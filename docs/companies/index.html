<p>Digital identity takes the spotlight in this week’s roundup of the top FindBiometrics stories. We also touch on data center security and take a brief look into the future of the biometrics industry.</p>



<p>Up first is a three-question microsurvey for our 19th annual FindBiometrics Year in Review report. The microsurvey asks readers about the biometric applications with the most momentum coming out of 2021, and then asks them to predict which applications will drive growth in the biometric market in the next five years. Be sure to share your thoughts, and be there to discuss the results during our <a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/20454161-8e78-4ae6-bc85-df7aa59a037b/summary?RefId=np">Year in Review online summit</a> on February 16!</p>



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/microsurvey-biometric-modality-2021-712209/">Microsurvey: What Application Will Drive Biometrics for the Next Five Years?</a> 



<p>Our next story highlights an Alcatraz AI eBook that focuses on security best practices for data centers. The eBook argues that many organizations have not invested in the physical security technology they need to protect digital infrastructure, and advocates for the use of facial recognition in modern access control setups.</p>



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/data-center-security-critical-often-overlooked-says-alcatraz-ai-501252/">Data Center Security is More Critical Than Ever, and Too Often Overlooked: Alcatraz AI</a> 



<p>On the digital ID front, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) has published a pair of reports that could lay the groundwork for a comprehensive digital identity scheme. One report addresses the use of facial recognition for online identity verification, while the other explains how self-sovereign identities can give people more control over their personal information and support interoperability between EU member states.</p>



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/enisa-lays-groundwork-european-digital-ids-with-two-new-reports-012404/">ENISA Lays Groundwork for European Digital IDs With Two New Reports</a> 



<p>In employment news, Chris Pick has signed on as Transmit Security’s new Chief Marketing Officer. Pick will be expected to come up with a new marketing strategy to drive the company’s expansion into international markets.</p>



 <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/transmit-security-brings-on-new-chief-marketing-officer-spearhead-international-expansion-012402/">Transmit Security Brings On New Chief Marketing Officer to Spearhead International Expansion</a> 



<p>Finally, the IRS is making an ID.me account mandatory for US taxpayers that want to access online taxation services. ID.me’s digital identities will be compatible with other state and federal agencies that use the service in addition to the IRS.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fingerprints.com/">Fingerprint Cards</a> (FPC) has posted its results for the fourth quarter of 2021 and for the full year, showing a challenging quarter but solid overall results.</p>



<p>Revenues for the quarter came in at SEK 356.6 million, compared to revenues of SEK 369.4 million for Q4 of 2020. But the full fiscal year for 2021 saw revenues of just under SEK 1.356 billion, compared to revenues of a little under SEK 1.256 billion in 2020.</p>



<p>FPC’s EBITDA numbers tell a similar story. The company reports EBITDA of SEK 26.7 million for the latest quarter, down from EBITDA of SEK 32.4 million in the corresponding period of 2020. Looking to full-year results, however, shows an EBITDA jump from SEK 59.4 million in 2020 to SEK 85.6 million last year.</p>



<p>There was also a huge improvement in FPC’s operating result, which went from a loss of SEK 365.8 million in 2020 to an operating loss of just SEK 7.6 million in 2021.</p>



<p>Commenting on the results, Fingerprints CEO Christian Fredrikson noted that the company was able to increase sales year-over-year “despite an insufficient access to production capacity throughout the year due to the prevailing semiconductor shortage in the world,” adding, “I believe that this demonstrates the strength and stability of our business, which also began to expand into new areas during the year at a significantly higher pace than previously.”</p>



<p>Fredrikson went on to note that FPC’s mobile operations remained strong, and that the capacitive fingerprint sensor “remains the most common biometric modality by far in the mobile industry.” Meanwhile 2021 saw the first volume orders for FPC’s biometric sensors designed specifically for PC applications, and Fredrikson believes that sales in this area could outgrow those of FPC’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/fpc-t-shape-sensor-2fa-access-control-via-biometric-smart-card-integration-712011/">access control solutions</a> in the next 12 to 18 months, thereby becoming the company’s second-largest business area after mobile biometrics.</p>



<p>Finally, the chief executive shed a little more light on <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/fpc-subsidiaries-after-strategic-review/">FPC’s dramatic restructuring</a> into two separate subsidiaries, the result of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/fpc-bod-launches-strategic-review-707072/">a strategic review</a> launched by the company’s board of directors last summer. Fredrikson said that the change, which entailed the creation of payments and access-focused Fingerprint Cards Switzerland and mobile and PC-focused Fingerprint Technology Company, took effect on January 1 of this year.</p>



<p>“This change enables an even sharper focus on our two individual business operations, which have industry conditions that differ in terms of structure, geography, customers, partners and regulations,” he said, adding that it also provides “better possibilities to explore distinct and separate financing options and avenues of development” for each of the subsidiaries.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.miteksystems.com/">Mitek</a> has continued to ride a wave of demand for remote onboarding solutions into the first quarter of its 2022 fiscal year, reporting a 25 percent year over year increase in revenues.</p>



<p>That growth brought revenues for the quarter, which ended December 31, 2021, to $32.5 million, a record for the company. Mitek’s GAAP net income increased 44 percent year over year to $3.1 million, while non-GAAP income went up 65 percent, to $10.2 million.</p>



<p>The figures suggest growing momentum for Mitek after the company reported a nine percent year-over-year increase in revenues in its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/mitek-brings-record-revenue-2021-110906/">previous fiscal quarter</a>, and revenue growth of 18 percent for the overall 2021 fiscal year. In announcing the latest results, Mitek credited growing demand for both its digital identity verification and mobile deposit solutions amid a broader trend of digital transformation.</p>



<p>“Biometrics are transforming the way we deliver authentication solutions,” explained Mitek CEO Max Carnecchia. “I am proud that the world’s leading brands trust Mitek to protect their companies and their customers from growing online fraud.”</p>



<p>Mitek’s solutions revolve around the use of facial recognition to match end users’ selfie images to pictures of their official identity documents, enabling reliable and convenient remote identity verification. It’s an approach that has become particularly popular among sectors such as financial services, where identity verification is critically important, as business has shifted into digital channels.</p>



<p>On that note, Mitek CFO Frank Teruel asserted that the company’s record Q1 revenues are “evidence of the positive impact our technology is making on financial services and marketplace businesses, mitigating business operation costs and fraud losses.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.idexbiometrics.com/">IDEX Biometrics</a> has raised its profile in Southeast Asia through a new partnership with <a href="https://mksmart.com.vn/">MKSmart</a>. MKSmart is one of the 10 largest card manufacturers in the world, and supplies organizations with access control cards and government IDs in addition to providing more conventional payment cards for financial institutions.</p>



  



<p>The partnership will allow MKSmart to start delivering biometric cards to card issuers before the end of the year. The company will initially focus on biometric payment cards, which will feature the turnkey <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idex-infineon-announce-biometric-payment-card-reference-design-707152/">card reference design that IDEX released with Infineon</a> back in July. That reference design combines IDEX’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idexs-trustedbio-sensor-enters-mass-production-032607/">TrustedBio fingerprint sensor module</a> with Infineon’s SLC38 security controller, and was built to help manufacturers bring new cards to market as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>VISA, Mastercard, China UnionPay, JCB, UPI, and the GSMA have all granted their approval to MKSmart’s smart card operations. IDEX’s components, meanwhile, have previously appeared in <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idex-biometrics-visa-mastercard-certifications-major-sensor-order-idemia-711041/">payment cards with Visa, Mastercard</a>, and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idex-biometrics-partner-certification-opens-door-china-market-711081/">China UnionPay certification</a>. The IDEX reference design also uses a proprietary integrated circuit to process the holder’s biometric data.</p>



<p>“The Southeast Asia region represents a very large opportunity for biometric payment cards,” said IDEX CEO Vince Graziani.&nbsp;“This adds to a growing list of customers and confirms that IDEX Biometrics is enabling the acceleration of global deployment for biometric smart cards. Our collaboration with MKSmart will deliver biometric smart card solutions that enable a secure and seamless user experience to millions of consumers in Southeast Asia and globally.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The scope of the new partnership will eventually expand to cover the development of IoT applications, and government and enterprise ID cards and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idex-doubles-down-access-control-partnership-with-dongwoon-anatech-122001/">access cards</a> in addition to biometric payment cards. The technology could also be used to power cryptocurrency wallets. IDEX and Infineon previously <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idex-and-infineon-ship-reference-design-for-major-card-manufacturer-707222/">shipped their reference design</a> to another card manufacturer back in July, shortly after the reference design was first announced.</p>

 “… FaceTec highlighted a number of particular business developments from the fourth quarter of 2021, including a contract for the DHS TVPS program in collaboration with Leidos, a renewal of a contract to provide Canada’s Parliament with remote identification software, and the launch of a major project for First Abu Dhabi Bank, in partnership with gDi.” 



  



<p><a href="https://www.facetec.com/">FaceTec</a> has provided an update for Q4 and its 2021 fiscal year, and has once again delivered impressive results.</p>



<p>Revenues for the fourth quarter were up 217 percent year over year; for the full fiscal year, revenue growth was up 246 percent. And the company’s 3D Liveness Check solution has seen particularly strong adoption, with FaceTec reporting usage growth of 268 percent year over year for 2021, and a 302 percent year over year jump in usage growth in the fourth quarter in particular.</p>



<p>All of this has happened against the backdrop of an ongoing pandemic that has accelerated the longstanding trend of digital transformation across a broad range of sectors. That trend has dovetailed with growing demand for identity security solutions, with FaceTec having established itself as a clear leader as a vendor of such solutions thanks to its highly sophisticated 3D facial recognition technology.</p>



<p>“Our outstanding performance in 2021 is a clear indicator that our unique 3D approach to remote digital identity is resonating globally,” commented FaceTec CEO Kevin Alan Tussy, adding later, “I can’t thank our partners and the incredible team at FaceTec enough for their dedication and hard work over the last twelve months.”</p>



<p>Beyond the overall growth trends, FaceTec highlighted a number of particular business developments from the fourth quarter of 2021, including a contract for the DHS TVPS program in collaboration with Leidos, a renewal of a contract to provide Canada’s Parliament with remote identification software, and the launch of a major project for <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facetec-gdi-provide-biometric-onboarding-solution-for-uaes-biggest-bank-501111/">First Abu Dhabi Bank</a>, in partnership with gDi.</p>



<p>FaceTec also upgraded its portfolio of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facetec-mobile-id-onboarding-with-sdk-upgrade-709231/">Software Development Kits</a> during the fourth quarter, adding barcode reading and chip scanning functionality that can dramatically reduce the cost of onboarding new users.</p>



<p>Looking to the year ahead, Tussy expressed confidence that FaceTec will continue to build momentum. “I believe our partner network will be the force multiplier that drives our 2022 growth beyond what we saw in 2021,” he said.</p>

<p>Moving past the login box using Verifiable Credentials</p><p>Visit any traditional website today and you’ll likely be confronted with a barrage of obstacles. The first thing will be those annoying cookie pop ups pushing you to consent to the countless number of 3rd parties that will track your visit. This information is peddled on exchanges around the world. Get past that, and you will eventually be pushed to share your email address or phone number, and create yet another password. All making you a likely target for phishing attacks and putting your personal data at risk of being included in the <a href="https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/96667-the-top-data-breaches-of-2021">1,291 data breaches </a>affecting <a href="https://fortune.com/2021/10/06/data-breach-2021-2020-total-hacks/">nearly 281.5 million people</a> in 2021. This approach is not going to last.</p><p>Web 3 has brought a new way to engage with websites, and dare I say, it is almost magical. No cookies, no username, no password, no sharing personal information. I can browse freely and pseudo-anonymously without having to worry about the cookies and terms I was forced to accept. When I want to transact, I connect to a website with a “wallet”. The wallet (e.g, <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a>) is a browser extension or mobile app that holds a unique pseudonymous identifier, such as my Ethererum address. When I click “Connect”, my wallet proves to the website that I control the private keys associated with that address. All my data stays with me, on my device. This puts me, the user in control. </p><p>The wallet replaces the username, the password, the cookie and requires no personal data to be shared. This is great for website owners as well because they no longer need to store sensitive data about their users. No surprise then that MetaMask, for example, claims to be “trusted by <a href="https://decrypt.co/86263/ethereum-wallet-metamask-reports-21-million-users">21 million users</a> worldwide”. The Web3 community is also exploring using other identifiers like NFTs and Ethereum Name Service (<a href="https://ens.domains/">ENS</a>) that can be associated with a wallet.</p><p>The Role of DIDs and Verifiable Credentials</p><p><br>But if we do not share any personal data, how do we complete web transactions that require age verification or affordability criteria(e.g. loans). How could users prove that they meet those eligibility or qualification criteria without breaking the Web3 model or privacy and convenience?</p><p>This is where the W3C standards on <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralised Identifiers </a>(DIDs)and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials </a>(VCs) come into play. DIDs and VCs are a new type of unique identifier with linked verifiable information that can be controlled solely by the user. DID-based representations for Ethereum Accounts and ENS names have been <a href="https://medium.com/uport/ens-names-are-decentralized-identifiers-dids-724f0c317e4b">already defined</a>, and with zero transaction costs, users can easily create their own DIDs. They will then be able to prove control over their DID, enable trusted third parties to “issue” cryptographically signed verifiable credentials (e.g. I am over 21) linked to the user’s DID, and allow websites to “verify” a user meets any eligibility (e.g. age verification) and/or qualification criteria (e.g. affordability checks) whilst preserving the user’s privacy.</p><p>Furthermore, these verifications can be done using selective disclosure (e.g. to prove your age, you need only disclose your date of birth versus showing your entire drivers’ license), predicates( e.g. instead of sharing your full date of birth, you can simply prove you are over 21), and zero knowledge proofs (e.g prove that I am a European citizen without sharing my passport details), using “<a href="https://blog.dock.io/anonymous-credentials/">anonymous credentials</a>”. This makes it possible for users to not have to compromise on neither the user experience nor on their anonymity within the Web3 ecosystem.</p><p>Get Started with Dock</p><p>To find out more about how to implement DIDs, Verifiable Credentials and Anonymous Credentials in practice, have a look at <a href="https://console.api.dock.io/">Dock’s platform</a> or reach out to <a href="https://www.dock.io/contact">Dock directly</a>.</p><p>About Dock:</p><p>Dock is a platform designed to provide a simple solution for businesses and developers to build, manage and present digital credentials that are instantly verifiable using blockchain technology.

<p><a href="https://vsblty.net/">VSBLTY</a> is looking to extend its reach in Europe through a new partnership with <a href="http://www.farleigh.net/">Farleigh Consultants</a>. Farleigh is a subsidiary of the Profile Security Group, and will be marketing VSBLTY’s computer vision and analytic solutions to potential customers in the United Kingdom and the European Union.</p>



  



<p>In that regard, Farleigh expressed a particular interest in the security applications of VSBLTY’s technology. Most notably, the VSBLTY Vector computer vision software offers real-time facial recognition and weapons recognition capabilities, in addition to license plate identification. The platform can also notify authorities when an unauthorized individual enters a restricted zone, essentially creating a “virtual perimeter” for secure facilities.</p>



<p>Farleigh stressed that its VSBLTY integrations will be fully compliant with Europe’s GDPR privacy regulations. The company (and its Profile Security parent) cited VSBLTY’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/vsblty-radarapp-expand-surveillance-network-mexico-city-121604/">successful surveillance deployments in Mexico City</a> as a motivating factor in the partnership.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.socure.com/">Socure</a> is the proud recipient of a <a href="https://www.idc.com/promo/future-of-x/trust/awards">Best in Future of Trust Award</a>. The Awards are handed out by the International Data Corporation (IDC), which specifically recognized Socure for its deployment with the investing platform <a href="https://public.com/">Public.com</a>.</p>



  



<p>In that regard, Socure, IDC, and Public.com all emphasized the impressive results that the partnership has produced. Public.com is currently using Socure’s identity verification technology for fraud prevention and new customer onboarding, and indicated that its manual review costs have plummeted 30 percent since it implemented the solution. Socure’s platform is able to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/new-socure-tools-help-verify-identities-younger-users-081002/">achieve auto-approval rates</a> of 98 percent, which dramatically lowers the number of cases that need to be referred to an agent and frees up employees to deal with more important tasks.</p>



<p>According to Public.com, the company’s enterprise value has gone up 15 percent as a direct result of those efficiency gains. The company also suggested that Socure’s high auto-approval rates have <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/socure-report-shows-how-unbiased-tech-can-help-raise-financial-inclusion-102807/">helped raise inclusion</a> on the platform, and made its investing services more accessible to a wider range of people.</p>



<p>The Socure solution is compliant with the latest regulatory standards, and enables a smoother onboarding process for end users. IDC listed privacy, compliance, risk management, cybersecurity, ethics, sustainability, and transparency as some of the key criteria it evaluates when selecting the winners of the Best in Future of Trust Awards.</p>



<p>“The average loss from consumers who are victims of identity fraud runs in tens of billions of dollars, making robust identity verification an important consideration for all organizations,” said IDC Future of Trust Research Director Amita Potnis. “Public.com has displayed effective and efficient user verification and made financial investments more accessible through technology for its customers.”</p>



<p>Socure’s ID+ Platform was the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/socure-comes-out-ahead-latest-aite-novarica-report-121402/">top-rated solution</a> in Aite-Novarica’s most recent Global Document Identification and Verification Impact Report. The company itself is now <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/latest-funding-round-makes-socure-most-highly-valued-identity-company-110907/">valued at $4.5 billion</a> after bringing in $450 million in funding in November.&nbsp;</p>

			  Mihalis Plelis is a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			<p></p>
 Who are you? 
<p>I am Mihalis, Senior Software Developer at Tokeny. I graduated from the Technological Educational Institute of Crete as a software engineer. I live in Crete and I like to work remotely.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>After working for two big companies and a startup in the past, I wanted a change. After I started looking for a new challenge in my career, my ex-colleague <a href="https://tokeny.com/tokenys-talent-story-of-jose/">José</a> who works for Tokeny referred me to the team, and this is how our journey started.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Working at Tokeny is something different. Right from the start, I was given the best welcome to date, better than any company that I have worked for in the past. We have a lot of freedom in our work, and we are free to do things the way we prefer. The team is really friendly, helpful and committed, which allows us to do things efficiently. The level of programming in our team is very high, allowing me to become a better developer and learn new things every day.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I like exploring new things, that’s why I like traveling. I’ve been to many European countries so far and I hope to continue traveling and exploring the world, experiencing new cultures and lifestyles. Also, I like to taste new kinds of food as this combines well with traveling around the world.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>Being happy, like everyone else’s, I suppose. I try to have a balanced life, free of stress, close to nature and away from the noise of the big cities. I also hope I can contribute to making this world a better place via my work.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>I would want everyone to have equal opportunities in personal and professional life. In addition, I would try to reduce pollution so that the next generation will have a quality place to live.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; Basics first&nbsp;</p>



<p>The basics sound simple, and yet are so significant. Make sure your devices are secure: your computers, smartphones, and tablets. By that we mean, check if you have a comprehensive data security policy. That includes antivirus software, firewalls, and data recovery. To protect data in transit, all connections to your system should be on a secure platform. Emails should be encrypted, and remote desktops should be accessed via a VPN (virtual private network). At the end of the day, preventing security breaches is far less costly than curing it if it happens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. Enforce password management&nbsp;</p>



<p>Did you know that weak or stolen passwords account for as much as 80% of attacks? Ensuring that you have strong passwords in force can help lower the chance of those attacks. Today there are password manager applications in use that allow you to generate strong passwords and store them securely, like LastPast. The best password is one that you can remember, but one that will be hard for other people, even malicious programs, to guess. An abbreviated sentence or passphrase is often better than a single word with numbers and symbols inserted. If possible, you can also add 2-factor authentication on most software platforms. Needless to say, everything you would do to protect your computer should be done on your mobile devices also. Update your software whenever possible, use strong passcodes, turn off Bluetooth when not in use, and verify legitimacy before you download anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. Educate yourself&nbsp;</p>



<p>Education is everything, and when considering that human errors and negligence are the major causes of data breaches, it becomes even more important. Keep up to date with the latest security best practices and do your research on how to prevent cybersecurity threats such as malware or phishing scams – it might pay off in the end! In general, it is good to follow the Better safe than sorry guideline. As multiple studies have shown time and again, many data breaches could have been prevented if we had taken better care earlier on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>4. Finding a good connection&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever we go online in a public place, e.g. by using a public WIFI connection, we have no direct control over its security. Before providing information, such as your bank account number, be sure that you are using a secure WIFI network – or wait for a better time. Using a secure VPN connection further enables you to have a safe connection between device and Internet server: one that no one can monitor or access the data you are exchanging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>5. Be sceptical&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you receive a link that looks strange from a trusted friend or family member, better contact them to ask if the link you’ve received was sent on purpose. Viruses and other forms of malware often spread because of phishing or social engineering, meaning you click on a link from someone you know. This is when you are tricked into revealing personal or sensitive information for fraudulent purposes. Spam emails, ‘free’ offers, or online quizzes all use these tactics to entice you to click on dangerous links or give up your personal information. Always be wary of offers that sound too good to be true or ask for too much information. Again: better safe than sorry!&nbsp;</p>

“None are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe they are free.”- Johann Wolfgang von&nbsp;Goethe<p>Payment processing is an extremely complex system that involves several intermediaries; it isn’t as easy as sending monetary value from the consumer to the merchant. Let’s make an easy to understand example of such a notion. An office worker pays by credit card after eating at a franchise restaurant. It is evident that the transaction occurred between two people, the office worker and the restaurant owner, however many intermediaries are involved with one payment. These intermediaries can cause inefficiencies and additional costs for the business owner. This complexity is one of the focal components on why many businesses charge an additional processing fee when paying with a credit card as opposed to a cash transaction. Countless intermediaries and contracts form the basis of even the smallest of payments; at your local 711 or deli, an innocuous three dollar transaction can turn into a convoluted process where multiple systems must become involved. This creates a problem for the small business&nbsp;owner.</p><p>Since the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic specifically, small businesses in particular have seen the degradation of their businesses. This is due to a number of reasons which include shutdowns, a slowdown in economic expenditures and now, a looming supply crisis and payment processing only adds to these multiple nuisances. Many contract structures that provide convenience and risk management to the business owner in return conceive of a high commission burden to that specific small business owner. This is a fundamental flaw in the payment processing paradigm. Naturally, it is evident that the burden of this fee must be borne by the individual franchisees and the consumer. An easy and innovative payment service must be the answer, and one is on the horizon,&nbsp;GemPay.</p><p>Ask yourself this question, and answer it honestly, has fintech and big tech platforms enhanced the monetary performance of your business, or retracted upon it and left it in economic stagnation? It is an honest question that every small business owner should be asking. At the end of 2021, the fee for small merchants with annual sales of 300 million won ($250,000 USD) or less was only&nbsp;.08% for credit cards. However the percentage for Naver Pay is 2.2% (order management) and 2.0% for Kakao Pay (online), higher than the majority of card processing companies. It has been analyzed that the approximate fee is 2–3 times higher. It has become difficult to simply compare fee rates because of the broad range of services that credit card companies and simple payment operators provide. Of course, it is true that it is difficult for everyone to know transparently about the standards and specific details of processing fees. But we must ask ourselves about the fundamental maxim of big tech service companies, whose sole purpose is for-profit business. Are big tech service companies competing to provide quality services for their customers rather than financial companies that are subject to stricter audit and regulatory restrictions? Even so, it will be just a temporary marketing to dominate the market and that creates a major&nbsp;dilemma.</p><p>The fact that the development of technology has made it possible for consumers to easily consume is certainly a benefit of fintech technology; resulting from this, more people and business entities experience convenience and versatility. ‘Easier’, ‘faster’ and ‘kinder’ have become essential features of all services as technological innovation has increased astronomically over the last two decades. However, for sellers, this means higher fees and more platform dependencies which perpetuates the ability for payment processing platforms to price gouge processing fees because of the “leverage of reliancy.” We are not just satisfied with the simplicity of the service, but can actually increase the benefits that we can receive from the huge platform created with data and aggregation. This is where GemPay comes into play, developed by Blocko&nbsp;XYZ.</p><p>Blocko XYZ is an incredibly forward thinking company that creates blockchain solutions for enterprises of all sizes. GemPay is a convenient solution to the major processing fee dilemma that small business owners face. Bitcoin and blockchain technology are great solutions to these problems, but they have unfortunate dilemmas as well which include scalability, high transaction fees, exploits, slow transaction times and bottlenecks. After consistent deliberation and study of the mechanics of blockchain technology, Blocko was able to collect the following three notions to successfully integrate and amalgamate into GemPay. Beginning with the first pillar, the philosophy entailed is this “accept the notion of eliminating payment intermediaries and borrow the concept of point discounts to increase discounts instead of fees!” The second pillar highlighted is “let’s become the subject of the service by transparently sharing the transaction process, such as payment details and discount rates, and allowing users to exercise their own choice in operation!” And lastly, the third pillar is thus “keep the value 1:1 with the legal currency, so let’s focus on the points that can be easily paid rather than the investment purpose!”</p><p>The first pillar highlights the ethos of decentralized blockchain technology, comparing it to its non-traditional notions in accordance with the existing financial system. The core principle of blockchain is decentralization. Through blockchains the fee dilemma can be resolved by excluding electronic payment agencies (in essence, removing the oligopolist middle-men such as Payment Gate PG) and value added networks that are interconnected in the payment process. In English, buyers and sellers are directly connected through a peer-to-peer paradigm without the necessity of third parties, which results in virtually zero commission costs. Because GemPay is a blockchain based payment system, a “double discount” is possible.</p><p>The second ethos of GemPay revolves around the notion of preventing a second merge point which allows for the service to operate transparently with blockchain technology. Anonymity and paradoxically, transparency are the quintessential components of blockchain technology, and these can be utilized in an open payment system. At the time of payment, the user can clearly and easily check through the app how much discount the business received, unlike other payment methods, and that this amount of discount is possible only with the GemPay application. Instead of “you were charged x amount of won, please pay’, we become smart users by becoming the subject of payment data from consumers who used to make payments passively. This is one of the focal components of why GemPay is a practical solution in payment processing.</p><p>The third ethos of GemPay revolves around the controversy surrounding the coin price volatility. A justifiable question that small business owners ask themselves when utilizing blockchain and cryptocurrencies is “why would I accept such a volatile currency, I could make the transaction now and the value of the transaction can drop 20% in one minute”, which is a completely understandable sentiment. Afterall, a business must protect its profit and revenue streams. Blocko has conceived of an idea that will end this notion. Blocko will create AergoGem tokens on itself-developed AERGO mainnet to ensure 1:1 value exchange with fiat currency, and will initially focus on exchange with the KRW pair. Users can use the Gem charged through the GemPay app as in original currency and Gem can then be recharged with AERGO tokens, and you can also link third-party points with GemPay to exchange each point of the Gem. To conclude with a simple summary, GemPay allows for a high discount rate through its “double discount”, it enables transparency and independence through blockchain technology, and easy payments with gems that maintain 1:1 value with legal currency.</p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency involves substantial risk, do not invest more than you can afford to lose!

  <p>WebAssembly (Wasm) is one of the most exciting and underestimated software technologies invented in recent times. It’s a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine that aims to execute at native speeds with a memory-safe and secure sandbox. Wasm is portable, cross-platform, and language-agnostic—designed as a compilation target for languages. Though originally part of the open web platform, it has found use cases beyond the web. WebAssembly is now used in browsers, Node.js, Deno, Kubernetes, and IoT platforms.</p>

<p>You can learn more about WebAssembly at <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly.org</a>.</p>

 WebAssembly on Kubernetes 

<p>Though initially designed for <a href="https://www.w3.org/wasm/">the web</a>, WebAssembly proved to be an ideal format for writing platform and language-agnostic applications. You may be aware of something similar in the container world—Docker containers. People, including Docker co-founder Solomon Hykes, recognized the similarity and acknowledged that WebAssembly is even more efficient since it’s fast, portable, and secure, running at native speeds. This means that you can use WebAssembly alongside containers as workloads on Kubernetes. Another WebAssembly initiative known as <a href="https://wasi.dev/">WebAssembly System Interface (WASI)</a> along with the <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime">Wasmtime</a> project make this possible.</p>

 <blockquote><p>If WASM+WASI existed in 2008, we wouldn't have needed to created Docker. That's how important it is. Webassembly on the server is the future of computing. A standardized system interface was the missing link. Let's hope WASI is up to the task! <a href="https://t.co/wnXQg4kwa4">https://t.co/wnXQg4kwa4</a></p>— Solomon Hykes (@solomonstre) <a href="https://twitter.com/solomonstre/status/1111004913222324225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 27, 2019</a></blockquote>

 

<p>WebAssembly on Kubernetes is relatively new and has some rough edges at the moment, but it’s already proving to be revolutionary. Wasm workloads can be extremely fast as they can execute faster than a container takes to start. The workloads are sandboxed and hence much more secure than containers; they are way smaller in size due to the binary format than containers.</p>

<p>If you want to learn more about WASI, check out <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/standardizing-wasi-a-webassembly-system-interface/">the original announcement from Mozilla</a>.</p>

 Why Rust? 

<p>I previously wrote a blog post about <a href="https://deepu.tech/my-second-impression-of-rust/">why Rust is a great language for the future</a>, Tl;Dr; Rust is secure and fast without the compromises of most modern languages, and Rust has the <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/">best ecosystem and tooling</a> for WebAssembly. So Rust + Wasm makes it super secure and fast.</p>

 Enter Krustlet 

<p><a href="https://krustlet.dev/">Krustlet</a> is a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/">Kubelet</a> written in Rust for WebAssembly workloads (written in any language). It listens for new pods assignments based on <code>tolerations</code> specified on the manifest and runs them. Since the default Kubernetes nodes cannot run Wasm workloads natively, you need a Kubelet that can, and this is where Krustlet comes in.</p>

 Run WebAssembly workloads on Kubernetes with Krustlet 

<p>Today, you will use Krustlet to run a Wasm workload written in Rust on Kubernetes.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

 
   <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/">Docker</a> 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/">kubectl</a> 
   <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation">kind</a> or another local kubernetes distribution 
   <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started">Rust toolkit</a> (Includes rustup, rustc, and cargo) 
 

 Preparing the cluster 

<p>First, you need to prepare a cluster and install Krustlet on the cluster to run WebAssembly on it. I’m using <a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/">kind</a> to run a local Kubernetes cluster; you can also use <a href="https://docs.krustlet.dev/howto/krustlet-on-minikube/">MiniKube</a>, <a href="https://docs.krustlet.dev/howto/krustlet-on-microk8s/">MicroK8s</a>, or <a href="https://docs.krustlet.dev/intro/quickstart/">another Kubernetes distribution</a>.</p>

<p>The first step is to create a cluster with the below command:</p>

   <code>kind create cluster
</code>   

<p>Now you need to bootstrap Krustlet. For this, you will need <code>kubectl</code> installed and a kubeconfig that has access to create <code>Secrets</code> in the <code>kube-system</code> namespace and can approve <code>CertificateSigningRequests</code>. You can use these <a href="https://github.com/krustlet/krustlet/tree/main/scripts">handy scripts</a> from Krustlet to download and run the appropriate setup script for your OS:</p>

   <code># Setup for Linux/macOS
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krustlet/krustlet/main/scripts/bootstrap.sh | /bin/bash
</code>   

<p>Now you can install and run Krustlet.</p>

<p>Download a binary release from the <a href="https://github.com/krustlet/krustlet/releases">release page</a> and run it. Download the appropriate version for your OS.</p>

   <code># Download for Linux
curl -O https://krustlet.blob.core.windows.net/releases/krustlet-v1.0.0-alpha.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xzf krustlet-v1.0.0-alpha.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz
# Install for Linux
KUBECONFIG=~/.krustlet/config/kubeconfig \
  ./krustlet-wasi \
  --node-ip=172.17.0.1 \
  --node-name=krustlet \
  --bootstrap-file=${HOME}/.krustlet/config/bootstrap.conf
</code>   

<p>Note: If you use Docker for Mac, the node-ip will be different. Follow <a href="https://docs.krustlet.dev/howto/krustlet-on-kind/#special-note-docker-desktop-for-mac">the instructions from the Krustlet docs</a> to figure out the IP. If you get the error <code>krustlet-wasi cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified</code>, you can allow it with the allow anyway button found at System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; General on macOS.</p>

<p>You should see a prompt to manually approve TLS certs since the serving certs Krustlet uses must be manually approved. Open a new terminal and run the below command. The hostname will be shown in the prompt from the Krustlet server.</p>

   <code>kubectl certificate approve &lt;hostname&gt;-tls
</code>   

<p>This will be required only for the first time when you start the Krustlet. Keep the Krustlet server running. You might see some errors being logged, but let’s ignore it for now as Krustlet is still in beta, and there are some rough edges.</p>

<p>Let’s see if the node is available. Run <code>kubectl get nodes</code>, and you should see something like this:</p>

   <code>kubectl get nodes -o wide
# Output
NAME                 STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION         INTERNAL-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE       KERNEL-VERSION            CONTAINER-RUNTIME
kind-control-plane   Ready    control-plane,master   16m   v1.21.1         172.21.0.2    &lt;none&gt;        Ubuntu 21.04   5.15.12-200.fc35.x86_64   containerd://1.5.2
krustlet             Ready    &lt;none&gt;                 12m   1.0.0-alpha.1   172.17.0.1    &lt;none&gt;        &lt;unknown&gt;      &lt;unknown&gt;                 mvp
</code>   

<p>Now let’s test if the Krustlet is working as expected by applying the Wasm workload below. As you can see, we have <code>tolerations</code> defined so that this will not be scheduled on normal nodes.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: hello-wasm
spec:
  containers:
  - name: hello-wasm
    image: webassembly.azurecr.io/hello-wasm:v1
  tolerations:
  - effect: NoExecute
    key: kubernetes.io/arch
    operator: Equal
    value: wasm32-wasi   # or wasm32-wasmcloud according to module target arch
  - effect: NoSchedule
    key: kubernetes.io/arch
    operator: Equal
    value: wasm32-wasi
EOF
</code>   

<p>Once applied, run <code>kubectl get pods</code> as shown below, and you should see the pod running on the Krustlet node.</p>

   <code>kubectl get pods --field-selector spec.nodeName=krustlet
# Output
NAME                    READY   STATUS       RESTARTS   AGE
hello-wasm              0/1     ExitCode:0   0          71m
</code>   

<p>Don’t worry about the status. It’s <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/72020">normal</a> for a workload that terminates normally to have <code>ExitCode:0</code>. Let’s check the logs for the pod by running <code>kubectl logs</code>.</p>

   <code>kubectl logs hello-wasm
# Output
Hello, World!
</code>   

<p>You have successfully set up a Kubelet that can run Wasm workloads on your cluster.</p>

 Setting up Rust for WebAssembly 

<p>Now let us prepare an environment for WebAssembly with Rust. Make sure you are using a stable Rust version and not a nightly release.</p>

<p>First, you need to add <code>wasm32-wasi</code> target for Rust so that you can compile Rust apps to WebAssembly. Run the below command:</p>

   <code>rustup target add wasm32-wasi
</code>   

<p>Now you can create a new Rust application with Cargo.</p>

   <code>cargo new --bin rust-wasm
</code>   

<p>Open the created <code>rust-wasm</code> folder in your favorite IDE. I use Visual Studio Code with the fantastic <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=matklad.rust-analyzer">rust-analyzer</a> and <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb">CodeLLDB</a> plugins to develop in Rust.</p>

 Create the WebAssembly workload 

<p>Let’s write a small service that will print random cat facts on the console. For this, you could use a free public <a href="https://catfact.ninja/fact">API that provides random cat facts</a>.</p>

<p>Edit <code>cargo.toml</code> and add the following dependencies:</p>

   <code>[dependencies]
wasi-experimental-http = "0.7"
http = "0.2.5"
serde_json = "1.0.74"
env_logger = "0.9"
log = "0.4"
</code>   

<p>Then edit <code>src/main.rs</code> and add the following code:</p>

   <code>use http;
use serde_json::Value;
use std::{str, thread, time};

fn main() {
    env_logger::init();
    let url = "https://catfact.ninja/fact".to_string();
    loop {
        let req = http::request::Builder::new()
            .method(http::Method::GET)
            .uri(&amp;url)
            .header("Content-Type", "text/plain");
        let req = req.body(None).unwrap();

        log::debug!("Request: {:?}", req);

        // send request using the experimental bindings for http on wasi
        let mut res = wasi_experimental_http::request(req).expect("cannot make request");

        let response_body = res.body_read_all().unwrap();
        let response_text = str::from_utf8(&amp;response_body).unwrap().to_string();
        let headers = res.headers_get_all().unwrap();

        log::debug!("{}", res.status_code);
        log::debug!("Response: {:?} {:?}", headers, response_text);

        // parse the response to json
        let cat_fact: Value = serde_json::from_str(&amp;response_text).unwrap();

        log::info!("Cat Fact: {}", cat_fact["fact"].as_str().unwrap());

        thread::sleep(time::Duration::new(60, 0));
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The code is simple. It makes a GET request to the API and parses and prints the response every 60 seconds. Now you can build this into a Wasm binary using this Cargo command:</p>

   <code>cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasi
</code>   

<p>That’s it. You have successfully created a WebAssembly binary using Rust.</p>

 Run the workload locally (optional) 

<p>Let’s run the workload locally using <a href="https://wasmtime.dev">Wasmtime</a>, a small JIT-style runtime for Wasm and WASI. Since Wasmtime doesn’t support networking out of the box, we need to use the <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/wasi-experimental-http#testing-using-the-wasmtime-http-binary">wrapper</a> provided by <a href="https://github.com/deislabs/wasi-experimental-http">wasi-experimental-http</a>. You can build it from source using the below command.</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/deislabs/wasi-experimental-http.git
# Build for your platform
cargo build
# move to any location that is added to your PATH variable
mv ./target/debug/wasmtime-http ~/bin/wasmtime-http
</code>   

<p>Now run the below command from the <code>rust-wasm</code> project folder:</p>

   <code>wasmtime-http target/wasm32-wasi/release/rust-wasm.wasm -a https://catfact.ninja/fact -e RUST_LOG=info
</code>   

 Run the workload in Kubernetes 

<p>Before you can run the workload in Kubernetes, you need to push the binary to a registry that supports OCI artifacts. OCI-compliant registries can be used for any OCI artifact, including Docker images, Wasm binaries, and so on. Docker Hub currently does not support OCI artifacts; hence you can use another registry like <a href="https://github.com/features/packages">GitHub Package Registry</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/container-registry/">Azure Container Registry</a> or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry">Google Artifact Registry</a>. I’ll be using GitHub Package Registry as it’s the simplest to get started, and most of you might already have a GitHub account.</p>

<p>First, you need to log in to GitHub Package Registry using <code>docker login</code>. Create a <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens">personal access token on GitHub</a> with the <code>write:packages</code> scope and use that to log in to the registry.</p>

   <code>export CR_PAT=&lt;your-token&gt;
echo $CR_PAT | docker login ghcr.io -u &lt;Your GitHub username&gt; --password-stdin
</code>   

<p>Now you need to push your Wasm binary as an OCI artifact; for this, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/engineerd/wasm-to-oci/releases">wasm-to-oci</a> CLI. Use the below command to install it on your machine. Download the appropriate version for your OS.</p>

   <code># Install for Linux
curl -LO https://github.com/engineerd/wasm-to-oci/releases/download/v0.1.2/linux-amd64-wasm-to-oci
# move to any location that is added to your PATH variable
mv linux-amd64-wasm-to-oci ~/bin/wasm-to-oci
</code>   

<p>Now you can push the binary you built earlier to the GitHub Package Registry. Run the below command from the <code>rust-wasm</code> folder.</p>

   <code>wasm-to-oci push target/wasm32-wasi/release/rust-wasm.wasm ghcr.io/&lt;your GitHub user&gt;/rust-wasm:latest
</code>   

<p>You should see a successful message. Now check the GitHub Packages page on your profile, and you should see the artifact listed.</p>

<p></p>

<p>By default, the artifact would be private, but you need to make it public so that you can access it from the Krustlet cluster. Click the package name and click the Package settings button, scroll down, click Change visibility, and change to public.</p>

<p>You can check this by pulling the artifact using the below command:</p>

   <code>wasm-to-oci pull ghcr.io/&lt;your GitHub user&gt;/rust-wasm:latest
</code>   

<p>Yay! You have successfully pushed your first Wasm artifact to an OCI registry. Now let’s deploy this to the Kubernetes cluster you created earlier.</p>

<p>Create a YAML file, let’s say <code>k8s.yaml</code>, with the following contents:</p>

   <code>apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: rust-wasi-example
  labels:
    app: rust-wasi-example
  annotations:
    alpha.wasi.krustlet.dev/allowed-domains: '["https://catfact.ninja/fact"]'
    alpha.wasi.krustlet.dev/max-concurrent-requests: "42"
spec:
  automountServiceAccountToken: false
  containers:
    - image: ghcr.io/&lt;your GitHub user&gt;/rust-wasm:latest
      imagePullPolicy: Always
      name: rust-wasi-example
      env:
        - name: RUST_LOG
          value: info
        - name: RUST_BACKTRACE
          value: "1"
  tolerations:
    - key: "node.kubernetes.io/network-unavailable"
      operator: "Exists"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
    - key: "kubernetes.io/arch"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "wasm32-wasi"
      effect: "NoExecute"
    - key: "kubernetes.io/arch"
      operator: "Equal"
      value: "wasm32-wasi"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
</code>   

<p>Note: Remember to replace <code>&lt;your GitHub user&gt;</code> with your own GitHub username.</p>

<p>The <code>annotations</code> and <code>tolerations</code> are significant. The annotations are used to allow external network calls from the krustlet, and the tolerations limit the pod to only schedule/run on Wasm nodes. We are also passing some environment variables that the application will use.</p>

<p>Now apply the manifest using the below command and check the pod status.</p>

   <code>kubectl apply -f k8s.yaml

kubectl get pods -o wide
# Output
NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP       NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
rust-wasi-example   1/1     Running   0          6m50s   &lt;none&gt;   krustlet   &lt;none&gt;           &lt;none&gt;
</code>   

<p>You should see the Wasm workload running successfully on the Krustlet node. Let’s check the logs.</p>

   <code>kubectl logs rust-wasi-example
# Output
[2022-01-16T11:42:20Z INFO  rust_wasm] Cat Fact: Polydactyl cats (a cat with 1-2 extra toes on their paws) have this as a result of a genetic mutation. These cats are also referred to as 'Hemingway cats' because writer Ernest Hemingway reportedly owned dozens of them at his home in Key West, Florida.
[2022-01-16T11:43:21Z INFO  rust_wasm] Cat Fact: The way you treat a kitten in the early stages of its life will render its personality traits later in life.
</code>   

<p>Awesome. You have successfully created a Wasm workload using Rust and deployed it to a Kubernetes cluster without using containers.
If you’d like to take a look at this solution in full, check out the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-rust-webassembly-k8s-example">GitHub repo</a>.</p>

 So, are we ready to replace containers with WebAssembly? 

<p>WebAssembly on Kubernetes is not yet production-ready as a lot of the supporting ecosystem is still experimental, and WASI itself is still maturing. <a href="https://radu-matei.com/blog/towards-sockets-networking-wasi/">Networking is not yet stable</a> and the library ecosystem is only just coming along. Krustlet is also still in beta, and there is no straightforward way to run networking workloads, especially servers on it. <a href="https://wasmedge.org/">WasmEdge</a> is a more mature alternative solution for networking workloads, but it’s much more involved to set up and run than Krustlet on Kubernetes. <a href="https://wasmcloud.dev/">WasmCloud</a> is another project to keep an eye on. So, for the time being, Krustlet is suitable for running workloads for jobs and use cases involving cluster monitoring and so on. These are areas where you could use the extra performance anyway.</p>

<p>So, while Wasm on Kubernetes is exciting, and containerless on Kubernetes is definitely on the horizon. containerized applications are still the way to go for production use. This is especially true for networking workloads like microservices and web applications. But, given how fast the ecosystem is evolving, especially in the Rust + Wasm + WASI space, soon I expect we will be able to use Wasm workloads on Kubernetes for production.</p>

 🌎⚠️🔒 VaultAlert.net — Always know your crypto assets are&nbsp;safe  <a href="http://www.vaultalert.net">VaultAlert.net</a> is a brand new service for the Verus ecosystem. Every user who set up the secure VerusID Vault can now check its status from anywhere in the&nbsp;world.  VerusID Vault: A secure place for your crypto&nbsp;assets <p>Vault is part of the <a href="https://docs.verus.io/verusid/">VerusID self-sovereign identity protocol</a>, built within the Verus multichain blockchain protocol. One of many VerusID features is that it functions as a human-readable cryptocurrency address. You can store $VRSC on your VerusID and lock them with Vault. In the future tokens and other bridged crypto-assets can also be stored and locked on a&nbsp;VerusID.</p><p>A locked VerusID can not spend, which means assets can not leave your VerusID. Even if someone has the private keys. It’s a revolutionary novel technology that will help many people from getting their crypto assets stolen. It can also be used for inheritance, trusts or vesting&nbsp;periods.</p><p>$VRSC that is locked with Vault can still stake. You can create a setup for yourself in which you won’t have to worry about your $VRSC being&nbsp;stolen.</p><p>In combination with other VerusIDs functioning as revocation and recovery authorities you can be a self-sovereign superpower. Having peace of mind and full control over your crypto assets is an incredibly powerful thing to&nbsp;have.</p> Revocation and Recovery Authorities <p>What if the private key of your VerusID is exposed? Maybe through your own fault, or a hacker that tries to steal your crypto assets. You don’t want anyone to be able to run away with your hard-earned assets. You’d want to be able to revoke access to that VerusID, so no one can do anything with the assets that are on it. And after that, you’d want to completely recover those assets into your own control. <a href="https://www.vaultalert.net/intro#RevocationAuthority">Read more here on how the revocation and recovery authorities function.</a></p> TimeLock &amp; DelayLock <p>Vault has two different options to lock your assets, TimeLock and DelayLock. You can only choose one option to lock the Vault. And the only way to circumvent a locked Vault is through revoking and recovering the&nbsp;VerusID.</p>  With TimeLock you determine how long you want the Vault to be locked. After the determined period is over the assets can be spent again. The maximum amount of time the Vault can be locked is 21&nbsp;years.  With DelayLock you determine a cooldown period. You lock the Vault and have to request an unlock. After requesting the unlock you have to wait for the determined cooldown period before the assets can be spent&nbsp;again.   VaultAlert.net <p>So how does it work? You can search for any VerusID on <a href="http://www.vaultalert.net">VaultAlert.net</a> and it shows you all you need to know about the Vault status and&nbsp;more.</p>  LOCKED: the Vault is locked and funds can not be&nbsp;spent  UNLOCK SOON: the Vault is locked but gets unlocked within a time period of 30&nbsp;days.  NO LOCK: Vault is not active and thus funds can be&nbsp;spent.  DelayLock or&nbsp;TimeLock  Primary address: The primary address is the owner of the VerusID, as it contains the private key. It can contain more than one&nbsp;VerusID.  Identity address (also called i-address): The identity address is, next to the name, the identifier of the&nbsp;VerusID.  Revocation and recovery VerusID authorities   🌎⚠️🔒 <a href="https://www.vaultalert.net/Steal%20my%20VRSC@">Check out VaultAlert.net yourself with this example&nbsp;VerusID.</a>  Be a self-sovereign superpower <p>If you want to be at the forefront of Verus’ cutting edge technology then you should not waste any time and get yourself a VerusID for a small fee (which goes to the miners and stakers of the network). <a href="https://verus.io/wallet">Download Verus Desktop</a>, or <a href="http://www.verus.io/discord">join our Discord to engage with the worldwide community</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin/%EF%B8%8F-vaultalert-net-always-know-your-crypto-assets-are-safe-a20b4d537c61">🌎⚠️🔒 VaultAlert.net — Always know your crypto assets are safe</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/veruscoin">Verus Coin</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Enterprise-focused identity security specialist <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en.html">Ping Identity</a> has set a date for the release of its financial results for Q4 of 2021 and the full fiscal year. The update will arrive after market close on February 24, with the company’s management to further discuss the results on a conference call at 5:00 p.m. Eastern.</p>



<p>For many of those following the company, expectations are likely to be high. In <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/ping-identity-brings-71-5-million-strong-q3-110903/">its Q3 update</a> delivered in November, Ping reported revenues of $76.2 million, a year-over-year increase of 27 percent, with the vast majority of those revenues coming from subscriptions.</p>



<p>Commenting at the time, Ping Identity CEO Andre Durand was upbeat about how the company’s momentum would carry forward into the final quarter of the fiscal year. “We executed well financially, exceeding our guidance ranges for all key metrics, which gives us confidence and momentum to close out 2021 in a strong position.”</p>



<p>Like other digital security solutions providers, Ping has been benefitting from heightened demand from the enterprise sector over the past year as the ongoing pandemic has continued to accelerate digital transformation efforts across a number of sectors. A growing number of organizations are in need of solutions for identity management and remote onboarding, while at the same time seeking to ensure compliance with Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering regulations – concerns that Ping’s Head of Personal Identity, Armin Ebrahimi, discussed in an <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/on-demand-the-future-of-identity-verification/">interview with FindBiometrics</a> last autumn.</p>



<p>For its part, Ping provides a number of identity solutions, including Single Sign-On, multi-factor authentication, and support for fingerprint recognition. Its solutions can be deployed on a SaaS basis, or on-premises, or in a hybrid configuration.</p>



<p>Those who are interested in Ping’s Q4 and 2021 update will be able to dial in on February 24, or can view a webcast of the call afterwards that will be available <a href="https://investor.pingidentity.com/">on the company’s website</a> until March 3, 2022.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.id.me/">ID.me</a> is reaffirming its commitment to inclusive and ethical identification practices. The company recently became the <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/irs-makes-id-me-mandatory-people-accessing-online-accounts-011802/">official identity provider for the IRS</a>, and currently provides identity services for 10 federal agencies and <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/id-me-says-remote-verification-facilitated-1-2-billion-aid-americans-102302/">30 states</a>.</p>



  



<p>Given its popularity with the public sector, ID.me needs to be able to guarantee that all citizens can take full advantage of its services. With that in mind, the company offered some more details about its platform in an effort to build trust with the general population.</p>



<p>In doing so, ID.me revealed that <a href="https://www.paravision.ai/">Paravision</a> is its facial recognition technology provider. Paravision was the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/paravision-takes-top-spot-latest-nist-evaluation-012502/">most accurate solution</a> in the NIST’s most recent FRVT evaluation, and has displayed minimal (and statistically insignificant) demographic bias in independent testing with the NIST and other state and third-party agencies.</p>



<p>In plain terms, that means that ID.me’s solution should perform well for people of any race, age, or gender. ID.me has also partnered with the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/iproov-announces-integrated-biometric-authentication-solution-910062/">iBeta-approved iProov</a> for liveness detection.</p>



<p>On the privacy front, ID.me stressed that it does not sell any of the personal information it collects, and that end users retain full control of their data when choosing what to share with other organizations. The company does not perform 1:N facial recognition, and instead only performs 1:1 face authentication using technology that compares a new face to one already registered in the system and associated with one account. ID.me pointed out that many people already use similar technology to unlock their smartphones.</p>



<p>With regards to utility, ID.me went on to explain that the vast majority (90 percent) of the people who register for an account are able to do so online through the company’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/id-mes-selfie-onboarding-solution-gets-fedramp-green-light/">self-service portal</a>. The other 10 percent can either go to one of ID.me’s 650 in-person locations (run in collaboration with Sterling), or register through a video chat with a “Trusted Referee.” ID.me argued that its identity verification services are more inclusive than those that rely on credit bureaus and data brokers, since those alternatives often overlook unbanked individuals or exclude people with poor credit histories. The company offers support for 16 languages in video chat, and nine languages in the online self-service portal.</p>

<p>Banking at the speed of now requires financial institutions to process payments quickly and maintain compliance. Today, open banking lets Financial Institutions (FIs), payment platforms and fintechs deliver payment services with the speed and ease that consumers now demand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But many organizations still rely on outdated methods to process payments, forcing consumers to wait. They could and should be supporting lightning-fast, real-time payments, recurring payments, refunds and disbursements. Practices like micro-deposits and pre-notifications for account opening and funding or payment processing jam up the experience. Delays around bank account details and balance verification don’t help, either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stakes are high. According to one <a href="https://www.onespan.com/resources/cornerstone-digital-identity-verification-report">industry report</a>, twice as many consumers walk away when faced with <a href="https://www.onespan.com/resources/cornerstone-digital-identity-verification-report">slower methods</a>. “The abandonment rate for FIs that do not require micro-deposits for ACH funding is 13%–in contrast to 27% for those that do.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dissatisfied customers can overwhelm customer support channels when these methods fail. Even worse, scammers love to exploit these older practices to gain rogue access to accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enter: Finicity, a Mastercard company<a href="https://www.finicity.com/pay/">.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our open banking platform meets the needs of digital consumers and the digital payment ecosystem by enabling clients to verify the essential account details, owners, and balances that are needed to transfer, get paid or set up an account with confidence.</p>
<p>Digital payments just make sense. One <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking/">study</a> shares that close to three-quarters of consumers have or would connect their bank accounts for digital payments. In another <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2016/what-suppliers-want-checks-cards-and-ach-preferences/">survey from PYMNTS</a> of supply-side organizations, the majority (63%) said they prefer being paid electronically, specifically via ACH. Just one-quarter wanted to get paid by paper check.</p>

<p>Our platform relies on open banking innovations to support a wide range of digital payment experiences for FIs and consumers. A few popular use cases include:</p>
 
 Secure account opening and funding&nbsp; 
 Mortgage and consumer loan repayment/servicing 
 P2P money transfers 
 Direct ACH payments (P2M) 
 Funding digital wallets 
 Government disbursements 
 Recurring, account-based bill payments&nbsp; 
 Buy-Now-Pay-Later and installment-style credit 
 
 Move Money With Confidence 
<p>We designed our platform behind a driving principle: Pay Confidently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means reliably fast data and superior, API-based connections with leading financial institutions. We layered in added intelligence and deep learning which can help to mitigate fraud while reducing payment failure and pesky NSF fees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each year, more of the world’s leading banks, fintechs, and payment platform providers deliver faster, more secure consumer payments with the power of open banking.</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing how you’ll use open banking capabilities to exceed your customers’ expectations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Previously…<br><br>Staking rewards were allocated each era, but these rewards needed to be triggered in order to payout. This manual step required validators or stakers to initiate the rewards payout for each validator in each era. As soon as a validator or staker requests a payout for an era, all the stakers for that validator would receive the rewards into their accounts. </p><p>After liaising with our community and taking into account the feedback, we’ve made some changes to this process. Dock has now enabled these payments to take place automatically. </p><p>The New Process</p><p>Validators and stakers will no longer have to manually request a rewards payout. The payout will occur automatically after each era. Now validators can continue to produce blocks and validate blocks made by other validators without worrying about claiming the rewards after each era. Rewards will be paid to the winning validators and their stakers accounts after each era, automatically. </p><p>The automatic staking process also saves validators the cost of running the transactions to issue the payouts for each era. This cost will be covered by the Dock Association moving forward with funds from the Dock Treasury.</p><p>The only time the rewards payout after each era will not be automatic is when the validators commission is over 5%.

<p>We had a busy fourth quarter 2021 at Northern Block working on NB Orbit, our suite of self-sovereign identity products.</p>
<p>We feel quite fortunate to be on the forefront of bringing SSI closer to mass adoption. We’re working alongside great partners and customers who have the same goal. Everything we build is to further this mission.</p>
<p>Through the NB Orbit Platform, organizations can deploy digital credentialing ecosystems, become credential issuers, accept digital credentials within workflows and use a variety of digital wallets and agents to connect and exchange credentials.</p>
<p>Note: throughout this post, when we refer to the NB Orbit Platform, we’re talking about our enterprise products (e.g., Issuer, Verifier), which you can read more about towards the end of this post</p>
<p>In this post we’ll cover some of the major items we worked on during Q4 2021 within our suite of products.</p>
 <br>
1&nbsp; B2B Interactions &amp; Credential Exchanges 
<p>Legal entities are required to be holders of credentials, just like people. We started seeing more demand for organization credentials (e.g., audit results, financial proofs, ESG credentials), so we wanted to provide a way for our customers to easily manage them through a user interface.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>
We built in features on the NB Orbit Platform where a person acting on behalf of their organization can view their organization’s credentials, and interact on behalf of it with offers and proof requests. The features include:</p>
 
 Accepting connection invitations from other Organization (cloud wallets) 
 Accepting credential offers from connected Organization (cloud wallets) 
 Displaying the list of credentials stored in the cloud wallet with pagination or card layout 
 Receiving proof requests from connected Organization (cloud wallets) 
 Displaying received proof requests with pagination 
 Displaying the list of credentials available for requested proof 
 Attribute selection option while generating the proof 
 
 <br>
2&nbsp; Verified Business – Enhancements 
<p></p>
<p>With increasing compliance and AML requirements, the veracity and source of company data have become a central point in combating money laundering and other frauds. We started seeing an increasing demand from clients to validate legal entity data at source.</p>
<p>Onboarding in a self-sovereign manner to digital trust ecosystems is different than in federated models. When network operators manage a trust network and an entity connects into the network and begins transacting, it’s important to first ensure that it’s&nbsp; a verified entity, and that the claims the entity makes about itself are verified using a trusted source.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This enables the NB Orbit Platform to create ecosystems for trusted entities to conduct business and daily operations.</p>
 <br>
3&nbsp; Support for Multiple Verifiable Data Registries 
<p>Our customers do not want to have multiple wallets to hold their credentials. Instead they prefer to have one wallet and connect with multiple verifiable data registries from this one wallet to receive verifiable credential offers and provide proofs.</p>
<p>Therefore we added the option to select from multiple Indy-based networks on the mobile device so that it can function with other networks.</p>
<p>See below how our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a> was used to show network interoperability with the BCovrin Indy Network:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 <br>
4&nbsp; Customized Wallet Branding 
<p>Many of our customers have their existing branding that they wish to leverage for their customers, employees or vendors.</p>
<p>To enable them to provide a customized user experience to their end users, we wanted to ensure&nbsp; the process of white labeling our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet </a>was quick and easy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We now offer two ways to get a customized branded wallet:&nbsp;</p>
 
 We work with you to collect information we need for whitelabelling such as colour guides, assets, texts, and languages (more on the multi language support below). 
 We can provide you with a base Figma file&nbsp; and once your designs are finalized, we will quickly implement them. 
 
<p>Once assets are collected, it’s a fairly automated process from then on to have a build ready for private or public distribution via mobile app stores.</p>
<p>Below is a customer of ours, <a href="http://thrivacy.io/">Thrivacy</a>, who we worked with to quickly launch of their SSI&nbsp;Mobile Wallet &amp; Enterprise Issuer/Verifier product suite.</p>
<p></p>
 <br>
5&nbsp; Multi Language Support 
<p>We now offer language selection in our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a>. Being a Canadian company, it’s very important that we can offer multilingual options to Canadian citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We now support two languages: English and French. We will be expanding to offer other languages based on our roadmap and needs from our partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re looking for other languages or simply to modify certain existing text copy for your branded app, the process is now extremely simple thanks to the good work put in by our wallet team to make the code modular and scalable.</p>
 6&nbsp; Verified Person – Enhancements 
<p>We use ID Proofing within our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a> for use cases where a high-level of assurance on the person is needed from a Government-issued ID perspective.</p>
<p>We added assurance to our Verified Person by including more checks and controls over the digitization process.</p>
<p></p>
 <br>
7&nbsp; Digitize Any Document 
<p>There exists lots of authentic and valuable data/documents that aren’t digitally available today. Therefore, rather than waiting for various industries (source data owners/issuers) to go fully digital, we’ve decided there is a continuous need for digitization – turning physical or digital documents into machine readable data. The value of digitizing them is massive.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We implemented a powerful AI-based document parser in our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a>&nbsp;to support the digitization of any document with a standard structure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use an AI-based algorithm that can be trained to support any structured documents.</p>
<p>The use case here is to provide attested documents without going to the attestor physically (e.g., lawyer or notary’s office). We digitized a manual process which takes a ton of time, causes friction/effort and has a cost.. With our document parser, the attestors can instead issue digital credentials remotely. Rather than a stamped seal on a document, attestors can use the NB Orbit Platform to issue cryptographic digital signatures.<br>
</p>
<p>The other value we see is that this process doesn’t have to be repeated over and over again, as verifiable credentials are reusable, once again saving cost and time.</p>
 <br>
8&nbsp; Proof Requests – Enhancements 
<p>With use cases that enable the supply of many verifiable credentials with the same schemas, it’s important that the holder can pick and choose the right verifiable credential during a proof request.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you purchased a microwave from Walmart and it’s broken – you may want to return it – and you’ll need to show your receipt credential. Or perhaps you are looking to get insurance coverage for your microwave – you will need to prove the item and purchase information to the insurer. In both of these scenarios, when the verifier asks for a proof request, you need to show your microwave credential from Walmart (issuer), rather than other credentials you have with the same schema.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We built this functionality into our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a>&nbsp;to allow holders to do just that. We also worked on updates in our Mobile SDK to enable this.</p>
<p>We see this whole process as becoming more intelligent with time as smart agents become able to pull out most relevant credentials based on context, while learning over time.</p>
 <br>
9&nbsp; P2P Messaging Between Agents – Enhancements 
<p>From Kaliya’s post on <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/understanding-didcomm-14da547ca36b">Understanding DIDComm</a>:</p>
<p>“If you are reading this, you probably know already what Decentralized Identifiers (DID) are: they are “identifiers” or addresses which can be queried to return some information about the subject represented.”</p>
<p>Continued: “DIDComm is a cross-community standard that creates libraries and design patterns for two or more DID-controlling entities from diverse DID-based systems to communicate directly with one another. It creates a secure communication channel between software controlled by each of these entities, which can be people, organizations or things. This constitutes an “authenticated channel,” in that control of a given DID’s private keys is, barring a failure of design or operational security, proof of authenticity of the party represented by that DID.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>DIDComm messaging is such a powerful mechanism to achieve security, privacy, decentralization, and transport independence. Most messaging software today is routed through centralized servers. Although different encryption methods are used by them, there’s still an entity between yourself and the other entity you’re communicating with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We wanted to give more flexibility to the multitude of use cases we are seeing by enabling chat to happen over DIDComm, independent of what role and system you’re using in the SSI trust triangle. We built in a web interface on the Enterprise Platform where organizations can now directly chat with their employees, customers, vendors, partners, etc.</p>
<p>We now support chat across these types of relationships:</p>
<p></p>
 10&nbsp; NB Orbit Mobile Wallet Demonstrates AIP 1.0 Compliance 
<p>As Canadian and European governments prepare to issue digital identities to their citizens (e.g., passports, driver’s licences, health cards), ensuring ownership, control and interoperability of data is paramount.</p>
<p>Northern Block has committed itself to compliance with open source projects which lead to the interoperability of verifiable credentials. In November 2021, we worked with the Digital Identity Laboratory of Canada to have them evaluate conformance of our wallet technology to the Hyperledger Aries Interoperability Profile.</p>
<p>The IDLab team conducted the testing of the NB Orbit mobile wallet on both iOS and Android devices, running testing within the IDLab’s technology environment.</p>
<p>Read more <a href="https://northernblock.io/nb-orbit-mobile-wallet-demonstrates-aip-1-0-compliance-with-digital-identity-laboratory-of-canada/">HERE</a>.</p>
 <br>
11&nbsp; General Platform Operation Enhancements 
<p>Lastly, in Q4 2021 we also continued enhancing general functionalities, infrastructure and security features of our product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To recap on our NB Orbit suite of products:</p>
 
 NB Orbit Digital Wallets – store personal credentials using our <a href="https://northernblock.io/ssi-digital-wallet/">NB Orbit Edge Wallet</a>. Store organization-related credentials in our Organizational Cloud Wallet. Maintain high-levels of assurance around identities through integrated ID proofing solutions. 
 NB Orbit Issuer – a Hyperledger Aries cloud agent and controller that can create and issue verifiable credentials.&nbsp; It can create invitations to holders to connect and to track the status of connection invites and credential offers.&nbsp; The issuer has a web interface to provide users with the controls for handling connections and credential issuances.&nbsp; 
 NB Orbit Trust Registry – a server application used to provision new issuer and verifiers.&nbsp; It handles the process to invite, authorize and orchestrate the cloud containers for each issuer and verifier on the platform. 
 NB Orbit Verifier – a Hyperledger Aries cloud agent and controller that can create proof templates and initiate proof requests. It can create invitations to holders to connect and to track the status of connection invites and proof requests. The verifier has a web interface to provide users with the controls to handle connections and credential verifications. 
 NB Orbit Verifiable Data Registry – a Hyperledger Indy network running four nodes.&nbsp; It is used to hold credential schemas and definitions as well as the DID Documents for the public DIDs of the issuers and verifiers.&nbsp; The DID Documents contain information such as the public key and endpoints of the issuers and verifiers.&nbsp; No data pertaining to the holders is ever stored in this network. Alongside this, we also run a revocation registry – a cryptographic tails files store that provides credentials issued based on a credential definition to be revoked.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 NB Orbit Mediator – a store and forward system that provides the mobile wallets with a static endpoint. Mobile devices are not guaranteed to be available online when a cloud agent needs to communicate with them.&nbsp; The mediator acts as an answering machine for the mobile wallet and will forward on the encrypted messages it has received when the mobile device is back online. 
 
<p>—</p>
<p>I hope this summary was helpful for everyone who’s reading.</p>
<p>Moving forward, we’ll aim to keep you updated every few months.</p>
<p>Now, back to building!</p>

 The Sovereign Yidindji Government (SYG) has issued and deployed the Sovereign Yidindji Dollar successfully using MetaMUI Identity-based Blockchain Sovereign Yidindji has successfully issued their own Central Bank Digital Currency(CBDC) <br>“Sovereign Yidindji Dollar” on top of MetaMUI Blockchain<p>After more than half a year of intense collaboration between Sovereign Yidindji Government(SYG) and MetaMUI, the team had successfully issued a fully functioning Central Bank Digital Currency using the revolutionary technology of MetaMUI, the world’s first Identity-based Blockchain.</p><p>While hundreds of CBCD projects are cropping up around the world, most projects are still at the research or Proof of Concept stage. Only a few, such as ‘Sand Dollar’ in the Bahamas, and ‘e-Naira’ in Nigeria, have launched CBCD so far. Yidinji Dollar has four distinctive features which differentiate it from&nbsp;others.</p><p>● Yidindji Dollar is the first Central Bank Digital Currency issued by the “CBDC Issuance Platform.”<br>● Yidindji Dollar was issued only in digital currency without any paper bills.<br>● A new payment system connected with MetaMUI’s SSID system is used in all retail stores and government offices. Payment can be processed without using the dedicated network, there is no transaction fee, sales settlement is done immediately, and cross-border payment can be made without using Visa or Mastercard.<br>● It is a convertible currency whose collateral assets are gold and silver and other minerals and natural resources such as green and blue carbon. Money issuance, backed by a digital certificate, is also backed with collateral assets. Convertible currencies ended in 1971 when President Nixon stopped the exchange between the dollar and gold. It is the first convertible currency since Nixon and the first digital currency.</p><p>MetaMUI is the first identity-based token blockchain that combines the concept of self-sovereign identity and decentralized blockchain. Self-sovereign identity is a decentralized identity that protects users’ privacy. It avoids the problem of centralized censorship and the abuse of private information. The Sovereign Yidindji Government has already built the national identity system utilizing MetaMUI’s technology. Therefore every Yidjindji citizen, Yidindji company, and Yidindji organization can create their own digital identity, own various digital assets, and make payment with Yidindji&nbsp;Dollar.</p><p>“Yidindji is the first nation to choose MetaMUI’s CBDC platform. MetaMUI platform allows any country to publish the state-of-the-art CBDC within a few days at a fraction of the cost. MetaMUI platform also provides a single integrated solution for national identity, e-Government, peer-to-peer payment, digital certificates, and cross-border payment.” said Phantom Seokgu Yun, CEO of&nbsp;MetaMUI.</p><p>“The benefits of central bank digital currencies are profound, and it is only a matter of time before they are implemented by countries around the world,” said Don Tapscott, Executive Chairman of the Blockchain Research Institute. “But they need to be done right to safeguard citizen privacy and to interoperate around the world. I am delighted to see this technology used to build a more sustainable future for the people of the Sovereign Yidindji Government in Australia.”</p><p>Loretta Joseph, an advisor of MetMUI, who connected with the Sovereign Yidindji Government, said, “I am very excited for the oldest civilization to adapt to the 21st century by embracing technology and change for a more inclusive and better&nbsp;world”.</p><p>The Sovereign Yidindji Government is an Aboriginal Australian micronation, and its territory is home to some of the world’s most pristine rainforests. Academics and scientists claim the Yidindji people have been around for more than 60 thousand years, so it is one of the oldest living cultures on the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>“‘Gayaburra galin nyundu’ With the blessing of Yeshua Hamashiach, the Yidindji nation is becoming a fully digitized nation, thanks to MetaMUI revolutionary technology we made a leapfrog towards the future. The Yidindji reserve currency will stabilise and add security, it will also ensure credibility to the global economy and financial system. Yidindji’s participation not only makes sense being logical, but it is also inevitable. The world is now ready for the indigenous peoples to underwrite a new future.” said Gudju-Gudju Gimuybara, Chief Minister of&nbsp;SYG.</p> About Yidindji <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qjX1OysGbk4">Yidindji people</a> are a rainforest-based society with several clan groups in the area described as far north Queensland on the Australian continent. The Yidindji territory is home to some of the world’s most pristine rainforests and is an essential gateway to the great barrier reef. Academics and scientists claim the Yidindji people have been around for more than 60 thousand years, so it is one of the oldest living cultures on the planet. In 2014, history was made on September 20 as the official government of the Yidindji nation came into life with the launch of its coat of arms. Since then, the SYG, as it is known, has created several departments, and its parliament continues to pass laws for the peace, order, and good governance of the Yidindji territory. SYG has 17 ministers and 22 ministries and plans to be the first government to become entirely digitized in its venture towards e-governance.</p> About MetaMUI <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b-W5nwN9dMU">MetaMUI</a> is the first identity-based token blockchain. The design approach of MetaMUI is opposite to most cryptocurrencies and other anonymous token blockchains. In contrast, most token technologies follow the anonymous token design of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, etc. MetaMUI chose to redesign the blockchain structure based on identity entirely. The main reason for this is to satisfy the regulatory framework of current financial systems such as FATF’s travel&nbsp;rule.</p><p>[SOVEREIGN WALLET NETWORK ‘SWN’] is the genius behind the development of the MetaMUI identity-based blockchain. The Sovereign Wallet Network (SWN) has redesigned the blockchain and developed the MetaMUI blockchain. We are proud to provide the state-of-the-art 4th generation blockchain with a mainnet launched on January 3, 2021. The Sovereign Wallet is located in six (6) different countries globally, with headquarters in Singapore and offices in Korea, Sweden, the United States, India, and Uzbekistan. The MetaMUI blockchain is paving the way towards building the Internet of Sovereign Digital Currencies (IoSDC). The company’s website at MetaMUI-SovereignWallet contains additional information.</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a>/<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a>/<a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a>/<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">John Tolbert</a></p><p>Have you entered a password somewhere today? Do you wonder why you’re still having to do that? Did entering that password give you a feeling of digital safety? Did it make your consumer experience more enjoyable?</p>
<p>Cybersecurity and identity management experts have been proclaiming the benefits of and absolute necessity of Multifactor Authentication (MFA) and risk-adaptive authentication for years now.&nbsp; MFA is the leading concept for implementing strong authentication, which is defined as the combination of two or more of the following: something you know, something you have, or something you are. Indeed, you won’t hear anyone in the field deny that MFA and risk-adaptive authentication are two of the best ways to reduce cybercrime and fraud, particularly account takeover (ATO) fraud. But we enter passwords every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every. Single. Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn’t improve security, and it doesn’t make for a pleasant user experience. So why are we still doing it?&nbsp;</p>
 
 Security and user satisfaction are just not high enough priorities in some organizations yet&nbsp; 
 
<p>That’s it, there’s no need for a second bullet point. Here are some common retorts:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Security and user satisfaction are important to our org, but we don’t have the budget.” Find the budget. Authentication system and service upgrades are not as expensive as you may think. The offset against potential fraud risks, especially in certain sectors, can be demonstrated to pay for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We haven’t had any security incidents tied to password breaches.”&nbsp; Are you sure? Even if that’s true, it’s only a matter of time before it does happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re a small business, the big cybercriminals aren’t targeting us.” The days when big global brands and big banks were exclusively targeted are gone. If your organization has something of value or processes transactions of any kind, then it is likely already on the radar of cybercriminals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We have legacy Line of Business (LOB) applications that don’t interoperate with identity and authentication standards.”&nbsp; Admittedly, this is a tougher issue. Most IAM and IDaaS authentication services allow for customization to address compatibility for older applications. It’s probably harder to integrate old apps, but not impossible. Moreover, legacy LOB apps often reside on unsupported operating systems which are more vulnerable to exploits. A project to upgrade authentication may have additional security benefits if legacy apps on out-of-service OSes can be removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Users are used to entering passwords.” That may be true, but it doesn’t mean we like doing it. Many of us know that passwords are weak security. It makes us wonder what else you’re doing wrong. When security conscious users enter passwords into websites or mobile apps, we doubt that those organizations are committed to the security of our information and finances. Repeated entering of passwords leads to reduced trust in the organization asking for passwords. Erosion of trust leads to diminishing customer loyalty, lost business, and shrinking revenue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Insecurity leads to doubt, doubt leads to mistrust, and mistrust leads to the dark downside of lost business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of us have been waiting for years for the promise of passwordless authentication. IAM vendors typically define passwordless as removing password databases from centralized systems, thereby improving security by reducing the likelihood of password breaches. Mobile phone-based biometrics and FIDO are good examples of passwordless authentication. It’s important to note that although password databases may be omitted in passwordless authentication systems, users may still have to enter passwords or PINs occasionally, but those factors are evaluated locally on the users’ devices.&nbsp; We have, however, fortunately observed that the number of completely passwordless solutions in the market is increasing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, thanks to many excellent authentication solutions and services available in the market, it’s never been easier for organizations that still use traditional passwords with centralized databases to move away from them. For more information on authentication solutions, see <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research?q=authentication&amp;f=&amp;ref=eic22blogjohn" title="KuppingerCole Research">KuppingerCole Research</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we can’t get to fully passwordless, we’ll settle for password-fewer. Password authentication can be augmented by risk analysis. Many sites that still appear to use passwords are actually doing sophisticated examination of many attributes in the background. This is what social media, some big retailers, and other forward-looking organizations are doing. Their users have passwords “on file” but rarely have to use them because of the advanced risk analysis that going on behind the scenes. Examples of contextual information considered includes device intelligence, IP address (history and reputation), browser attributes, geo-location of request, time/day, etc. All these data points can be compared at transaction time to a per-user historical baseline. In cases like this, the password is the fallback. If the risk analysis concludes that the request context is within acceptable parameters, the user doesn’t get prompted to re-enter a password, get an email/SMS OTP, etc. It’s smooth surfing. Only if the risk analysis shows a significant deviation would the user be asked to explicitly demonstrate they are who they say they are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The unobtrusive nature of risk-adaptive / password-fewer authentication is a win-win for those who deploy it: they reduce their own risks of loss from fraud while providing a better experience for their customers. Happy customers mean repeat business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best of all, MFA and risk-adaptive authentication can go hand-in-hand. Risk-adaptive authentication systems can leverage MFA methods for those cases where they do sense something is amiss in the request context and need to re-authenticate or step-up authentication for certain types of transactions. Mobile push notifications, mobile biometrics, and FIDO authenticators improve usability and security concomitantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather than continuing to wait on the organizations we interact with to update their authentication systems, how do we move forward?&nbsp;</p>
 
 Ask. Use available contact methods such as emailing support or chat options. At least requests are registered. Honestly this method has not met with much success.&nbsp; 
 Ask more formally. Contact CISOs of organizations that use weak authentication and respectfully request that they implement MFA and risk-based authentication to reduce their risk and protect your information and assets better. Consider having an attorney send a letter on your behalf. If the organization in question does not have a CISO, find contacts for their legal counsel, CIO, CTO, or another high-level position that has the power to make positive changes.&nbsp; 
 Look for more secure alternatives in the marketplace. If you feel that your info and assets are not being properly protected by the service providers you are currently doing business with, then look for those that do offer the kind of security that you need.&nbsp; 
 
<p>It’s time for consumers to make their concerns and desires for a more secure ecommerce ecosystem known. Join us at EIC in Berlin in May for a vibrant discussion on the latest authentication technologies and how implementing them can protect organizations, consumers, and improve business.&nbsp;</p>

 Highlights <p>In the face of the upcoming Metaverse revolution, DID has demonstrated its powerful utility: it will serve as the entrance to the Metaverse and carry the user’s trusted identity and privacy data. Therefore, we need mature DID technology for the underlying infrastructure. Ontology has been working in the DID industry for several years and has gradually reached different partnerships around the world. At the same time, ONTO, a DID-based gateway for a seamless Web3 experience, will continue to expand its multi-chain asset and dApp support, to promote the development of the Metaverse.</p> Latest Developments  Development Progress   We have completed the launch of Ontology’s EVM TestNet. Developers are welcome to conduct various tests. Related documents can be obtained at the <a href="https://docs.ont.io/">Ontology Developer Center</a>.

Community Growth   We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1484246853189193729?s=20">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, with the theme “how to make the blockchain acceptable”. The Ontology community believed that in order to be accepted by the mainstream, it is necessary to guide the positive development of the blockchain industry and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent incidents. A reputation system based on DID will be one of the solutions. When everyone’s reputation is linked to their behavior, and data cannot be tampered with, people need to carefully maintain their reputation.  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He talked with community members about why Ontology chose to set up an office in Berlin, Germany, and its positive impact. By opening the new office in Berlin, Ontology is excited to contribute to the continent’s ongoing efforts to create a more secure web. Benny also shared the upcoming Valentine’s Day event, community members said that they will definitely participate in this romantic and meaningful event.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.

It has redefined how technology should function and what it means to create value and utility. As the world continues to teeter on the brink of chaos because of the uneven distribution of resources and center-oriented control, Web3 technologies provide a way out.&nbsp;”</p><p>In the end, there will not be a single blockchain, but rather a collection of different chains, each with their own characteristics, benefits, and subcultures. Whilst there will be competition, there is also tremendous opportunity for collaboration for the benefit of the overall ecosystem and user experience. Ontology will continue to optimize deeper product integrations across different blockchains. With a focus on DID and data, users will be on-boarded into the Ontology experience for secure, self-sovereign control over their digital existence.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, and welcome to a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity in this new year, 2022. And we have, after some time, again, our friends of the Open Identity Exchange. And today, our guest is Nick Mothershaw. He is the Chief Identity Strategist at the Open Identity Exchange, a community for all those involved in the identity sector to connect and collaborate.</p>
<p>Nick has expert knowledge of Identity and Fraud techniques, solutions and standards across a wide variety of different sectors and jurisdictions. Nick was previously Director of Identity and Fraud at Experian, where he was responsible for the development of Experian’s fraud and identity solutions for both the public and private sectors. Nick led Experian’s development, launch and operation of a full “Identity as a Service” solution, which was the first live example of a digital identity being seamlessly interoperable across public and private sector.</p>
<p>Hello, Nick.</p>
<p>Nick Mothershaw: Hello, Oscar. Hello.</p>
<p>Oscar: Welcome. It’s great having you, Nick.</p>
<p>Nick: It’s a pleasure to be here. And yeah, Happy New Year to you and all your listeners, very exciting to be at the start of 2022, which I think it’s going to be an amazing and transformational year for digital identity. So this is a really timely conversation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. And I know you have new things to tell us. So yeah, Nick, let’s talk about digital identity. But I’d like to start hearing a bit more about yourself, so please tell us about your journey to the world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Nick: Yeah, it’s been a long journey now. So I was originally involved in, I guess, in identity when I worked with law enforcement, providing crime management and intelligence management systems. And after that, we started looking at biometrics. So around the year 2000, we were using biometrics to help identify criminals from group photographs and also using facial mapping to look at, where we used to use these E-FITs, these faces that were being drawn by computer that were put out on things like crime watch programmes, so we’re using facial biometrics to match those two databases of known and suspected criminals. And that was way back in 2000.</p>
<p>So from there, I moved to look more in detail at fraud and around identity fraud, specifically, and how can identity fraud be detected and prevented. So using algorithms, anomaly detection, graph-based analysis to bind identity fraud in the finance ecosystem initially, and then into insurance and telcos.</p>
<p>And the flip side of that is, of course, identity. So if you strongly identify the individual, the risk of fraud is reduced. So this fraud and identity became two sides of the same coin. And as we put our business, Experian, around fraud and identity, we both evolved the fraud solutions to be more and more sophisticated, but also involved the identity side of the coin, to leverage data that can prove to the individual’s identity to scan documents, to bring those together into complete Identity-as-a-Service management.</p>
<p>So around 2015, we built an Identity-as-a-Service platform. And that enabled us to identify end users both of Experian systems and, in the UK, Gov.Uk Verify users. So we were able to take users through a proofing process using data, using passports and driving licenses, using – getting payments into open banking, with PINs on. And that enabled us to strongly proof an individual.</p>
<p>And alongside that we ran all the fraud controls we created as well. So we mitigated against identity fraud to create a really strongly trusted ID. There was a reusable ID, and users could use the identity to both log on to Experian’s credit management systems, credit reference systems and also in the UK, log onto government systems through the Gov.UK Verify framework. So we were the only identity provider who did that – had both a public-private interoperable login for users, which meant I only had to have one password, only one set of credentials, to access multiple different services at a high level of trust. So we’re really proud that we built that and that was delivered into UK Verify.</p>
<p>As part of that, I got involved in the Open Identity Exchange. So I was Vice Chair for a while and then became Chair. And then just over two years ago now, I decided I wanted to spend all of my time driving forward this vision of digital identity so that we could all have a digital ID that is trusted, that is accepted ubiquitously and our lives, our digital lives are made so much easier because our trusted information is available, it’s controlled by us, and is shareable by us to those who need to understand who we are and what we’re eligible to do for different use cases, different services all over the world. I really strongly believe in that vision and joined OIX as Chief Identity Strategist, so just over two years ago now to help OIX, as a members’ body, to help its members collectively pursue and achieve that vision.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, fantastic experience you had in Experian. That sounds quite exciting what you were doing there. And also, now I can hear your motivation to work here in OIX. Excellent.</p>
<p>So as I mentioned earlier, we had before, around a bit more than two years ago, we had in this podcast show and at that time, it was <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/don-thibeau-openid-foundation/" title="Don Thibeau">Don Thibeau</a> representing the OIX. And he was talking about the need for a global approach to identity. And he also has mentioned a little bit of that. But something that came to, I think everybody who is involved in the digital identity space in the last months has been the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/global-assured-identity-network-gain-elizabeth-garber/" title="GAIN">GAIN</a> white paper. And we know that both OIX and I think also yourself have been involved in that. So could you tell us a bit about that? What is the OIX’s role within GAIN?</p>
<p>Nick: Yeah, absolutely. So GAIN, Global Assured Identity Network, was a white paper that was released back in September, and was created over the summer. In the end, over 150 different authors put their name to that paper. And the vision was that – lots of people shared the vision, I’ve just articulated. This vision that an identity can be used in an interoperable way and that will work internationally. So 150 plus people, all sharing that vision, put their name to that paper.</p>
<p>The paper was collectively created; fortunately a few people held the pen, not 150, or else it would never have come. We’d never have got anything coherent out. We mostly created a collective paper that had the backing of 154 people, I think it was in the end, they all shared that same vision. And that vision is that an ID can be accepted anywhere around the globe. And that’s a massively ambitious statement. And to do that, the GAIN term was coined, the Global Assured Identity Network. To make that possible, there needs to be some kind of network on a global basis and that that work enables trust, to the number of different elements of GAIN.</p>
<p>So we released the paper, and then five organisations have kind of rallied around that vision, taking different parts and delivering it. So firstly, on the technical side, the Open Identity Foundation, the foundation is looking at OK, how do that vision achieve technically? How can we communicate trust from one domain to another, from one framework to another, from one country to another? And they’re looking at the different technical rails of how that makes possible.</p>
<p>OIX is looking at the legal, the operational, the governance elements that would sit above that technical layer. And arguably, and my other colleagues sometimes say that this is true, that’s the harder bit. So we can communicate some information about an individual. But what does that information mean? And I’ll come back to that in a minute. And that’s one of the key challenges OIX is looking at.</p>
<p>The other organisations involved in it are <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/">GLEIF</a>, Global Legal Entity Identity Foundation. So wherever we’ve got a legal actor in here, an organisation, GLEIF have a role to play in identifying who that organisation is, both in terms of parties providing information, but also consuming information and being the identity asserters themselves where it’s an organisational ID.</p>
<p>For the Cloud Signature Consortium, because this links closely into digital signing, digital signatures. And once we know who the user is, we want to legally enter into a relationship with them in many use cases.</p>
<p>And then the International Institute of Finance is looking at how, across the finance community, how can that community both be involved as consumers of identities – because finance is a key area we need to prove who you are – but also providers of identities. In many countries already in the Nordics, in Canada, we’ve got banks playing the role of identity providers, and that’s likely to happen in a lot of other countries. So IIF are playing that dual role of representing identity consuming community and providing community.</p>
<p>So these five organisations have now come together to drive GAIN forward. And so OIX’s focus area is the, as we term it, the trust framework element. So let’s imagine that I can communicate information about an individual. So that individual has a Belgian ID, for instance. And they’re trying to assert their identity in Indonesia. So I can tell that the relying party in Indonesia, who the person is. I can give them the name, the address, the date of birth, the national ID number, maybe, to identify who they are, which is relevant in Belgium, that means nothing in Indonesia. I can tell who the identity provider is that has provided that information. I tell them the standard to which that identity was proofed, which might be eIDAS substantial, for instance. And I can tell them the framework that it was done in – so it was done in eIDAS. So I can give a lot and I can communicate all of that information pretty simply in a technical package of data.</p>
<p>But the key question is what does all that mean? So can this relying party, let’s say it’s a bank in Indonesia, trust a Belgian ID? The Belgian ID is issued under this thing called eIDAS and has a level of assurance ‘substantial’. What does that mean? And how does that map into any Indonesian trust framework and rules that that relying party is subject to? How does it map into any finance rules they have that’s replicable for anti-money laundering?</p>
<p>So, they can only accept that ID if they know a lot more about the framework that is behind the information. And that’s OIX’s role to work out how do we explain the information about each framework? And how do we assess framework and interoperability, because what we’re really looking at there is the Belgian ID is operating under a framework. There’s a framework in Indonesia that dictates how ID needs to be assessed, managed, scored, levels of assurance, assessments in Indonesia. Are those two things compatible? So can that Indonesian relying party accept a Belgian-issued identity?</p>
<p>To do that, we think we need some kind of global interoperability framework. So we can take those two different frameworks in two different jurisdictions, and assess where they align, where they differ. And where they do differ, work out what those differences are, and work out how those differences can be mitigated. And is that by further alignment, by step up, by legal agreements? And to do that, we think we need a global interoperability framework, a meta framework, a framework of frameworks to compare frameworks to.</p>
<p>So, one of the things we’re going to be working on in our new global interoperability Working Group, which is kicking off on the 31st of January, is exploring precisely that question, how do we get two frameworks to interoperate? And that leaves the question of how do we get many frameworks to interoperate, which is why we think we need this global interoperability, this meta framework that sits across the top to make this happen.</p>
<p>And on top of that, we’ll be exploring how might that be governed? So how might that be done in a way that is independent, a lot of these frameworks will be government-driven, so enables government-to-government frameworks to communicate and strike agreements internationally with each other, without having to have lots of bilateral agreements from government to government, because that will take forever. That would be like doing trade agreements with every single country bilaterally, that doesn’t work. People do trade agreements in blocks, we need to leap beyond that to that entity to do identity trust agreements on a global basis. Let’s get this right, first time around.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I can see. So, a very good example you gave with two quite distant countries, Belgium and Indonesia, for example. And I get the idea that in different jurisdictions there are trust frameworks, but what is needed, the missing piece, is that global interoperable trust framework, and that is the – that is a piece that your team at the OIX is working right now. And both as part of the GAIN, the implementation of GAIN, but also I think this global interoperable trust framework is meant to be used also anywhere it can be used, correct?</p>
<p>Nick: Oh, absolutely. Yes, yes. So this is so – we already have a framework, which is intended as a global guide to frameworks at the moment. So you can come along to the OIX website, www.oix – sorry, <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/">http://www.openidentityexchange[in full].com</a>. And on there is our <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/guide-trust-frameworks-interoperability">guide to trust frameworks</a>. And that details the contents of a trust framework, and it’s already there as a guide for those who need to understand what a trust framework is, what should be in it, and how to create it. So we already have that, so that’s been published a couple of years. That builds on the work we’ve done over the last 10 years around defining what a trust framework is. So that’s out there. We’re about to update that with the 2022 version, which I’ll talk about in a moment.</p>
<p>So the work we’re doing with GAIN is really taking that framework model we’ve got, and then using that to reason about how frameworks can interoperate. And from that, we expect to distil that there are key elements of a framework that are required for interoperability. And that’s where the term global interoperability framework is starting to come from. A lot of the things in our guide, they’re all important. But when you ask the interoperability question across frameworks, some are more important than others. And that’s the work we’re about to do with the GAIN initiative, to make that assessment. Whatever conclusions we reach there, again, conclusions are done where the Open Identity Exchange will be publishing our findings in an open way. And that framework would be able to be used by GAIN and the others looking to achieve the same objectives.</p>
<p>Our framework, though, our new framework that’s coming out, the trust framework 2022 is a massive evolution from the one that was previously published. One of the things we’ve done is taking a look at the way the markets moved over the past, I mean five years really, but in particular, since COVID, and that has emphasised the need for user-centric identity. We’ve seen a lot of self-sovereign based identities, verifiable credentials being used now to communicate the COVID certificates. We’ve seen the emergence of mobile driving licenses as a particular credential, digitised credential that can be gained by the user and put in a wallet and shared with others.</p>
<p>So we’ve moved our framework on to make sure it’s fully embracing of user-centric, self-sovereign identity. And we’ve changed some of the terminology. So we’ve moved to use, heavily use the term ‘credential’. So we talked about digitised credentials and derived credentials, that the digital identity, which could be a wallet, helps the user manage, gather, and manage those credentials and share them with others. So we’ve kind of taken a bit of a shift in our positioning and philosophy but we are remaining technology agnostic in that shift that we’ve made.</p>
<p>The other thing that we have really baked into that new version of the framework is that we see a digital identity is going to be useful for the user. If we just simply collect a set of digitised real-world credentials in a digital wallet- So if I end up with a wallet on my phone that’s got my passport and my driving license in it and my COVID certificate, that’s digitised some real-world credentials, documents, and given me them in an electronic form. That’s a great step forward.</p>
<p>But what the digital identity needs to do is really help the user in that process of both gathering that information, and more importantly, collating it to present to relying parties in a way that meets the rules of the relying party. So what you’ll see in our new trust framework, when it comes out, is an emphasis on a digital identity being able to understand the rules of the relying parties, the organisations that need to consume identity, and eligibility information, because we classed something like COVID information as eligibility information, and the digital identity can take those rules, and then work out, does the user have what they need to meet those rules?</p>
<p>So if it’s a question about, is the user COVID safe? What does COVID safe mean in this context? What is that question that’s being asked? Because COVID safe, COVID secure means different things, depending on who’s asking the question. If it’s a government wanting to let you into the country, versus a bar wanting to admit you to have some drinks, it’s a very different question. And everybody’s rules are different.</p>
<p>So the digital identity’s got to help the user through that process. It’s got to accept the request from the airline that saying, “Well, if you’re going to board me, you’ve got to be COVID safe. These are the rules. This is what I mean, by COVID safe. I mean, you’ve got to have a vaccine. And the vaccine has got to be one of these types. And you’ve got to have had a complete course of two vaccines. And it’s got to have been done with the last 14 days. And I mean, you’ve got to have a test. And that test has got to be completed in the last 24 hours. And it’s of this type, and it’s from one of these certified providers.”</p>
<p>So all of those rules, complex rules, the digital identity needs to help the user through. It needs to be intelligent, so that it can accept the request from the relying party, it can work out, well, yeah, the user’s have got the vaccine they need, that’s great. But they haven’t got the test that they need. So they need to go and get a test. So where can they go and get that test – it needs to help them through that process. It’s got to be intelligent. So you’ll start to hear us talking a lot about intelligent digital identity. And that that is going to be key to digital identity being a success.</p>
<p>Oscar: What is that intelligence – where it relies, in the application? Or…</p>
<p>Nick: So, from the user’s perspective, it needs to look to them as though it’s simply their digital identity is doing this for them. Technically, where does that sit? There are a number of options. So, if I’ve got a digital identity that’s cloud-based, or wallet-based, as part of the provision of that digital identity in the cloud, or in the wallet, that intelligence can be built in. So we’re talking there about an intelligent wallet, or an intelligent digital identity, where it has a rules engine in it.</p>
<p>So within our framework now, we’ve made it that a rules engine being present, that can interpret the rules and can work out how to answer the questions. And that can either be embedded in the wallet, or we’re talking about concepts of a rules agent. So where you can have a wallet, which is the thing that collects the information and collects derived information, and a rules agent who does the intelligent bit. So it’s the rules agent who takes the rules around being COVID safe, understands those, works out what credentials the user’s already got, helps the user get the ones that haven’t, and then derives the COVID safe status as a derived credential, enables the wallet to pass that on to the relying party.</p>
<p>So we see it’s very much as either it can all be in one intelligent digital identity, or it can be in a digital identity leveraging intelligent rules agents to achieve that goal. And again, the new framework paints both of those options as being completely valid.</p>
<p>Oscar: And all this is defined in the trust framework. That sounds powerful, I would say.</p>
<p>Nick: Yeah, we tried to make it as consumable as possible. So, at OIX, we’ve got the section on the guide, and we break the framework guide down into sections so it’s more easily consumable. So there’s a guide in there, really to what is a digital ID and how does it manage these credentials and gather them? How does it derive credentials like COVID safe from core credentials, like vaccines and tests? And then we dive into rules around things like identity assurance. Again, what are the rules around determining a level of assurance for an individual if that is required.</p>
<p>And most frameworks work on some kind of level of assurance, you’ve got low, substantial, high. In eIDAS, you’ve got low, medium, high. In the UK, you’ve got IALs and NIST… So when you get to that level of trust, and you’ve got a pre canned definitions of levels of trust, it gets quite complicated. So it’s really, there’s a whole section on that around identity assurance and how that is achieved.</p>
<p>Below the guide itself are more detailed guides. So we have a separate guide on identity assurance and authentication. We have separate guides on trust marks and how you mark, create and market a trust mark. We have guides on principles just to think, few things you should think about when creating principles. We’ve got another new guide coming out in February on everything that happens when something goes wrong. So from Help Desk to compensation, how should a digital identity ecosystem deal with those unhappy paths, and make sure all users have a good experience despite difficulties they may encounter?</p>
<p>And we also have a guide to fraud controls as well, which enables people creating identity ecosystems to understand. Unfortunately, digital identity will be targeted by fraudsters. It will become a honeypot, we’ve got to build the right flow controls at day one. So the overarching guide is really- there’s 25 different elements of the trust framework, what we’re doing is drilling into those 25 elements with more guides. There won’t be 25 of them, because we drill into several elements at once in a single guide. But we’re probably about halfway through in writing a full guide to digital identity. But the framework itself is complete and contains everything you need to do to create successful and trusted digital identities.</p>
<p>Oscar: Oh, it sounds very powerful as I said. And if I may, what is the ultimate name, the official name of this new trust framework?</p>
<p>Nick: The official name is OIX Trust Framework 2022. It’s the year, is the new version. So it will be launched on I’d say February the 3rd, we are planning a <a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/oix-2022-trust-framework-launch-tickets-245784777887">launch event</a>. So for those of you who are OIX members, or if you sort of follow on the OIX website, there’ll be a launch event coming up early next week for you to come along and hear more about what’s in that framework and why we’ve done it and the intent behind making sure we’ve got intelligent digital IDs, not just collections of stuff in a wallet.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, absolutely, I’m asking because people can easily find it. And also, to dig a bit more on the details of the actual work you’re doing. So, who it’s being created for, who should read this, this work that you are going to release?</p>
<p>Nick: So, it’s aimed at multiple audiences. And we also just announced from it, other information that is relevant to relying parties. So the overarching framework guide itself – if you were to want to write a framework from scratch, it contains everything you need to enable you to do that, and to understand what needs to be in a trust framework. There’s no other global guide that does that, that tells you what is a trust framework and what’s in it and how should it be governed? So that enables those creating trust frameworks to create them and evolve them. And you know, we’re hoping with the new version is people who’ve already got trust frameworks will look at the new version and say, “Yeah, we need to evolve our existing framework to move towards this provision of intelligent digital ID.”</p>
<p>And it enables those creating self-sovereign identities to understand how that identity would fit into a trust framework. And we are talking with the Trust Over IP Foundation about a partnership where the work they do and the work OIX do is more closely aligned. So hopefully more on that as we move further into 2022. It’s designed to explain trust frameworks to identity providers who might need to go and get certified and approved into a trust framework. And we distil from it a version that enables relying parties, organisations who consume trust frameworks, to also understand what a digital identity is.</p>
<p>However, they need a simpler view of the world. They’re interested in the bits that are relevant to them. So we have a separate guide called <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/networks/87/item.html?id=503">Getting Ready for Digital ID</a> that positions what a digital ID is, why it should be intelligent, and what a framework does, in the context of a relying party that was launched back in October, and it’s available on the website now. So it’s designed to kind of multi– I mean their readership isn’t designed for its end users, really, but it’s relevant to the rest of the ID ecosystem.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. That concept that you mentioned the intelligent ID that definitely intrigued me. I have to go and read that part at least and to know more. Sounds really powerful.</p>
<p>Nick: And what we’re going to use it for now. And this has always been our vision, is going back to what we’re doing on GAIN around global interoperability. So, having written it, brought it up to date, republished it, it now gives us the framework to start assessing global interoperability, and there’s already a section in it which talks about key elements for global interoperability. And we’re going to build out from that section and drill into the items we’ve highlighted in there to work out how do we create a framework that specifically enables interoperability. So enables us to do that and do that in a way that the terminology is consistent.</p>
<p>We’ve got a published benchmark to work from, because everyone’s– as frameworks have been written over the last, I guess, 10 years, OIX is proud to have influenced how a lot of them have been written, but it’s been evolutionary. So they’re all slightly different. And they’re all slightly different terms and structured things in slightly different ways. If we’re going to compare them and make them interoperable, we need something that’s standard to do that. And then so we would use the trust framework 2022 as that start point.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Makes a lot of sense. Anything else about this trust framework that you would like to share that we have not covered?</p>
<p>Nick: I think there’s a couple of things that we’re throwing out that are new. So, they move through the term credential. It does talk about these two things, digitise credentials and derived credentials. And that’s quite new. We’ve done a lot of work on this, a lot of thinking about what will those two terms mean.</p>
<p>So a digitised credential, we mean a digital version of a real-world thing like passport or driving license, a COVID vaccine, an education certificate. So these are the things that the self-sovereign world has been digitising, and is digitising. So they become part of a digital identity available in a wallet.</p>
<p>We’ve then got the term derived credential. And what that means – if we take digitised credentials, and then we derive other things from them. That might be simply deriving the person’s over 18. But we’re positioning that as a new credential that’s been derived from those other credentials. You might be determining that a person is COVID safe, which was the example earlier. We might be determining a level of assurance for the individual. So is this person eIDAS substantial? And we also position that as a derived credential, because it’s– you need to know what credentials it came from, when it was made, or what evidence was behind it, and how long it lasts. So if you have a person that’s over 18, they’re always over 18. So that’s the long-lasting derived credential. If you work out someone’s COVID safe, they probably are for a few weeks.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. Yeah.</p>
<p>Nick: Yeah, work at a level of assurance it probably lasts months, or until something occurs that says its unsafe. So we thought it was important to have this separate type of credential, the derived credential, and it’s that those derived credentials are often the things that the relying parties need. If we’re going to do data minimisation, it’s the derived credential that data minimises the digitised credentials as they’re passed on to the relying party. So this construct digitised and derived credentials is quite key.</p>
<p>And the other thing to bring out that we’ve got is a new view on principles. So we’ve always had a user-centric view on principles in the framework. We talk about the four C’s are important for consumers, and we framed principles in terms that consumers would understand. And that’s always been really useful. But it didn’t map to more traditional principles that trust frameworks are built on. So we now got that mapping, we’ve got a set of traditional principles like data minimisation, privacy, security, and a set of user articulations on those principles around things like convenience, control, that enable a user view of the world and a ID ecosystem security, ethical view of the world to be mapped together to make sure actually, those principles are fulfilling user needs. So that’s an expanded section in the document that we’ve got at the moment.</p>
<p>We’ve also done quite a lot of work on roles. So we recognise the separate role of identity proofing provider, it’s just a specialist form of rules agent as we’ve created that in the trust framework. So all of that’s in there, as explained in the new framework. What we haven’t put in, or did debate quite a bit was the difference between centralised, decentralised and where federated fits. So we’ll be doing a subsequent piece of work in the trust framework working group to help explain those different terms of positioning to the market.</p>
<p>A lot of the questions I get from members, particularly new members are, what’s the difference between centralised, decentralised, distributed, and is federated the same as centralised? And it’s not. So we’ve done quite a bit of work on that already. It’s not ready for release just yet. But later in the year, we’ll be coming out with some views on, and hopefully clarity on, some of those terms to help the industry- to remove some industry confusion, because there’s quite a lot in the area at the moment.</p>
<p>Everything we do is members-driven, member-driven, so the need for clarity there is something our members are saying “Yeah, can you please sort this out and tell us properly what does distributed versus decentralised mean? Are they the same thing or different?” So that’s something we’re working on at the moment. So that’s something to watch out for. And you know, if you want to get involved in OIX, you can play a part in a definition of those, as well as the other things we’re working on around global interoperability. And we have a whole host of other working groups we’re just kicking off or continuing into 2022.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Well, this Trust Framework 2022 sounds super interesting. We’ll be following for sure. One more question for you, Nick. For all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Nick: So if you’re a business leader who is a consumer of an identity, a relying party, so if you, today, you run your own identity ecosystem to ID your customers, and are looking at moving to digital identity, then I would encourage you to start seriously thinking about getting ready for that now. Our getting ready paper is designed to help you understand what digital identity is all about, the benefits you’ll get as a business and what you should be looking for. And what you should be looking for is identity that comes from a trust framework, so that it has all the right rules, procedures, etc., around it that you can trust.</p>
<p>So a key thing we want at OIX is to try to help get that market going and help people understand what digital identity is. So if you’re a business leader in the relying party, please do have a look at that document and it’ll tell you a lot more about digital identity and what you should be looking for.</p>
<p>If you’re a business leader in the identity community, then start thinking intelligence. How can you install products that work for the user, not just user-centric, but the work for the user, help the user, assist the user? Because if we’re going to be successful, we’ve got to do that for the user, and got to make this easy. Because we know when things work for users they get adopted, when they work for the relying party, or they work for the ID provider or they work academically, they work from a security point of view. If they don’t work for the user, that’s all pretty academic. Make this work for the user to make it successful.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, I couldn’t agree more. And well, thanks a lot for this very interesting conversation and guiding us through the Trust Framework 2022, please let us know how people can follow the conversation with you or learn more about what OIX is doing.</p>
<p>Nick: Absolutely. So we’ve got the launch of that is on the third of February. So please look out for that on the OIX website. So the OIX website is <a href="https://openidentityexchange.org/members/anon/new.html?destination=%2Findex.html">www.openidentityexchange.org</a>. So please come along to that. There you can find the guides, there you can find the information about becoming a member if you’re not already a member, and information about the working groups we are looking at the moment, which I say include global interoperability, we’re taking a fresh look at fraud, we’re looking at can we get relying party adoption moving more quickly? So there’s a whole host of things we’re looking at in 2022, which I’m sure would be of interest. So reach out to me directly so it’s nick.mothershaw@openidentityexchange.org.</p>
<p>Oscar: Perfect. Well, thanks a lot again, Nick, and all the best.</p>
<p>Nick: Thank you Oscar. It’s pleasure to talk to you today. And yeah, really excited about what 2022 is going to bring. Thank you.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you. Bye-bye.</p>

<p>Introduction: NFTs On AERGO: Tapping Into A Multi-Billion Dollar&nbsp;Industry</p>NFTs Have Sold For Millions Of Dollars And Provide Artists With Outlets For Exposure, Networking And Monetary Valuation On Their&nbsp;Art<p>AERGO has been consistent in developments, whether it be surrounding technological innovations, partnerships and NFT development on the platform. Blocko XYZ, AERGO’s technology partner, has successfully incubated a project known as CCCV, a blockchain identity management platform that has enabled the utilization and creation of NFT’s within the AERGO ecosystem, specifically highlighted by major events within South Korea over the past year. As NFT’s are linked to their designated artists through unique serial numbers, CCCV amalgamates this notion with its unique blockchain identity management service that enables individuals to manage multiple accounts and identities based on NFT technology. NFT technology, as we have seen, is still in its infancy, but is garnering major traction from major media outlets, conglomerates and monetary payment entities throughout the world; AERGO and Blocko XYZ realized this notion, and CCCV has perpetuated the utilization and creation of NFTs on the AERGO platform through a variety of ways. As NFT’s garner mainstream attention, it is important to highlight the work AERGO has been doing to assist in that ethos of NFT expansion.</p><p>CCCV Sales: Adding AERGO As A Payment For&nbsp;NFT’s</p>Within CCCV, You Can Pay For NFTs With The AERGO Token, Alongside Ethereum<p>Utility is the calling-card of a projects longevity; hype may impact price extensively, but hype is a short-term trend, and as one hype-trend begins, it fades just as quickly. Utility is the vitality of a project, whether the market dictates it or not. CCCV has enabled the AERGO token to garner utility in regards to payment options for NFT’s, as NFT sales grow, specifically in South Korea, the use-case of AERGO and it’s utilization by NFT artists will inevitably grow with the tide as well. Although there are many different NFT marketplaces that exist within the realm of blockchain technology, it is far and few between where a mid-cap project garners partnerships with major media outlets that enable NFT exhibitions throughout South Korea. It is incumbent to mention the multitudes of offline NFT enthusiasts that have contributed to NFT exhibitions in South Korea, most notably, the offline NFT exhibition with one of the largest broadcasters in Korea MBC, which held the exhibition in an NFT based format. Provided under this paragraph are pictures from that very exhibition! It is far and few between where even some of the largest NFT marketplaces are able to garner the attention of massive media companies, but CCCV, the incubation project of Blocko XYZ, AERGO’s technology partner, has done just&nbsp;that.</p><p>The Korean President Election: NFT’s Of The Nominees On&nbsp;AERGO?</p>Coindesk Korea Has Recently Shared An Article Highlighting NFT Innovation From&nbsp;CCCV<p>CCCV has recently partnered with MaskDAO, an autonomous NFT marketplace, which, in partnership with CCCV, aims to create pre-election voting polls through NFT’s for each presidential nominee in South Korea. With electioneering, fraudulent ballots and human malevolence, NFT’s have garnered a major utility when it comes to the democratization of choosing incumbents for nations, CCCV and MaskDAO emphasize that idealism through conceiving of a pre-election poll through the utilization of NFTs. Through CCCV and MaskDAO, users can “pre-vote” in advance for their presidential nominee through NFTs. The lack of participation in elections conveys a serious problem for republicanism throughout the globe and South Korea isn’t clear from this threat. MaskDAO and CCCV created this initiative to incentivized users to participate in the voting process through a familiarized setting with a robust technology: NFTs. Through this tournament, statistics can be created and analyzed surrounding who will be the next president of South Korea; prediction isn’t necessarily fact, but, this can assist the voting process by understanding voting trends among a populace through the immutable innovation of NFTs. This initiative is extremely forward thinking and amalgamates a multi-billion dollar industry with elections, which need less tampering, as we have seen with numerous elections throughout the world; AERGO and Blocko understand such an ideal, of their own volitions.</p><p>A Comparision: Upbit And Bithumb NFT Marketplaces Versus&nbsp;AERGO</p>Utility Is A Broad Spectrum When It Comes To NFT’s, However, These Exchanges Perpetuate NFT Enthusiasm For Crypto Veterans, Not Every Day&nbsp;Artists<p>It is evident that Bithumb and Upbit are some of the largest exchanges in the world for digital asset exchanges; this will also hold true with their NFT marketplaces as well. Unfortunately, these exchanges have created a concept of exclusivity among crypto and NFT veterans where only those who’re tech savvy with blockchain and cryptocurrency exchanges can participate within these marketplaces. This notion can only go so far surrounding the perpetuation of NFT maturation. AERGO and CCCV have conceived of a paradigm for NFT artists and non-NFT artists alike that enables everyday mainstream people to involve themselves with NFTs through offline brick and mortar art exhibitions throughout South Korea. Inclusivity and the introduction of this technology to the people is an important ethos for the maturity of this market, and AERGO and Blocko clearly understand that notion in its entirety.</p><p>AERGO NFT’s Go Mainstream: CCCV And Maekyung Media&nbsp;Group</p>Founded In 1966, Maekyung Media Group’s Is One Of The Largest Mainstream Media Companies In South&nbsp;Korea<p>Blocko XYZ’s MOU with Maekyung Media Group cannot be overstated, this is a massive feat for a blockchain company to partner with a half-century old media company, and one of the largest mainstream media agencies in South Korea. Did you know that Maekyung Media Group, according to the World Economic Forum “operates a newspaper, a broadcasting network, a weekly and monthly magazine, and an electronic newspaper. It published a Korean-language business newspaper with a circulation of approximately 1.2 million; its television broadcast reaches 15 million users per-day.” <a href="https://www.weforum.org/organizations/maekyung-media-group">https://www.weforum.org/organizations/maekyung-media-group</a> Yes, the article highlights 15 million users per-day, that is the entire population of many small-mid size nations throughout the world, and Blocko XYZ has signed an MOU with this&nbsp;company.</p><p>On the 24th, Blocko XYZ signed an MOU with Maeil Economic Research Institute for blockchain NFT business cooperation, propelling NFT’s into the mainstream eye within South Korea. Through this mutual understanding, Blocko will assist in NFT technical support to the Maeil Economic Research Institute and the two companies plan to participate in multiple NFT related projects together. This synergistic relationships enables AERGO to conceive of connections with mainstream media outlets for future prospects surrounding NFT exhibitions, projects and collectibles exclusive to the AERGO platform, providing a unique value proposition for the network. Mainstream validity is what will drive the adoption of networks as the maturation of blockchain continues; NFT’s are no exception to such a clause and AERGO is solidifying its base within that paradigm.</p><p>Conclusion: Setting The Stage For NFT Adoption: AERGO And&nbsp;Blocko</p>Without Mainstream Validation, This Market Will Never Mature, NFTs&nbsp;Included<p>It’s far and few between where a mid-cap project has such connections with mainstream media outlets and governmental entities. AERGO stands out in this crowd through its technology partner, Blocko XYZ which has solidified an MOU with one of South Korea’s largest broadcasting agencies: this is no easy feat. In order for NFT’s to become more than just a trend, mainstream adoption must foster this industry and perpetuate its expansion. Through initiatives such as this, conceived of by Blocko XYZ, there is hope that NFT’s are more than just a trend. This is through AERGO’s and Blocko’s own volitions and ambition.</p><p>Disclaimer: NFT’s and cryptocurrency investing involves substantial risk, I am not responsible for your trades, do not invest more than you can afford to&nbsp;lose!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/of-aergos-volition-mainstream-partnerships-the-nft-af7dd0d91598">Of AERGO’s Volition: Mainstream Partnerships: The NFT</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 GiD Report#196 — How crypto is changing central&nbsp;banks <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-195-can-you-trust-your-million-dollar-nft-3c578fd8707">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The Fed finally publishes its paper on&nbsp;CBDCs  The web3 wars&nbsp;continue  Tweet of the week — IG NFT&nbsp;edition  Stuff happens   1. Better late than&nbsp;never The Federal&nbsp;Reserve<p>There are already <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/cbdctracker/">23 countries already experimenting with CBDCs or central bank digital currencies</a> — 9 of which have already officially launched, <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2021/11/15/na111621-five-observations-on-nigerias-central-bank-digital-currency">including Nigeria</a>. In China, WeChat <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/06/chinas-digital-currency-comes-to-tencents-wechat-in-expansion-push.html">recently integrated the country’s CBDC</a> bringing it to its billion plus user&nbsp;base.</p><p>Notably lagging is the U.S. When you’re the world’s reserve currency, there’s that much more at&nbsp;stake.</p><p>But last week, the Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/money-and-payments-discussion-paper.htm">finally published (after much delay) its paper</a> weighing the upside and potential challenges of introducing a digital dollar backed by the central&nbsp;bank.</p><p>On the positives, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/20/business/fed-digital-currency.html">from the NYTimes&nbsp;report</a>:</p><blockquote>Such a currency “could provide a safe, digital payment option for households and businesses as the payments system continues to evolve, and may result in faster payment options between countries,” the Fed release accompanying the discussion paper&nbsp;stated.</blockquote><p>Cross-border payments are particularly slow and expensive, relying on the correspondent banking&nbsp;system.</p><p>On to the challenges, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/20/business/fed-digital-currency.html">from the same&nbsp;report</a>:</p><blockquote>But the paper also noted that a central bank digital currency would raise policy questions, including about its effect on the financial sector, the cost and availability of credit, the safety and stability of the financial system and the efficacy of monetary&nbsp;policy.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Commercial banks, for their part, <a href="https://bpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Central-Bank-Digital-Currencies-Costs-Benefits-and-Major-Implications-for-the-U.S.-Economic-System.pdf">have been worried</a> that the creation of a central bank digital currency and Fed accounts could take away their deposit base and upend their business model. The paper probably does not address all their concerns, but may serve to calm worries that consumers could fully leapfrog the traditional banking&nbsp;system.</blockquote><p>It’s a particular challenge for an institution that has historically preferred a hands off and decentralized approach — outside of extraordinary circumstances. The average person often considers money creation the responsibility of the Fed, but that job is actually outsourced to banks through fractional reserve lending. By loaning out money they don’t have, banks create more money. (How the Fed sets interest rates impacts all of this, but you get my&nbsp;point.)</p><p>For the Fed, decentralization of money creation makes a lot of sense. Banks are better positioned to manage the risks of their customers and communities.</p><p>The same has been true of the digital dollar. Today, most of my dollars exist in digital form, managed by my bank’s centralized ledger.</p><p>Introducing its own CBDC flips that historical framework on its head with the Federal Reserve stepping in to take a far more outsized role in how money works today. Doing so without rocking the boat too much will be a top priority.</p><p>It’s also why the Fed was crystal clear in its paper that it had no plans to offer consumer accounts at the central bank, which would further step on banks’ toes. The NYTimes&nbsp;again:</p><blockquote>The Fed paper also seemed to slam the door on several possibilities — including the idea that a central bank digital currency could be created alongside consumer bank accounts at the Fed, <a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/SIL20449.pdf">something Democrats</a> and proponents of <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-issued-digital-dollar-could-print-money-for-the-people-174238842.html?guce_referrer=ahr0chm6ly93d3cuz29vz2xllmnvbs8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=aqaaabobubllw2plqobfnniatsw134z-654qygpll_odvlpdcnuofr4czpxjkfgb-w4b_-dfvcxxi9nlcmguzokco42iddyrqvych9vlc4fees61ebjkkgr_lysa-4rzafzdc1ci9-0xdtnaumzmjro32yh17l7xtbnh0dbckatcdoej">broader financial inclusion</a> have at times suggested.</blockquote><p>But as the Fed itself argues, the rise of crypto is already disrupting the system whether or not central banks decide to participate. Change is inevitable and it will be up to banks whether or not they sink or swim given the choices now available to consumers.</p><p>In that sense, crypto has always been a forcing function for innovation within a historically slow moving industry — just as platforms like PayPal, Venmo, and Square likely sped up the adoption of solutions like Zelle, which allowed customers to easily send money to each other (even across different bank ledgers).</p><p>Here’s the&nbsp;Fed:</p><blockquote>“A C.B.D.C. could spur innovation by banks and other actors and would be a safer deposit substitute than many other products, including stablecoins and other types of nonbank money,” the paper said. “These forms of nonbank money could cause a shift in deposits away from banks even without a C.B.D.C.”</blockquote><p>And just like that, the Federal Reserve has officially started the conversation.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/20/business/fed-digital-currency.html">Fed opens debate over a U.S. central bank digital currency with long-awaited report.</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/the-federal-reserve-is-open-to-creating-a-digital-dollar-5f332697-b3f5-4e59-b542-ab1f5ca79d3b.html">The Federal Reserve is open to creating a digital&nbsp;dollar</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/ceo-of-financial-services-giant-charles-schwab-calls-cryptocurrencies-hard-to-ignore/">CEO of Financial Services Giant Charles Schwab Calls Cryptocurrencies ‘Hard to Ignore’ — Blockworks</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/TravisXRP">/TravisXRP</a> — <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20220120a.htm">Federal Reserve Board releases discussion paper that examines pros and cons of a potential U.S. central bank digital currency&nbsp;(CBDC)</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-13/paypal-sued-for-freezing-customer-accounts-without-explanation">PayPal Sued for Freezing Customer Accounts Without Explanation</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/proposed-russian-crypto-ban-may-push-miners-west/?oly_enc_id=3914C9559689A4M">Proposed Russian Crypto Ban May Push Miners West — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-20/yuan-s-popularity-for-global-payments-hits-highest-in-six-years">Yuan’s Popularity for Global Payments Hits Highest in Six&nbsp;Years</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/TravisXRP">/TravisXRP </a>— <a href="https://www.oecd.org/daf/fin/financial-markets/Why-Decentralised-Finance-DeFi-Matters-and-the-Policy-Implications.pdf">OECD: Why Decentralized Finance Matters and the Policy Implications</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/chinas-tech-crackdown-geopolitics-us">China’s Tech Crackdown Is a Geopolitical Play</a>   2. The web3 wars&nbsp;continue <p>Speaking of ongoing conversations, the promises of web3 continue to command vigorous&nbsp;debate.</p><p>Let’s start with a disclaimer: When it comes to human problems, technology is never the solution; it’s always just a&nbsp;tool.</p><p>And as a tool, it’s always a double-edged sword.</p><p>The arrival of Spotify meant that anyone could call themselves a published musician. The reality is that a handful of global stars (along with Spotify) rake in the majority of revenues.</p><p>(Notably, this is also the case for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncsNZacfla0&amp;t=3s">tennis</a> and golf players. The point being — this isn’t a technology problem.)</p><p>Zooming out, you can see how this applies to the greater internet. The Worldwide Web promised to democratize information — and it did. Today’s web2 version of that same internet grapples with complex social and economic issues around misinformation/fake news, deplatforming, and Big Tech monopolies.</p><p>Early in the hype cycle, new technological frameworks promise to solve human problems. But reality is a bit more complicated.</p><p>Now that web3’s 2021 honeymoon period is over, a vibrant conversation is emerging around those very complications — ignited by <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473139010197508098">that juicy tweet from&nbsp;Jack</a>.</p><p>That conversation is only just beginning, but this week, we have <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/web3/">a post from NYU professor Scott Galloway’s No Mercy No Malice newsletter</a> (via /gregkidd).</p><p>And Scott pulls no&nbsp;punches:</p><blockquote>Preaching liberation while sequestering into gated communities is endemic to tech. The “personal” computer was going to free us from the grip of IBM’s dominance in mainframes, but it fell under the even greater control of Microsoft. Apple claimed to be a revolutionary fighting Big Brother, but it erected the greatest tollbooth for creativity in history (the App Store). “Information wants to be free” was the rallying cry of earlier web company managements trying to convince fawning, idiotic content companies to exchange their content for pennies on the&nbsp;dollar.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Web3 has different-colored hair, but the same DNA as earlier web paradigms, which decentralized services at an unprecedented scale to centralize wealth and influence at an unprecedented scale. Ninety-three percent of intentions and two thirds of decisions are influenced by two firms. Is that a good thing? Pro tip: Ask someone with teen girls. So far, web3 is&nbsp;web2.01.</blockquote><p>So is web3 the solution? No.</p><p>Is it a powerful&nbsp;tool?</p><p>Certainly.</p><p>Much like the conversation around a Federal Reserve backed CBDC, it’s a question of centralization versus decentralization and there’s still plenty to be hashed&nbsp;out.</p><p>Further reading:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a> — <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/web3/">Web3 | No Mercy / No&nbsp;Malice</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd </a>— <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/thatwastheweek/issues/moxie-has-moxie-975189">Moxie has&nbsp;Moxie</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a> — Moxie Marlinspike: <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">My first impressions of&nbsp;web3</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a> — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/18/business/dealbook/web3-venture-capital-andreessen.html">Tales From Crypto: A Billionaire Meme Feud Threatens Industry&nbsp;Unity</a>  Matt Levine — <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-10/web3-takes-trust-too">Web3 Takes Trust&nbsp;Too</a>  <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-web3-debate">The Web3&nbsp;Debate</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-11/signal-founder-marlinspike-gives-web3-nfts-an-emperor-s-new-clothes-moment">Web3 Just Had Its Emperor’s-New-Clothes Moment</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-19/washing-web3">Wash Your Meebits in&nbsp;Web3</a>   3.

<p>Il progetto consiste in una iniziativa sociale itinerante che ha come obiettivo principale l’attivazione facilitata e gratuita dell’identità digitale per cittadini, nell’ottica di orientare nella dimensione digitale coloro che ne potrebbero rimanere esclusi.</p>



<p>A seguito della pandemia globale che ha avuto inizio nel febbraio 2020, la necessità di utilizzare gli strumenti digitali per sopperire all’impossibilità di svolgere le più comuni operazioni amministrative o di interfaccia con la PA, ha fatto salire vertiginosamente il bisogno da parte di cittadini e imprese di dotarsi di mezzi quali ad esempio SPID; molti cittadini però corrono il rischio di essere tagliati fuori dal mondo del digitale, poiché l’accesso a queste risorse prevede un livello minimo di conoscenza della tecnologia e dei device non sempre posseduto da tutti.</p>



<p>Con il proposito di non lasciare nessuno indietro, è nata l’associazione di promozione sociale MigliorAttivaMente, che persegue lo scopo di favorire la “salita a bordo” del cittadino nella dimensione digitale del Paese, così da fruire telematicamente, senza sprecare tempo e risorse, dei servizi offerti da aziende e pubblica amministrazione; questa idea è nata durante la pandemia, mentre l’associazione ha preso vita nel 2021, ha già all’attivo numerose iniziative di interesse sociale e si appresta a compiere ulteriori importanti passi.</p>



<p>Il progetto “SPID in ogni dove” è un’importante iniziativa che ha l’obiettivo di dotare gli utenti meno avvezzi alla tecnologia della propria identità digitale, il tutto si svolgerà durante le tappe di un tour che vedrà coinvolta InfoCert come provider per l’attivazione facilitata e gratuita del servizio, il tutto avverrà grazie all’impegno degli InfoCert partners, InfoAss, Studio Eureka, TeamService, e Unappa che si adopereranno materialmente mettendo a disposizione i referenti che avranno il compito di attivare le identità digitali, &nbsp;MigliorAttivaMente invece si occuperà di coordinare le tappe del tour e far sì che quanti più utenti in difficoltà possano avere l’opportunità di accedere al servizio.</p>



<p>Al momento sono state scelte le città che saranno tappa del tour (Roma, Milano, Napoli, Palermo, Verona, Brescia, Reggio Emilia, Perugia, Rimini, Salerno, Monza, Tento, Pescara, Cagliari), il tour avrà inizio nella primavera 2022 e MigliorAttivaMente ha già iniziato ad ingaggiare i volontari dedicati al servizio di accettazione del cittadino, InfoCert, attraverso i propri partner, metterà a disposizione l’addetto al riconoscimento e ovviamente il servizio SPID; le location per ogni città sono ancora in fase di selezione, verranno comunicate tramite i canali di InfoCert e MigliorAttivaMente non appena ufficializzate.</p>

<p>Partnership will responsibly facilitate access to DeFi for global institutional investors and enterprises</p>



<p>TORONTO,&nbsp; January 25, 2022 – <a href="https://liquidmeta.io/">Liquid Meta Capital Holdings Ltd.</a> (the “Company” or “Liquid Meta”) (NEO:LIQD) a leading decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure and technology company, today announced a partnership with Civic Technologies, Inc. (“Civic”), a leading innovator in blockchain-powered digital identity solutions. Together, the companies will bring trusted, secure permissioned identity services to DeFi and enable Liquid Meta to provide capital liquidity to permissioned dApps. This will promote the overall adoption of DeFi.</p>



<p>“Liquid Meta’s mission is to build a bridge between Traditional Finance and Decentralized Finance,” said Jonathan Wiesblatt, CEO. &nbsp;“Our partnership with Civic Technologies will provide us with the enhanced capabilities and tools needed to expand upon this mission and to create an environment for traditional institutional investors to access this nascent and emerging industry in a more secure and trusted capacity.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The partnership is timely, given interest in DeFi from institutional investors. At its core, DeFi relies on permissionless access, but this principle often runs counter to the obligations of large capital investors that must know the counter-parties they are participating with in order to reduce counter-party risk. Permissioned access through the partnership will provide a gateway into DeFi for these investors. Liquid Meta is already providing liquidity to some of the most exciting Decentralized Applications and Exchanges in DeFi.</p>



<p>As the first publicly traded, pure-play liquidity mining operation in the world, Liquid Meta is building proprietary software and tools to access, automate and unlock tremendous growth within DeFi. The Company is focused on generating cash flow in the fast-growing DeFi segment of the blockchain industry.</p>



<p>“The team at Liquid Meta has a long history in the financial services industry, public capital markets and the crypto and technology industries. The leadership team is attuned to the operational rigor that institutional investors require in order to explore investments in new categories like DeFi,” said Chris Hart, CEO of Civic. “We can’t think of a better partner that’s more aligned with our mission to open the DeFi ecosystem to new investors through permissioned markets.”</p>



<p>Civic provides a KYC and KYB solution, through Civic Pass, that a dApp provider can use as an input to their compliance program. Liquid Meta will use Civic Pass to determine which participants meet a dApp’s rigorous standards for verification prior to allowing them the ability to trade. Civic Pass is seamlessly integrated into a dApp’s onboarding flow. Once an institutional investor has completed the Civic Pass screening process, the dApp will use the results of the screening to allow trading.</p>

<p>About Liquid Meta</p>



<p>Liquid Meta is a decentralized finance infrastructure and technology company that is powering the next generation of open-access protocols and applications. The Company is creating the bridge between traditional and decentralized finance while ushering in a new era of financial infrastructure that benefits anyone, anywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>CLIs are great. I love the speed and productivity increases I get when using a CLI, but memorizing commands – especially when commands need arguments, options, flags, and so on – can be daunting. Luckily, there are tools available for CLI fans out there, and one tool I’ve been enjoying is <a href="https://fig.io/">Fig</a>.</p>

 Fig powers up your CLI productivity 

<p>Fig adds autocompletion to supported terminals, which makes using CLIs so much easier. Using Git? You’ll see a small window pop up with different commands and options.</p>

<p></p>

<p>It’s a cool way to reinforce remembering Git command-line operations. But most of us use Git on a daily basis, so we probably have a good command… of our Git commands. 😳 Hilarious pun aside, the branch names in the context menu are pretty darn helpful.</p>

 Boosting the power of Okta CLI 

<p>How about when it’s a CLI that you might not use daily? This is where the autocompletion shines and really helps you power up!</p>

<p>We’re pleased to announce that <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a> autocompletion is available in Fig!  When you use a supported terminal, you’ll see hints to help you navigate through the commands and flags, so managing your Okta applications has never been easier.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The autocomplete context menu lists all the commands available and shows you which command requires an argument. The <code>okta start</code> command allows you to pass in a name, and you can see the optional argument at a glance.</p>

 Managing Okta apps 

<p>You may need to create Okta apps and get app configurations. When you need to create an Okta app, the Okta CLI helps you step through the process. However, if you are an Okta power user, you may be fine creating the Okta app in one shot by passing in the app settings. In this case, the Okta CLI autocomplete is pretty handy as it shows you all the options you can pass in!</p>

<p></p>

 Help is on the way! 

<p>Getting more detailed help information is easier too! The autocomplete context menu helps you navigate to the help output for a command. And yup, you can get help about the <code>help</code> command. Pretty meta, right?</p>

<p></p>

 Supported terminals for Okta CLI using Fig 

<p>Now that you’re excited, here’s the fine print. Fig currently only supports macOS. 😰  And only certain terminals and shells within macOS at that. Read <a href="https://fig.io/support/other/faq">Fig’s FAQ</a> for supported terminals and shells, as well as information for work support cross-platform and more terminal/shell integrations. Don’t forget to get on the waiting list for your OS or shell, or submit an issue so Fig knows how to prioritize future work.</p>

 Learn more 

<p>I hope this autocomplete feature helps you! I’d love to hear how you use Okta CLI and what tools you use to power up your terminal commands. We welcome issues and PRs in the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli">okta-cli GitHub repo</a> too.</p>

<p>In a post-pandemic world, food is not just our biggest challenge, but also our biggest opportunity for sustainable change.</p><p>The ways that food is produced, distributed and consumed have major negative impacts on people and the planet. Food production is the largest human pressure on Earth, causing a mass extinction of species, and accounting for 23% of annual greenhouse emissions. Food is at the core of various social justice challenges such as working conditions, access to affordable good food, cultural diversity and burgeoning food-related health crises of both malnutrition and obesity. This means that many of the broader environmental and social challenges can be addressed if the way that food is produced and managed is transformed. As Johan Rockström, Director of Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, said in&nbsp;2016:</p><blockquote>If we get it right on food, we get it right for both people and&nbsp;planet.</blockquote><p>Food transformations will require a series of fast and slow transitions over the next decades. The world’s governments have agreed on the UN Global Goals for 2030. Here in Sweden the country plans to have net zero emissions by 2045. However, neither the world nor Sweden are on track to achieve these goals, and with every day that passes, impacts accumulate and the challenges grow.</p><p>Food is essential and a source of great pleasure. A shared meal can be a ritual or celebration, and a simple everyday pleasure. Food is a rich and meaningful expression of our shared cultural diversity, and the way we make, distribute, and enjoy it, speaks loudly as to what we stand for as a society. Food can be a generator of wealth, in numerous forms, and its cultivation can restore ecological functions. Given that food is the strongest connection humanity has with the biosphere, that most of our food systems are productive but unequal, and that food cultures can either be enriching or destructive, transforming our global food systems represent both a grand challenge and a grand opportunity. If we are able to make a just transition to food cultures that restore the biosphere rather than degrade it, we will not only improve the lives of the world’s people, and enhance the biosphere, but also learn how to become better stewards of the&nbsp;Earth.</p><p>Sweden and other Nordic countries are well-positioned to lead the way in the global transformations towards sustainable food systems. It shares many of the world’s problems, while beginning to take action to address them. Current diets in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland and Finland are unhealthy, carbon intensive, and harm terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, both in the Nordics and elsewhere. About half the population in Nordic countries is overweight or obese, food waste is a major problem, and meat consumption is well above amounts recommended for health or sustainability.</p><p>Sweden is also taking action to change its food system. The Nordic region has world-class dietary guidelines, strict agricultural regulations and emerging innovations to food challenges. In Sweden, diverse innovations are taking place in farming, marketing, logistics and retail. Similarly, many cities, municipalities, and national government are working to develop policy to improve the food system, for both health reasons and environmental objectives. Furthermore, there is widespread public discussion, led in particular by chefs, to build on the success of the New Nordic cuisine <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-healthy-sustainable-and-just-swedish-and-planetary-food-system-3354b72461cb#_msocom_1">[PO1]</a> to create a cuisine that is good for both people and the planet, exploring how to reverse these recent trends towards greater meat consumption and increased environmental damage. As Nordic populations diversify, the various cuisines in the region are enriched accordingly. This means Sweden has the potential to lead global food system transformations.</p><p>The unequal and often unplanned impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic have highlighted many flaws and fractures in the fabric of everyday life, not least because it moves as a complex system, as opposed to respecting the way Sweden is organised within health, mobility, urbanism, security, governance and other sectors. We believe that the responses to COVID-19 on the Swedish food systems may reveal aspects of the resilience measures needed to meaningfully address the risks and opportunities facing Swedish food&nbsp;systems.</p><p>While some of the rapid responses of food system actors to COVID-19 might accelerate a ‘just transition’ towards sustainable and resilient food systems, others may impede it. To better navigate towards sustainability, we want to understand how responses to COVID either built or eroded resilience within the Swedish food system resilience, and whether these responses enhances or reduced the transformative capacities of the Swedish food systems. Such understanding can help us better align existing and future research and innovation activities, in order to enable a ‘just transition’ of Sweden’s complex food systems; systems not defined by its territorial boundaries but the planetary flows that it is interlinked with.</p><p>Transformations require significant changes in multiple dimensions of society. These changes must take place at different levels in society, from practices and behaviours, to rules and regulations, to values (financial and non-financial), and world-views. Transformation involves changing the relationships among people, but also profoundly changing the relationships between people and nature. History shows us that crises can create openings for transformation. But while positive societal transformations may arise from crises, the consequences of crises are often not positive. The risk is that opportunities created by the crisis are missed and that crisis response — despite good intentions and innovation — fail to address accumulated problems, and restore a slightly improved or a damaged status-quo. Navigating crises requires understanding of capabilities and capacities that are needed and then developing and mobilizing those capabilities and capacities for&nbsp;change.</p><p>Our project aims to learn from the current COVID-19 crisis and support the enabling of capacities for transforming towards Swedish food systems that promote the health, equity and sustainability of people and the planet. The project will identify and map risks and opportunities emerging in the Swedish food systems due to the COVID-19 pandemic through a co-creative process with public, private and civic food system actors. This process will develop understanding and articulate alternative pathways for food system transformations. It will do this through a Rapid Transition Lab.</p> Rapid Transition Lab <p>The Rapid Transition Lab will identify opportunities and pathways for Swedish food system actors to engage in a rapid transition, in response to the COVID-19 crisis. It will assess different strategies within the Swedish food systems, and support the design of more transformative strategies, practices, and institutions. Vinnova, the Swedish government’s innovation agency who fund this work, plans to connect the learning to multiple related stakeholders in and around policymaking and practice relating to food systems in&nbsp;Sweden.</p><p>The Rapid Transition lab will consist of a sensemaking and a futuring project and be structured around three overlapping phases: First, the project will build a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of and the responses to Covid-19 in the Swedish food systems. Second, based on these insights, existing food system scenarios, and through workshops engaging multiple stakeholders, the project will build transformative food system scenarios. In the third phase, the project will use these scenarios to identify strategies and pathways and possible portfolios of experiments for actors to contribute to the transformations of the Swedish food systems. These will be accomplished by developing a process of collective sense-making.</p>  Learning from the crisis to reframe food systems: By exploring the interconnected cascading risks and opportunities that have emerged from responses to COVID-19 and the 2018 drought in Sweden, in the context of Swedish food system transformations, we will create broader views of food systems and cultures.  Suggesting strategies to support the capacity building for transformations: Building exploratory scenarios, informed by the responses to the COVID-19 crises in the Swedish food systems, can reveal capacity-building strategies that might better enable transformations in the Swedish food systems. The scenarios, will build on previous and ongoing scenarios, to develop systemic, holistic and multidimensional scenarios that will be used to identify a portfolio of pathways and experiments.  Input into strategic policymaking and innovation practice: Key stakeholders in and around policymaking and practice relating to food systems in Sweden, will be engaged to actively contribute and learn from these exploratory processes. The analysis of the crisis, and development of the scenarios should be relevant to these stakeholders.  <p>The Rapid Transition Lab will be linked to other ongoing transdisciplinary food system projects that Vinnova or the Stockholm Resilience Centre lead or are partners in. These include MISTRA Food Futures, Nordic Food Policy Lab, Sustainable Finance Lab, and NorthWestern Paths. The Rapid Transition lab will complement these projects by focusing on the responses to Covid 19 pandemic in the Swedish food systems and use these to build scenarios that in turn will be used to develop transformation strategies and identify capacities for&nbsp;change.</p> Further reading <p>More on Nordic food system transformations can be found in four policy briefs from the SRC, <a href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2020-11-24-nordic-countries-are-well-suited-to-collaborate-on-food-systems-transformation.html">https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2020-11-24-nordic-countries-are-well-suited-to-collaborate-on-food-systems-transformation.html</a></p><p>What can the COVID-19 pandemic teach us about resilient Nordic food systems? <a href="http://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1450471/FULLTEXT01.pdf">http://norden.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1450471/FULLTEXT01.pdf</a></p> Who we&nbsp;are <p><a href="https://www.stockholmresilience.org/">Stockholm Resilience Centre </a>Stockholm Resilience Centre (SRC) is an international research centre on resilience and sustainability science.

  <p><a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt</a> calls itself the intuitive Vue framework. It aims to make a developer-friendly experience while not sacrificing performance or degrading the integrity of your architecture. It has been exciting to see the community and tooling around VueJS grow and evolve — there’s no better time to get started in this ecosystem than now.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will build a small web application that retrieves some posts from an API and displays them for authenticated users. For authentication, you will integrate Okta into your Nuxt application. Okta’s simple authentication system and the power of Nuxt means you can configure and set up your authentication in just a few moments.</p>

<p></p>

<p>What you’ll need</p>

 
   Your favorite IDE (I will be using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>) 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node.js</a> 
   An <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">Okta Developer Account</a> 
   The <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a> tool 
 

 Set up your Okta application 

<p>Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:3000/login</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:3000/</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:3000/</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/vue/create-okta-application/">Create a Vue App</a> for more information.</p>



 Build your web application with Nuxt 

<p>If you wish to follow along using the completed project you can <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-vue-nuxt-example">check out the GitHub repository here</a>.</p>

<p>Nuxt provides a scaffolding tool called <code>create-nuxt-app</code> to make scaffolding your application easy. You can run the following command to create the application:</p>

   <code>npx create-nuxt-app okta-vue-nuxt-example
</code>   

<p>Usually, task runners have several options. There are some important options you should take a look at while using this task runner.</p>
 
   Programming language: JavaScript 
   Package manager: Npm 
   UI framework: Bootstrap Vue 
   Nuxt modules: Axios - Promise based HTTP client 
 

<p>We will use Axios to fetch data in our application. Next, you can select the linting tool of your choice and a testing framework.</p>

 
   Rendering mode: Universal (SSR / SSG) 
   Deployment target: Server (Node.js hosting) 
 

<p>You can use the following commands to enter the project directory and run the application.</p>

   <code>cd okta-vue-nuxt-example
npm run dev
</code>   

<p>If you open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser, you will see the default Nuxt page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Nuxt project layout is pretty straightforward. First you have a <code>.nuxt</code> folder where your compiled server code will end up. Next there is a <code>components</code> folder. You won’t use the folder in this tutorial, but breaking pages into components is common practice in larger projects. These components are then reusable in a number of pages. Next you will find a <code>pages</code> folder where your pages will go. Your routes will be inferred by Nuxt from these views. The <code>static</code> folder is where you can house css, images, or other static content to display. The store directory contains your <a href="https://vuex.vuejs.org/">Vuex</a> store files.</p>

<p>You will also add a <code>layouts</code> folder later.  As you might have guessed, this folder will contain layouts. There are several other directories that are configured out of the box for Nuxt, including middleware, modules, plugins, and dist.  These are out of scope for this article but it is important to know they exist.</p>

<p>Finally, you will need two packages from npm. The first is <code>@nuxtjs/dotenv</code> which is a nuxt-friendly implementation of dotenv. You will use this to store sensitive information that you don’t want to end up in your source control.</p>

<p>Finally you will need <code>@nuxt/auth-next</code> to control your authentication.</p>

   <code>npm i @nuxtjs/dotenv@1.4.1
npm i @nuxtjs/auth-next@5.0.0-1637333559.35dbd53
</code>   

<p>With your dependencies installed it’s time to start building your application. First, add a new file to your root directory and name it <code>.env</code>, then add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>OKTA_DOMAIN=https://{yourOktaDomain}
OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourClientId}
</code>   

<p>Be sure to replace the placeholder variables with your actual Okta information.</p>

<p>Now open your <code>nuxt.config.js</code> file located in the root directory and replace its contents with the following code.</p>

   <code>export default {
  // Global page headers: https://go.nuxtjs.dev/config-head
  head: {
    title: "todolist-article",
    htmlAttrs: {
      lang: "en",
    },
    meta: [
      { charset: "utf-8" },
      { name: "viewport", content: "width=device-width, initial-scale=1" },
      { hid: "description", name: "description", content: "" },
      { name: "format-detection", content: "telephone=no" },
    ],
    link: [{ rel: "icon", type: "image/x-icon", href: "/favicon.ico" }],
  },

  // Global CSS: https://go.nuxtjs.dev/config-css
  css: [],

  // Plugins to run before rendering page: https://go.nuxtjs.dev/config-plugins
  plugins: [],

  // Auto import components: https://go.nuxtjs.dev/config-components
  components: true,

  // Modules for dev and build (recommended): https://go.nuxtjs.dev/config-modules
  buildModules: [],

  // Modules: https://go.nuxtjs.dev/config-modules
  modules: [
    // https://go.nuxtjs.dev/bootstrap
    "bootstrap-vue/nuxt",
    // Doc: https://axios.nuxtjs.org/usage
    "@nuxtjs/axios",
    "@nuxtjs/dotenv",
    "@nuxtjs/auth-next",
  ],

  /*
   ** Axios module configuration
   ** See https://axios.nuxtjs.org/options
   */
  axios: {},

  auth: {
    strategies: {
      okta: {
        scheme: "openIDConnect",
        endpoints: {
          configuration:  `${process.env.OKTA_DOMAIN}/oauth2/default/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`,
          logout: undefined,
        },
        clientId: process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
        grantType: "authorization_code",
        responseType: "code",
      },
    },
  },
  // Build Configuration: https://go.nuxtjs.dev/config-build
  build: {},
};
</code>   

<p>The first thing this file does is make use of dotenv. It registers the modules you added earlier through the task runner and via npm. Finally, it sets up the options for your OAuth configuration. Here is where you use the environment variables that you set up in your <code>.env</code> file.</p>

<p>You should note the line of code that reads <code>logout: undefined</code>. It is critical for logging the user out correctly, because Okta requires the <code>idToken</code> to be passed as a query parameter. However, <code>nuxt-auth</code> won’t include that parameter under the hood. The solution is to override the logout URL obtained from the configuration endpoint with <code>undefined</code> and manually log the user out in your page file. You will implement this shortly.</p>

<p>To use the OAuth configuration properly, Nuxt requires you to add a file to the <code>store</code> folder called <code>index.vue</code>. You can leave this file empty, but it must exist for Nuxt to use it. If you do not have a <code>store</code> folder, create one now and add a blank <code>index.vue</code> file to it.</p>

 Add your Nuxt pages 

<p>Now, you can start adding pages to your application. Nuxt builds your routes by looking in the <code>pages</code> folder. You can read more about Nuxt’s custom routing in their <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Before working on your pages you should set up your layout. Add a new folder called <code>layouts</code> to the project directory and add a file called <code>default.vue</code>.</p>

<p>This file, and all of the views in this project, will use the Vue template syntax. Vue templating is very similar to most other template syntaxes. It relies heavily on the <code>v-bind</code> HTML attribute to handle events or bind attribute values. You can handle events with the <code>v-on</code> syntax, which can be short handed to <code>@</code>, such as <code>@click="doSomething"</code>.  The <code>b-*</code> components are from the <code>Bootstrap Vue</code> library that should have been installed via the npx task runner.</p>

<p>The layout page will display the headers and footers and incorporate some branching logic to determine if a user should see a <code>login</code> or <code>logout</code> button. It also contains some common CSS and JavaScript that will be needed on each page that uses the layout. The <code>&lt;nuxt /&gt;</code> element on this page will act as a placeholder for the code on your page. Nuxt will render your page code in this section.</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;b-container&gt;
      &lt;b-navbar toggleable="lg" type="dark" variant="info"&gt;

          &lt;a href="https://www.okta.com/" target="blank"&gt;Okta&lt;/a&gt;, Written by
          &lt;a href="https://profile.fishbowlllc.com" target="blank"&gt;Nik Fisher&lt;/a
          &gt;.
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;/b-container&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      loggedIn: this.$auth.$state.loggedIn,
      year: new Date().getFullYear(),
    }
  },
  methods: {
    logout() {
      this.$auth.logout();
    },
    login() {
      this.$auth.loginWith('okta').then(result =&gt; window.location = "/Dashboard");
    }
  },
}
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;style scoped&gt;
.fluid-container.footer &gt; *:last-child {
  margin-bottom: 0px;
  color: #fff;
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</code>   

<p>You will also need a basic landing page that isn’t under authentication. Your landing page will give some information about the application. It will also contain a redirect for authenticated users to route them to the <code>Dashboard</code> page.</p>

<p>Open the <code>index.vue</code> page in the <code>pages</code> directory and replace the code with the following.</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id="page-content"&gt;
    &lt;b-jumbotron
      style="margin-top: 5vh"
      header="Lets Get Some Posts"
      lead="A Simple App with Nuxt and Okta"
    &gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For more information visit their websites&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;b-button variant="primary" href="https://nuxtjs.org/" target="blank"
        &gt;Nuxt&lt;/b-button
      &gt;
      &lt;b-button
        variant="outline-primary"
        href="https://www.okta.com/"
        target="blank"
        &gt;Okta&lt;/b-button
      &gt;
    &lt;/b-jumbotron&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
export default {
  beforeMount() {
    if (this.$auth.$state.loggedIn) window.location = '/Dashboard'
  },
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>Next, you can add the <code>Dashboard</code> page. This page makes use of the <code>data()</code> webhook to get some data from a server using Axios, which it then displays in a table. The <code>Dashboard</code> page also makes use of the <code>auth</code> middleware to enforce authentication on this page. When a user attempts to hit this page, they will be rerouted to your login page if they are not authenticated.</p>

<p>Add a new file to the <code>pages</code> folder and name it <code>dashboard.vue</code>. Copy the following code into your <code>dashboard.vue</code> file.</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;b-table :items="posts" :fields="fields"&gt; &lt;/b-table&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
import Vue from 'vue'
export default Vue.extend({
  middleware: ['auth'],
  data() {
    return {
      fields: ['userId', 'title', 'body'],
      posts: [],
    }
  },
  async beforeMount() {
    this.$axios
      .$get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts')
      .then((res) =&gt; {
        this.posts = res
      })
      .catch((err) =&gt; {
        console.log(err)
      })
  },
})
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>Finally you will need to add the login page where Nuxt will route unauthenticated users. Add a new page to the <code>pages</code> folder named <code>login.vue</code>. Add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>&lt;template&gt;
  &lt;div id="page-content" class="p-4"&gt;
    &lt;a class="btn btn-primary" @click="$auth.loginWith('okta')"&gt;Login with Okta &lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/template&gt;


&lt;script&gt;
export default {
  middleware: ['auth'],
  data() {
    return {}
  },
  beforeMount() {
    if (this.$auth.$state.loggedIn) window.location = '/Dashboard'
  }
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

 Testing your Nuxt application 

<p>Now that your application is complete you can run <code>npm run dev</code> from your terminal and the application will build. You should see the home page first.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click on Dashboard or Login and this should route you to the Okta login form. You can enter your Okta credentials here and you will be routed to the <code>Dashboard</code> page where you can view the posts.</p>

<p></p>

 Do more with Nuxt and Vue 

<p>With a little bit of code, you can combine Nuxt and Okta to make secure Vue SPAs or universal applications. You can find the source code for the example created in this tutorial <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-vue-nuxt-example">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>In this post, you learned how to use the <code>@nuxt/auth-next</code> package to secure your Nuxt application using Okta. You also learned how to create the application in Okta and configure the Vue app to use it. Finally, you learned how to use the <code>@nuxtjs/axios</code> package to pull data from a sample API.</p>

 During this conversation, we discuss: 
 
 
 
 
 Where are the opportunities to apply SSI principles and frameworks towards DAOs? 
 
 
 How do you decentralize hiring, education, and the coordination of work. 
 
 
 Are .eth good or bad identifiers? Are .eth names and decentralized identifiers (DIDs) mutually exclusive? 
 
 
 How can the decentralized discovery of professional skills happen? 
 
 
 
 And more! 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Related Content</p>
<p>DAOs will offer more interesting opportunities to workers to contribute towards meaningful work. And SSI will allow workers to build up a verifiable portfolio of knowledge and skillsets, which can be used to participate in more and more opportunities through DAOs.</p>

<p>People are happier when their work has meaning and when they can associate with peers who share similar beliefs and values. But in the face of new challenges stemming from the pandemic — everything from the shift to remote work to closures of schools and daycare centers — many people began to question the validity of their career as their identity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Internet has provided us with many&nbsp;ways to discover and join likeminded communities that we can interact with. Take Reddit for example—there over one million subreddits that exist today with almost 48 million monthly active users (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/443332/reddit-monthly-visitors/">Statista</a>). You can find a niche community to join for almost any topic — and if you don’t find one you can create one yourself.</p>
<p>The web3 world takes this concept a bit further by adding economic incentives for community members to contribute. One of the earliest dreams for Ethereum was to enable “Decentralized Autonomous Organizations” (DAOs).</p>
<p>Because Ethereum enables anyone to write arbitrary rules in code, we can use those rules to design organizational or governance systems that allow groups of people to jointly make decisions through voting or other mechanisms.</p>
<p>While DAOs have existed on Ethereum since 2016, these early experiments were more science project-like rather than real product.</p>
<p>But the DAO ecosystem had a breakout moment in 2021. A simple but workable tech stack came together to enable existing DAOs to get things done, and new entrants pushed the boundaries of what a DAO can be and who can be a part of one.</p>
<p>I personally regained interest in DAOs in 2021 as I saw many opportunities to use self-sovereign identity (SSI) frameworks and principles towards unlocking further growth for decentralized systems.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sgershuni">Stepan Gershuni</a>&nbsp;and I started talking about the&nbsp;intersection of SSI and DAOs&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="https://northernblock.io/economics-of-self-sovereign-identity/">Episode #9 — Economics of Self-Sovereign Identity and the Future of Cryptoeconomics</a>&nbsp;— and once again in&nbsp;<a href="https://northernblock.io/daos-and-ssi/">Episode #16 — How DAOs Benefit from Self-Sovereign Identity</a>.</p>
<p>As 2021 was coming to a close, the number of unique monthly voters who participated in DAOs exploded. Today, there are hundreds of DAOs that see daily activity from members, pay members, build products, and vote on the use of shared funds. Collectively DAOs on Ethereum govern assets worth more than $16 billion.</p>
<p>One of the new DAOs that recently has caught my attention is the&nbsp;<a href="https://ens.domains/">Ethereum Name Service (ENS)</a>. In a nutshell, ENS is a name and lookup service built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows crypto users to translate their machine-readable addresses to human-readable addresses. Think of it as an&nbsp;identifier&nbsp;for public Ethereum addresses, aiming to make crypto more accessible. So rather than sending someone tokens by using their public key (e.g., 0x400668a22A85aac272608004130fp26E8e853eBD), I can use their nickname.eth address.</p>
<p>And if you use Twitter at all, you’ll probably also notice the trend where people in are placing their ‘.eth’ in their names. Again, to show allegiance/association to a community of people who share some similar values and beliefs.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) has seen breakout growth, growing to hundreds of thousands of users, hundreds of integrations, and a new DAO community treasury ($1.9B) to fund continued development of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>I started questioning how&nbsp;.eth identifiers compared to decentralized identifiers (DIDs) — DIDs being the most critical element in achieving digital self-sovereignty (for those unfamiliar with SSI).</p>
<p>Although&nbsp;.eth names can enhance user experiences for crypto users, it doesn’t add any privacy benefits that DIDs do. If you broadcast your&nbsp;.eth address like Shaq did, then the whole world can view your financial transactions. That’s simply the open and transparent nature of permissionless public blockchains like Ethereum.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There seems to be use cases for both types of identifiers (.eth names and DIDs) and they aren’t mutually exclusive from each other. However, I feel that at times the web3 space tries to apply blockchain to their use cases without understanding the core properties needed for their use case. For example using&nbsp;.eth names or NFTs as identifiers.</p>
<p>These are important conversation to keep having and I think the one here with Stepan starts to explain how different types of identifiers can not only co-exist, but reap value from each other.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The existing self-sovereign identity (SSI) frameworks are mature, more privacy-preserving and don’t force any specific technologies. For one, it they live on a specific blockchain. SSI gives people the properties of verifiability, control, portability, privacy and a slew of other ones that are important to achieve digital sovereignty.</p>
<p>I continue to strongly believe that the intersection of SSI and web3 will be extremely powerful and change the future of work.</p>
<p>DAOs will offer more interesting opportunities to workers to contribute towards meaningful work. And SSI will allow workers to build up a verifiable portfolio of knowledge and skillsets, which can be used to participate in more and more opportunities through DAOs.</p>
<p>There remains work to be done to bring SSI frameworks to the web3 space. There are some early stage projects like <a href="https://www.deepskills.io/">Deep Skills</a> attempting to do so. But as these become more mature and unlock supplies of verifiable data, people will have so much freedom and flexibility to work on passion projects.</p>
<p>To conclude this post, I want to share 5 ideas that this latest podcast conversation with Stepan has me thinking about:</p>
 
 Idea 1 — People are happier when their work has meaning and can associate with peers who share similar beliefs and values. DAOs provide opportunities to pick and choose your work communities. DAOs are open and transparent, making it easy to do your due diligence before joining one. It’s tough to truly know a corporation runs until you join it. 
 Idea 2— DAOs aren’t bound to geographical constraints or corporate policies. You can work on a DAO from anywhere in the world. You can also work on many DAOs from anywhere. 
 Idea 3— Contributing 5 hours per week of meaningful work will likely create more value than contributing 40 hours of non-meaningful work (e.g., one of the most meaningful contributors to Wikipedia does it as a side gig (<a href="https://northernvirginiamag.com/culture/culture-features/2021/11/24/steven-pruitt-wikipedia/">here</a>)) 
 Idea 4— DAOs can scale much quicker than corporations. There exists a lot of administrative overhead to onboard new talent to a corporation (e.g., register employee with government, set up payroll, etc.) — that overhead doesn’t exist in DAOs. 
 Idea 5— There is an oversupply of talent looking to join DAOs. There is an undersupply of talent available for almost every type of corporation. Corporations don’t have enough of a pipeline of talent, while DAOs are trying to figure out how to onboard the large available talent pools effectively.

<p>This week is a quiet one for news. But if you’re a developer; the following few changes are important ones!</p> holochain-conductor-api → holochain-client-js <p>After a discussion both inside the team and with key developer community members, the name of the JavaScript conductor client has been changed. Everyone feels this better reflects its purpose as a client library for the conductor admin and app APIs.</p><p>The GitHub repo can now be found at <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js">https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js</a>, and the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/client">NPM package</a> is now called <code>@holochain/client</code>.</p><p>Of course, this is a breaking change, and you’ll need to update your <code>package.json</code> file in any project that uses this library.</p><p>If you’re a Rust front-end developer, there’s a package for you as well on <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-rust">GitHub</a>. If you’re working on a different front-end language and are building a conductor client library for it, we’d love to tell other developers about it!</p><p>Finally, the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/happ-client-call-tutorial">hApp client call tutorial</a> has been updated to use the new NPM package name (and has been updated to work with Holochain 0.0.119 and newer too).</p> Holochain 0.0.123: unified zome calling <p>The only breaking change with this release is that <code>call_remote</code> has been merged into <code>call</code> in the host API, and the signature has changed (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1180">#1180</a>). If your hApp accesses the host API directly, you’ll need to refactor your code. If you use the HDK instead, the <code>call</code> function’s <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.119/hdk/p2p/fn.call.html">signature has changed</a> too. The <code>call_remote</code> function is still available and the signature hasn’t changed, but you will need to recompile your zome against HDK 0.0.119 if you use it.</p><p>A network-level bug has also been fixed (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1181">#1181</a>).

 New Value Flows: Impact modelling and Financing neighbourhood retrofit, v0.1 <p>This is part of <a href="https://www.notion.so/darkmatterlabs/TransCap-x-CivicValue-x-CommCap-WeekNotes-4e4acb5764af4e749d6463b097d3c0f4">a series of Weeknotes</a> as part of our TransCap x CivicValue x CommCap exploration. We have republished it here in our Provocations to spark a conversation on how we can rethink value flows in neighbourhood-level climate transitions.</p><p>Neighbourhoods are facing an imminent need to transition for climate change and deal with deep-seated issues of fuel poverty and other injustices. One of the most intractable challenges is the financial cost-benefit balance in undertaking a neighbourhood retrofit programme.</p><p>Under current conventional approaches, the comprehensive range of benefits and co-benefits projects generated are often unaccounted for, with the result being some projects being deemed (reductively) unviable investments, or worse, a liability. For example, as we have seen in our TreesAI project, <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/trees-as-infrastructure-1dd94e1cfedf">urban trees are often seen as costs to municipalities, rather than value-creating natural assets</a>, a logic that justifies trees being removed rather than nurtured.</p><p>Dark Matter Labs’ approach to the TransCap x CommCap project is based our working hypothesis, ‘Transitioning Together’, which aims to lay the framework of a system that puts streets and neighbourhoods in the driving seat of their climate transition, empowering residents to be able to sense-make, deliberate, implement, and access financing for their neighbourhood’s climate transition projects.</p><p>A fundamental part of our hypothesis is about rewiring value flows in order to make these community-driven climate transitions possible. This includes an alternative approach that attempts to account for a project’s benefits and co-benefits in a comprehensive, efficient and holistic way. This also includes wiring a project’s revenue and financing to its impact as a way of incentivising the maximisation of benefits.</p><p>While the community will be the primary beneficiary of climate transition, there will be other stakeholders/actors who too will co-benefit: such as public or philanthropic bodies who may have their liabilities reduced, nearby property-owners who may benefit from land value uplift, or local businesses that may benefit from revenue uplift. By putting in place mechanisms (e.g. <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2?gi=54aae78dd38b">Smart Covenants</a> or outcome-buying contracts / social impact bonds) to capture these co-benefits, we would provide a long-term revenue source that can shift the cost-benefit balance in favour of doing these necessary projects, and also provide a framework for stakeholders to invest in outcomes-based preventative measures to reduce their liabilities (such as investing in housing retrofit, rather than spending on healthcare system costs for dealing with the health consequences of substandard, unhealthy homes).</p>The Transitioning Together model so far: revenues from captured co-benefits replenish a city-wide evergreen fund that funds community-driven climate transition projects. Initial experiments in value modelling <p>As part of our work developing this model, Dark Matter Labs and Civic Square are engaging with the community of Link Road (in Edgbaston, Birmingham) as a pioneer community for this approach. Based on data from the tangible, real-world context of this neighbourhood in Birmingham, we have taken a first attempt at creating this value model that represents a climate transition project’s costs, comprehensive estimates of its various benefits and co-benefits, and also the potential for these co-benefits to be captured.</p><p>Some questions that are beginning to emerge from this work&nbsp;include:</p>  Is this model based on rewiring value flows and capturing co-benefits viable for funding community-driven climate transition projects?<br>In particular, we want to find out the approximate scale of the potential revenues that could derive from capturing co-benefits, and how they compare to the costs of a&nbsp;project.  Is it possible to quantify and model the comprehensive set of co-benefits being created by climate transition projects?<br>For each type of climate transition project, it is necessary to develop an understanding of the types and quantities of (co-)benefits being generated, from the perspectives of the resident, a co-beneficiary, and an investor — is there enough research to allow this to be estimated, and how can we avoid double-counting?  How can qualitative co-benefits be accounted for in the model?<br>While capturing co-benefits and outcomes requires some degree of quantification, how they are metricised and captured opens up a space for contestation. More critically, we are reflecting on how qualitative benefits can be factored into the&nbsp;model.  How do we model the value that is created beyond the projects themselves?<br>Value created by such an approach can exist beyond the projects themselves: for example, the capacity a community develops and experience they gain after successfully implementing their first project can unlock further, more ambitious projects — this has ‘sequential’ value. The coexistence of multiple projects in a neighbourhood can also create a ‘systemic’ value that is greater than the sum of its parts. How can we account for these in the&nbsp;model?  Finally, are there any ethical risks of financialisation civic or public value, including any perverse incentives created by doing so? This work also represents a transition from a model of centralised state taxation and spending, where the creation of civic value, captured or not, is considered part of the state’s remit. While this model has both its opportunities and risks, we must also consider the new set of opportunities and risks by taking a more decentralised approach to civic value creation.   Value modelling approach Diagram showing the components of the interactive value&nbsp;model.<p>The structure of our initial value model is set out in the diagram above: the model is designed to take several global inputs (e.g. assumptions on inflation, the investment horizon, base interest rate, etc.). The model also allows the selection of a portfolio of different types of civic assets and climate transition projects (e.g. home energy efficiency retrofit, urban agriculture, community-owned PV energy generation, etc.), and the scale of the project (e.g. number of homes retrofitted, m2 of gardens used for growing, m2 of PV panels, etc.). Based on these inputs, the model calculates for each civic asset/project:</p>  Costs: This calculates the upfront and ongoing costs of building and operating the project, based on fixed costs and costs that scale per unit of the&nbsp;asset.  Impacts/benefits generated: This calculates the impacts generated over a comprehensive set of factors quantified in their natural units (tonnes of carbon emissions prevented and/or sequestered, health outcomes improved through no. of avoided hospitalisations/deaths, no. of employment opportunities created, litres of stormwater retained, no. of households brought out of fuel poverty, etc.) The calculations use assumptions based on local statistics and review of academic literature, and is part of our ongoing work to refine and test these calculation methods through further research.  Revenues: This calculates the revenues generated over a comprehensive set of factors quantified in the local currency (GBP) — this includes direct revenues such as one-off or annual grants, but also potential revenues from spillover value capture. The spillover capture calculation takes each benefit generated and identifies third party liability holders who may see potential liability reductions and therefore cost savings. A percentage of these estimated cost savings can be captured as a revenue source for the project, to be negotiated with these liability holders as potential ‘outcome buyers’ (for example, the local NHS Clinical Commissioning Group may pay for the outcome of reduced cold weather hospitalisations from home retrofit, based on a percentage of savings from costs of x fewer patients not going to A&amp;E per&nbsp;year).  <p>These cost, impact, and revenues calculations will then be aggregated across the entire portfolio, giving an idea of financing requirements and potential investment returns. We are still reflecting on how secondary value, such as the ‘sequential value’ and ‘systemic value’ described above can be incorporated into the model’s current working form. Double-counting remains challenging to disentangle, especially in areas such as the mutually linked nature of physical and mental health outcomes.</p> A version 0.1 of our&nbsp;model <p>We have created a first attempt of the model based on the logic above in a spreadsheet. The estimates for costs, impacts, and revenues in this version are ‘back of the envelope’ calculations based on common sense assumptions and high-level research we have done so far. This model will be further developed as part of our next stage of work, as the types of impacts modelled are expanded, and deeper research is done to quantify and predict these impacts with more rigour. We have tried to make this modelling as tangible as possible by basing the modelling on the real-world location of Link Road, Birmingham, where Dark Matter Labs and Civic Square are working with a group of residents to test this approach.</p>Main dashboard of the interactive model, with current work being done to replace placeholder figures with more research.<p>The main interface of the model is the dashboard, which gives an overview of the neighbourhood climate transition portfolio, and the whole portfolio’s estimated costs, impacts and revenues. The dashboard allows global inputs, such as investment horizon and the assumed annual inflation rate. The dashboard also allows different civic assets/climate transition projects to be included as part of the neighbourhood portfolio, and the scale of those assets (e.g. no. of homes retrofitted, m2 of urban agriculture, etc.). By changing these inputs to model different scenarios, the user of this modelling tool, whether it is the residents themselves or their advisors, can experiment and find an ideal portfolio of projects that work for their vision of their neighbourhood, and test its viability both in financial terms and the benefits/impacts the community is&nbsp;seeking.</p><p>Beyond the dashboard, each civic asset will have its own page with a more detailed breakdown of the capital and operating costs, its impacts and co-benefits, and also potential both one-off and recurring direct revenues (e.g. government grants/subsidies) and revenues from captured spillover values, with the calculated values updated based on the scale of the asset, and also global inputs. In this version 0.1 of our model, we have begun to build out these costs, impact and revenue models for an average home retrofit (up to EPC C rating), with the ambition to refine the model with more research and sophisticated modelling methods.</p> Financial modelling assumptions and findings: <p>The key assumptions on the cost side&nbsp;are:</p>  Cost per home of retrofitting the home: This is the most significant variable and will depend on characteristics and size of existing home, lifestyle of occupants, target improvement levels and the local supply chain. The literature appears to include a wide range of costs. Most helpful for Link Road are probably the actual average costs incurred through the BEIS supply chain pilots which were mainly undertaken on owner-occupied ‘early adopters’ seeking to do whole-house retrofits. This ended up costing in the region of £20-£25k per home. We acknowledge that some homeowners would be comfortable with improving to EPC C and including a low/zero carbon heat source such as an Air-Source Heat Pump (ASHP). Therefore we’ve assumed a total cost of around £20k per home for this work, but acknowledge that it could be more expensive.  We have factored in operating/maintenance costs as a overall percentage of the capital costs, acknowledging that at regular periods and the end of the horizon (e.g. 30 years), the buildings and their retrofitted work may need to undergo periodic maintenance and upgrades. We hope to make this more granular depending on the type of intervention in future versions of the&nbsp;model.  Our <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/retrofit-building-back-better-d0ce9921840a">approach to deep retrofit</a> beyond the individual house means we should consider improving the streetscape and open spaces as part of retrofit. In our model, we have treated public realm improvements as a separate civic asset. These costs tend to be modest in comparison with the domestic improvements.  <p>Key assumptions on the revenue&nbsp;side:</p>  Energy savings are hard to quantify as again they depend on the home, occupants and selected level of comfort. We have used high-level <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/932403/prs-epc-c-consultation-stage-ia.pdf">government assumptions</a> around improving to EPC level C saving around £220 per household per year. This could be an underestimate especially given rising energy costs. These can be capitalised at a suitable discount rate and a reasonable life-cycle of the elements installed to achieve these outcomes.  Carbon emissions avoided are also based on the same government assumptions, approximately 1.69 tonnes of carbon per house per year. Although these emissions reductions are not all currently traded, there is a potential for this to be financialised beyond the existing ETS system — we have used the current (possibly underpriced) value of carbon in the UK ETS market as a conservative indication of a potential source of revenue. This is subject to change based on the carbon intensity of the grid, the price of carbon, and other regulatory changes in emissions trading.  We have also started to estimate other outcomes. These include social outcomes (e.g. fuel poverty alleviation), health outcomes (e.g. excess winter mortality, respiratory hospitalisations), and environmental outcomes (e.g. reduction of NOx emissions), with more in the pipeline. These are high-level back-of-envelope estimations using data as specific to the context (Link Road / Birmingham / West Midlands / UK) as possible. We are also in the process of reviewing approaches of modelling precedents, such as the <a href="https://www.c40knowledgehub.org/s/article/The-Multiple-Benefits-of-Deep-Retrofits-A-toolkit-for-cities?language=en_US">C40 Cities model</a>, <a href="https://www.greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk/what-we-do/research/research-cost-benefit-analysis/">GMCA’s Unit Cost Database</a>, or the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/energy-models/models/hideem">UK Government’s HIDEEM model</a>, as a way of informing our own modelling methodology.   Emerging findings &amp; next&nbsp;steps <p>The model is preliminary and requires substantial development as part of the second stage of work. The following points are findings that are beginning to&nbsp;emerge.</p>  Energy savings make the biggest contribution in the average household. This range could be around 15–30% of up front costs depending on capitalisation assumptions, modelled savings, lifestyle and poverty of household etc. At the time of writing, energy costs are rising and there is a general expectation that OFGEM will increase the tariff cap. Without further intervention this will result in greater fuel poverty, but will further strengthen the case for using energy savings as part of the&nbsp;model.  Carbon emissions savings (if traded) makes up around 10–20% of the up front capital if this can be realised. Alternative avenues beyond the ETS system should be considered as a way of realising the value of these emission&nbsp;savings.  The potential revenue from other spillover values such as health appear to be small based on the first tranche of research. However, we are seeing in some implemented projects, such as Warm Homes Oldham which is co-funded by the local public health service, <a href="http://shura.shu.ac.uk/15738/">where estimated savings to public healthcare are on a comparable scale to energy savings</a>. This requires further exploration and verification and does not rule out the viability of capturing these spillover values when they are aggregated across neighbourhoods and considered at a city scale (as proposed by the Transitioning Together model). This means that the contractual, technological and other mechanisms to allow this value capture would have to be tested at a small scale, albeit with negligible returns, in order for this to be scaled. This would also help us understand if the returns on these values can be efficiently measured and distributed.  <p>We are now entering the Strategic Design phase of the project. This has a number of strands. For the impact and finance workstream we&nbsp;will:</p>  Refine and test the assumptions and modelling approach.  Improve our understanding of the scale at which different elements of the model would work best, both in terms of any internal cross-subsidy required, but also in terms of efficiency.  Shortlist the liability holders and commence discussions with them, to test the political viability of outcome contracting.  Build a legible, user-friendly model that can be used in engagement with residents and other stakeholders  <p>We’ll be posting further updates of our progress as the work progresses.

   A digital wallet is a software program designed to keep your digital assets safe and secure. It can be used to store cryptocurrencies, verifiable credentials, and&nbsp;more.  These digital wallets can be broadly categorized into custodial and non-custodial wallets, depending on the level of control you have over your wallet. Specifically, this categorization is based on who stores the private keys

<p>A <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">digital wallet</a> is a software program designed to keep your digital assets safe and secure. It can be used to store cryptocurrencies, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/verifiable-credentials-in-bens-serendipity-b9acfa10f131">verifiable credentials</a>, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>These digital wallets can be broadly categorized into custodial and non-custodial wallets, depending on the level of control you have over your wallet. Specifically, this categorization is based on who stores the private keys of your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Before we jump into the differences, let’s recap how wallets work. Note that in this article, we will look only at <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/an-in-depth-exploration-of-self-sovereign-identity-and-verifiable-credentials-1a3eb2296004">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> wallets that store your <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/how-to-implement-driving-license-use-case-using-verifiable-credentials-cef928222c92">verifiable credentials</a>.</p> Working of an SSI&nbsp;Wallet <p>Any credential such as your name, age, address, educational qualification, work experience, etc. can be issued in a digital format known as a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credential (VC)</a>. The obvious advantage of such a credential is that it is highly portable, easy to share, machine-verifiable, secure, and tamper-proof because it is cryptographically signed.</p><p>Here, “cryptographically-signed” means <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/role-of-public-key-cryptography-in-self-sovereign-identity-8c2dc37a2bf3">Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI)</a> is used to secure the information contained in a VC, to prevent it from unauthorized viewing or tampering. The PKI has two parts, a private key, and a public key, and both these keys work only in&nbsp;pairs.</p><p>Every <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">verifiable credential</a> is signed by a public key and can be seen by anyone. But only the authorized people can access its contents as they will have the private key needed to unlock the public&nbsp;key.</p><p>The same principle applies to a wallet too. You need its private key to open the wallet and view or share the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-openbadges-vs-verifiable-credentials-d504c054d5db">verifiable credentials</a> stored in it. This is akin to a password.</p><p>From this standpoint, we can say that the entity that stores and maintains the private key of the wallet is its custodian.</p> Custodial Wallets <p>A custodial wallet is a type of digital wallet where the organization that offers this service holds the private key needed to open the wallet and access its contents. Here, the organization is the custodian of the&nbsp;wallet.</p> Advantages of Custodial Wallets <p>So, what are the advantages that come with custodial wallets?</p>  Most custodial wallets are web-based and hence, device agnostic. You can access these wallets from any part of the world, and need just a browser and Internet.  Highly convenient  The holder doesn’t have the responsibility to remember the password or the private&nbsp;key.  Extensible, as many organizations offer the same wallet for storing not just VCs, but also cryptos and other digital assets going&nbsp;forward.   Disadvantages of Custodial Wallets <p>Custodial wallets are not perfect, as they come with some shortcomings as&nbsp;well.</p>  The password is stored in the servers of a third party, and this can make it a lot less&nbsp;secure.  Requires considerable research to identify a secure and reputable wallet.  Custodial wallets come with a&nbsp;fee.  <p>In all, a custodial wallet is a convenient and extensible option for storing your <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/non-fungible-tokens-nfts-vs-verifiable-credentials-vcs-cd0ebb13f1fb">verifiable credentials</a>. It takes the responsibility of storing and remembering passwords from the user, but at the same time, brings a third party into the transaction, thereby making it a lot less secure. Furthermore, the organization that controls the wallet’s keys can determine in the future how and where its contents can be&nbsp;used.</p> What are Non-Custodial Wallets? <p>As the name suggests, non-custodial wallets are those wallets that are solely controlled by the owner. In other words, you are the only one who knows the password to open the wallet, and hence, you’re the only one who can access it. No other entities are involved in managing your&nbsp;wallet.</p> Advantages of Non-custodial Wallets <p>The biggest advantages of non-custodial wallets are privacy and security. Since no one other than you can access the wallet, you can be assured that its contents will never be accessible to anyone and hence, offers the highest levels of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Furthermore, only you can determine how your VCs can be used, and with whom they can be shared. In this sense, non-custodial wallets adhere to the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity completely.</p> Disadvantages of Non-custodial Wallets <p>The biggest disadvantage of non-custodial wallets is their inaccessibility when you lose or forget the password. Since you are the sole custodian, there is a huge responsibility on you to always remember the password of your&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>The other minor disadvantage is that non-custodial wallets can be tied down to a device, depending on its implementation.

 Spherity is Partnering with Legisym Offering Joint Compliance Product for the U.S. Life Sciences&nbsp;Market.  Legisym, LLC is a trusted expert in the U.S. Life Sciences Market, providing services to pharmaceutical companies around the world since&nbsp;2009 <p>Legisym and Spherity have worked closely together to bring to maturity a joint offering that meets the security requirements of the U.S. Life Sciences Market. As part of the joint development, both companies have collaborated with SAP and Novartis, which have already subjected the product to extensive quality testing and functional validation. Spherity and Legisym are pleased to officially announce their partnership as of&nbsp;today.</p>Spherity is partnering with Legisym offering a joint compliance product, Credentialing Service, for the U.S. Life Sciences&nbsp;Market.<p>In November 2013, the U.S. congress enacted the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) in order to protect patients’ health. To ensure that only legitimate actors are part of the supply chain, the regulation requires U.S. pharmaceutical trading partners to ensure that they only interact with other trading partners that are authorized. Authorized is every trading partner holding a valid state-issued license or a current registration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p><p>Today in 2022, U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain actors have no interoperable, electronic mechanism to validate each other´s authorized status. With more than 60,000 interacting trading partners involved in the U.S. Life Sciences Industry and a FDA recommendation to respond to data requests in under one minute, a solution that provides compliance with the regulations by 2023 is in high demand. Legisym and Spherity have decided to cooperate and offer an interoperable highly secure service to enable pharmaceutical supply chain actors to become an Authorized Trading Partner (ATP) according to U.S.&nbsp;DSCSA.</p><p>Legisym, as a trusted identity and license verification service provider, perfectly complements Spherity’s digital wallet technology for managing verifiable credentials. The verifiable credential technology is used to represent the authorized status of interacting trading partners in an highly efficient, secure and DSCSA-compliant way. To use credentialing for Authorized Trading Partner (ATP) requirements under DSCSA, trading partners need to go through a one-time due diligence onboarding process with Legisym. Once the verifiable credentials are issued, they are stored in a secure digital wallet which comes embedded with the Credentialing Service provided by Spherity. Using this technology enables U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain actors to interact with digital trust, as they now can digitally verify their ATP status in every interaction.</p><p>Georg Jürgens, Manager Industry Solutions at Spherity says, “together with our partner Legisym we focused on making the adoption of credentialing for trading partners as simple as possible. Manufacturers, wholesalers and dispensers can all acquire a digital wallet and ATP credentials within minutes without integration effort and use this innovative solution for DSCSA-regulated interactions.”</p><p>“Legisym is thrilled to be working alongside Spherity to bring the first production-level ATP Credentialing solution to the industry,” said Legisym President &amp; Co-Owner David Kessler. “With the successful completion of the ATP Credentialing Pilot in 2020 and the joint founding of the Open Credentialing Initiative in early 2021, the Spherity-Legisym partnership is already proving successful in collaboration and forward thinking.”</p><p>Legisym and Spherity founded along with other adopters, the <a href="http://oc-i.org">Open Credentialing Initiative</a> (OCI). This newly formed organization incubates and standardizes the architecture using Digital Wallets and Verifiable Credentials for DSCSA compliance for Authorized Trading Partner requirements. Besides U.S pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers, and dispensers, the OCI is open for solution providers integrating the ATP solution.</p><p>For press relations, contact <a href="mailto:communication@spherity.com">communication@spherity.com</a>.

<p>A credential comprises one or more claims made by the issuer of a credential about the subject. For example; a driving license containing the licensee's name, SSN, date of birth, etc is a credential where such data and details are claims made by the license issuer about the licensee which is the subject. A credential is called a verifiable credential when its authenticity can be cryptographically checked by anyone because the credential contains a cryptographic signature by the issuer, and the issuer's public key is well known. To convince a service provider, the verifier, of the authenticity of a verifiable credential, the credential along with the signature is shared with the service provider who can then verify the signature.</p><p>However, the above approach may be harmful to the user’s privacy. The entity in possession of the credential being the holder, has to share the credential in its entirety with the verifier, which may reveal a lot more information than what was needed. As an example, the holder may have wanted to share his name and date of birth from his license, not the rest of the credential data like his SSN, all while still being able to convince the verifier that he does own a verifiable credential containing his name and date of birth. This desired property is called selective disclosure where the holder can choose to disclose only parts of the credential, rather than the entire credential. </p><p>Another problem to solve is linkability. Say the holder is able to achieve selective disclosure where it only reveals part of the credential data to the verifier (the part that is sufficient for the verifier to provide service to the holder), the holder would not want the verifier to link his previous interactions with him. This desired property is called unlinkability. There are cases however when the holder is willing to be linked across several of his interactions but that should be voluntary and we do support that.</p><p>In some cases, even the above two properties might not be sufficient, for example when the holder wants to reveal part of the data -</p>  If a holder wants to prove he is over 18 or above 65 for availing a service, he doesn't need to show his date of birth; just being able to prove those conditions, called predicates is sufficient for the verifier.  For proving that he/she is not a resident of a city/state, the holder should not need to share his exact address.  For availing of social welfare, when the holder's salary is below a certain amount, the holder should not need to reveal his salary from his bank statement, but show an anonymous credential to convince the verifier of the same.  Similarly, an investor should be able to convince a verifier that the total value of his assets is greater than some amount without revealing the actual values of his assets.  <p>One of the solutions to solve the above problem is called anonymous credentials, sometimes called Attribute-Based Credentials (ABC). The main idea in anonymous credentials is that rather than considering the credential data as arbitrary bytes which are then signed by the issuer, anonymous credentials adds "structure" to the credential. Each claim in the credential is treated as an attribute and then these attributes are signed in a specific way by the issuer to create a signature. These attributes and the signature now form anonymous credentials. For example, if a credential has 3 claims made by the issuer about the holder including, name, city, and SSN, these 3 claims correspond to 3 attributes, one for each claim. Because of the "structure" in this credential, the holder can prove to a verifier, using zero-knowledge proof, that he has this credential from the issuer without revealing any of the attributes. To be precise, the holder can disclose these attributes exist and have been signed by an official issuer, without disclosing the attributes themselves or the signature. </p><p>"The holder can also reveal one or more attributes as part of the zero-knowledge proof from this anonymous credential, thus achieving selective disclosure."</p><p>“One or more zero-knowledge proofs created from the same anonymous credential cannot be linked together thus giving us unlinkability. "</p><p>To achieve both of these properties, we use a signature scheme called <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/663">BBS+</a>. A useful property of BBS+ (and similar) signatures is that when using several BBS+ signatures, attributes common to the signatures can be proven equal without revealing them. For example, if you have a driving license credential and passport, both with a BBS+ signature, you can prove that your SSN attribute is the same in both your driving license and passport without revealing your SSN. This property allows linking many credentials together and is helpful in cases when you need to prove that all credentials are about the same subject (or subject id).</p><p>Because credentials are essentially attestations made by an authority, i.e. the issuer, meaning they act as evidence or proof of something, it should be possible for the authority to permanently or temporarily renounce the attestations. These revoked credentials signal that the credential should not be accepted by any verifier. This kind of signaling requires the verifier to check the unique ID against a public list of all revoked credentials. However, revealing such a unique ID goes against our unlinkability requirement, as the unique ID of the credential ties all zero-knowledge proofs created from that credential. Therefore, we need a system in which the holder can prove that the membership of their credential ID is in a list in-zero knowledge:</p>  The verifier is assured the holder’s credential ID is not in the public list of all revoked credentials  The verifier will not have access to the credential ID  This system will ensure the holder is unlinkable.  <p>For this zero-knowledge membership, we use an accumulator which is a set-like database but with a very small size and allows such zero-knowledge membership checks. Accumulators also enable other use cases where such a membership or non-membership check is required. </p><p>Say that you have a bank details credential that contains your account number as one of the attributes. To convince a regulator that your account is not in a "suspicious-accounts" list, you can prove to the regulator that your account is not in the accumulator which contains all suspicious accounts. We use a pairing-based accumulator called <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/777">VB accumulator</a>.</p><p>Some other common requirements with anonymous credentials is being able to prove conditions or predicates about the attributes like proving total income from a bank statement credential is less than the limit. Here the total income might not be a single attribute but composed of several attributes with one attribute per income source. Therefore, the attributes need to be added together before comparing to the limit amount, some cases may need more complex operations on one or more attributes. </p><p>These capabilities are not possible with BBS+ alone, and we therefore use zk-SNARK which can be used to prove arbitrary conditions on the attributes. The zk-SNARK we use is the same as used in Zcash but <a href="https://github.com/lovesh/legogro16">adapted</a> to be linked with the BBS+ signature.</p><p>Anonymous credentials offer great privacy but too much privacy can sometimes be crippling for regulators or law enforcement. Consider an exchange as a verifier that allows customers to make transactions after they prove possession of a government ID, but does not ask for any other information. At any point, a regulator or law enforcement may want to know details of who made certain transactions, but the only information the verifier has and is able to provide, is that someone made the transactions with a government ID. </p><p>This isn’t sufficient for the regulator or law enforcement, traceability is needed here. However, not everyone in this chain needs traceability, certain authorities are the ones in need of it. We solve this problem by a technique called verifiable encryption.</p><p>Using the example above, a customer who possesses a government ID should be required to encrypt their SSN for the regulator without revealing the SSN itself. Authorities can decrypt the SSN and track who the government ID belongs to, while the customer is assured the exchange is not able to track them, only the authorities who need to trace them. Note that verifiable encryption is not mandatory with Dock credentials, it’s opt-in.</p>  The <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto">core cryptographic library</a> that implements the signature schemes and proof protocols is implemented in Rust.  The library contains different primitives in separate crates. The notable ones are <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/main/bbs_plus">BBS+ signatures</a>, <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/main/vb_accumulator">accumulators</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/main/proof_system">composite proof system</a>.  The composite proof system allows us to combine these primitives like proving knowledge of 2 BBS+ signatures with proof of accumulator membership.  <p>Since a large part of this code needs to run in a Javascript environment like a browser or a react native app, we built a <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm">WASM wrapper</a> over the Rust code. The wrapper is quite thin and mostly does deserialization/serialization logic. It intentionally lacks abstractions like classes and is just some modules with free-floating functions. Finally, there is a <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts">Typescript library</a> that uses the WASM wrapper and provides various abstractions like creating signatures, proofs, accumulators. &nbsp;</p><p>As verification of proofs and accumulator membership/non-membership requires publicly available authenticated storage, we deployed the ability to post BBS+ and accumulator public keys on our chain and also to create, update and remove accumulators. The changes have been live on the mainnet for some time and <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/master/src/modules/bbs-plus.js">corresponding</a> <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/master/src/modules/accumulator.js">modules</a> and tests are added in SDK for <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/master/tests/integration/anoncreds/bbs-plus.test.js">BBS+</a>, <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/master/tests/integration/anoncreds/accumulator.test.js">accumulators</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/sdk/blob/master/tests/integration/anoncreds/demo.test.js">composite proof</a> by fetching objects from the chain.</p><p>For a more detailed explanation of the primitives, see <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#overview">the explainer</a> in the GitHub repo. The usage with examples is described <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#usage">here</a>. It is broken down into the following sections:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#bbs-signatures-1">BBS+ signature</a>  <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#accumulators">Accumulator</a>  <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#composite-proofs-1">Composite proof system</a>  <p>The composite proof subsection shows several examples like <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#selective-disclosure">selective disclosure</a>, creating proofs over <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#multiple-bbs-signatures">multiple BBS+ signatures</a>, <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#bbs-signature-together-with-accumulator-membership">BBS+ signature with accumulator membership</a>, getting <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#getting-a-blind-signature">blind BBS+ signature</a>, meaning even the issuer is not aware of certain attributes, and <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto-wasm-ts#verifier-local-or-opt-in-linkability">opt-in linkability</a> where the holder chooses to be linkable across several proofs of his credential, but only at a certain verifier.</p><p>We are exploring options for predicates like range proofs, verifiable encryption, and support for arbitrary computation on credential data in general, but we have PoCs for showing that they work with BBS+ signatures.</p><p>This <a href="https://github.com/lovesh/cp-snark-bbs">PoC</a> shows the usage of BBS+ and <a href="https://github.com/lovesh/legogro16">LegoGroth16</a>, which is an adaptation of Groth16, the zk-SNARK used in Zcash. The PoC shows how to:</p>  Prove that some attribute of a BBS+ signature satisfies some bound that can be used to prove that age is less than or greater than some number  Prove that the sum of certain attributes satisfy a certain bound which can be used to prove that the sum of liabilities is less than some number.  Prove that sum of certain attributes of 1 credential is less than the sum of certain attributes of another credential, which can be used to prove that the sum of liabilities is less than the sum of assets.  <p>This <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/tree/saver-poc/saver">PoC</a> shows verifiable encryption based on <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1270">SAVER</a>. We show in <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/blob/saver-poc/saver/src/tests.rs">this test</a>, that a user can verifiably encrypt any of his attributes for a third party, and convince the third party that the encryption has been correctly done. </p>

Still, it is essential to talk about pioneers in the Web2 space fighting for free internet and data privacy. They are the advocates working with governments for data regulations that protect internet users. One of such organizations is Mozilla. In this episode of Voices of the Data Economy, we talked with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/udbhav-tiwari-b4919839/">Udbhav Tiwari</a>, Public Policy Advisor at Mozilla. During this discussion, he explains the role of Mozilla in the free internet ecosystem, data regulations discrepancies in the Asia Pacific and particularly India, and more. Here are edited excerpts of the&nbsp;podcast.</p><p>Mozilla’s role in the internet ecosystem: 20 years of Mozilla&nbsp;Firefox</p><p>Mozilla explicitly works towards treating the internet as a global public resource that should be accessible to everyone. It does this with the help of different <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/products/">products such as Firefox, Pocket, and Mozilla&nbsp;VPN.</a></p><blockquote>“My role in the global public policy team at Mozilla is to also look out for laws and regulations that may impact these products. I oversee if the laws can be improved to ensure that they lead to that open Internet — I then advocate for those laws. Or if there are particularly worrying things in certain laws and regulations that would be bad, not just for Mozilla’s products, but also for the internet — I also tend to work on those issues. And so far my remit has largely been in the Asia Pacific region but I also work on some other issues globally.”</blockquote><p>The main aspects of Udbhav’s role&nbsp;are</p>  data protection and&nbsp;privacy  content regulation and intermediary liability  connectivity, encryption, and&nbsp;security  <p>The Mozilla Foundation is actually a digital rights NGO. It has fellows that work on internet health and internet security around the world. At Voices of the Data Economy, we have interviewed two fellows in the past: <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/julia-reinhardt-what-do-gdpr-and-ai-regulations-mean/id1506212617?i=1000531062544">Julia Reinhardt </a>and <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/anouk-ruhaak-data-trusts-and-collective-consent/id1506212617?i=1000475444072">Anouk Ruhaak</a>. The foundation has initiatives like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keb0oAMV-I4">YouTube Regrets </a>and <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/privacynotincluded/">privacy not included</a>.</p><p>Data Regulations across Asia and&nbsp;India</p><p>Udbhav mentions that Europe has had a data protection law for much longer than other parts of the world (of course, now we have&nbsp;GDPR).</p><blockquote>“Here in the Asia Pacific region, it’s quite far from being the norm even to have a data protection law in the first place. If one were to turn the clock back, I would say even ten years ago; one could easily count on two hands the number of countries in the Asia Pacific region that had a dedicated data protection law on the books. But thanks to the proliferation of technology and public demands from civil society that want better protections for users and consumers– things are changing.”</blockquote><p>Australia has had a privacy law for a fair amount of time. Still, they are actually amid re-looking at their privacy law; it’s being updated to suit modern technologies better. If one were to move a little higher up, countries like the Philippines have now had a privacy law for some time. And in fact, business imperatives around the business processing and outsourcing industry in the Philippines played a considerable role in the Philippines, even having a privacy law in the first place. Sri Lanka is also looking at a data protection law. Even countries like Indonesia have been debating data protection laws for some time, and Indonesia also now has a data protection law. However, some provisions within the law still need to be notified, or specific, like regulatory entities under the law need to be set&nbsp;up.</p><blockquote>“Even in India, the protection, the conversation around data protection has been going on for well over, I think, 12 years now, approximately, there have been different versions of different bills that different committees have proposed.”</blockquote><p>Indian data regulation law and its relation with non-personal data</p><p>The drafted data protection law in India has the following issues:</p>  The first fundamental provision is around data protection and how it applies to governments. So the law in India currently has a section, the draft law, section 35, which will allow the government to exempt any part of itself from any part of the law. Everybody understands the need for exceptions: national security for law enforcement access, and all laws worldwide contain it like the GDPR contains some exceptions. But in India, many people think it has significantly exceeded that narrow scope. Hypothetically, it can say things&nbsp;like    These 15 sections will not apply to the Reserve Bank of&nbsp;India  These five sections won’t apply to view IDI, India’s digital identity authority or  The whole law will not apply to the Intelligence Bureau OR the whole law will not apply to the CBI, India’s centralized investigation agency.    The second provision is in general, around the independence of the Data Protection Authority that this law is proposing. The Data Protection Authority is the regulator that enforces data protection laws — they are the ones you can complain to if something goes wrong with you and a Data Collector. But some individuals do proactive audits who enforce the provisions of the law. And suppose you don’t have a robust Data Protection Authority. In that case, the law becomes a toothless tiger when it comes to data protection because you can’t do anything unless there is, you know, a capable infrastructure of people who can enforce that&nbsp;law.  <p>India’s data protection law contains both the drafts and the new one as well contains some pretty strong language that splits data into three categories.</p>  Personal data  Sensitive Personal&nbsp;data  Critical Personal&nbsp;data  <blockquote>“Critical personal data isn’t defined; it’s something that the government will be able to notify, for example, they can say health data is critical, they can say that. And in these three classifications, critical data will have to stay in the country and simply cannot leave the country. Sensitive data can leave the country for a short amount of time, but a copy of that data must always be kept in the country, and personal data can currently go around when it wants to. So as you can imagine this, fundamentally like rejigs the way the internet and its infrastructure works in a very big&nbsp;way.”</blockquote><p>When it comes to non-personal data, in general, numbers, data is actually like, it has a negative definition, which is anything that isn’t personal data is nonpersonal data. So all privacy laws and data protection laws around the world fundamentally apply to personal data, right, like data that identifies an individual or has identifying characteristics. So for example, if I write a poem, right, like on a piece of paper or on Google Docs, and I don’t write any my name on it, I don’t associate it with an account, then that is actually isn’t data. Yes. Is it personal data? No. Right? Like, because, for example, imagine Amazon has the list of the top 100 products that are sold in India every day, right without who bought them without any other information, just a pure List of 100 products, top 100 products that are sold in India every day. That is an example of nonpersonal data. It is data it has its uses as inferences associated with it. But it doesn’t meet the definition of personal data, which means it doesn’t have identifying characteristics that can’t be used to identify individuals, so on and so&nbsp;forth.</p><p>India’s status in Data Regulation</p><p>India, in many ways, is trying, and some people are now openly saying it is very much trying to carve what it calls is the fourth part of internet regulation; they think that the three main dominant models&nbsp;are</p>  The United States: with the free market, very little regulation  Europe: pretty strong prescriptive regulation,  regulation in countries like China, which differs much more from the state’s&nbsp;power.  <blockquote>“I think India, in all of the issues that we have discussed, is trying to pick and choose different models from these different countries in order to be able to implement them in practice. I think it is very deliberately doing so to set an example for other similarly placed countries. So it’s not just what we do here, but it’s also how we do things in a manner that other countries can&nbsp;follow.”</blockquote><p>Here is a list of the selected time stamps on the different topics discussed during the&nbsp;podcast:</p><p>2.20 -7.25: Mozilla’s role in the internet ecosystem</p><p>7.25–13.20: Data regulations in the Asia Pacific with a focus on&nbsp;India</p><p>13.20–28:35: What is non-personal data, and how are the regulations?</p><p>28.35–32:05: How should a data protection law in India look&nbsp;like?</p><p>32.05–43.06: How does big tech behave in&nbsp;India</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-governance-across-continents-what-does-it-mean-for-internet-users-39c771ab1f08">Data Governance Across Continents: What does it mean for internet users?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   Bribery, theft, lost opportunities: the threats posed by corrupt politicians to communities are immense. In parallel, inadvertently facilitating the laundering of illegally-acquired funds is also a major threat for financial or virtual asset service providers. By implementing ongoing sanctions lists and PEP data screenings in their KYC process, businesses can lower their risk of regulatory fines -

 È online il nuovo sito web di InfoCert-Tinexta Group per parlare alla platea sempre più vasta ed eterogenea di utenti dei Digital Trust Services. 



 Il progetto rientra nella più ampia strategia aziendale che punta ad arricchire e rafforzare il rapporto con i clienti con esperienze d’uso personalizzate e coinvolgenti in ogni ambito. 



<p>Roma, 20 Gennaio 2022 – InfoCert (Tinexta Group), la più grande Autorità di Certificazione europea, annuncia il rilascio della nuova versione di infocert.it, il sito web dedicato all’offerta di soluzioni tra cui PEC, Firma Digitale, Marche temporali, Conservazione Digitale, Fatturazione Elettronica e SPID.</p>



<p>Il radicale rinnovo di infocert.it ha grande valore strategico per l’azienda, anche per il suo ruolo di porta d’accesso della clientela, in particolare PMI e Professionisti e privati, al mondo dei trust services: sono oltre 1 milione i clienti dell’ecommerce InfoCert ed il sito ogni anno registra oltre 100 Milioni di pagine visitate.</p>



<p>Inoltre, questa prima release del sito è la chiave di comunicazione digitale di InfoCert in Europa. Infatti, le aziende del gruppo InfoCert verranno allineate a questo nuovo format, con l‘obiettivo ambizioso di rendere sempre più riconoscibile l’immagine e l’offerta del gruppo InfoCert. Questo elemento è stato fondamentale per determinare la scelta attuale di User Experience e Look&amp;Feel, in quanto ha l’importante ruolo di comunicare non solo un marchio all’estero, ma soprattutto di intercettare le esigenze di geografie e culture diverse.</p>



<p>Il progetto è in continua evoluzione: già entro il primo trimestre del 2022, è prevista la trasformazione della sezione di e-commerce nonché la creazione di aree dedicate a specifici target di clientela.</p>



<p>Il nuovo sito si distingue per quattro caratteristiche principali:</p>



  Completo: gli utenti possono trovare sul sito non solo le informazioni su tutti i prodotti dell’offerta InfoCert per digitalizzare il proprio business, ma anche lo spazio per comprendere meglio il mondo dei servizi di digital trust.  Chiaro: le informazioni sono sintetiche, precise e facilmente consultabili anche grazie a numerosi video tutorial.  Conversazionale: lo stile punta su fruibilità e informalità, anche grazie a un uso di immagini coinvolgenti e rappresentative dei principali target.  Contemporaneo: il design risponde non solo a specifiche esigenze funzionali, ma è anche in linea con i più recenti e innovativi canoni estetici e qualitativo-esperienziali.  



<p>In sintesi, il nuovo sito web è in 4C per un’esperienza inedita, personale e coinvolgente su qualsiasi dispositivo, innanzitutto mobile.</p>



<blockquote><p>“Il nuovo portale vuole essere in linea con l’evoluzione del posizionamento di InfoCert, realtà tutta italiana che si è fortemente posizionata come leader in Italia dei servizi di Digital Trust e che negli ultimi anni sta adottando una strategia sempre più globale in Europa e non solo. Questo nuovo sito è solo la prima tappa di una strategia più ampia di cui si vedranno pienamente i risultati nei prossimi mesi. Vogliamo, infatti, garantire una brand experience continua, chiara e coerente ai clienti esistenti e potenziali a prescindere dal canale o dal dispositivo da loro utilizzato. Per continuare, e addirittura accelerare, il percorso di successo intrapreso da anni. Puntiamo al consolidamento e all’arricchimento del rapporto di conoscenza e fiducia con tutti i nostri sempre più numerosi interlocutori. Questo è dovuto essenzialmente ad una vera e propria esplosione, causata in larga parte anche dall’evento pandemico, della digitalizzazione sia in ambito professionale che non. A questo si aggiunge una platea internazionale crescente, vista la nostra dimensione sempre più globale”</p>Marco Lauro, Director Web &amp; Inside Sales InfoCert – Tinexta Group</blockquote>

  <p>UI designers and front-end developers are tasked with creating clean and consistent user interfaces. At the same time, testing is a cornerstone of software development. Each part of a software project is tested individually and isolated from the other elements in unit tests. This practice has been challenging to achieve in the context of user interfaces.</p>

<p>Now <a href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storybook</a> provides an open-source framework that lets you test UI components in isolation from the rest of the website. Storybook presents you with a browser of all the components in your web application. You can test each component independently and in different configurations. The tool runs as a separate application outside your main application, which means that you can test your components without worrying about application-specific dependencies or requirements.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, I will show you how to use Storybook to create a simple <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> application. The application will be a unit conversion app, and I will use Storybook to showcase the individual components and the application page itself. I will not assume any prior knowledge of React or Storybook. I will assume that you are familiar with JavaScript and Node, and have an up-to-date version of the <code>npm</code> packet manager installed on your computer.</p>

 Creating React components with Storybook 

<p>In this section, I will show you how to create a React application and implement components displayed in Storybook. These components will serve as the basis for the unit conversion application. To start, open a terminal in a folder of your choice and run the following command to create a new React application.</p>

   <code>npx create-react-app@5 react-storybook --use-npm
</code>   

<p>The <code>create-react-app</code> command creates a new folder, <code>react-storybook</code>, and initialises a basic application skeleton. Next, turn this basic React app into a Storybook application. Navigate into the newly created folder and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npx sb@6 init
</code>   

<p>When prompted, answer yes to install the <code>sb</code> package. Initializing Storybook will create a new folder, <code>stories</code> inside the <code>src</code> folder, and populate it with some pre-made demo components and stories to be used by Storybook. Open the project folder in your favourite IDE.</p>

<p>You can test out storybook straight away. Open a terminal session in the project folder and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm run storybook
</code>   

<p>The command runs the Storybook app and opens a browser tab (http://localhost:6006). For now, you will only see the components that Storybook installs by default. You can keep Storybook running while you develop your app.</p>

<p>Using your IDE, create a new file named <code>src/stories/Components.jsx</code>. This will be the module that will contain some basic UI components. For the sake of this tutorial, I will place all these components into a single module. In practice, you might want to spread them out over several files. Open <code>src/stories/Components.jsx</code> and paste in the following code.</p>

   <code>import React, { useState } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import './Components.css';

export function Input({ size, type, label, name, placeholder, onChange }) {
  return (
    &lt;label className={`input-component input-component--${size}`}&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;{label}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;input
        type={type==='text' ? 'text' : 'number'}
        step={type==='floating-point' ? 'any' : undefined}
        name={name}
        placeholder={placeholder}
        onChange={onChange}
      /&gt;
    &lt;/label&gt;
  );
};

Input.propTypes = {
  size: PropTypes.oneOf(['medium', 'large']),
  type: PropTypes.oneOf(['text', 'number', 'floating-point']),
  label: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  name: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  placeholder: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  onChange: PropTypes.func,
};

Input.defaultProps = {
  size: 'medium',
  type: 'text',
  label: 'Enter a value',
  name: 'input',
  placeholder: 'Please enter a value',
  onChange: undefined
};

export function Select({ size, label, options, onChange }) {
  return (
    &lt;label className={`select-component select-component--${size}`}&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;{label}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;select className="select-component" onChange={onChange}&gt;
        {options.map((option) =&gt; &lt;option value={option.value}&gt;{option.description}&lt;/option&gt;)}
      &lt;/select&gt;
    &lt;/label&gt;
  );
};

Select.propTypes = {
  size: PropTypes.oneOf(['medium', 'large']),
  label: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  options: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape({
    value: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    description: PropTypes.string.isRequired
  })).isRequired,
  onChange: PropTypes.func,
};

Select.defaultProps = {
  size: 'medium',
  label: 'Options',
  options: []
};

export function Tabs({ children }) {
  const [active, setActive] = useState(0);

  const onTabClick = (newActive) =&gt; () =&gt; {
    setActive(() =&gt; newActive);
  };

  return (
    &lt;div className="tabs-component"&gt;
      &lt;div className="tabs-row"&gt;
        {children.map((child, index) =&gt; &lt;div className={`tab ${index === active ? "active" : ""}`} onClick={onTabClick(index)}&gt;{child.props.label}&lt;/div&gt;)}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div className="tabs-content"&gt;
        {children[active]}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};

Tabs.propTypes = {
  children: PropTypes.instanceOf(Array).isRequired,
};

Tabs.defaultProps = {
  children: []
};
</code>   

<p>This module exports three components. <code>Input</code> is a configurable <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element with a label for entering text or numbers, <code>Select</code> is a dropdown <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element wrapped in a label, and <code>Tabs</code> is a component that shows its children in a separate tab. I am using the React feature <code>propTypes</code> to specify the properties that each React component expects as arguments, allowing Storybook to extract this meta-information and display it to the user. To provide a bit of styling for the components, create a file <code>src/stories/Components.css</code>, and fill it with the following contents.</p>

   <code>.input-component {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
}

<p>With this, the components are usable as React components in your application. But you also want them to be browsable through Storybook. For this, you will need to create one file for each component. Start by creating a file <code>src/stories/Input.stories.jsx</code> and enter the following code in it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';

import { Input } from './Components';

export default {
  title: 'Components/Input',
  component: Input,
};

const Template = (args) =&gt; &lt;Input {...args} /&gt;;

export const Normal = Template.bind({});

Normal.args = {
  label: 'Normal Input',
  placeholder: 'Enter your value',
  size: 'normal'
};

export const Large = Template.bind({});

Large.args = {
  label: 'Large Input',
  placeholder: 'Enter your value',
  size: 'large'
};

export const Number = Template.bind({});

Number.args = {
  label: 'Integer Number',
  placeholder: 'Enter your value',
  size: 'large',
  type: 'number'
};

export const FloatingPoint = Template.bind({});

FloatingPoint.args = {
  label: 'Floating Point Number',
  placeholder: 'Enter your value',
  size: 'large',
  type: 'floating-point'
};
</code>   

<p>The <code>export default</code> at the top of the file tells Storybook what the component’s name is and which React component the stories in this file refer to. The subsequent exports <code>Normal</code>, <code>Large</code>, <code>Number</code>, and <code>FloatingPoint</code> represent individual stories or use cases for that component. Each story defines a member <code>args</code> that specifies the properties to pass to the component. Creating stories in this way is quick, so now create the next one for the <code>Select</code> component. Create a file <code>src/stories/Select.stories.jsx</code> and paste the following contents into it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';

import { Select } from './Components';

export default {
  title: 'Components/Select',
  component: Select,
};

const Template = (args) =&gt; &lt;Select {...args} /&gt;;

export const Default = Template.bind({});

Default.args = {
  size: 'medium',
  label: 'Select an Option',
  options: [
    { value: 'a', description: 'Option A' },
    { value: 'b', description: 'Option B' },
    { value: 'c', description: 'Option C' },
  ]
};

export const Large = Template.bind({});

Large.args = {
  size: 'large',
  label: 'Select an Option',
  options: [
    { value: 'a', description: 'Option A' },
    { value: 'b', description: 'Option B' },
    { value: 'c', description: 'Option C' },
  ]
};
</code>   

<p>This file defines two stories for the <code>Select</code> component. One story shows it in normal size, and the other shows it in a large size. Finally, do the same for the <code>Tabs</code> component. Create a file <code>src/stories/Tabs.stories.jsx</code> and fill it with the contents below.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';

import { Tabs } from './Components';

export default {
  title: 'Components/Tabs',
  component: Tabs,
};

const Template = (args) =&gt; &lt;Tabs {...args} /&gt;;

export const Default = Template.bind({});

Default.args = {
  children: [
    &lt;div label="One"&gt;Content One&lt;/div&gt;,
    &lt;div label="Two"&gt;Content Two&lt;/div&gt;,
    &lt;div label="Three"&gt;Content Three&lt;/div&gt;,
  ]
};
</code>   

<p>Now, you are ready to test out your new components in Storybook. If you haven’t done so already, open the terminal in the project folder and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm run storybook
</code>   

<p>The command runs the Storybook app and opens a browser tab (http://localhost:6006). You can browse the components in the left sidebar. The stories you just created can be found under the Components header, and when you select, for example, the Input -&gt; Number story, you should see something like shown in the image below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The component shows up in the main view, and the icons above let you change the background, the screen size, and even allow you to check the dimensions of the component’s layout. Below the main view, you can manually adjust the options passed to the component. I invite you to play around with all the features Storybook provides.</p>

 Creating the unit converter application using Storybook component stories 

<p>I will use the <code>convert-units</code> library to implement the unit conversion app. Open a second terminal in your project folder and run the command below.</p>

   <code>npm install -E convert-units@2.3.4
</code>   

<p>Now, in your IDE, create a new file, <code>src/stories/Converter.jsx</code>, and fill it with the contents below.</p>

   <code>import React, { useState } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import * as convert from 'convert-units';
import { Input, Select } from './Components';

export const Converter = ({measure}) =&gt; {
  const possibilities = convert().possibilities(measure).map((unit) =&gt; {
      const descr = convert().describe(unit);
      return {
          value: descr.abbr,
          description: `${descr.singular} (${descr.abbr})`
      };
  });

  const [fromUnit, setFromUnit] = useState(possibilities[0].value);
  const [toUnit, setToUnit] = useState(possibilities[0].value);
  const [fromValue, setFromValue] = useState(1);
  const [toValue, setToValue] = useState(convert(1).from(fromUnit).to(toUnit));

  const updateFromUnit = (event) =&gt; {
    setFromUnit(() =&gt; event.target.value);
    setToValue(() =&gt; convert(fromValue).from(event.target.value).to(toUnit));
  };

  const updateToUnit = (event) =&gt; {
    setToUnit(() =&gt; event.target.value);
    setToValue(() =&gt; convert(fromValue).from(fromUnit).to(event.target.value));
  };

  const updateValue = (event) =&gt; {
    setFromValue(() =&gt; event.target.value);
    setToValue(() =&gt; convert(event.target.value).from(fromUnit).to(toUnit));
  };
  
  return &lt;div className="converter"&gt;
      &lt;Select label="From:" options={possibilities} onChange={updateFromUnit}&gt;&lt;/Select&gt;
      &lt;Select label="To:" options={possibilities} onChange={updateToUnit}&gt;&lt;/Select&gt;
      &lt;Input label="Value:" type="floating-point" onChange={updateValue}&gt;&lt;/Input&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;{fromValue} {fromUnit} = {toValue} {toUnit}&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
};

Converter.propTypes = {
  measure: PropTypes.string.isRequired
};

Input.defaultProps = {
  measure: 'length'
};
</code>   

<p>The component takes a single property called <code>measure</code>, which specifies the type of units to be converted and can be something like <code>mass</code> or <code>length</code>. The code for this component then consists of four parts. The first action is to query the <code>convert-units</code> library for all the possible unit conversion options. Units are mapped into an array of objects, ready to use with the <code>Select</code> component. In the next part, you’ll define four state properties, followed by three event handlers. These will react to a change in the user input and update the state accordingly. These event handlers contain the actual calls to the <code>convert-units</code> library where the unit conversion happens. Finally, the component is put together from all the parts and returned. You can also create a story for this more complex component with the individual components. Create a file <code>src/stories/Converter.stories.jsx</code> and paste in the following contents.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Converter } from './Converter';

export default {
  title: 'Components/Converter',
  component: Converter,
};

const Template = (args) =&gt; &lt;Converter {...args} /&gt;;

export const Default = Template.bind({});

Default.args = {
  measure: 'length'
};

export const Mass = Template.bind({});

Mass.args = {
  measure: 'mass'
};
</code>   

<p>When you installed Storybook with the <code>npx sb</code> command, the initialization script added a few components as examples to demonstrate Storybook’s capabilities. You will be reusing two of these components for the unit-conversion app. 
Open <code>src/stories/Header.jsx</code> and replace its contents with the following code.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import { Button } from './Button';
import './header.css';

export const Header = ({ user, onLogin, onLogout }) =&gt; (
  &lt;header&gt;
    &lt;div className="wrapper"&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Unit Converter&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      {user ? &lt;div&gt; Hello {user.given_name} &lt;/div&gt; : ""}
      &lt;div&gt;
        {user ? (
          &lt;Button size="small" onClick={onLogout} label="Log out" /&gt;
        ) : (
          &lt;&gt;
            &lt;Button size="small" onClick={onLogin} label="Log in" /&gt;
          &lt;/&gt;
        )}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/header&gt;
);

Header.propTypes = {
  user: PropTypes.shape({}),
  onLogin: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  onLogout: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  onCreateAccount: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
};

Header.defaultProps = {
  user: null,
};
</code>   

<p>I have modified the header component to show the correct application name and allow some structured user data to be passed in. In the story for the header, in file <code>src/stories/Header.stories.jsx</code>, modify the arguments passed to the <code>LoggedIn</code> story to reflect this change.</p>

   <code>LoggedIn.args = {
  user: {
    given_name: "Username"
  },
};
</code>   

<p>Now, open <code>src/stories/Page.jsx</code> and modify its contents to match the code below.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import { Header } from './Header';
import './page.css';
import { Tabs } from './Components';
import { Converter } from './Converter';

export const Page = ({useAuth}) =&gt; {
  const [user, login, logout] = useAuth();
  return &lt;article&gt;
    &lt;Header user={user} onLogin={login} onLogout={logout} /&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
      &lt;Tabs&gt;
        &lt;Converter measure="length" label="Length" key="length"&gt;&lt;/Converter&gt;
        &lt;Converter measure="mass" label="Mass" key="mass"&gt;&lt;/Converter&gt;
        &lt;Converter measure="volume" label="Volume" key="volume"&gt;&lt;/Converter&gt;
      &lt;/Tabs&gt;
    &lt;/section&gt;
  &lt;/article&gt;;
}

Page.propTypes = {
  useAuth: PropTypes.func.isRequired
};

Page.defaultProps = {
};
</code>   

<p>This component displays the application page, including the header and a tabbed container that allows switching between <code>Converter</code> components configured to convert different measures. The page needs a <code>useAuth</code> hook passed in that returns the user information and callbacks to log the user in or out. In the stories for the page, in <code>src/stories/Page.stories.jsx</code>, you need to create a mock function that supplies fake user data. Edit the contents of this file to look like the following code.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import { Page } from './Page';

export default {
  title: 'Pages/Page',
  component: Page,
};

const mockUseAuth = (loggedIn) =&gt; () =&gt; [
  loggedIn ? {given_name: "Username"} : undefined, 
  () =&gt; {}, 
  () =&gt; {}
];

const Template = (args) =&gt; &lt;Page useAuth={mockUseAuth(true)} {...args}/&gt;;

export const LoggedIn = Template.bind({});
LoggedIn.args = {
  useAuth: mockUseAuth(true),
};

LoggedIn.parameters = {
  controls: { hideNoControlsWarning: true },
};

export const LoggedOut = Template.bind({});
LoggedOut.args = {
  useAuth: mockUseAuth(false),
};

LoggedOut.parameters = {
  controls: { hideNoControlsWarning: true },
};
</code>   

<p>Note how <code>mockUseAuth</code> uses <a href="https://javascript.info/currying-partials">currying</a> to return a function that can be used as the <code>useAuth</code> hook in the <code>Page</code> component. You can now use Storybook again to test the <code>Converter</code> component and the full application page. If it’s not still running, run <code>npm run storybook</code> again. You can navigate to Pages -&gt; Page in the left sidebar, and you should see something like the image below.</p>

<p></p>

 Adding authentication with Okta to the application 

<p>You have created a page that uses an <code>useAuth</code> hook to manage user authentication. For the Storybook stories, you made a mock implementation of this hook. This section will show you how to implement the hook using Okta’s authentication service. First, register the application with Okta.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:3000/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/react/create-okta-application/">Create a React App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Next, install the necessary libraries. Open the terminal and run the command below.</p>

   <code>npm install -E @okta/okta-react@6.4.1 @okta/okta-auth-js@5.10.0 react-dom@17.0.2 react-router-dom@5.3.0
</code>   

<p>Open the file <code>src/index.js</code> and modify its contents to match the code below.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import { App } from './App';
import { Page } from './stories/Page';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';
import { LoginCallback, SecureRoute, Security } from '@okta/okta-react';
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';
import { useAuth } from './auth';

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: '/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{clientID}',
  redirectUri: `/callback`,
});

function SecuredRoutes(props) {
  const history = useHistory();
  const restoreOriginalUri = async (_oktaAuth, originalUri) =&gt; {
    history.replace(toRelativeUrl(originalUri || '/', window.location.origin));
  };
  
  return (
    &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}&gt;
      &lt;Route path="/" exact render={(props) =&gt; &lt;App {...props} useAuth={useAuth}/&gt;} /&gt;
      &lt;SecureRoute path="/converter" exact render={(props) =&gt; &lt;Page {...props} useAuth={useAuth}/&gt;} /&gt;
      &lt;Route path="/callback" component={LoginCallback} /&gt;
    &lt;/Security&gt;
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;React.StrictMode&gt;
    &lt;Router&gt;
      &lt;SecuredRoutes /&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
  &lt;/React.StrictMode&gt;,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

reportWebVitals();
</code>   

<p>Here <code>{yourClientID}</code> is the client ID that you obtained earlier and <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> is your Okta domain. This change does several things. The <code>oktaAuth</code> instance provides a global authentication singleton. The main <code>render</code> function now contains a <code>Router</code> element that allows the application to navigate different routes. Finally, <code>SecuredRoutes</code> is a component that wraps the routes in a <code>Security</code> component. This component makes a <code>useOktaAuth</code> hook available for all components contained within it. Inside this component, you define the routes. Note how you pass a <code>useAuth</code> hook into the <code>App</code> and the <code>Page</code> components. Create a new file <code>src/auth.js</code> and add the following code to implement this hook.</p>

   <code>import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react';

export const useAuth = () =&gt; {
  const { oktaAuth, authState } = useOktaAuth();
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    if (authState?.isAuthenticated) {
      if (!user) {
        oktaAuth.getUser().then(setUser);
      }
    } else {
      setUser(null);
    }
  }, [authState, user, oktaAuth]);

  const login = async () =&gt; oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect('/');
  const logout = async () =&gt; oktaAuth.signOut('/');

  return [user, login, logout];
};
</code>   

<p>Finally, you need to modify the existing <code>App</code> component to use the authentication hook. Open <code>src/App.js</code> and adjust the content to look like this.</p>

   <code>import './App.css';
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { Header } from './stories/Header';

export const App = ({useAuth}) =&gt; {
  const [user, login, logout] = useAuth();

  return (
    &lt;div className="App"&gt;
      &lt;Header user={user} onLogin={login} onLogout={logout} /&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Unit Converter&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;Link to="/converter"&gt;Go to the app!&lt;/Link&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}
</code>   

<p>Congratulations, you have completed your React application with Storybook. You can now open the console in the project folder and run the following command to start the app.</p>

   <code>npm start
</code>   

<p>You should see the application’s front page in your browser. When you click the  Go to the app! link, you’ll log in on the Okta page. After successfully signing in, you will redirect to the unit converter page, which looks like the image below.</p>

 Learn more about React, Storybook, and Single-Page Apps 

<p>In this tutorial, I have shown you how to create a React application and use Storybook to browse the application’s components. Storybook is a great tool that can enhance your development workflow.</p>
 
   It lets you view and test your components in isolation. 
   You can specify the location of each component in a hierarchical menu and then browse through the components in your browser. 
   You can have multiple stories showcasing different use cases for each component. 
   You can also modify the component parameters and see the impact on the visual appearance in real time. 
   Storybook can keep running during the development process, and it will reflect any changes you make to your code. 
 

<p>The application you wrote was a simple unit-conversion app. I guided you on using the <code>convert-units</code> library to convert length, mass, and volume. You assembled the individual components to create a larger component containing multiple input elements. I have shown you how Storybook lets you create stories, test these complex components, and complete application pages.</p>

 Protecting customer data will continue to be an urgent issue for businesses worldwide in 2022. The risks and requirements are not going away. 



<p></p>



<p>In 2021 we saw users demanding and gaining more control over their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>. Big tech/ad tech took&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/16/big-tech-critics-mustered-their-forces-2021/">more hits</a> to their data-driven business models, even while introducing variously effective “privacy” measures (such as Google phasing out&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/google-pushes-privacy-but-can-a-leopard-really-change-its-spots/">third party cookies</a>&nbsp;and scrapping app developers access to&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/google-makes-genuine-privacy-move-by-scrapping-ad-ids-for-users-who-opt-out-of-targeted-ads/">ad IDs</a>&nbsp;and Apple introducing the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/apples-new-att-and-why-facebook-is-hitting-back-hard/">ATT</a>&nbsp;feature and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/12/apple-forces-data-privacy-further-into-the-spotlight/">privacy labels</a>&nbsp;in the App Store). When&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/the-whatsapp-facebook-signal-issue-explained-and-why-mysudo-is-the-best-solution/">WhatsApp</a>&nbsp;caused global outrage by demanding its 2 billion-plus users consent to sharing their personal data with Facebook, and Elon Musk switched millions of those users to private messaging app Signal with a two-word tweet, the world was never surer that consumers are tired of trading their personal information for access to services. This sentiment is only intensifying.</p>



<p>Throughout 2021, the regulatory landscape expanded, placing even greater compliance burdens on business and making cross-border data transfers more difficult.&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/businesses-face-rising-cybersecurity-risks-from-covid-19/">COVID-19</a>&nbsp;and the mass move to remote working environments continued to demand businesses find ways to protect employee devices and secure corporate data and resources as cybersecurity threats ramped up. Contact tracing also amplified the risks of sharing and storing personal information.&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/cisco-the-age-of-privacy-has-arrived-helped-by-covid-19/">Cisco</a>&nbsp;confirmed the pandemic had seriously elevated the importance of data privacy as a business priority and, as we enter the third year of the pandemic, this imperative hasn’t changed. Privacy budgets and resourcing skyrocketed among businesses in response, and governments and health authorities are still struggling to balance public health with protecting personal privacy.</p>



 Obviously, data privacy will remain firmly on the agenda in 2022, so the big trends to watch for are:

<p></p>



 Privacy regulations and compliance obligations will continue to expand and tighten in the US and globally.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodwinprivacyblog.com/2022/01/03/the-year-ahead-privacy-developments-in-2022/">International Association of Privacy Professionals</a>&nbsp;(IAPP) quotes Goodwin Partner and IAPP Senior Fellow, Omer Tene as saying,&nbsp;“In 2022, expect an avalanche of new laws and regulations, attempting to govern and impose order on a dizzying array of tech developments. New regulatory efforts will range from data protection laws in India and China to AI regulation in the EU to automated decision making rules in US states. Add to that a flurry of enforcement activities, and you get a perfect storm of tech regulation.”<br><br>But&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodwinprivacyblog.com/2022/01/03/the-year-ahead-privacy-developments-in-2022/">Tene</a>&nbsp;says it’s unlikely the US will gets its long awaited national privacy law in 2022, but at least six states will move to pass their own (Maryland, Oklahoma, Ohio, New Jersey, Florida and Alaska), and it will be interesting to see whether any of those states includes a&nbsp;<a href="https://lawrina.com/blog/private-right-of-action/#:~:text=According%20to%20Federal%20law%2C%20a,legal%20violations%20under%20a%20statute.">private right of action</a>&nbsp;(PRA) —because, if they don’t, the game could change. “A couple of years ago, conventional wisdom was that the more states pass privacy laws, the greater the pressure will build on the business community, and consequently Congress, to pass preemptive federal legislation. Absent a PRA, however, an interesting dynamic may develop, where the more state privacy laws, the less appetite businesses – who are growing accustomed to complying with the emerging (PRA-less) state framework – have for federal pre-emption,” Tene says.</p>



<p>More tech legislation will flow out of Europe too. In fact,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.goodwinprivacyblog.com/2022/01/03/the-year-ahead-privacy-developments-in-2022/">Tene</a>&nbsp;calls it&nbsp;“a veritable alphabet soup of tech regulation affecting digital platforms, digital services, online marketing, data intermediaries and more …”. The&nbsp;<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0206">AI Act</a>, affecting algorithmic decision making across the economy, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-a-europe-fit-for-the-digital-age/file-data-act">Data Act</a>, which broadens legal obligations, including cross-border transfer restrictions, to non-personal data will also be things to watch.</p>



 We’ll see more regulatory enforcement.  



<p></p>



<p>Governments in the US and Europe are expected to ramp up regulatory enforcement around breach reporting and risk reporting. GDPR enforcement increased in 2021 and this is set to continue. Tene says, “Importantly, regulators are expanding the lens from an early focus on data breaches to challenging companies’ legal bases for processing data and, notably, cross-border data flows. In 2022, expect an additional step up the enforcement ladder. We expect regulators to focus on issues such as protecting children’s data, restricting the use of sensitive health and financial information, and curbing the excess of digital marketing.” Of course, if greater enforcement is to happen, the regulators will need to be adequately resourced. Enforcement times are not getting any shorter on the complex cases. It will also be long overdue. For example, the Schrems II decision was in the middle of 2020 and there has been very minimal (if any?) enforcement action resulting from that change.&nbsp;</p>



 More limits on big tech/ad tech.  



<p></p>



<p>Regulators, the media and the general public have big tech/ad tech firmly in their sights and will continue to demand more privacy-first data tracking and sharing practices and business models. As we&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/10/consumers-could-gain-from-ftcs-stronger-focus-on-data-protection/">reported</a>&nbsp;last year,&nbsp;the Federal Trade Commission could go harder on consumer privacy protection and cybersecurity with President Biden’s recent nomination of digital “privacy hawk” and law professor&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/alvaro-bedoya-ftc-biden/">Alvaro Bedoya</a>&nbsp;and House Democrats’&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/09/democrats-tech-reconciliation/">proposal</a>&nbsp;to allocate $1 billion for a new privacy and data security bureau.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tene notes: “Under the leadership of new Chair Lina Khan, the FTC has issued strong&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/jsp/eAgenda/StaticContent/202110/Statement_3084_FTC.pdf">statements and strategic plans</a>&nbsp;for broad&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202110&amp;RIN=3084-AB69">rulemaking</a>&nbsp;efforts, including rules to curb “abuses stemming from surveillance-based business models” and “lax security practices” and to “ensure that algorithmic decision-making does not result in unlawful discrimination.” But he notes this in part depends on Bedoya’s appointment proceeding in the Senate, which may not be quick.&nbsp;</p>



 Consumers will continue to favor brands that are genuinely good, honest stewards of their personal data.  



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/consumer-privacy-study-finds-online-privacy-is-of-growing-concern-to-increasingly-more-people/">Cisco</a>&nbsp;released research findings in October 2021 which it says, ”demonstrates the growing importance of privacy to the individual and its implications on the businesses and governments that serve them.”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/consumer-privacy-study-finds-online-privacy-is-of-growing-concern-to-increasingly-more-people/">Eighty-six per cent</a>&nbsp;of respondents said they care about data privacy and want more control, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/consumer-privacy-study-finds-online-privacy-is-of-growing-concern-to-increasingly-more-people/">79 percent</a>&nbsp;said they’d be willing to vote with their wallet and not support businesses that don’t protect their data and would indeed pay for better data protection. This sounds like the new growing market of “<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/why-no-brand-can-afford-to-ignore-the-new-privacy-actives/">privacy actives</a>” we discussed last year and which no brand can afford to ignore. Cisco reminds business that data abuses have eroded trust in brands, which is one reason it has released&nbsp;its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/cisco-new-trust-standard.pdf?CCID=cc000742&amp;DTID=esootr000875&amp;OID=wprsc027437">New Trust Standard</a>, which we’ll explore in a separate article soon.</p>



<p>Clearly the opportunity for businesses to build customer trust and loyalty by responding authentically to what their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">customers want and need</a>&nbsp;are enormous. As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/cybersecurity/trusted-tech.html">PwC</a>&nbsp;says, brands that get customer privacy and safety right will disrupt the market.

What people are&nbsp;saying  The question of atoms v.&nbsp;bits  Tweet of the week — guy who created Ethereum&nbsp;edition  The investment everyone is talking&nbsp;about  Stuff happens   1. Can you trust your million dollar&nbsp;NFT? Bored Ape Yacht&nbsp;Club<p>One of the fundamental novelties of NFTs is that the framework has brought a sense of scarcity and permanence to a place — the internet — that has historically been of abundance and transience.</p><p>That NFTs exist on decentralized blockchains further gives users a sense of ownership over their items — perfect for digital collectibles and other use cases such as&nbsp;gaming.</p><p>But how permanent are NFTs really? And how decentralized are they actually?</p><p>That’s one of Moxie Marlinspike’s points from a blog post last week on his “<a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">first impressions of web3</a> (via /rcb) that’s making the rounds in the cryptosphere.</p><p>Here’s Moxie on the problem with&nbsp;NFTs:</p><blockquote>Most people think of images and digital art when they think of NFTs, but NFTs generally do not store that data on-chain. For most NFTs of most images, that would be much too expensive.</blockquote><blockquote>Instead of storing the data on-chain, NFTs instead contain a URL that points to the data. What surprised me about the standards was that there’s no hash commitment for the data located at the URL. Looking at many of the NFTs on popular marketplaces being sold for tens, hundreds, or millions of dollars, that URL often just points to some VPS running Apache somewhere. Anyone with access to that machine, anyone who buys that domain name in the future, or anyone who compromises that machine can change the image, title, description, etc for the NFT to whatever they’d like at any time (regardless of whether or not they “own” the token). There’s nothing in the NFT spec that tells you what the image “should” be, or even allows you to confirm whether something is the “correct” image.</blockquote><blockquote>So as an experiment, I made an NFT that changes based on who is looking at it, since the web server that serves the image can choose to serve different images based on the IP or User Agent of the requester. For example, it looked <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x5c61afa47570ab2b562606fa578221305b12c307/1">one way</a> on OpenSea, <a href="https://rarible.com/token/0x5c61afa47570ab2b562606fa578221305b12c307:1?tab=details">another way</a> on Rarible, but when you buy it and view it from your crypto wallet, it will always display as a large [poop] emoji. What you bid on isn’t what you get. There’s nothing unusual about this NFT, it’s how the NFT specifications are built. Many of the highest priced NFTs could turn into [poop] emoji at any time; I just made it explicit.</blockquote><p>That’s the current NFT reality. But technology has never been just about code. It’s also an inherently social endeavor — as Matt Levine <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-10/web3-takes-trust-too">points out in his Money Stuff newsletter</a>:</p><blockquote>The NFT does not by itself convey ownership of the underlying thing in either a legal or practical sense. It conveys ownership in some more metaphysical sense: If you buy a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT, then the people who are part of the BAYC NFT community will treat you as the owner of your ape. This is essentially a social fact and can be true even if the immutable code of the blockchain says that you don’t own the ape, because you were <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/y3v3ny/all-my-apes-gone-nft-theft-victims-beg-for-centralized-saviors">hacked or whatever</a>. The technology is a scaffolding on which to hang a social system, but the social system is what does or does not convey “ownership” in a meaningful sense.</blockquote><p>It’s also likely that as the space develops — web3 and NFTs really only entered the mainstream conversation last year — that new solutions will emerge to address some of those technological gaps. (For instance, your NFT might be stored on Filecoin’s Interplanetary File&nbsp;System.)</p><p>But there will also be cases where some gaps can’t be addressed or more practically, it doesn’t make sense to address them with decentralized solutions.</p><p>As Moxie points out, that’s something the industry and community as a whole will continue to grapple over going forward. There are philosophical merits to decentralization, but in order to deliver a compelling and convenient product to end users, some sort of balance will be struck between the vision of a decentralized world and the efficiency of centralized solutions. (To Moxie’s point, that’s already the case with NFTs and platforms like OpenSea.)</p><p>For Moxie, it’s about expectations:</p><blockquote>This isn’t a complaint about OpenSea or an indictment of what they’ve built. Just the opposite, they’re trying to build something that works. I think we should expect this kind of platform consolidation to happen, and given the inevitability, design systems that give us what we want when that’s how things are organized. My sense and concern, though, is that the web3 community expects some other outcome than what we’re already&nbsp;seeing.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>However, even if this is just the beginning (and it very well might be!), I’m not sure we should consider that any consolation. I think the opposite might be true; it seems like we should take notice that from the very beginning, these technologies immediately tended towards centralization through platforms in order for them to be realized, that this has ~zero negatively felt effect on the velocity of the ecosystem, and that most participants don’t even know or care it’s happening. This might suggest that decentralization itself is not actually of immediate practical or pressing importance to the majority of people downstream, that the only amount of decentralization people want is the minimum amount required for something to exist, and that if not very consciously accounted for, these forces will push us further from rather than closer to the ideal outcome as the days become less&nbsp;early.</blockquote><p>All of which is hardly a radical take. Decentralization in and of itself is no panacea — even if it is a cornerstone for where we’re evolving&nbsp;toward.</p><p>And as web3 continues to grow in prominence and end product, these conversations will only continue and new gaps will be identified.</p><p>One gap that will command increasing focus in 2022 is the question of identity. If technology is a fundamentally social endeavor, we need to know who we’re dealing with, whether from a personal, community, or regulatory perspective.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  Via <a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb </a>— Moxie Marlinspike: <a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html">My first impressions of&nbsp;web3</a>  Matt Levin e— <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-10/web3-takes-trust-too">Web3 Takes Trust&nbsp;Too</a>  <a href="https://www.notboring.co/p/the-web3-debate">The Web3&nbsp;Debate</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-11/signal-founder-marlinspike-gives-web3-nfts-an-emperor-s-new-clothes-moment">Web3 Just Had Its Emperor’s-New-Clothes Moment</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876891/signal-ceo-steps-down-moxie-marlinspike-encryption-cryptocurrency">Moxie Marlinspike has stepped down as CEO of&nbsp;Signal</a>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/10/moxie-marlinspike-is-leaving-signal-heres-where-we-suspect-hes-headed-and-why/">Moxie Marlinspike is leaving Signal — TechCrunch</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/easwee">/easwee</a> — <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/01/10/newton-signal-crypto-payments?s=09">Casey Newton on the Danger of Signal Adding Anonymous Payments</a>   2. What people are&nbsp;saying <p>Here’s FTX’s <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1481381452696723459">Sam Bankman-Fried’s tweetstorm on the subject</a>, referencing <a href="https://medium.com/@danfinlay/what-moxie-missed-on-web3-wallets-8dc572e7f39b">this blog post response from Dan&nbsp;Finlay</a>:</p><blockquote>I think Dan’s ‘right to exit’ is a key piece. Sure, there are centralized apps in crypto — FTX is one! But you have the right to exit: if you don’t like FTX, you can withdraw assets to another exchange, or to your private&nbsp;wallet.</blockquote><blockquote>And, in fact, everything in the crypto universe — or at least almost everything — is plugged into decentralized rails which connect all of the (sometimes centralized) pieces. It’s not perfect, from a decentralization angle. But it still helps a&nbsp;ton.</blockquote><blockquote>And those rails are not just decentralized, they’re also open to competition. Don’t like using blockchain X to transfer assets? Try blockchain Y! Banks have had the same ~2 ways of sending funds for decades, and can’t change that. Crypto exchanges generally have&nbsp;~20.</blockquote><blockquote>And, similarly, if some infrastructure provider sucks — RPC nodes, for instance — people can create a new one. That doesn’t, of course, mean that they *will* — and I think Moxie makes some really compelling points that we probably don’t do enough of that as an industry.</blockquote><blockquote>There is concentration of usage in various places, and some of those places are not really making progress.</blockquote><blockquote>In general, I really encourage people to find pieces of crypto infrastructure that seem shitty, and build competitors to them. That’s how we move&nbsp;forward.</blockquote><blockquote>And Moxie’s other point — that crypto is too profit-motivated right now — seems totally correct to me. Hopefully we can take a longer-term view of the ecosystem.</blockquote><p>Sam’s first point reminds me of something that an old friend told me (who properly introduced me to Bitcoin told me back in 2013): You can build centralized services on a decentralized framework, but that doesn’t hold true the other way&nbsp;around.</p><p>And having that decentralization layer, having that option — whether or not people decide to take it — is powerful in and of&nbsp;itself.</p><p>To Sam’s second point, it’s probably no surprise that a lot of the real work gets done during crypto winters.

They are transforming old industries and building real world&nbsp;assets.</blockquote><p>It reminds me of something Peter Thiel likes to say, paraphrasing: We’ve done a lot of work in the world of bits, but we need to do more work in the world of&nbsp;atoms.</p><p>(By the way, it’s not necessarily clear that those two things are mutually exclusive.

Citadel Securities is interested in getting into crypto market making, but is waiting for greater regulatory clarity surrounding digital currencies, especially in the U.S., a company spokesperson told The Information.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Paradigm and Sequoia can also connect Citadel Securities to exchanges and companies that would enable the market maker to build a crypto business. Both VC firms have invested in crypto exchange FTX, for example, as well as in Fireblocks, a startup that offers a platform for market makers to manage crypto&nbsp;trading.</blockquote><blockquote>In addition to potentially securing a powerful new partner for their portfolio companies, Paradigm and Sequoia could also benefit from investing in a company that’s well-positioned to be a major player in crypto trading, in the event that the Securities and Exchange Commission recognizes digital currencies as securities. That move seems likely given SEC Chair Gary Gensler’s recent attitude.</blockquote><blockquote>Even though many crypto advocates don’t consider digital currencies to be securities, Paradigm and Sequoia seem to be betting on that to change with their investment. Citadel Securities already has two decades of experience in trading securities and established relationships with regulators, although it has recently tangled with the SEC. Its deep connections could help it quickly become a crypto market maker in compliance with emerging regulations. Citadel Securities could also let Paradigm, which helped create a digital currency lobbying group, gain better access to regulators.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/11/paradigm-sequoia-to-invest-115b-in-citadel-securities-bringing-trading-firm-closer-to-crypto/">Paradigm, Sequoia to Invest $1.15B in Citadel Securities</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/11/business/dealbook/citadel-sequoia-paradigm.html">Ken Griffin’s Trading Powerhouse Gains New&nbsp;Partners</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-exchange-ftx-sets-up-2-billion-venture-fund-11642163402">WSJ News Exclusive | Crypto Exchange FTX Sets Up $2 Billion Venture&nbsp;Fund</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/visa-partners-with-consensys-to-develop-cbdc-on-ramp-tool/">Visa Partners With ConsenSys to Develop CBDC On-ramp Tool — Blockworks</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/12/us-banks-form-group-to-offer-usdf-stablecoin/">US Banks Form Group to Offer USDF Stablecoin</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-07/paypal-is-exploring-launch-of-own-stablecoin-in-crypto-push">PayPal Explores Launch of Own Stablecoin in Crypto&nbsp;Push</a>  <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/venmo-paypal-zelle-must-report-600-transactions-irs-rcna11260">Venmo, PayPal and Zelle must report $600+ in transactions to&nbsp;IRS</a>   6.

<p>We are thrilled to announce the launch of <a href="https://socialkyc.io/">SocialKYC</a>, a service for regaining control over your digital identity using KILT Protocol. SocialKYC is a building block for making online services in Web3 better and safer, providing a way to return your credentials to where they belong — with&nbsp;you!</p><p>KYC or “Know Your Customer” is standard practice while opening an account with a bank or exchange, where customers must prove they possess government-issued credentials like a passport. SocialKYC gives the user power to extend trust in a similar way, by building a digital identity using their social accounts.</p><p>SocialKYC and <a href="https://www.sporran.org/">Sporran</a>, the KILT wallet, were built by B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH (B.T.E.) a subsidiary of BOTLabs GmbH, the initial developer of KILT. Used together, SocialKYC and Sporran allow users to manage and store their personal credentials, and decide which elements of their private information they share with online services.</p><p>SocialKYC issues credentials to users confirming the ownership of their email address or social media accounts after the user proves that they control the account. Unlike sign-in processes on the internet to date, SocialKYC then forgets about the user and the credential as soon as the credential is issued. The credential, the personal information, and the control remain with the&nbsp;user.</p><p>How it&nbsp;works:</p>  SocialKYC first sends the user a simple task to verify their control of a specific account (confirm your email address; Tweet this message to prove this is your account).  After a successful check, SocialKYC issues a credential to the user. The user can save the credential in their Sporran wallet, which is installed locally on their computer. The credential states the ownership of the specific&nbsp;account.  This personal data is not stored or shared by SocialKYC. It remains in the user’s Sporran wallet under their full&nbsp;control.  Using Sporran on their local computer, users can later send their credential to any online service that accepts the credential.  Users can also choose to publish one or more of their credentials, making them accessible to anyone. Published credentials can be unpublished by the user at any&nbsp;time.  <p>Create your identity and get your first KILT credentials now! Here’s how to get&nbsp;started:</p> Get Your&nbsp;Sporran <p>The first step is setting up your Sporran, a browser extension for Firefox and Chrome that serves as a wallet for your KILT credentials and KILT Coins. Download this at<a href="https://www.sporran.org/"> sporran.org,</a> then <a href="https://support.kilt.io/support/solutions/articles/80000959735-how-do-i-create-a-kilt-sporran-identity-">follow our step-by-step guide</a> to set it&nbsp;up.</p> Create Your KILT&nbsp;Identity <p>In KILT, identity starts with a unique decentralized identifier (<a href="https://dev.kilt.io/docs/sdk/core-feature/did">DID</a>), represented by a string of numbers and&nbsp;letters:</p><p>did:kilt:light:014sxSYXakw1ZXBymzT9t3Yw91mUaqKST5bFUEjGEpvkTuckar</p><p>You will get your first DID as part of the Sporran setup. Your digital identity is built by adding different credentials like email, Twitter account, passport, certificates, etc. to this identifier. You may even want to create several digital identities; one personal, one for work, one for&nbsp;gaming.</p> Get Your KILT Credentials <p>Once your Sporran is set up, follow our guide to creating your email credential or Twitter credential via SocialKYC <a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SocialKYC_How_To_Create_Identity_19Jan.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>By default, these free credentials are anchored on the KILT blockchain and are linked to a “light” DID that lives on the computer it was created&nbsp;on.</p><p>Credentials for platforms such as Discord, GitHub, and others are coming soon, which will support use cases like gaming, e-sports leagues, health care, academia, media, and decentralized social networks. We’ll announce SocialKYC partner integrations as they happen, so keep an eye on our <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> account and&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">blog</a>.</p> Upgrading to a Full&nbsp;DID <p>The Sporran also provides the option to upgrade to a “full” on-chain DID. This allows you to create a service endpoint such as a url, providing a way to make your credentials public and making it easier for online services to access&nbsp;them.</p><p>Upgrading to a full DID requires a transaction fee payable in KILT (currently less than 0.01 KILT) and a deposit of 2 KILT. The deposit is designed to incentivize users to clear the data from the blockchain once it is not needed any longer, reducing wasted storage space. If you choose to delete a DID at a later date, this deposit is returned.</p><p>This could also be of use, for example, for companies who want to share their product credentials, etc. The full DID also allows the owner to set additional keys for different purposes beyond authentication, including attestation and delegation. This would allow the owner to issue their own credentials and create delegation hierarchies — useful in a company where several employees would be involved in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>On-chain DIDs will also be useful for individuals who want to publish their credentials, use key rotation for extra security, and anchor their DID anchored on the blockchain.</p><p>See how to upgrade&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SocialKYC_How_To_Create_On-Chain_DIDs_19Jan.pdf">here</a>.</p> Start Building! <p>We’ve created the infrastructure. The rest is up to you, the Web3 community! Got an idea? Build it! We can’t wait to see you create services that use SocialKYC to make Web3 a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Go to our <a href="https://dev.kilt.io/">dev site</a>, read our documentation, and check out the open-source SDK. If you’re not already in the community, join our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/HztRqvzbhG">Discord</a> channel. We’re excited to see the apps and concepts you come up with. Don’t forget, KILT Treasury funds are available for creating infrastructure or initiatives that benefit the&nbsp;network.</p><p>We’ve started the ball rolling with a fun use case — a SocialKYC launch raffle on <a href="https://clankilt.io/raffle">ClanKILT</a>. Set up your credentials with SociaKYC, then enter to win limited edition KILT and Sporran&nbsp;swag.</p><p>Keep an eye out for more exciting uses for the full DID coming soon, like&nbsp;DIDsign!</p> About B.T.E.

Community Growth   This week, DuMont, an outstanding Harbinger from our English community, published《<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/staking-vs-candidate-node-ownership-9191bfbd5661">Staking vs Candidate Node Ownership</a>》, which introduced the Ontology staking strategy for the community members in detail. The article answered questions relating to ”How to participate in Ontology staking”, “How to launch a candidate node?”, and more. Community members all said that they have benefited a&nbsp;lot.  This week, Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community, was invited to join the AMA held by <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1481824177879273477?s=20">BingX</a>. He shared Ontology’s long-term efforts and future goals, with a focus on DID and data. He explained how users will be on-boarded into the Ontology experience for secure, self-sovereign control over their digital existence. Humpty also interpreted Ontology 2022 Roadmap: From the very inception of the project, the aim has been to build the infrastructure required for users to interact with this new generation of decentralized applications, and that aim has not&nbsp;changed.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1481710138624929795?s=20">weekly Discord Community Call</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1483363542262640645?s=20">Telegram Community Call</a>, with the theme “Staking”. For those who are new to Staking, they rely more on APY when choosing a node, while Ontology Harbinger Polaris and SG Node believe that it is necessary to pay more attention to the revenue distribution ratio of each node. It is necessary to check the comparison before the start of each Consensus Round, which can reduce problems such as staking reward&nbsp;losses.  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He talked with community members about DID, including its function, meaning, and the changes it brings to Web3. The Ontology community believes that DID will be an indispensable foundation in Web3; by comprehensively deploying DID, Web3 will realize the protection of identity and privacy, and truly return data ownership to&nbsp;users.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Global News   Li Jun, Founder of Ontology, was invited to participate in an exclusive interview hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoCoinShow/status/1482817191619829762?s=20">Crypto Coin Show</a>, and shared the latest progress of Ontology EVM. He said that Virtual Machines (VMs) play a crucial role in both the aforementioned need for interoperability and in the expansion of applications built on Ontology. The Ontology EVM will be launched in Q1 2022, and aims to establish seamless interoperability between Ontology and the Ethereum platform and to offer an inclusive experience to developers and&nbsp;users.  Moonstake published a series of articles to introduce their strategic partners. In the article 《<a href="https://moonstake.io/what-you-need-to-know-about-ontology-in-2022/">What You Need to Know about Ontology in 2022</a>》, Moonstake elaborated on Ontology’s plans and goals for 2022, stating that they are proud to be strategic partners of Ontology. They will continue to maintain strong support for the ever-growing and developing Ontology ecosystem in 2022, building Web3 infrastructure with Ontology together.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Finextra — 《<a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/21543/five-digital-identity-trends-to-watch-in-2022">Five Digital Identity Trends to Watch in&nbsp;2022</a>》</p><p>“In 2020, the world went online and fraudsters were quick to pounce on the opportunities as businesses rapidly digitised their operations. The wave of opportunistic fraudsters drove the rate of identity document (ID) fraud up by 41% in 2020. Given the rise in sophisticated identity fraud over the past 12 months and the staggering<a href="https://aite-novarica.com/report/us-identity-theft-stark-reality"> losses of $712 billion</a> as a result, it is critical that organisations understand the most common trends and take the necessary steps to protect themselves. ”</p><p>With the continuous development of decentralized technology, decentralized identity is getting more and more attention. Whether it is traditional Internet giants or blockchain start-ups, they are building their own decentralized identity solutions based on blockchain technology, and are committed to building a new generation of Internet with more security and privacy.

<p>Many industries are seeing a significant increase in the use of digital services. Of course, this has been ongoing for some time, but the COVID-19 pandemic has expedited it.   &nbsp;</p>



 With more digital services comes an increased risk of fraudulent activity 



<p>As customer onboarding and verification become automated, there are new challenges with which we must deal. Regulation has been devised to address such matters through the control and use of technical solutions and the checks and processes which currently exist. &nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow has developed solutions that offer state-of-the-art video-based and biometric onboarding. These have been designed to meet regulations in Europe and the Middle East. They continue to do so as regulations expand and tighten, particularly as our industry evolves and becomes more engrained as a standard part of the AML / KYC process. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The UAE is one of the furthest ahead countries in the Middle East. It has technology, AML, and electronic signature regulation in place. The country has also adopted full use of national identities. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">IDnow’s AutoIdent</a> product is ready to meet UAE regulations and help financial institutions realize the security and user experience benefits of automated verification.  (See also our article: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uae-accelerates-automated-identity-verification/">UAE accelerates use for automated identity verification</a>)</p>



 Growth of identity verification and regulation &nbsp; 



<p>Video and automated onboarding has increased in recent years, along with controlling regulations. Of course, there is a need to ensure secure processes, both in identity matching and in the wider area of safeguarding against fraud and money-laundering activity. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Europe and the UK have been leading developers of identity regulation. The first AML laws (the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/">EU Anti-Money Laundering Directives</a>) were released in 1991, following Financial Action Task Force  (FATF) guidance. Germany – traditionally a highly regulated market – later moved to allow video-based identity verification. Many other countries have since done the same. Being more deregulated in this area, the UK is one of the most supportive.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>This use and approval of video-based verification have quickly expanded to further automated and biometric verification. Many EU countries now permit some form of electronic identification / verification, and the trend is well set for expansion. &nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s verification solutions have been developed alongside this growth. They aim to fully support new and evolving technology while also meeting the latest regulations. Many of such regulations throughout the Eurozone, have been promulgated with the input of IDnow and our relationships with national and international contacts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>VideoIdent was launched in 2014, largely to meet German regulators’ requirements for video-based identity verification. As regulations and technology evolved, AutoIdent was launched as a single solution offering greater user experience, faster conversion rates, and added security against fraud. </p>



<p>AutoIdent takes VideoIdent further and offers fully-automated biometric identity verification with video or agent fallback. As a fully automated or hybrid solution, Autoident encompasses current and the most recent developments in digital identity verification. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Read on: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/id-verification-autoident-meeting-eu-regulations/">ID Verification with AutoIdent – meeting European Regulations</a></p>



<p>The regulatory trend to allow biometric solutions that rely on automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to onboard customers is evolving across Europe, Asia, and now the Middle East. &nbsp;</p>



 UAE regulations &nbsp; 



<p>For technical regulation, the UAE follows joint guidelines issued by The UAE Central Bank, Securities and Commodities Authority, the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) of the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) of Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM). They have jointly issued “<a href="https://www.centralbank.ae/sites/default/files/2021-11/Guidelines%20for%20Financial%20Institutions%20adopting%20Enabling%20Technologies%2020211107.pdf">Guidelines for Financial Institutions Adopting Enabling Technologies.</a>“   &nbsp;</p>



<p>These regulations apply to all financial institutions that are licensed and supervised under UAE law. In terms of identity verification, these are advanced and far-reaching regulations – going further than many European countries as of early 2022. They permit video onboarding as well as fully automated biometric solutions. The use of NFC technology for reading national identity cards is also permitted. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to these technical regulations, anti-money laundering laws cover monitoring and screening requirements. The primary law in the UAE is ”Federal Decree-Law No. (20) of 2018 On Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism and Financing of Illegal Organisations.” These AML regulations have been designed to follow international FATF guidance, much like the European AMLD regulations.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>The use of electronic signatures is regulated under two separate laws. Federal Law No. 1 of 2006 (eCommerce Law) applies countrywide in the UAE, while Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) has introduced separate legislation under the DIFC Electronic Transactions Law of 2017. These are more open than EU laws, however, and they do not define specific <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">Qualified Electronic Signature</a> standards. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Just as AutoIdent meets European regulations and is used with several financial institutions, it also complies with UAE regulations. The following are some of the main areas to consider. &nbsp;</p>



 Use of AutoIdent to meet UAE regulations for automated identity verification &nbsp; 



<p>UAE regulations permit the use of automated and biometric identity verification. Under the UAE joint regulations, an automated solution should carry out the following steps: &nbsp;</p>



  ID Proofing Check (to check the identity document is valid and genuine) &nbsp;  Similarity Check (to match the person and the identity document) &nbsp;  Liveness Check (to ensure the person is physically present) &nbsp;  



<p>IDnow’s AutoIdent solution is designed to support these steps. Full automated identity verification is also supported by manual verification as a backup. If the AI is unsure of a case (or country regulations require a hybrid approach), <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">manual video-based verification</a> is available to ensure the completion of the process.  &nbsp;</p>



 







 Supporting NFC technology &nbsp; 



<p>The UAE is a leader in the region with its Emirates ID national identity card. This is compulsory for citizens and uses NFC technology. &nbsp;</p>



<p>AutoIdent has the functionality to read biometric data from NFC chips, developed to meet ICAO 9303 standard. NFC is currently used to read German identity cards but can work with any chips using global standards – such as the Emirates ID.  &nbsp;</p>



 Meeting AML regulations &nbsp; 



<p>AutoIdent has been developed for compliance alongside EU AMLD regulations, and it fully meets the requirements of the latest 4AMLD, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld5-anti-money-laundering-directive/">5AMLD</a>, and 6AMLD updates.  These regulations have evolved to respond to criminal behaviour changes and increasing sophistication of methods used.  </p>



<p>UAE AML regulations, despite being first released later than EU regulations, incorporate many of the main advances seen in AMLD. This includes key areas such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Political Exposed Persons (PEP)</a> and checking sanction lists.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Under AML regulations (AML-CFT Decision 4.2(b), 7.2, 15, 22, 25), enhanced due diligence must be carried out for PEPs and customers associated with high-risk countries. AutoIdent offers this functionality through add-on modules to the single platform. It handles fully compliant <a href="https://www.idnow.io/aml-screening-monitoring/">AML Screening &amp; Monitoring</a>. This includes checking Politically Exposed Person (PEP) and Sanction Lists. &nbsp;</p>



 Use of Qualified Electronic Signatures &nbsp; 



<p>The use of QES is relatively new in the UAE but is permitted in many areas. Crucially, the UAE’s laws allow the use of electronic signatures and state that a contract may not be deemed invalid or unenforceable solely because it is in electronic format. However, acceptance and legal basis are more open than under European regulations.   &nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/electronic-signature/">Electronic Signatures</a> can only be used in some areas. Traditional paper signatures are currently still required for transactions involving immoveable property, negotiable instruments, civil documents, and other processes that require a notary public.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>AutoIdent fully supports eIDAS regulations for the use of Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES). Neither the UAE E-Commerce Law nor the DIFC law prescribes specific technical criteria for acceptable signatures, and as such, QES would not be automatically deemed acceptable. Working to the highest QES standards with a reputable provider is the best way forward, though. With limited use to date, the area is somewhat untested. &nbsp;</p>

 Moving to more automation in the future &nbsp; 



<p>Many countries are rapidly moving towards greater use of automated identity verification and electronic signatures. In Europe, Germany, Austria, Spain, and the UK all permit this process, and more are moving this way. The UAE is a leader in the Middle East, but other countries will likely follow. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Recently, in August 2021, Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank reported that it had successfully implemented automated customer onboarding. This uses facial recognition techniques combined with reading NFC data from a customer’s Emirates ID card and passport.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow firmly believes that the industry is moving to document and biometric-centered identity verification – in the Middle East and elsewhere. There is growing evidence that automatic techniques are more secure than manual ones in many areas (especially facial recognition). The FATF now supports this, and many more regulators are likely to follow its guidance.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>For a more in-depth look at AutoIdent, how it has evolved, and how it offers a well-thought-out balance between security and user experience, take a look at IDnow’s <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/evolution-id-verification-idnow-platform/">recent webinar</a>. &nbsp;</p>

 Understanding containers vs. virtual machines 

<p>In 2013, <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> was released, beginning a shift in how we think about hosting applications and managing infrastructure. Infrastructure teams and operations had been leveraging virtual machines with great success for decades, so you may be tempted to think, “isn’t this just a virtual machine?” In spirit, yes; in application, no.</p>

<p>To talk about containers, we have to talk about virtual machines. A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual representation of a computer, all the way from its boot process to loading an entire operating system (OS). This provides a lot of flexibility. You gain fine-grained control over an entire virtual computer, as well as all the pitfalls of a whole computer. The operating system has to be maintained, patched, and updated; disks have to be managed, and all manner of operational overhead goes into their care and feeding. Notably, VMs are huge because an entire OS has to go on them. So when you start a VM, you have to go through the entire boot sequence of a traditional computer.</p>

<p>There are three major problem areas that containers hope to solve: ease of management, size, and speed to start. There are others, but for simplicity, I will focus on those that are the most relevant to business processes. Containers differ from traditional virtual machines in one significant way. They do not have an actual OS. This may come as a surprise to you, even if you’ve dabbled in containers before. Instead, containers rely on an abstraction of an operating system that provides hooks into the host OS using standards and conventions supplied by the container system.</p>

<p>Docker is the de facto container standard for all practical purposes, but other container technologies do exist. The notion of a standardized container comes from the shipping industry. In shipping, there was no standardization, which made transport difficult because you had to figure out how to hold each item on a boat, train, or truck. Containers provided a standard format for moving goods: “You can put whatever you want inside the container so long as it conforms to a standard set of dimensions and can be opened and bolted down in a uniform way.” This simplified the logistical process of moving real-world items. In this same way, standardizing the way a software container interacts with its host OS to delegate the responsibility for executing tasks simplifies management of the most crucial part, the application.</p>

 Hosting containers with AWS ECS Fargate 

<p>Now that we have a better idea of what makes a container different from a virtual machine, how does this solve our three problems?</p>

<p>First, containers make management easier by letting us write build scripts to create a stable, repeatable representation of the host. This is needed to do the body of work required by the application. Second, since an OS ultimately hosts the container, that OS can enforce company and security policies. In the worst case, this would be the most a given container could do. For example, if the host OS only allows traffic inbound from a specific subnet and port, the container cannot override this restriction. The container is ultimately bound by the host OS’s networking rules.</p>

<p>This kind of management reliability continues into data management, memory management, and any other policies that need to be enforced. Ultimately, the result here is business agility. Operations can open the doors to developers knowing that established guide rails are in place. As for size–our second key problem area–since you no longer need a whole OS, container images are often as small as a few MB vs. many GB. On the topic of speed–our third key problem area–since there isn’t a complete boot cycle, the container can effectively start up as fast as the hosted application.</p>

<p>The difficulty with containers moves further up the abstraction chain (as is the style of such things) than virtual machines. The challenge comes down to networking and managing container images across many resources so that you can treat a set of computing as one homogeneous unit. Fortunately, products like Kubernetes, OpenShift, Mesos, Nomad, and others can help you solve these challenges. However, you are ultimately back to managing a fleet of computers along with the associated management overhead.</p>

<p>This is the sweet spot of AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) Fargate. Fargate gives you networking abstractions across a virtual network known as a VPC (virtual private cloud). This network abstraction is built right into the heart of AWS and is well vetted for any type of workload, including high-security government workloads. Fargate takes this a step further by abstracting away the machine management. You can set up traditional clusters and manage your machines if you want, but leveraging Fargate simplifies one more part of your process. Ultimately the goal with using cloud vendors is to let them handle the infrastructure management so you can focus on managing your business.</p>

<p>Time to jump in and try out .NET containers with AWS Fargate!</p>

<p>What you will need to get started</p>

<p>What you’ll need to continue are the following:</p>

 
   Basic knowledge of .NET 
   <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-in/dotnet/core/install/">.NET SDK 3.1</a> 
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free">An AWS account (you’ll be using a free tier product)</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> 
   <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS CLI V2</a> 
   <a href="https://www.docker.com/get-started">Docker Desktop for Windows/macOS (Not required if you are on Linux)</a> 
 

<p>This tutorial assumes you already have Docker set up and running.</p>

 Build and dockerize a .NET chat application 

<p>So what do you want to build? To keep things simple and see the value in using something other than standard HTTP protocols, you’ll use SignalR to build a very basic chat application.</p>

 
   Secure: Only logged-in clients should be able to use the chat functionality 
   Chat users’ names must come from their validated identity 
   Real-time 
 

<p>To achieve this, I am going to use four technologies:</p>

 
   Okta for identity management 
   .NET to host the application 
   SignalR to provide the socket management abstraction 
   Vue.js to provide the rendering for the front-end 
 

 Authentication for Your .NET chat app 

<p>Authentication is vital in any application, but doubly so when you need to depend on who someone is. Okta makes it really easy to delegate access to those who need it and shut down access across the entire suite of applications if a bad actor gets a set of credentials.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Other. 
    Then, change the Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:5000/authorization-code/callback</code> and accept the default Logout Redirect URI of <code>http://localhost:5000</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>

   <code>export OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS"
</code>   

<p>Your Okta domain is the first part of your issuer, before <code>/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Web App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Note the Issuer URL and Client ID. You will need this in the next step.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: To test out your chat application, don’t forget to manually add a second user to your Okta org. Log in to your Okta org and navigate to the Directory &gt; People page. Click the Add person button and fill out the form.</p>
</blockquote>

 Set up a .NET Core web application 

<p>Let us create a new ASP.NET Core web application using the <code>dotnet</code> CLI. Navigate to the location where you want to create the project and run the following command.</p>

   <code>dotnet new webapp -n Okta.Blog.Chat
</code>   

<p>Let’s call the project Okta.Blog.Chat.</p>

<p>Now, set up your Okta application credentials by opening appsettings.json and add the following to the JSON object after AllowedHosts:</p>

   <code>"OktaSettings": {
  "OktaDomain": "{yourOktaDomain}",
  "ClientId": "{yourOktaClientID}",
  "ClientSecret": "{yourOktaClientSecret}"
}
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: You can find the required values from the .okta.env file created at the folder where you executed the <code>okta apps create</code> command. The value of <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> should be something like <code>https://dev-123456.okta.com</code>. Make sure you don’t include <code>-admin</code> in the value!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Make sure to exclude appsettings.json from Git so that you don’t accidentally commit your client secret. You can generate a .gitignore file by running the command <code>dotnet new gitignore</code>.</p>

<p>Now you’ll need to add the authentication library. Run the following command inside the Okta.Blog.Chat folder.</p>

   <code>dotnet add package Okta.AspNetCore
</code>   

<p>Now modify Startup.cs to use the Okta authentication provider.</p>

<p>Modify the method <code>ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)</code> to look like the code below. A line is commented out on purpose. You will use it later for authorization.</p>

   <code>public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    var oktaMvcOptions = new OktaMvcOptions()
    {
        OktaDomain = Configuration["OktaSettings:OktaDomain"],
        ClientId = Configuration["OktaSettings:ClientId"],
        ClientSecret = Configuration["OktaSettings:ClientSecret"],
        Scope = new List&lt;string&gt; { "openid", "profile", "email" },
    };

    services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
    {
        options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
        options.DefaultSignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
        options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme;
    })
    .AddCookie()
    .AddOktaMvc(oktaMvcOptions);

    services.AddRazorPages()
    .AddRazorPagesOptions(options =&gt;
    {
        //options.Conventions.AuthorizePage("/Chat");
    });
    services.AddSignalR();
}
</code>   

<p>Make sure to add imports.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Okta.AspNetCore;
using Okta.Blog.Chat.Hubs;
</code>   

<p>This will add the authentication provider, set the page Chat as an authorized page, and add SignalR support.</p>

<p>Next, modify the method <code>Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)</code> to look like the code below. A line is commented out on purpose, you will use it later during our SignalR setup.</p>

   <code>public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
{
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
    {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
    }
    else
    {
        app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
        // The default HSTS value is 30 days. You may want to change this for production scenarios, see https://aka.ms/aspnetcore-hsts.
        app.UseHsts();
    }

    app.UseHttpsRedirection();
    app.UseStaticFiles();

    app.UseRouting();

    app.UseAuthentication();
    app.UseAuthorization();

    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
    {
        endpoints.MapRazorPages();
        //endpoints.MapHub&lt;ChatHub&gt;("/chathub");
    });
}
</code>   

<p>The key difference here is <code>app.UseAuthentication();</code>.</p>

<p>Next, create a new folder called Hubs and a new class file in that folder called ChatHub.cs. This will provide our chat backend.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.SignalR;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Okta.Blog.Chat.Hubs
{
    public class ChatHub : Hub
    {
        public async Task SendMessage(string message)
        {
            if (this.Context.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
                await Clients.All.SendAsync("ReceiveMessage", this.Context.User.Identity.Name, message);
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>You’ll see in this class you’ve made use of the user’s authentication status. This way, even if someone knows the backend is SignalR, you’ve mitigated their ability to use the system unless explicitly authenticated. Any additional authorization logic could go here as well.</p>

<p>Next, you need to make sure you have the pages you need. In the Pages folder, go ahead and delete the page Privacy.cshtml and Privacy.cshtml.cs and add a new page named Chat.cshtml by running the following command from the Pages folder.</p>

   <code>dotnet new page -n Chat
</code>   

<p>Edit Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml and modify the second nav item from this:</p>

   <code>&lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-page="/Privacy"&gt;Privacy&lt;/a&gt;
</code>   

<p>To this:</p>

   <code>&lt;a class="nav-link text-dark" asp-area="" asp-page="/Chat"&gt;Chat&lt;/a&gt;
</code>   

<p>Now, if you run the <code>dotnet run</code> command or run the application from Visual Studio, you should be able to navigate to the chat page with the heading “Chat”. Make sure that it runs successfully before moving on to the next step.</p>

 Add Docker support to your .NET chat application 

<p>Before you add the chat functionality, add the Docker support. Add a file named Dockerfile to the root Okta.Blog.Chat folder with the following content:</p>

   <code># build and publish the app
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:3.1-bullseye AS build
WORKDIR /src
## copy csproj and restore as distinct layers
COPY Okta.Blog.Chat.csproj ./
RUN dotnet restore
## copy everything else and publish app
COPY . ./
RUN dotnet publish -c release -o /app --no-restore

# final stage/image
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:3.1-bullseye-slim AS base
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app ./
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "Okta.Blog.Chat.dll"]
</code>   

<p>We are building and publishing our application first. Next, you will copy the build files and call <code>ENTRYPOINT</code>, which translates to “run dotnet with our published DLL” - nothing extraordinary, right? The <code>FROM</code> keywords use other built docker files as base images to build our image from, so the work of installing .NET is already done.</p>

<p>Now add a .dockerignore file with the below content so that they are not copied to the final image.</p>

   <code>**/.dockerignore
**/.git
**/.vscode
**/bin
**/obj
</code>   

<p>If you use Visual Studio, you’ll now have the ability to debug right into a running container in your debug toolbar. If you press F5 or click the play button, you’ll run your app in a Docker Container.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If you are not using Visual Studio, run the following command to build and start the container.</p>

   <code>docker build . -t okta-chat
docker run -it --rm -p 5000:80 okta-chat
</code>   

<p>The app should be accessible at <code>http://localhost:5000/</code>.</p>

 Authorize Your chat app 

<p>Modify Setup.cs and uncomment the following line.</p>

   <code>options.Conventions.AuthorizePage("/Chat");
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: At this point, if you try to authenticate the <code>/Chat</code> path using Google Chrome, you’ll get an error. This is because you are running the app without TLS and Chrome blocks set-cookie headers with <code>SameSite=None</code> when the <code>Secure</code> attribute is not present (which will be preset only for HTTPS requests).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s make sure our docker container can run with HTTPS.</p>

<p>First, you need to create a certificate. You can use the .NET CLI for creating self-signed certificates for development. Please note that this is only for development purposes and should not be used in production.</p>

<p>Run the following command to create a self-signed certificate. Use the correct command based on your OS and use an appropriate password.</p>

   <code># clean existing certs if any
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
# create a new cert on macOS/Linux
dotnet dev-certs https -ep ${HOME}/.aspnet/https/aspnetapp.pfx -p mypass123
# create a new cert on Windows
dotnet dev-certs https -ep %USERPROFILE%\.aspnet\https\aspnetapp.pfx -p mypass123
# trust the cert
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
</code>   

<p>Now you can run the container with HTTPS using the below command. You will use the certificate you created above and mount it as a volume.</p>

   <code># macOS/Linux
docker run -it --rm -p 5000:80 -p 5001:443 -e ASPNETCORE_URLS="https://+;http://+" -e ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=5001 -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password="mypass123" -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=/https/aspnetapp.pfx -v ${HOME}/.aspnet/https:/https/ okta-chat

# Windows
docker run -it --rm -p 5000:80 -p 5001:443 -e ASPNETCORE_URLS="https://+;http://+" -e ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=5001 -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password="mypass123" -e ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=/https/aspnetapp.pfx -v %USERPROFILE%\.aspnet\https:/https/ okta-chat
</code>   

<p>The app should be accessible at <code>https://localhost:5001/</code> now.</p>

<p>In your Okta Developer Portal, go to Applications &gt; Applications and click the application name you created using the CLI. Edit the General Settings, and add URI for Sign-in redirect URIs and Sign-out redirect URIs as below:</p>

   <code>Sign-in redirect URI = https://localhost:5001/authorization-code/callback
Sign-out redirect URI = https://localhost:5001/
</code>   

<p>Try running the application. You should see that to open the chat page, you’ll be redirected to the Okta Single Sign-On portal and then redirected back. You are now successfully authenticated.</p>

 Add chat functionality with Vue.js and SignalR 

<p>You’ll use Vue for state management since you can take as little or as much as you want. With Vue, you. can start with a CDN script tag and use it for a single component, a single page, or a deep dive with a robust build system on Node. For this exercise, you’ll be using a CDN-hosted script.</p>

<p>But first, you need to finish one thing on the backend.</p>

<p>Since you have created your ChatHub.cs, open Startup.cs and uncomment the following line:</p>

   <code>endpoints.MapHub&lt;ChatHub&gt;("/chathub");
</code>   

<p>Now modify the Chat.cshtml file to look like this:</p>

   <code>@page

&lt;div id="chatApp"&gt;
  &lt;div class="container"&gt;
    &lt;div class="row"&gt;
      &lt;div class="col-2"&gt;Message&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="col-4"&gt;
        &lt;input type="text" v-model="message" id="message" /&gt;
        &lt;input type="button" v-on:click.stop.prevent="sendMessage" id="sendButton" value="Send Message" /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-12"&gt;
      &lt;hr /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="col-6"&gt;
      &lt;ul id="messagesList"&gt;
        &lt;li v-for="(item, index) in chatLog" :key="index"&gt;{{ item.User }} - {{ item.Message }}&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/aspnet-signalr/1.0.27/signalr.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3.2.24/dist/vue.global.prod.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder().withUrl("/chatHub").build();

  const VueChatApp = {
    data() {
      return {
        isConnected: false,
        message: "",
        chatLog: [],
      };
    },
    mounted() {
      connection.on("ReceiveMessage", (user, message) =&gt; {
        this.receiveMessage(user, message);
      });
      connection
        .start()
        .then(() =&gt; {
          this.isConnected = true;
        })
        .catch((err) =&gt; {
          return console.error(err.toString());
        });
    },
    methods: {
      receiveMessage(user, message) {
        this.chatLog.push({
          User: user,
          Message: message,
        });
      },
      sendMessage() {
        connection
          .invoke("SendMessage", this.message)
          .then(() =&gt; {
            this.message = "";
          })
          .catch((err) =&gt; {
            return console.error(err.toString());
          });
      },
    },
  };

  Vue.createApp(VueChatApp).mount("#chatApp");
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>We use CDN for the SignalR client library, and the connection to the ChatHub uses the endpoint you set earlier:</p>

   <code>const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder().withUrl("/chatHub").build();
</code>   

<p>The state is stored in the data section of our Vue app. There are three properties in use: a flag to let us know if it is connected, the message currently being typed, and a chat log.</p>

   <code>data() {
  return {
    isConnected: false,
    message: "",
    chatLog: [],
  }
},
</code>   

<p>Your app has two methods: <code>receiveMessage</code> and <code>sendMessage</code>.</p>

<p>When <code>receiveMessage</code> is called, it appends an object to the chat log with the user and the message.</p>

<p>When <code>sendMessage</code> is called, you use the SignalR connection to invoke “SendMessage” and pass along our message properties. Once the message is sent, you blank it out to fill a new message.</p>

   <code>receiveMessage(user, message) {
  this.chatLog.push({
    User: user,
    Message: message,
  });
},
sendMessage() {
  connection
    .invoke("SendMessage", this.message)
    .then(() =&gt; {
      this.message = "";
    })
    .catch((err) =&gt; {
      return console.error(err.toString());
    });
},
</code>   

<p>When the app is created, a hook is added for “ReceiveMessage” that calls the ViewModel <code>receiveMessage</code> method described previously.</p>

<p>Then the connection to the hub is started, and if successful, <code>isConnected</code> is set to true.</p>

   <code>connection.on("ReceiveMessage", (user, message) =&gt; {
  this.receiveMessage(user, message);
});
connection
  .start()
  .then(() =&gt; {
    this.isConnected = true;
  })
  .catch((err) =&gt; {
    return console.error(err.toString());
  });
</code>   

<p>If you run your application at this point, you’ll have a secured chat application running in a container!</p>

 Deploy your .NET chat application to AWS 

<p>Now that the chat application is complete, it’s time to deploy. First, you need to build the docker image and deploy it for use in AWS. AWS has private container repositories via its Elastic Container Registry (ECR) product.</p>

 Create an ECR repository 

<p>First, you need to make one final change to the Dockerfile to get TLS working on Fargate.</p>

<p>Add the following two lines to the Dockerfile right after the <code>dotnet publish</code> command:</p>

   <code># build and publish the app
...
RUN dotnet publish -c release -o /app --no-restore

ARG CERT_PASSWORD
RUN dotnet dev-certs https -ep /app/aspnetapp.pfx -p ${CERT_PASSWORD}

# final stage/image
...
</code>   

<p>This will create a self-signed development certificate right within the docker image, which you can use to run the application with TLS on Fargate for demo purposes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: This type of development certificate is not recommended for production use. It is used here for simplicity in a demo. For a production setup, you should use a certificate signed by a certificate authority. Recommendation: to run a production .NET application on ECS, use an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) to route traffic to a reverse proxy (Nginx) via an HTTPS listener configured to use a certificate signed by a certificate authority. The reverse proxy would then route traffic to the application. The reverse proxy and the application should also be configured to use TLS using valid certificates.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Log in to your AWS console and navigate to ECR.</p>

<p>Click Create Repository.</p>

<p>For visibility settings, choose Private and name your repository. Then click Create Repository at the bottom of the wizard.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Navigate to okta-chat and click View push commands. This has all the steps you’ll need to build and push your image to ECR.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Follow the steps and push the images to ECR. Make sure to pass <code>--build-arg CERT_PASSWORD=mypass123</code> to the <code>docker build</code> command like below.</p>

   <code>docker build --build-arg CERT_PASSWORD=mypass123 -t okta-chat .
</code>   

<p>Select the copy button in the URI column next to your image and save that for later. This is the path to your image.</p>

<p></p>

 Set up the ECS Fargate cluster 

<p>Now set up your ECS cluster.</p>

<p>On the left menu, click Clusters under Amazon ECS, then click the Create Cluster button.</p>

<p>Click Networking Only &gt; Next step from the options.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I named my cluster “okta-test”, name yours as you see fit, and click Create on the following screen. Then click View Cluster.</p>

<p>Now that the cluster is set up you’ll need to create a task for your image.</p>

<p>Click Task Definitions on the left menu and click Create new Task Definition.</p>

<p>For launch type, select FARGATE and click Next step.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For the Task Definition Name, I named mine okta-chat.</p>

<p>Set the Task memory (GB) to 0.5 GB.
Set the Task CPU to 0.25 vCPU.</p>

<p>.NET Core applications are very efficient, as are containers. For many applications, you’ll find you can serve many requests with smaller boxes than you might expect.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Leave other options unchanged.</p>

<p>Now you need to define the image you want to use. Click Add Container.</p>

<p>Let us name the container the same thing – okta-chat.</p>

<p>For the Image, you’ll need the path you copied from the ECR repository earlier.</p>

<p>Set the soft limit to 512, and add ports 80 and 443.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Scroll down to the ENVIRONMENT section and add the following key-value pairs:</p>

   <code>ASPNETCORE_URLS="https://+;http://+"
ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORT=443
ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password="mypass123"
ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path=./aspnetapp.pfx
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>Click Add at the bottom of the pop-up. Now click Create at the bottom of the page. Go back to your cluster, click on the Tasks tab, and click Run new Task.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: Here’s a recommendation: Create services instead of tasks for production to take full advantage of the elastic scaling capabilities of ECS. I’m using tasks directly for the simplicity of the demo. When using an ALB (application load balancer) to route traffic to the application, use of services is also required.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>Select FARGATE as Launch type.</p>

<p>Select your default VPC and Subnets under VPC and security groups.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click the Edit button next to the security groups. Click on Add rule to add a new inbound rule for HTTPS port 443. Click Save on the pop-up.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, click Run Task.</p>

<p>You’ll be taken back to your cluster. Select the task you created by clicking its ID. Make a note of its public IP; you’ll need that to adjust your Okta application settings.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In your Okta Developer Portal, go to Applications &gt; Applications and click the application’s name you created using the CLI. Edit the General Settings and add URI for Sign-in redirect URIs and Sign-out redirect URIs using the IP address from your running task as shown below:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now, if you navigate to <code>https://YOUR_FARGET_TASK_PUBLIC_IP</code>, you’ll see you are the proud owner of a fully functional chat application, secured with Okta, running in an ECS Fargate container.</p>

 Recap 

<p>Whew, that was a ride! Good job on making your new chat application. What can we take away from this?</p>

 
   Serverless is good for HTTP request/response, but other protocols need something different. 
   Containers are more lightweight than virtual machines but come with their own challenges. 
   A docker file consists of the instructions to build your application and launch it, and which ports to expose. 
   Fargate makes the hosting of containers easier since you don’t have to manage the host machine infrastructure. 
   SignalR makes real-time communication easier by abstracting most of the heavy lifting. 
   Vue can be used for state management without taking on additional build and development pipeline. 
   Okta makes it easier to secure any type of .NET web application. 
   There is no reason to have an insecure site! 
   Use AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) + Nginx configured to use TLS with valid certificates in production.

				  Indicio will upgrade Hyperledger Indy to support “did:indy” DID Method Specification, which will enable greater interoperability across Indy-based networks  
			  
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Indicio has won the&nbsp; <a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/marketplace/opportunities/code-with-us/e3dd1605-cc1d-4c30-a9ee-245940bccd0d">BC Gov “Code With Us” Challenge</a> to develop the did:indy DID Method for the <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a> project, the open source project housed at the Hyperledger Foundation that provides tools, libraries, and reusable components for providing digital identities rooted on blockchains or other distributed ledger. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenge has two goals. The first is to expand the types of content that can be written to DIDDocs, documents that instruct users on which ledger they need to find and read so that they can use verifiable credentials.</p>
<p>Second, the new method will align Hyperledger Indy with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Decentralized Identifier (DID) Specification</a>. Most of Hyperledger Indy’s development occurred prior to the completion of the standard DID Specification by the W3C and, as a result, identifiers written to one network are currently not resolvable on other networks. A new did:indy DID Method will fix that and make it easier for decentralized identity products and services to interoperate across different Indy networks.</p>
<p>“Given the increasing use of Indy Networks, we are grateful to this &lt;/&gt; Code With Us challenge and to BCGov for sponsoring this important contribution,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “As a company, we are committed to open-source development, and we applaud BCGov for its leadership in sponsoring critical development needs that will make interoperability easier and lead to increased adoption. We’re excited to work with BCGov on this—and it means a lot given that several of Indicio’s developers have been contributing to the Hyperledger Indy project since its inception.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;Winning the challenge comes as Indico is about to kick off a series of&nbsp; <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/blog/2021/11/22/hyperledger-foundation-community-training-accelerate-your-decentralized-identity-skills-with-two-free-hyperledger-indy-and-hyperledger-aries-workshops">Hyperledger Community Training Workshops</a> in using the Hyperledger Aries codebases to design and develop decentralized identity solutions. Indicio has made training on all aspects of decentralized identity a key part of its mission and product offerings. Places on the free Hyperledger workshops filled rapidly, so keep an <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">eye out</a> for future events.</p>
<p>To learn more about decentralized identity training, or how to start developing decentralized identity products on the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-testnet/">Indicio TestNet</a>, or how to use our products, services, and hosting to create trusted data ecosystems, please <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">contact us</a>. </p>

<p>I have always given a damn about digital identity.</p>



<p>Hi. <a href="https://wider.team/team/#wolff">I’m Phil Wolff</a>. And this is a personal note to start my year. </p>



<p>I love that digital identity tries to answer deep philosophical questions. What does it mean to be human? How do we trust ourselves and each other? What is the reality we agree on? What is personal integrity? What helps civilization and a civil society endure? What is fairness and justice?</p>



<p>I love that it’s more than a technical discussion. It’s laws. Sociology. Politics and civics. Commerce. Psychology. Ethics. History. Economy. All the humanities.</p>



<p>Identity touches everything. It always will. Computation and communication continue their pervasion, and identity spreads with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Identity ships. I like that a few standards folks have the power to turn grand ideas into covenants into engineering protocols. To settle things for everyone for a while. To versioning something pragmatic that others can build from and evolve.</p>



<p>Shaping identity is a human endeavor. I like the geeky and artistic communities that emerge for a while around problems and opportunities. We show the best of ourselves. Comradery while tackling authenticity and the unidentified. Courage taking on concentrations of power. Conviction while building safety and security for all. Grit for persevering through long slogs to make stuff work. </p>



<p>So I’m passionate for digital identity’s formative process, its purpose, and its impact on our world.</p>



<p>That’s why I organized online for data portability as a human right (DataPortability Project). Why I literally marched on Oakland City Hall for privacy and joined police in working out a surveillance policy (Oakland Privacy). Why I promoted open data and open source in civic projects at more than 150 civic hack nights (OpenOakland). Why I fostered identity-centric startups (PDEC). Why I consult on identity as transformational strategy here with Wider Team.</p>



<p>Since 2021, I’ve worked with standards bodies on digital identity in clinical IoT, trust governance, decentralization and fiduciaries, and biometrics. I hope to continue these efforts along with the growing cadre who focus on the intersection of technology, society, and enterprise. </p>



<p>Have a healthy and impactful 2022, y’all. </p>

<p>Picture above: SSI workshop at Decentralized Web Summit 2018, San Francisco Mint, (left to right) Kim Duffy, Christopher Allen, Jonathan Holt, Daniel Buchner, Christian Lundquist, Markus Sabadello, Eugeniu Rusu, Rouven Heck.</p>



<p>At this point, we know what self-sovereign identity (SSI) is, but where does it come from? A short timeline highlights just how quickly SSI has developed. It underlines the path and development of the evolution of Internet Identity. From a centralized to a federated to a user-centric identity, the self-sovereign identity is seen as the most recent and urgently needed step in this evolution. It is independent from any individual silo, and provides three essential elements: individual control, security, and full portability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The source goes back to the 1990s&nbsp;  



<p>Christopher Allan estimates the birth of SSI in the early 90s (cf. Allan 2016). In 1991, PGP mentions a first hint towards what could become a self-sovereign identity when introducing a ‘Web of Trust’. This was an example of a decentralized trust management, but focusing only on email addresses. Therefore, PGP can be seen as one of the first to highlight a different way, in which identity can be supported by peers instead of centralized authorities. As another early thought, Allan recognizes a paper by Carl Ellison that examined how digital identity was created, published in 1996 (‘Establishing Identity without Certification Authority’). Ellison’s main argument highlighted that there was a need for a method of establishing identity without using certificates from trusted certification authorities (Ellison 1996).&nbsp;</p>



<p>These early approaches could mark the beginning, but it is safe to say that SSI really took off in the 21st century, along with the development and further spread of the internet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, things have changed of course. Essentially, Sovereign is really about the individual being able to control what happens to stuff others (trusted parties) say about them. The community as a whole does not rely on web of trust infrastructure anymore for SSI, but rather connects the SSI technology with the existing trusted certification authorities (ie. the state).&nbsp;</p>



 Taking off: SSI in the 21st century&nbsp; 



<p>In 2000, the Augmented Social Network provided the groundwork for a new digital identity. Their most significant advance was ‘the assumption that every individual ought to have the right to control his or her own online identity’ (Jordan 2003).&nbsp;</p>



<p>One major contribution, paving the way for the SSI development, is the Internet Identity Workshop, which started back in 2001 and introduced on a new term: user-centric identity. It is interesting to notice that the term of self-sovereign identity itself only came into increased use in the late 2010s. At Jolocom, we used the term ‘autonomous identity’ before SSI picked up.&nbsp; One of the first references is Devon Loffreto’s blog post back in 2012, where he wrote about ‘Sovereign Source Authority’ (Loffreto 2012).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Five years later, Phil Windley described self-sovereign identity as an ‘Internet for identity’ (Windley 2012). He highlights three major virtues of such: no one owns it, everyone can use it, and anyone can improve it. Ever since, SSI has grown into an ecosystem aiming to put users in control over their own personal information and data. Identity management can be expected to become increasingly significant due to the rise in digital interactions. Already, self-sovereign identity is becoming a large industry.&nbsp;</p>



 The late 2010s&nbsp; 



<p>A year to remember is 2018. Back then, the emerging SSI community agreed on a high level definition of the term SSI in the Identity Position Paper by Bundesblock for the first time. INATBA’s position paper ‘What’s at stake’ in 2020 built on exactly this foundation and furthermore highlighted possible development scenarios for SSI. These efforts helped to make SSI a priority in the digitalization process within Germany and the EU. In Germany specifically, the SDI (secure digital identities) projects are a significant effort to start an SSI ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On a European level, developments towards an SSI friendly legal framework were proposed by the European Commission in June 2020. The initial examples of successful SSI pilots and projects across EU member states and the international momentum on the topic have found their way into the proposal for an updated eIDAS (electronic Identification, Authentiction and trust Services) regulation. This proposal It is currently being debated by the European Council and the European Parliament&nbsp; and foresees a introduction of European Digital Identity Wallets for all European citizens. The proposed regulation is taking inspiration from self-sovereing identity principles and is a great chance for Europe. It’s main potetnial lies in the provision of a legally binding Trust Framwork, as well as associated Technical Specifications for a coherent technical infrastructure. As a result, if the European Commission has its way, all public services should be available online by 2030 and 80 percent of EU citizens should use an eID solution. &nbsp;</p>



<p>We have been contributing to this process on a German, European and Global level in different capacities of the past years as Jolocom and will do our best to ensure that our vision for an open- and decentralized infrastructure will be achieved.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

			 What does our new strategic partnership with Inveniam mean for issuers? 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>We are off to a great start this year as&nbsp;we teamed up with Inveniam to&nbsp;unlock asset liquidity via tokenization.&nbsp;The partnership comes alongside a €5m investment from Inveniam, Apex Group, and K20 Fund.</p>
 Assets tokenized and priced&nbsp; 
<p>The most exciting part about this partnership is that <a href="https://inveniam.io/inveniamio/">Inveniam’s data solution</a> complements the T-REX ecosystem by providing tokenized assets with a valuation reference, which will fully unlock private market asset liquidity.</p>
 Covering the entire value chain of tokenization 
<p>As a result of this collaboration, securities tokenized through <a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643/">the ERC-3643 standard and the T-REX suite</a> will be enriched with timestamped valuation data linked to their underlying assets. The result? High functioning securities that will unlock liquidity:</p>
 
 Issuance: We provide the enterprise-grade white-label tokenization platform – <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/">T-REX Platform</a> – to help asset managers compliantly bring assets to blockchain. 
 Asset management:&nbsp;Tokenized assets and investors are managed via our T-REX platform. In addition, tokens are enriched by real-time data regarding asset valuation delivered by Inveniam. 
 Secondary trading:&nbsp;Peer-to-peer transfers are available through our compliance framework. With trusted pricing references provided by Inveniam, investors can then make fair deals with confidence. 
 
  
 Accelerating the tokenization adoption&nbsp; 
<p>By addressing the&nbsp;two biggest issues in private markets, which are pricing discovery and compliance, we are now making private market assets more accessible and liquid together with our partner Inveniam.</p>
<p>Additional value to the market will accrue as the partnership will ultimately enable Apex Group, Inveniam’s fund administration partner, to deliver end-to-end cutting-edge services to a broad ecosystem of private asset owners.

SWN Global &amp; MetaMUI x Blockchain Research Institute<p>We are excited to announce that SWN Global and MetaMUI became a Pioneer member of the Blockchain Research Institute(BRI).</p><p>BRI is a globally well known and most active blockchain think tank to be the catalysts of the blockchain transformation. BRI has more than 100 research projects underway to explore, understand, document and inform leaders about blockchain strategies, market opportunities and implementation challenges. All the research and programs done by BRI are funded by BRI members, including enterprise organizations, governments, universities, colleges and blockchain startups from around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Here is a greeting from Don Tapscott, Executive Chairman of the Blockchain Research Institute.<br>“Digital identity and central bank digital currencies are two emerging technologies that will bring about profound changes to businesses, governments, and societies around the world. At the Blockchain Research Institute, we are pleased to collaborate with companies like Sovereign Wallet Network and MetaMUI, who are paving the way for digital transformation using these technologies,”</p><p>We are proud to be one of the members of the BRI and we are excited to do a joint research with the BRI and keep strong connection each other to build a new era of digital currency.</p><p>BRI announcement link: <br><a href="https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/blog/2022/01/17/swn-metamui/">https://www.blockchainresearchinstitute.org/blog/2022/01/17/swn-metamui/</a></p> About MetaMUI <p>MetaMUI is the world’s 1st Identity-based blockchain to truly enable regulated Peer_to_Peer (P2P) transactions. It can be used as the cornerstone for most financial offerings, with its high versatility and support for custom-developed use cases that enable Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) implementation and issuance easily on the MetaMUI CBDC platform.<br>MetaMUI is built around Self-Sovereign Identity (SSID) technology. By combining the SSID and blockchain token mechanism, MetaMUI was able to create a new identity-based CBDC system that can protect user’s privacy while providing an identity-based transfer system that can satisfy travel rules and other regulatory requirements such as Know your customer (KYC), Anti-money laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism(CFT).</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a>/<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a>/<a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a>/<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

<p>The world is moving towards digitalisation and its having both a positive and negative impact on businesses. On one hand, with the rise of cybercrime, and cybercrime damages costing the world roughly $6 trillion in 2021, regulators and authorities are looking into solutions that can ensure highest security standards. On the other hand, completely automated processes, that can be used remotely are a new requirement amongst users.</p>



<p>The Austrian Financial Market Authority (FMA) made an important step and changed its online identification ordinance. The Austrian Anti-Money Laundering Act (Austrian AMLA) has been amended to allow for the use of a fully automated biometric process for remote identity verification. The new process allows banks and other AML-required companies to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements using a variety of remote identity verification methods. This is a positive development not only for users, but also for companies, who can now offer quicker processes and achieve better conversion rates.</p>



<p>According to the proposed amendment, biometric verification criteria must meet current state-of-the-art technology and offer the same level of security as an “in person” identity. This procedure involves technical requirements ranging from ID document security feature checks to biometric capture or Liveness Detection, which can be verified via video recording. From January 2023 onwards, a photo ID must be verified by reading the electronic security chip (NFC chip) under the current contingency under the new amendment.</p>



<p>IDnow is constantly working with the authorities, regulators and European standardisation working groups like IDO Alliance working groups from identity verification to European digital identity. IDnow is also a member of Hyperledger, W3C and, Linux Foundation, to work towards a safe, modern identity ecosystem and to ensure a superior platform for all compliance needs.</p>

<p>Over the past years, various frameworks and models for defending against cyber-attacks have been published. A popular one is the NIST CSF (Cybersecurity Framework), another one is MITRE D3FENDTM. Both have overlaps and differ in other areas. But, when looking at these approaches, there also are missing elements that are required for a comprehensive approach.</p>
<p>Comparing NIST CSF and MITRE D3FENDTM</p>
<p>While NIST consists of the five stages Identify – Protect – Detect – Respond – Recover, the MITRE approach has Harden – Detect – Isolate – Deceive – Evict as its five main stages. When comparing these in a matrix, it looks like this:</p>




<p>NIST CSF</p>


<p>MITRE D3FENDTM</p>




<p>Identify</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Harden</p>




<p>Protect</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Detect</p>


<p>Detect</p>




<p>Respond</p>


<p>Isolate</p>
<p>Deceive</p>
<p>Evict</p>




<p>Recover</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Table 1: Mapping NIST CSF to MITRE D3FENDTM shows that the overlaps and differences between both approaches.</p>
<p>Also, while the MITRE approach is more a list of technical steps and technologies, NIST also focuses on continuous improvements. It details the actions by mapping the functions (such as “identify”) into categories, which are split into subcategories that then reference to established standards such as ISO/IEC 27001:2013 or COBIT 5.</p>
<p>When analyzing the MITRE framework, one also could argue that some essential steps such as hardening the operating system. patching applications or hardening by enforcing consistent access controls at the system and application level are lacking. In addition, Access Governance for enforcing the least privilege principle, or Privileged Access Management (PAM) should be considered along with endpoint management related capabilities, which are absent. Notably, all this could be easily added to the framework.</p>
<p>The even more interesting challenge becomes apparent in table 1: The bread around the sandwich is lacking, with the phases of identify and recover not (yet) being part of the MITRE framework. NIST CSF starts with Asset Management as the first category within the first stage of “Identify”. Without understanding which systems are in place, which software is running on these systems, or how these systems are configured, the knowledge of which systems to harden in which way, or analyzing the state of security becomes difficult, as well as response becomes a challenge.</p>
 You can’t protect what you don’t know 
<p>Experience from practice tells that a lot of organizations struggle in case of incidents with the simple fact that they don’t know exactly which systems, be it clients, servers, or services, they have in place that could be affected. Identifying these systems takes valuable time and the right endpoint management systems can assist in discovery and identification actions.</p>
<p>Asset management and software inventory are essential capabilities for every defensive approach, capturing the information about the state of IT. Such repository is the foundation for automating activities for hardening/protecting as well as for response.</p>
 Response is not enough – keep your business up and running 
<p>While protecting or hardening, detection, and responsive actions such as isolation, deception, and eviction are essentials, there also is a need for recovery. These activities also must be well-prepared, for rapid reaction in case of an incident. This, e.g., might include recovering both endpoints and data in case of a ransomware attack, to return to normal work as quickly as possible. Also, in case of many other types of attacks, the ability to recover or restore to a known state is an essential capability.</p>
<p>Thus, a comprehensive approach must look beyond the technical response and forward to getting back to work based on a known, safe state. A key capability therein is the ability to recover systems, including endpoints, rapidly, which is a common capability with Endpoint Management Systems solutions available today.</p>
 Operate and automate 
<p>Last not least, it also is about automation and efficient IT operations. Neither steps such as identification and hardening, nor response or recovery, can be only based on manual activities. Efficient protection across all systems and services requires a high degree of automation, where, again, Endpoint Management comes into play. Rapid reaction equally requires automation, to be fast in, e.g., restoring systems and data.</p>
<p>IT operations is the glue that ensures that all these activities can be executed fast, efficiently, and with a high degree of automation.</p>
 Taking the best of both worlds: Bread, mustard, cheese, and more 
<p>Both frameworks, the one from NIST as well as the one from MITRE, deliver very valuable input for organizations when implementing their cyber defense, as other references such as ISO/IEC 27001:2013 or NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 are doing. The analysis of these frameworks also shows that there is not a single, simple answer to all challenges. The depth MITRE delivers when it comes to technical activities is impressive, while NIST CSF takes a broader perspective.</p>
<p>For being well-prepared against cyber-attacks, a broad perspective is essential, from the identification of both risks and the assets to be protected, to the ability for quickly recovering from attacks. Technologies such as UEM, Asset Management, and solutions that support in recovery from both a data perspective (Backup and Restore) as a system perspective (UEM again) thus must become part of a comprehensive approach on defense against cyber-attacks.</p>
<p>The KuppingerCole Recommended Risk Framework:</p>




<p>The Sandwich</p>


<p>When To Use</p>


<p>The New Recommended Framework</p>




<p>Bread</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the Attack</p>


<p>Identify</p>




<p>Mustard</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Harden</p>




<p>Cheese</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Protect</p>




<p>Ham</p>


<p>During the Attack</p>


<p>Detect</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Respond: Isolate, Evict, Patch</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>After the Attack</p>


<p>Recover</p>




<p>Bread</p>


<p>Improve</p>




<p>At the end, it is like with a good sandwich. It is not only about ham or cheese, about mustard or other sauces, it also is about the bread and putting all this together the right way. MITRE D3FENDTM is a very valuable approach, providing depth at the technical level other models don’t deliver. Other approaches such as the established NIST CSF add another perspective and a broader coverage across the whole cycle of cyber-attack resilience.</p>

<p>At Ubisecure, our financial year runs with the calendar year, and so January is a time to reflect, (re)calibrate and drive, and I’d like to share some of my reflective thoughts from 2021.</p>
<p>Like much of the world’s population right now, I am sitting in my home office space – a converted section of garage that embraces the current continuum that used to be known as the work-life balance. It seems like whilst 2020 was a year of shock and discovery, 2021 was a year of acceptance, leveraging the “silver lining” and getting on with the job, and that is what I’m proud to say Ubisecure has done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Corporate Growth 
<p>We are a private company, so don’t talk publicly about the detail of our financial performance, however our provisional results from 2021 are fantastic and a testament to everyone in the company. We’ve spent three years deploying funds from the <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/news-events/ubisecure-announces-growth-funding-from-octopus-investments/" title="investment made by Octopus mid-2018">investment made by Octopus mid-2018</a> with the target of passing break-even in 2021, and we have unequivocally achieved that. We have also seen significant revenue growth, whilst approaching nearly 90% of sales on a subscription basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Record Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) Issuance 
<p>Issuing LEIs through our RapidLEI brand has generated impressive statistics throughout the year. You might have seen us mention some of these during 2021, such as:</p>
 
 RapidLEI is #2 for total number of LEIs issued, passing Bloomberg and WM Datenservice. 
 RapidLEI is #1 for cumulative growth rate – issuing more new LEIs than DTCC, Bloomberg &amp; LSEG combined. 
 RapidLEI is the #1 destination for LEI transfers. 
 
<p>To me, the most impressive is that RapidLEI was the number 1 issuer of validated LEIs every single month in 2021, from a standing start in 2018. This is a testament to our pioneering platform which enables automated LEI issuance, our brilliant internal team and fantastic global partner network – and completely supports the premise behind our vision that automation is the key to business efficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Launched the CI Pipeline 
<p>Keeping with the theme of automation, 2021 saw the new Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline come online for our Identity and Access Management (IAM) engineering team. The complexity of software in general, and IAM software in particular, means that automation of build, test and deploy is critical. The proof point of this was the Log4J CVE last month. Like many software companies, we took action to ensure customers using our platform were not negatively affected. The CI pipeline enabled us to patch all supported versions of our software within hours, which was especially important with the rolling fixes that appeared for the Log4J library. A great achievement by the engineering team, and a great reassurance to our customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Announced LEI Everywhere 
<p>2021 saw the launch of our <a href="https://rapidlei.com/gleif-validation-agents/">LEI Everywhere</a> proposition – a Global LEI Foundation (GLEIF)-approved operational model for KYC Service Providers, Banks, FinTechs, &amp; Trust Service Providers. The model allows these institutions to leverage their existing KYC &amp; AML workflows to enhance legal entity identity information, while synchronously issuing LEIs in real-time. Our automated systems provide value-adding functionality over the basic GLEIF Validation Agent definition by detecting anomalies in legal entity data and highlighting these to enhance KYC and AML processes. We will be making several announcements in early 2022 detailing a number of global banks who have already joined the LEI Everywhere programme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Advancing our IAM Platform 
<p>We had three IAM releases in 2021, with each release bringing further incremental features and value to existing customers. Throughout the year we delivered a number of features including enhanced extensibility, increased support to our already broad range of EU high assurance identities, deeper usage data, PKCE enhancements, and programmatic key rotation. I’m excited to introduce further features and enhancements that we have planned throughout 2022.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Looking forwards 
<p>When I look at the achievements of the individuals, teams and departments within Ubisecure I feel rightly proud of what has been achieved and frankly honoured to be part of it all. As you would imagine, the success and growth means we are continually looking for high calibre individuals to join us.

 SmartPlaces partners with Ocean Protocol to unlock data monetization for Web3 social interaction app <p>SmartPlaces Protocol is partnering with Ocean Protocol to enable users who contribute to social interactions through the SmartPlaces app to securely monetize their data while preserving their&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The mission behind SmartPlaces Protocol is to provide users with a new way of social interaction based on the benefits of blockchain technology. SmartPlaces Protocol makes it possible for people to interact and connect in real-world situations. This is done through a geo-location based mobile application that allows them to make their thoughts and interests visible for others in a direct real-life environment.</p><p>With the “1-click-wingman”, people can easily seize everyday’s life opportunities and immediately connect with others. The hyper-localized application will be launched at a later stage in 2022 and, based on strategic partnerships, it will be made available in approx. 40 countries. In addition, SmartPlaces will provide use cases for the Metaverse, as it allows users to earn an identity and trust label based on the volume and the quality of real-life interactions with the&nbsp;others.</p><p>The SmartPlaces app data will be shared and monetized on Ocean Market. Ocean’s Compute-to-Data technology aligns perfectly with SmartPlaces Protocol’s need, as it provides a means to exchange data while preserving privacy — the data stays on-premise with the data provider, and data consumers can run compute jobs on the data — to train AI&nbsp;models.</p><p>Bruce Pon, Co-Founder of Ocean Protocol, commented:</p><p>The current data economy is not inclusive, transparent, nor does it allow for easy entry and access. The collaboration between Ocean and SmartPlaces Protocol is adding to the opportunities for people to take control over their data and monetize–this is the social media of tomorrow, fair, responsible, open, beneficial for everyone who is a part of&nbsp;it.</p><p>Hung Luu, CEO of SmartPlaces Protocol added&nbsp;that:</p><p>The digitalised world lacks real-life interactions between people. Smart Places Protocol’s vision is to create a new era of social interaction by engaging people to connect with others. I’m sure that our values and vision have the potential to align decentralized technologies with everyone on a real social level. We believe that Ocean Protocol could play a major role in enabling this ambitious but realistic plan in a distributed way. We envision that our cooperation will build a redistributed social data ecosystem, by being a solid proposition to our&nbsp;society.</p><p>We’re aware that the data produced by the user’s activities, like geolocation, consuming behaviors, and other metadata is private and must be protected. With Ocean Protocol we’re sure to have the right partner to combine privacy requirements with opportunities for monetizing these data in favor of the users, says Björn Heinze (COO &amp; Legal) expert and specialist in data protection /&nbsp;GDPR.</p><p>About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</p><p>Ocean Protocol is a decentralized data exchange platform spearheading the movement to unlock a new Data Economy, break down data silos, and open access to quality data. Ocean’s intuitive marketplace technology allows data to be published, discovered, and consumed in a secure, privacy-preserving manner. By giving power back to data owners, Ocean resolves the tradeoff between using private data and its public exposure.</p><p>About SmartPlaces Protocol</p><p>SmartPlaces’ mission is to provide users with a new way of social interaction based on the benefits of blockchain technology and to build a decentralized ecosystem. As a result, SmartPlaces Protocol helps to (re)connect people in real life and creates unique user experiences.</p><p>SmartPlaces Protocol introduces the “connect2earn” approach and rewards all users who contribute to interact with other users. SmartPlaces Protocol will also allow users to earn NFT-based identity and trust label that covers various use cases within the Metaverse.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/smartplaces-partners-with-ocean-protocol-to-unlock-data-monetization-for-web3-social-interaction-cb59d14033f5">SmartPlaces partners with Ocean Protocol to unlock data monetization for Web3 social interaction…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>"Privacy and Consent Management" is an exciting topic in a continuously changing market. Annie Bailey has just completed her latest Leadership Compass, which researches this market segment. To mark the release of this document, she joined Matthias for an Analyst Chat episode where she talks about the innovations and current developments.</p>
<p>In A Nutshell</p>
<p>In the episode 108 “Privacy &amp; Consent Management” Matthias hosts Anne Bailey.</p>
<p>Q: “From a definition point of view, what do we need to think of when we talk about privacy and consent management?”</p>
<p>Anne: “Yeah. So this is one of those terms where you could spin it in a lot of different ways, you know, privacy is so much in the public discourse that it doesn't really have a concrete definition anymore. So I thought it might be useful to get us all on the same page before we talk any more about it. So the way at least I have defined privacy and consent management in this most recent report. It's, of course, considering organizations and it's their administrative and governance capabilities over data privacy within their organization and of course, the tools and the solutions that are there to make that happen. So you could think of it then in a simplified manner about the capabilities that such a tool or a solution would have to the first group of capabilities, would then to be able to manage any incoming signals about privacy and consent. So these are things like being able to manage cookies and trackers that are on websites, being able to accept and then implement those consent or preference choices that an end user would make. And that would be over the range of different channels. So on a smart TV, on a mobile device, on a website, over the phone, via email in person interactions as well, should be considered. So that's all about managing the incoming signals. But what's also very important as well is the organization's ability to take care of their own internal management of privacy. So being able to govern sensitive data, which is in the organization and private data, being able to document their steps towards compliance and something which is a buzzword in this most recent report is being able to operationalize privacy.”</p>
<p>Q: “Recently, you published an updated version of your Leadership Compass report, which compares providers and services. What are the changes in the market that you can observe that you want to share with us?”</p>
<p>Anne: “Yeah. So this is an especially dynamic market area. Things are always changing. And so we can see some pretty big market changes between the report which published 18 months ago or so and the one which just came out this week. And that's in the types of vendors that were interested in participating. So what we saw in the last report were a lot of vendors that really focused on being able to manage those incoming signals, so being very focused on cookie management, on being able to collect consents and preferences and make sure that those are all able to be implemented in the many different connected systems within an organization and all the downstream vendors that may impact. Very focused on this incoming flow of information from end users. And what we saw, which was different in this report, is that there were more vendors that are really focused on data governance and using that as a foundation for privacy. So being able to operationalize and take action within the organization to further their privacy goals. And so we could think of that as an example. So being able to identify a privacy weakness of some sort in a process and then from that same administrative screen, then be able to do something to address that weakness. I guess we could go into more concrete details on what that could be. So, you know, if there was a scan done on a database and that scan returns the notification that there is private information in this database, there would then be the chance to leverage automation to go and anonymize those sensitive fields. So you're then connecting information about the status of privacy in the organization with an action to then improve it. So that was something that we noticed among several of the vendors that they're moving more in this direction. And that also does connect back to the relationship between the end user and the organization. So there was a big focus on being able to provide support for data subject requests and being able to process those. So in the same way of operationalizing privacy, if a consumer then submits a data subject request, the administrator would then be able to scan and automatically compile a report containing their personal information rather than needing to do that manually.”</p>
<p>Q: “Vendors offer products and services globally. Do you think they can catch up with changing privacy and consent requirements?”</p>
<p>Anne: “Mm-Hmm. Yeah. And frankly, this is really hard to stay up to date with because given our very globalized presence on the internet and connection with consumers all around the world, many organizations do have to stay up to date with the regulations that are not just for their own jurisdiction and in the region where they reside, but they have to pay attention to where their customers are, where any of their downstream suppliers or, you know, MarTech partners may reside and where this data is moving. So they have to be aware of a much wider legal domain than they've been used to before. And as I mentioned before, this is a really dynamic space. And part of that is because there are many privacy regulations which are being released all around the world. So this is something that we've identified as a really key capability in privacy and consent management tools, is that having some basis, some support from legal experts in-house to be able to keep up with all of these changing regulations and be able to pass that knowledge down to their customers is a really valuable thing.”</p>

 To stake or not to stake? Or even better, should I choose to stake or should I create my own candidate node instead? Is it worth it? What are the benefits? This and more you can find answered in this article, brought to you by your Telegram admin, Ontology Harbinger and proud owner of candidate node “CZ/SK Ontology community node”,&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/dumontiskooo">DuMonT</a>.  Which one is better for&nbsp;me? <p>In order to make a correct decision, you should know what staking is, what it means to run a candidate node, and what are the main differences. To put it simply, staking means that you assign your ONTs to a candidate or consensus node. For doing this, you earn ONG rewards based on the distribution ratio set by the node owner. On the other hand, as a node owner, the main advantage is that you manage the distribution ratio. Let’s see the main pros and cons of both approaches.</p> Staking <p>(+) Low limit - you can stake as little as 1 ONT, while the upper limit depends on how much the specific node can accept from&nbsp;stakers.</p><p>(+) Higher flexibility - you can decide to cancel the full, or part of the stake at any time. Your tokens are unlocked when consensus round ends (in the case of unstaking from candidate nodes).</p><p>(+) No entry barrier - no extra fees applied, only a transaction fee of 0.05&nbsp;ONG.</p><p>(-) Trust in the node owner - your rewards depend mainly on the node’s distribution ratio, the risk is that node owner can change it or even cut it to 0, which may force you to stake to a different node. To minimize the risk, it is recommended to either stake with nodes that have stable fee sharing ratio checkmark at <a href="http://node.ont.io">node.ont.io</a>, or regularly check whether the node you stake with changed the ratio to unfavorable values.</p><p>(-) Switching nodes - if you decide to change a node, cancelling the stake and staking to a different node will result in losing 1 consensus round of&nbsp;rewards.</p> Candidate node&nbsp;owner <p>(+) You manage the distribution ratio - you decide on how much % of generated rewards you keep, and how much is distributed to your&nbsp;stakers.</p><p>(+) Potentially higher rewards - explained in next parts of&nbsp;article.</p><p>(+) A way to promote yourself/your company.</p><p>(-) Higher entry limit - minimum amount to start a candidate node is 10,000&nbsp;ONT.</p><p>(-) Lower flexibility — as a node operator you can not reduce your stake below 10,000 ONT, or unstake such an amount that would result in user stake being more than 10x higher than your remaining node stake (example: your node stake is 15K ONT, user stake is 100K ONT, at max you can unstake 5K ONT). In case you would need to unstake more, you must cancel your node entirely.</p><p>(-) Entry fee - to start a node you need to pay a fixed 500 ONG fee, + 0.05 ONG transaction fee.</p> Summary <p>Staking is a great way to get passive rewards for holding your ONTs. Moreover, it is suitable for everyone as you can stake from as little as 1 ONT, and it also provides more flexibility than when you run a node. You can learn more about staking in the <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ultimate-ontology-staking-guide-e70c44330429">Ultimate Ontology Staking Guide</a>. On the other hand, if you have more than 10,000 ONTs, and you are a long term holder that wants to maximize your rewards, it is a good time to consider creating your own candidate node.</p> I want to run a candidate node! <p>So you decided to run a candidate node? In the next part, I will cover how to create a candidate node, the requirements, and possible strategies.</p> How it&nbsp;works? <p>Ontology candidate nodes are nodes which do not validate transactions. They could become active validators if they get to the top 15 by size, which would turn them to consensus nodes. A basic candidate node is something like staking pool, which creates room for stakers. Therefore, once you register a candidate node, and you are not in the top 15, you are not required to have your device online 24/7. This is all you need to start generating ONG rewards. In addition, you could run an online node, which synchronizes the blocks generated by consensus nodes. This would require your device to be online but does not bring you any extra rewards as you do not actively participate in consensus. If you still want to go in that direction, then you can find documentation at <a href="https://docs.ont.io/ontology-node/abstract">https://docs.ont.io/ontology-node/abstract</a>, but it also requires some technical skill.</p> How to launch a candidate node? <p>The main tool you need is OWallet on your PC. It is a desktop wallet application developed by Ontology. Download it only from the official GitHub source: <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases</a>.</p><p>Once you have OWallet installed, you can create a new wallet, import your existing wallet, or use a Ledger hardware wallet. Last but not least, you need at least 10,000 ONT in your wallet address, + at least 500.05 ONG. Ontology published a step-by-step guide on how to proceed within OWallet, you can find the guide here: <a href="https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/ontology-node-staking-docs/guides/sign-up-to-run-an-ontology-node">https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/ontology-node-staking-docs/guides/sign-up-to-run-an-ontology-node</a></p><p>Once you launch the node within OWallet, and set important settings, you just need to wait until a new consensus round begins. At that point, your node generates rewards which will be available for you to claim after each consensus round&nbsp;ends.</p> Explanation of important settings in&nbsp;OWallet <p>There are few important settings, which you definitely should not miss because they define rewards distribution as well as how stakers see&nbsp;you.</p>  Allowed stake unit — located at the “User stake Authorization” page, determines how many ONT your node can accept from stakers. By default it is set to 0, which means stakers can not stake at your node. The maximum value you can set is 10x of your initial node stake, and you can also see this value in the table below. So, if your node stake is 10K ONT, you can set a maximum of 100K&nbsp;ONT.    Fee sharing ratio — located at at “User Stake Authorization” page, determines the distribution ratio of rewards between the node operator and its stakers. You set the ratio for the node’s initial stake and user stake separately. Remember, in OWallet, you set reward values which you, as node operator, decide to keep. The remaining rewards are automatically distributed to stakers. The first value represents % of rewards generated by the node initial stake, while the second value represents % of rewards generated by the user stake. If you set it to 100/100, this would mean you keep all rewards and stakers get 0 (so nobody will stake with you). On the other hand, if you set it to 0/0 then all rewards will go to the stakers and you get 0. The trick is to find the ideal setting which fits your strategy. Some popular ratios are 90/10, or even more generous to stakers, 90/5. This would be displayed to stakers at <a href="http://node.ont.io">node.ont.io</a> as 10/95. Keep in mind that any change of ratio takes effect in the consensus round after the next one. (Example: you change the ratio in OWallet during round 150. When round 151 begins, it will be displayed to stakers at node.ont.io as the next round ratio and becomes effective when round 152&nbsp;begins).  Node info — it is a separate page where you can fill in all the information about your node. For instance, you can change the node name, set a logo, etc. If you want to obtain a “Verified” checkmark next to your node at <a href="http://node.ont.io">node.ont.io</a>, you need to also fill in the “Email to contact with Ontology”. You can learn more about checkmarks at <a href="https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/ontology-node-staking-docs/node-checkmark">https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/ontology-node-staking-docs/node-checkmark</a>   When will I get&nbsp;rewards? <p>Reward distribution frequency is the same as when you are a staker. You do not get rewards for the round during which you launch a node, but you get your first rewards for the next consensus round. Rewards are added to your profit section each time when a consensus round ends. You can claim them after each round, or keep them accumulating and claim anytime you like. (Example: you launch the node during consensus round 150, you will get your first rewards when round 151 ends and the next rewards when round 152 ends,&nbsp;etc.)</p> Candidate node possible strategies   Operator only — some candidate nodes decide not to allow user staking to their node so they participate only with their node initial stake. In this case, they keep all rewards generated by node initial stake, but lose the potential of getting additional rewards from user stake. The difference from normal staking is that they do not need to worry about changing the distribution ratio, because they are node&nbsp;owners.  Self promotion — some nodes may decide to use their node for promotional purposes, such as Unifi Protocol node, which distributes 100% of all rewards to stakers. Node operator gets 0 rewards but in return is well visible in the community, which can help achieve long term goals of the operator in the&nbsp;future.  Win/win — this strategy means that you set a distribution ratio, which gives you, as node operator, higher rewards than you would get with the “operator only” strategy, and at the same time gives good rewards to stakers, which motivates them to stake with you. Success of this strategy depends on the node operator’s ability to attract stakers, because the goal of such a node is to achieve 100% filling of the staking capacity. An example may be Harbinger nodes, which are represented by outstanding members of the Ontology community. Stakers can decide to stake with those Harbingers to support them and their work, instead of some company or corporation.  Anything else — you can develop your own strategy which fits you best&nbsp;:)  <p>In the end, I hope this article helped you with your decision making process.

<p>200,000 OCEAN available for Web3 data economy projects!</p><p>Hello, Ocean Community!</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO</a> is a grants DAO to help fund Ocean community projects, curated by the Ocean community. Anyone can apply for a grant. The community votes at the beginning of the month. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">The Ocean ecosystem becomes self-sustainable</a> as the builders of the Web3 data economy leverage Ocean Protocol to create products, services, and resources that the community finds valuable and fosters value creation for the Ecosystem.</p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">The OceanDAO website</a> has up-to-date information on getting started with OceanDAO.</p><p>OceanDAO’s next funding round — Round 14 — has 200,000 OCEAN available. Submissions are due February 1st 2022; we encourage you to submit early, reach out to the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-working-groups-db920b14a5d8">Project-Guiding Work Group</a> for feedback and guidance. The rest of this post has details about Round&nbsp;14.</p><p>Thank you to all of the OceanDAO participants, voters, and proposers.</p> OceanDAO Round 14&nbsp;Outline  Funding Amount <p>There is 200,000 OCEAN in grant funding available in Round&nbsp;14.</p> Grant Funding Categories   Building / improving applications or integrations to&nbsp;Ocean  Community or developer outreach (grants don’t need to be technical in&nbsp;nature)  Unleashing data  Building or improving core Ocean&nbsp;software  Improvements to OceanDAO&nbsp;itself   Submit your&nbsp;Proposal <p>As a builder, you can check out the <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO home page</a> to get onboarded and create your proposal. Once completed, you can submit your proposal to our forum:&nbsp;<a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/round-14/74">Port</a>.</p><p>As a voter, Port is where you can see all proposal details and cast an informed&nbsp;vote.</p><p>Proposals that meet the basic criteria are then submitted to Snapshot.</p><p>Proposals that receive support from the DAO receive funding in&nbsp;OCEAN.</p> Project Standing <p>If you have previously received a grant, you must update your Grant Deliverables inside each proposal to remain in Good Standing. This enables eligibility in upcoming Funding Rounds. Follow the instructions on the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standing Dashboard</a> to learn&nbsp;more.</p> Funding Tiers <p>To incentivize completion and outcomes we are continuing Funding Tiers, which can be achieved by Teams delivering on their grant promises.</p><p>The funding tiers&nbsp;are:</p>  New Project    Funding Ceiling: $3,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: No one in your project has ever received a grant from OceanDAO. Open to&nbsp;all.  Benefits: Earmarked. Receive feedback during the application process. Introduced to related projects. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>2. Existing&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $10,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 1 or more&nbsp;grants.  Benefits: Same as above. Receive promotion via Newsletter, Twitter, and other channels. Receive support during&nbsp;voting.  <p>3. Experienced Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $20,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 2 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>4. Veteran&nbsp;Project</p>  Funding Ceiling: $35,000&nbsp;USD  Requires: You have completed 5 or more&nbsp;grants.  <p>Above are the Funding Tiers accessible by projects for OceanDAO Grants Round 13. The amount requested is in USD; the amount paid is in OCEAN token. The conversion rate is the market price on the Proposal Submission Deadline.</p><p>Earmarks</p><p>“Earmarks” means that there are funds available exclusively to the first three groups listed below, without having to compete. For example, New Teams (Outreach) have 12,000 OCEAN available without having to compete against other projects. Beyond that amount, they have to&nbsp;compete.</p>  24,000 OCEAN for New Teams (non-outreach category)  12,000 OCEAN for New Teams (outreach category)  30,000 OCEAN for Core Tech Initiatives (listed&nbsp;below)  134,000 OCEAN for remaining General&nbsp;Grants  <p>A total of 200k OCEAN is available.</p><p>Core Tech Earmark &amp; Initiatives</p><p>If you are interested in contributing to Ocean Protocol there are earmarked Core Tech Initiatives that are being continuously expanded upon. You can <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Proposal-Ideas#4-build--improve-core-ocean-software-core-tech-initiatives-earmark">view them inside our&nbsp;wiki</a>.</p><p>Please find us in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/612953348487905282/908016816029319178">Core-Tech Working Group discord channel</a> and review your proposal ahead of time to qualify for the Core-Tech Earmark.</p><p>Unleash Data&nbsp;Category</p><p>In Round 13 we have revised the Unleash Data Category to have the same rules as the rest of the Funding Categories. They can qualify again for funding up to 35,000 OCEAN conditional that Unleash Data projects:</p>  “Unleash data” has actually always had a broad intent, towards driving Data Consume Volume. It is intended for projects like: becoming a data broker to get data owners’ data into Ocean Market, networking / “hitting the phones” to increase consumption on Ocean Market, integrating Filecoin &amp; publishing data on Ocean Market, etc. <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/oceandao/wiki/Proposal-Ideas#3-unleash-data">Here are further examples</a>. It was never meant to be solely for constructing / maintaining a small number of datasets.  Whatever is proposed should be high value-add to the Ocean ecosystem.  Example of poor value-add: requesting a lot of OCEAN to construct / maintain a small number of datasets to sell with expectation of profit. We expect and encourage OceanDAO voters to downvote such proposals.  <p>Burning becomes Recycling</p><p>Starting Round 13, any funds remaining inside an Earmark will be recycled into General Grants rather than burned. If there are any funds available at the end, they will be moved back into the Treasury.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/on-voting-in-oceandao-8f7e07d40e9d">For intuition on how burning relates to voting in OceanDAO</a>.</p><p>You can find all the steps&nbsp;below:</p>  [Earmarked Grants] winners are counted&nbsp;first.  Projects that do not win an [Earmarked Grant] are then considered for funding under the [General Grant] category.  Any remaining funds inside an Earmark, are then moved towards [General&nbsp;Grants]  [New &amp; Core Tech] teams are thus eligible to be funded from both [Grant Categories].  Returning teams are eligible to be funded from [General&nbsp;Grants].  50% or more “Yes” Votes receive a&nbsp;grant.  Any remaining funds inside the [General Grants] Category are moved back to the treasury.  <p>Quadratic Voting</p><p>We are planning to ship Quadratic Voting for Round&nbsp;14.</p><p>This will include a portal where participants will be able to register, receive a voting boost, and increase their total voting&nbsp;power.</p><p>Please keep an eye on Twitter and Discord for announcements.</p><p>Working Groups</p><p>Head to the <a href="https://discord.gg/TnXjkR5">Ocean Discord</a> and dive into each Working Group. There you will find each Working Group’s respective documents, stewards, members list, meeting times, and&nbsp;more:</p>  Project Guiding Working&nbsp;Group  Parameters &amp; Roadmap Working&nbsp;Group  Core Tech Working&nbsp;Group  OceanDAO Engineering Working&nbsp;Group  Data Consume Volume Working&nbsp;Group  Ambassadors Working&nbsp;Group  <p>Working Group&nbsp;Outline</p>  Each Working Group has its own public discord sub-channel. Then, each Working Group can leverage real-time discord channels (voice/video).  Each Working Group has its own membership + working&nbsp;process.  Each Working Group has a weekly or bi-weekly call.

<p>In the world of real-time ACH payments, open banking instant account verification is quickly making the old, manual methods look like the rotary phone. Why use an unreliable relic, when there’s a better, more secure, faster innovation? Throughout the years, financial institutions have relied on voided checks, manual routing and account number input by the consumer and microdeposits. These require days or weeks to complete, and are prone to errors or fraud.</p>
<p>More recently, data consortiums were used to confirm customer-submitted account details, checking them against existing databases. This assisted with clearing Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. Mixed-solution authenticators provided a fraud risk rating for the account being verified, but their information was sometimes based on older data. At best, these methods yielded only a sensible prediction of risk. With FinicityPay, failed payment risk is mitigated by obtaining account owner and balance insights prior to processing.</p>
<p>Previous methods of verification were rife with processing delays and lost revenue due to failed payments and fraud. Open banking APIs and platforms are the next evolution of payments. Faster, more secure and more transparent.</p>
 Open Banking Platforms Create a Real-Time Network of Connections to Financial Institutions 
 
 Trusted financial data aggregation platforms facilitate secure access to consumer-permissioned data via traditional connections (enriched with bank-level security) and APIs. 
 Tokenized access to account credentials is granted to third-party financial services innovators, utility providers and investment platforms, opening up consumer options. 
 Open banking is making third-party ACH payments faster and more secure, maximizing savings, rewards and investment opportunities. 
 A simple account balance check smooths the pre-funding path and protects consumers and merchants alike from failed payments and potential fees. 
 
<p>Using secure, consumer-permissioned access, financial institutions and vendors now get instant account balances and data from a consumer’s bank. Owner details, addresses, account and routing numbers and real-time balances are all immediately available. They can be scrutinized before authorizing payments on an open banking platform. Account access credentials are packaged into a “token” that can be passed to a third party. It yields no meaningful data if intercepted and hacked. This new level of security is spawning a much larger, more niche-oriented market of financial services providers and app developers. Open banking applications allow users to move money at the speed of the market.&nbsp;</p>
 Open Banking Opens Up Payment Enablement and Authentication 
 
 Innovation across all data-sharing stakeholders in the ecosystem expands what you can do to verify data and customize it to fit your payment use cases. 
 New technologies like AI are now available to integrate into your user experience. Move customers through your account setup process quickly and intuitively, while gaining permission to curated data that fits your needs.&nbsp; 
 Once an account is authenticated, payments from it can be issued instantly (dependent upon market/account providers) throughout your suite of products. Financial management, investment, utilities and recurring payments are all open for immediate money movement. 
 
<p>All of this has been revolutionary for consumers. Their mobile phones are full of financial services options powered by open banking, and they’re adopting them at a rapid pace. With a few taps on the screen, a user can grant permission to third-party apps and platforms, without having to type in account or routing numbers. The app or service the user wants to access is up and running with a full package of information pre-loaded. Secure, real-time ACH payments can be made within moments of installing and setting up an app. With the richer level of insight that’s available through consumer-permissioned data, developers are giving consumers a wealth of new options for managing, spending, and borrowing money. This is industry-changing innovation. It’s giving consumers more flexibility and ownership of their financial position than ever before.&nbsp;</p>
 Open Banking Simplifies the Payments Experience for Consumers 
 
 Customers aren’t asked to supply sensitive information, just permission to their accounts. 
 No more waiting periods for further verifications, like microdeposits or database checks. The customer’s data is pulled in milliseconds and rolled into the app they’re using, making real-time payments a breeze. 
 Financial management apps with AI integration pull together a holistic picture of the consumer’s moment-to-moment financial well-being.&nbsp; 
 
<p>While authenticating account details, ownership and current balance can streamline your payment process, it also reduces the hassle of setting up accounts and making payments for your customers. Enhancing their experience, especially when setting up payment is one of the first interactions they have with you.</p>

        <p>Major transaction processors in the Bitcoin SV network are upgrading to accept and handle Bitcoin block sizes up to 4 Gigabyte.</p>
  <p>On January 24, 2022, major transaction processors in the Bitcoin SV network are upgrading to accept and handle Bitcoin block sizes up to 4 Gigabyte!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The upgrade to 4GB is a breakthrough that will help everyone in the BSV ecosystem. TAAL is here to support the community and to help every BSV transaction processor to mine bigger and bigger blocks. That’s why we’re encouraging all miners to immediately increase their excessive block size limit to 4GB. They’ll be able to take full advantage of the node upgrade to expand their revenues and client base,” said Lars Jorgensen, TAAL Chief Operating Officer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original Satoshi Nakamoto Bitcoin protocol does not have a limit on the block size (!), it is up to the decentralized transaction processors (aka “Miners”) to decide how big a block they accept based on their own capacity.</p>
<p>The market decides. When there is a market demand for more transactions and thereby larger blocks, the transaction processors will invest in hardware, network and energy contracts to be able to capture and handle more transactions efficiently and earn the transaction fees on the transactions they process and store.</p>
<p>The old term “Crypto Mining” becomes irrelevant as the initial “block reward” diminishes and becomes irrelevant compared to the massive amount of (very low) transaction fees. Transaction processors are not “mining crypto” they are processing transactions and storing data in the distributed blockchain.</p>
<p>Now when the Bitcoin blocks become larger and store many million transactions, the energy cost per transaction also becomes irrelevant, especially as the Energy Return on Investment (EROI) becomes very high due to the practical use of Bitcoin blockchain technology in for example enabling Global Supply Chains to become more efficient.</p>
<p>Global Supply Chains waste at least 80%! i.e., global supply chains end-to-end aggregated efficiency is less than 20%. If we can increase global supply chains efficiency by just some percentages by using Bitcoin Blockchain technology the Energy Return on Investment (EROI) will be enormous! Not to mention the enormous positive environmental and sustainability effects that will bring us.</p>

			<p>Tokeny, the Luxembourg-based tokenization platform, announced today a partnership with Inveniam Capital Partners, Inc. (“Inveniam”), a SaaS company delivering trust, transparency and completeness of data to private market assets. The partnership includes a €5m investment by Inveniam, Apex, and K20 Fund.</p>
<p>Inveniam works with private market asset owners and managers to deliver trusted valuation and pricing data using distributed ledger technology. This data underpins private market digital assets and gives these assets integrity upon which market participants can establish price discovery. The benefit to asset owners and managers is a more liquid asset, which can unlock value.</p>
<p>Tokeny offers a comprehensive and institutional-grade white-label solution for digital assets that allows asset owners and managers to efficiently and compliantly issue, transfer, and manage digital assets. All processes, from the client onboarding process including KYC/AML checks to the administration required to manage investor subscriptions, capital tables, distributions, capital calls, etc., are streamlined on the Tokeny platform.</p>
<p>The partnership aims to fully unlock asset liquidity via tokenization, which will be facilitated by providing all technical solutions private asset owners need, covering the entire value chain of tokenized assets underpinned with trusted data regarding asset valuation and pricing. These synergies can return significant value to each company’s clients.</p>

		 
	 
    We’ve been watching the Tokeny team’s progress and product evolution for more than two years and know they're building next-gen tokenization systems the efficient and compliant way. Totally altering the global trading of private market assets will only work on the institutional level if the experience is seamless, the technology is top-notch, and the right regulatory structures and business networks are in place. This partnership addresses all those requirements for success.  Patrick O'MearaChairman and CEO of Inveniam    
	 
		 
			<p>While Tokeny’s solutions provide a compliance infrastructure enabling asset managers to easily bring nearly every kind of real-world asset to blockchain, Inveniam allows their investors to access trusted data and asset valuation. Liquidity will be realized as investors can conduct peer-to-peer transfers using Tokeny’s compliance framework with a fair and transparent price reference provided by Inveniam.</p>

		 
	 
    Tokeny’s capabilities pick up right where Inveniam’s end and vice versa, addressing two biggest obstacles in private markets — pricing data and compliance — on a hyper-efficient infrastructure. In tandem with this very synergistic partnership, the investment by Apex, K20, and Inveniam will allow us to further improve our solutions and accelerate the adoption of tokenization with the best-in-class technology.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny Solutions    
	 
		 
			<p>Additional value to the market will accrue as the partnership will ultimately enable Apex Group, Inveniam’s fund administration partner, to deliver end-to-end cutting-edge services to a broad ecosystem of private asset owners.</p>

  Effective cyber defense depends on detecting, preventing, and mitigating threats not only on desktops, laptops and servers, but also on the network, in the cloud, and in OT, ICS and IoT, which is where Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR) solutions come into play. Support for a security operations (SecOps) approach is essential as remote working becomes commonplace.

 MetaMUI and Sovereign Yidindji Government launched 1st Self-Sovereign Identity-based National ID&nbsp;system 1st Self-Sovereign Identity-based App “Yidindji SSID” for Yidindji’s National ID&nbsp;system<p>We are delighted to announce that our first E-Government pilot program with the Sovereign Yidindji Government has been successfully completed on Jan 7,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>The Sovereign Yidindji government is a representative of Sovereign Yidindji which is a rainforest-based micronation with several clan groups in the area described as far north Queensland on the Australian continent and it has a combined population of more than 150,000 Australian citizens and Yidindji citizens. Academics and scientists claim the Yidindji people have been around for more than 60 thousand years, so it is one of the oldest living cultures on the planet. In 2014, history was made on September 20 as the official government of the Yidindji nation came into life with the launch of its coat of arms. Since then, the SYG, as it is known, has created several departments and its parliament continues to pass laws for the peace, order and good governance of the Yidindji territory. Currently, SYG has 17 ministers and 22 ministries and plans to be the first government to become fully digitized in its venture towards E-Governance and national ID&nbsp;system.</p><p>The purpose of this pilot program was to establish the world first fully blockchain-based E-Government. During the six-month pilot program, Sovereign Wallet Network(SWN) team has implemented the first self-sovereign identity-based national identity system to digitize all government services such as digital identity authentication, vaccination certificate, and digital administrative works.</p><p>We just finished our first step to open the gate for making governments become automated and fully compatible with each other country on top of MetaMUI Blockchain. MetaMUI Blockchain is the world’s first blockchain that every government and institution can issue their own digital currency while complying with all the financial legal conditions. MetaMUI Blockchain allows users to have their own Decentralized Identity(DID) and all the personal information of the users only stays inside the users’ device. Every ownership of the assets is bound to the identity of the user, not to the private key, therefore it can be recovered should the user lose the private key. This will make every bank adopt MetaMUI Blockchain to build a practical application for their customers and it will allow the customers borrow, lend and store their digital currency and digital assets through the&nbsp;app.</p><p>The Yidindji SSID and MetaMUI SSID will soon provide more functions such as storing various digital assets including NFTs, Carbon Credits, Stocks and even gold certificates. These 2 apps will also present a special feature called “Pairwise Trust”. Pairwise Trust is a two-way cryptographic binding system that enables users to login any websites without registering a new ID and password but only with DID. Users can also avoid phishing websites through its Pairwise Trust function because the two-cryptographic binding makes possible not only the users prove themselves to the website but also the website must prove itself to the users through the&nbsp;system.</p><p>More innovations will come through the year of 2022 and our journey has just begun. We are glad that we could deliver this wonderful news to our audience at the very first month of this year and we will keep building and developing our technology to make a better&nbsp;world.</p><p>Cointelegraph article:<br><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/metamui-and-sovereign-yidindji-government-launched-1st-self-sovereign-identity-based-national-id-system">https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/metamui-and-sovereign-yidindji-government-launched-1st-self-sovereign-identity-based-national-id-system</a></p><p>Sovereign Yidinji SSID Launch Video: <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjX1OysGbk4&amp;t=102s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjX1OysGbk4&amp;t=102s</a></p> About MetaMUI <p>MetaMUI is the world’s 1st Identity-based blockchain to truly enable regulated Peer_to_Peer (P2P) transactions. It can be used as the cornerstone for most financial offerings, with its high versatility and support for custom-developed use cases that enable Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) implementation and issuance easily on the MetaMUI CBDC platform.<br>MetaMUI is built around Self-Sovereign Identity (SSID) technology. By combining the SSID and blockchain token mechanism, MetaMUI was able to create a new identity-based CBDC system that can protect user’s privacy while providing an identity-based transfer system that can satisfy travel rules and other regulatory requirements such as Know your customer (KYC), Anti-money laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism(CFT).</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a>/<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a>/<a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a>/<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

  <p>On an iPhone, when we log in to an app, we click a login button, and a website pops up to verify our credentials. Once verified, the website then redirects back to the app, and you are logged in. This familiar Single Sign-On (SSO) pattern is frequently referred to as the redirect flow for authentication. The use of a web browser for auth in this example is considered <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8252.txt">a “Best Current Practice”</a> for security and usability reasons.</p>

<p>However, in 2017, a new prompt appeared in the login flow, before you were taken to the website. The following screenshot came from an iOS app preparing to log you in with Facebook. The interface prompt informs you that a specific app, the Yelp app in this example, wants to use a specific website to sign you in, and it warns you about information sharing.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There are a couple of problems with this prompt:</p>

 
   
    <p>Problem One (Where did this prompt come from? ) : Many people consider this a bad user experience because the prompt looks out of place, and the wording is confusing and might alarm end users.</p>
   
   
    <p>Problem Two (Ambiguous UI message): If you implement logout functionality through the same flow, the prompt still says Sign In, even though the user may have already clicked a Logout button. This too is confusing to the end user, as shown in the following screenshot. This problem is reported as <a href="https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS/issues/255">a bug on the AppAuth library</a>, although it was designed as a security and privacy feature.</p>
   
 

<p></p>

<p>In this article, I’ll go into more detail on aspects of the iOS platform limitations. I’ll explain why this prompt is shown and how to get around it to build a more seamless user experience.</p>

<p>Specifically, this article will:</p>

 
   explain the evolution of iOS over time, and how and why this prompt was introduced. 
   describe various ways you can invoke a standalone or embedded browser on iOS, and explain the cookie-sharing behaviors. 
   discuss several ways to eliminate the confusing user experience issues we’ve identified above. 
 

 A brief history of iOS evolution 

<p>The browser options available for authentication  on an iOS device have changed significantly over the years, as Apple continues to add capabilities to enhance user privacy.  To understand the behavior of the browser options provided on iOS, some historical context is  helpful.</p>

 Authentication prior to iOS 9 

<p>Before the release of iOS 9 in 2015,  there were only two ways to authenticate through a web browser, and neither one was optimal.</p>

 
   
    <p><code>UIWebView</code>. This approach shows web content in a <code>UIView</code>. The mobile app can intercept interactions with the <code>UIView</code>,  hence it is not secure.</p>
   
   
    <p>Redirect to an external browser. The mobile app can open a webpage in a separate browser app, and the browser app can redirect back to the mobile app after authentication. However, app switching is not a good experience for mobile users. In addition, the redirect back can fail if another app has registered the same URL scheme first.</p>
   
 

 Authentication in iOS 9 (2015) 

<p>In 2015, Apple introduced <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller"><code>SFSafariViewController</code></a>, which displays an embedded Safari browser in the app. As an in-app browser tab, this interface lets the user stay in the app. Once the user interaction with the website is no longer needed, the browser tab can be closed and dismissed.</p>

<p>This solution was groundbreaking, because it is secure (the native app can neither peek into the embedded browser, nor alter its state) and it provides a better user experience by avoiding app switching.</p>

<p><code>SFSafariViewController</code> shares cookies with the standalone Safari browser. This gives developers a way to implementSSO (Single Sign-On) with shared cookies..</p>

 iOS 11 changes (2017) 

<p>Apple changed <code>SFSafariViewController</code> behavior to address privacy concerns with the release of iOS 11 in 2017. <code>SFSafariViewController</code> no longer shares cookies with the standalone Safari browser. Thus, a website can no longer determine that the user on <code>SFSafariViewController</code> is the same user on Safari, even though the view controller and the browser are open on the same device.</p>

<p>Apple understood that  the <code>SFSafariViewController</code> behavior change would break SSO, since single sign-on relies on the ability to share cookies. Instead, Apple had to introduce <code>SFAuthenticationSession</code> as a workaround, where <code>SFAuthenticationSession</code> would share a persistent cookie with Safari.</p>

 Iterative changes in iOS 12 (2018) 

<p>In 2018, Apple deprecated <code>SFAuthenticationSession</code>, but introduced <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/authenticationservices/aswebauthenticationsession"><code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code></a> as a revised solution.</p>

<p>Both <code>SFAuthenticationSession</code> and <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> are designed specifically for OAuth 2.0 authentication, not for showing general web content. To avoid abuse, when <code>SFAuthenticationSession</code> or <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> are used, Apple always displays the prompt we saw earlier. The prompt is designed explicitly for user sign-in, and indicates that cookies are shared.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Apple does not know whether an <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> is invoked  for sign in, sign out, or general web browsing. This is why the prompt text is generic. It only states that your app is trying to Sign In, regardless of the actual use case, which results in the ambiguity described earlier in  Problem 2.</p>

 iOS 13 changes (2019) 

<p>In 2019, Apple introduced <code>prefersEphemeralWebBrowserSession</code> as an option for <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code>. If this option is set to true, <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> does not show the prompt above, and as a consequence, it does not share cookies with Safari. This gives developers a choice. Either they gain  a better user experience with no confusing prompt and no SSO, or they get  SSO, along with the annoying prompt.</p>
 <code>SFAuthenticationSession</code> or <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> behavior 
<p>The various browser options offer differing levels of cookie sharing in order to limit websites’  ability to track a user.</p>

<p>The cookie-sharing behavior is not well documented in Apple’s documentation. The  <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/sfsafariviewcontroller"><code>SFSafariViewController</code> doc</a> mentions that, “In iOS 9 and 10, it shares cookies and other website data with Safari … If you would like to share data between your app and Safari in iOS 11 and later, … use <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> instead.”</p>

<p>A few third-party websites extend Apple’s documentation to highlight that persistent cookies are shared between an embedded browser and Safari. Unfortunately, it is rarely known that session cookies can also be shared between different embedded browsers. If your application just needs SSO between your mobile apps, you do not have to use a persistent cookie; a session cookie is sufficient.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes the complete sharing behavior in iOS 11 or later. I’ve omitted <code>SFAuthenticationSession</code> for brevity because it is deprecated, but it behaves the same as <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code>. I’ve also omitted the <code>prefersEphemeralWebBrowserSession</code> option for <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> because when it is set, cookies are not shared at all. 
I also use SVC as shorthand for <code>SFSafariViewController</code> and WAS as shorthand for <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code>.</p>

 

  
    
      
        &nbsp;
        APP1 + SVC
        App1 + WAS
        App2 + SVC
        App2 + WAS
        Safari
        Other browsers (ex.: Chrome)
      
    
    
      
        Session cookie
        ❌
        ✅
        ❌
        ✅
        ❌
        ❌
      
      
        Persistent cookie
        ❌
        ✅
        ❌
        ✅
        ✅
        ❌
      
    
  

 

<p>In the following iOS cookie behavior demo video, you can see how the session cookie and the persistent cookie are shared. The session cookie sharing behavior is not intuitive. Even when App1 is closed (which should clear all session cookies), opening App2 would make it possible to see App1’s session cookie.</p>

 
            
         

<p>It is worth noting that in iOS 14 and later you can specify another browser, such as Chrome, as the default. This does not affect the sharing behavior. <code>SFSafariViewController</code> and <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code> always use Safari under the hood, so they will never share cookies with browsers other than Safari, even if they are set as the default. The term system browser, often used in online articles, is synonymous with Safari.</p>

 Solution: how to remove the extra prompt 

<p>Now that we’ve reviewed the evolution of iOS browser behavior, and explored the rationale for the changes, let’s look at solutions to improve the user experience.</p>

 Solution to problem two 

<p>Solving problem two only – eliminating the ambiguity of the prompt message – is straightforward: Use the browser for sign-in only; do not use the browser to sign out. You can sign out of your application directly by revoking the access token and the refresh token. Okta provides a <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/revoke-tokens/main/">revoke API</a> that you can call directly.</p>

<p>Revoking a token works as a solution if you are okay with signing the user out of the native app only. The user may still have a login session in the browser, and if the native app wants to log in again, the browser will not ask the user for credentials before granting an access token.</p>

<p>This is the recommended approach if your web session may be supporting many different native apps. For example, <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/unity/reference/current/FB.Logout/">FB logout</a> specifically recommends not to log out of the web session.</p>

<p>However, if you require a stronger privacy and security posture, for instance for a banking app, keeping the web session alive may not be an option.</p>

 Solutions to problem one 

<p>There are two potential approaches to solve problem one.  Both solutions use browser components that do not show a prompt. Both have the drawback that no cookie can be shared, so SSO will not work. If your app requires SSO, you’ll have to find a new way to share login sessions. Fortunately, Okta recently introduced <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/configure-native-sso/main/">Native SSO</a>, which allows native apps to implement single sign-on without cookies. See our <a>blog post on SSO between mobile and desktop apps</a> for a full example. The following code shows how to remove the prompt, and it assumes your app either does not require SSO or uses Native SSO.</p>

<p>First, you can use the <code>prefersEphemeralWebBrowserSession</code> option for <code>ASWebAuthenticationSession</code>. If you are using the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-ios">Okta OIDC iOS</a> library, you can configure the <code>noSSO</code> option as follows:</p>

   <code>let configuration = OktaOidcConfig(with: {YourOidcConfiguration})
if #available(iOS 13.0, *) {
    configuration?.noSSO = true
}
</code>   

<p>Under the hood, the <code>noSSO</code> option sets the <code>prefersEphemeralWebBrowserSession</code> flag. Note that this flag is only available in iOS 13 and above.</p>

<p>Second, if you desire to support older iOS versions, you could use <code>SFSafariViewController</code> as the browser to present the login session. The following demonstrates how to launch <code>SFSafariViewController</code> if you are using the <a href="https://github.com/openid/AppAuth-iOS">AppAuth iOS</a> library.</p>

<p>AppAuth iOS supports a concept of external user agent, where you can use any browser to present the sign-in webpage. Normally, you invoke the following method to bring up a browser:</p>

   <code>OIDAuthState.authStateByPresentingAuthorizationRequest:presentingViewController:callback:
</code>   

<p>This method will invoke a default user agent. Alternatively, you can use the following method, which gives you an option to plug in any external user agent, as long as it conforms to the <code>OIDExternalUserAgent</code> protocol.</p>

   <code>OIDAuthState.authStateByPresentingAuthorizationRequest:presentingViewController:callback:
</code>   

<p>There is already an implementation of using <a href="https://gist.github.com/ugenlik/2a543f351e9b9425800b48266760dc85"><code>SFSafariViewController</code> as an external agent</a>. You can download it and plug it into your project. The following code snippet shows how to create and pass in an external user agent <code>OIDExternalUserAgentIOSSafariViewController</code>.</p>

   <code>let appDelegate = UIApplication.shared.delegate as! AppDelegate
let externalAgent = OIDExternalUserAgentIOSSafariViewController(presentingViewController: self)

appDelegate.currentAuthorizationFlow =
        OIDAuthState.authState(byPresenting: request, externalUserAgent: externalAgent) { authState, error in
    if let authState = authState {
        self.authState = authState
        print("Got authorization tokens. Access token: " +
              "\(authState.lastTokenResponse?.accessToken ?? "nil")")
    } else {
        print("Authorization error: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? "Unknown error")")
        self.authState = nil
    }
}
</code>   

 Summary 

<p>Understanding iOS and Android platform-level constraints is a prerequisite for developing great mobile experiences. I hope this article will help you understand the browser options available on iOS and their cookie sharing behaviors.</p>

<p>At Okta, we are adamant about optimizing end-user experience. Every extra click needs to be eliminated if possible, and every extraneous prompt should be avoided. We develop solutions such as Native SSO to help you overcome mobile constraints. I hope our solution helps you improve the experiences you are building for your end users. We’d love to hear more about your needs and how we can build solutions together. Feel free to add your questions and suggestions about this solution or future topics in the comments below.</p>

<p>A few keen-eyed readers pointed out that I never wrote a follow-up article on last year’s DevCamp. They’re absolutely right; all I wrote since the start was this <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/three-more-holochain-releases/#devcamp-8">small update</a> halfway through the course. It’s time to write something!</p><p>As you may have heard, over 1800 people signed up for the DevCamp, which amazed us all. This was a huge increase from the previous DevCamp’s roughly <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/speedy-improved-holochain-release-unblocks-all-the-things/#register-for-devcamp-7">200</a> registrants. More and more people are hearing about Holochain, among them developers who may go on to create some really wonderful apps.</p><p>I’m so grateful to the DevCamp organisers. I think they did a fantastic job presenting a pretty demanding subject to a huge group of people, all online and spread out across time zones. They facilitated with enthusiasm, structure, patience, and compassion. This was a big project, and they faced it courageously and skillfully. (Did you know that they were all volunteers, doing it simply because they love the project?)</p><p>The organisers did have some selection criteria to make sure it would be a rewarding experience for participants — this was, after all, meant to train people to build Holochain apps, so it probably would only be useful to people who intended to build Holochain apps. Roughly 1000 of the registrants were selected for participation, and roughly 400 enrolled once they were accepted.</p><p>Over the course of the DevCamp’s two-month schedule, we did see a drop in participation. Live session attendance dropped by 67% between the beginning and the end of the course. This might sound disappointing, but it’s actually quite good — various studies say online courses see from <a href="http://www.katyjordan.com/MOOCproject.html">85%</a> to <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2019/01/16/study-offers-data-show-moocs-didnt-achieve-their-goals">97%</a> dropout rate. This shows that an above-average number of people committed themselves to learning a pretty demanding subject.</p><p>Not knowing why individual participants decided to leave, I have some guesses: some may have found the course load or meeting times didn’t work for their schedules, others may have decided that Rust or Holochain development wasn’t for them, and still others may simply have joined because they wanted to learn a little bit about the project but not develop an app.</p><p>Some Holo team members helped with the DevCamp too, which gave us the opportunity to do some research. We learned a few important things:</p>  People don’t get interested in Holochain simply because it solves a technical problem for them. Instead, they get involved because they believe in the <a href="https://www.holochain.org/what-holochain/">values</a> it represents — agency, accountability, privacy, cooperation, voluntary participation. They want to join a movement, not just use a piece of tech.  Holochain’s community is unique among open-source communities — it seems stronger, more closely knit and supportive, with passionate people who are willing to give their time to help newcomers. (The DevCamp organisers are a case in point!) Reputation revolves around commitment to helping others grow, rather than crowing about one’s accomplishments.  It’s not just one ‘community’ either — there are many communities who value slightly different things or are focused on different aspects of the project. There are a lot of different perspectives about what matters. In a way, the tech and the social structures mirror each other.  DevCamps are a special way to experience the health of the community — it might be that the community is the most valuable part, because they create a supportive space for learners and help them become part of the Holochain community at large. The Discord server, in particular, was a great addition to DevCamp 8, and resulted in a lot more active conversations than the <a href="https://forum.holochain.org">forum</a> had had in previous DevCamps.  There’s a steep learning curve. Not only is Rust a new language for most, but Holochain is quite different from either cloud or blockchain. Many DevCamp participants had already participated in a DevCamp but wanted to reinforce or refresh their knowledge. The strong, supportive community also helps people gather the courage to meet this challenge.  Many participants feel like there was still so much to learn by the end of the course. In fact, we learned that some had already participated in a DevCamp and wanted a refresher. This reinforces what we learned about the learning curve, and suggests that a community, ongoing events, and self-serve resources for alumni would be useful.  Not everybody can participate in a DevCamp or online learning community. Time constraints — busy life or time zone differences — are the biggest barriers. Most people participated asynchronously, replaying the recorded session videos and chatting on Discord. We would do well to develop more self-serve resources for those people. (Fortunately, the organisers have published <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOuXrtFJO6zVMOMiqt0iOvwGtEba470wi">all of DevCamp 8’s session videos</a> on YouTube, which is a great start!)  Session 1 of the DevCamp Holochain 0.0.122: big gossip performance improvements <p>Most of the recent Holochain releases have been maintenance releases.</p><blockquote>But today’s release brings big New Year news. I’ve been looking forward to sharing this one!</blockquote><p>Recently one of the core developers has been troubleshooting a performance bottleneck we saw in the Elemental Chat tests. Gossiped DHT ops were being integrated at a rate of 40 per second, which seemed unusually slow because it didn’t involve a lot of processing.</p><p>If you’re not familiar with the mechanics of the DHT, here’s how it works: when an agent commits an element to their source chain, it results in the creation of a number of DHT operations. These operations are messages, sent to peers on the DHT, that update their local DHT shard. Here’s an example of the ops produced by a ‘create app entry’ element:</p>  A <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/latest/holochain_types/dht_op/enum.DhtOp.html#variant.StoreElement"><code>StoreElement</code></a> operation stores the header in the neighbourhood of the new header’s hash.  A <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/latest/holochain_types/dht_op/enum.DhtOp.html#variant.StoreEntry"><code>StoreEntry</code></a> operation stores the entry, and a copy of the header, in the neighbourhood of the new entry’s hash.  Finally, a <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/latest/holochain_types/dht_op/enum.DhtOp.html#variant.RegisterAgentActivity"><code>RegisterAgentActivity</code></a> operation stores a copy of the header in the neighbourhood of the author’s public key, allowing those authorities to detect source chain forks or serve up source chain segments to other validators.  <p>Each of these operations has to be ‘integrated’ by the authorities in the neighbourhood — that is, validated and stored in their DHT shard. This happens initially, at publish time, when the author first sends out these operations. But it also happens on an ongoing basis, as new peers join the DHT and start building their shard, or as peers disappear and cause remaining peers to increase their coverage. These peers share this information through gossip, which happens at regular intervals — more frequently for new data, less frequently for historical data.</p><p>In the Elemental Chat tests, the historical data gossip loop was slowing down HoloPorts. Part of this was because sharding wasn’t yet turned on, which meant that everybody gossiped everything with everybody else. But that ended up being a great way to catch this performance problem.</p><p>The solution was to optimise the table that stores the operations, along with the queries that manipulate it (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1167">#1167</a>). Now, operations are integrated at a rate of 1000 per second — a 25× increase!</p><p>There are other changes you should know about as a developer:</p>  The conductor API lets you manually insert elements into a source chain. This will be used to build source chain redundancy for Holo hosting, as well as source chain backup and restore for natively installed Holochain instances. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1166">#1166</a>)  Breaking: The <code>Path</code> abstraction for working with links has changed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1156">#1167</a>)  Breaking: You can now query a source chain by ranges — either between two sequence numbers, between two hashes, or the most recent element plus a certain number of preceding elements. All range queries are inclusive. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1142">#1142</a>)  The above breaking changes mean that Holochain 0.0.122 is compatible with <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.118/hdk/">HDK 0.0.118</a>.  <p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#20220106093622">Read the full changelog</a>.</p><p>That’s the news from the start of 2022. I’m looking forward to sharing more this year as our projects move towards beta status and see wider adoption among developers!</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@tegan?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Tegan Mierle</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/camp?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

<p>We’re thrilled to announce the launch of <a href="https://www.global.id/about/airdrops/">Trusted Airdrops on GlobaliD</a>.</p><p>Every crypto project faces the same challenge: How to strategically or fairly distribute tokens to their&nbsp;users.</p><p>A common practice is called an airdrop — giving away tokens to users who qualify for certain terms or accomplish certain tasks. For example, Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, created one billion governance tokens and airdropped 15% of them to anyone who had used the protocol up to that point — 400 UNI tokens in total, at the time, worth about&nbsp;$2000.</p><p>Airdrops are a great way to distribute tokens to your most active and engaged users while also helping to promote and market the&nbsp;project.</p><p>But as airdrops have gained in popularity and prominence — and with significant money at stake — these distributions are increasingly vulnerable to people gaming the system, undermining their equity and effectiveness. When bots sabotage your airdrop, it compromises the strategic intent of the token distribution.</p><p>For any project, the goal is to reach engaged users that are real people. Naturally, that extends to NFT drops, DeFi platforms, and DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) as&nbsp;well.</p> Trusted Airdrops <p>By introducing self-sovereign identity to airdrops, you can now guarantee that real people receive tokens rather than bots in a privacy preserving way. It’s the natural symbiosis between decentralized finance and decentralized identity.</p><p>With GlobaliD’s Trusted Airdrops, developers can quickly and easily verify that wallets belong to real&nbsp;people.</p><p>Users that receive airdrops can conveniently verify themselves and participate in exciting new projects without compromising ownership or control over their identity or their data. GlobaliD never sees users’ private data, which is encrypted and decentralized.</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/why-self-sovereign-identity-matters-8fd2c982ca2e">Learn more about why self-sovereign identity&nbsp;matters</a>  <p>The process is simple and straightforward:</p>  Developers create a signup link for their airdrop through&nbsp;GlobaliD  Recipients follow the link to verify their&nbsp;identity  Recipients add a wallet and get their&nbsp;drop  <p>You can learn more about the process&nbsp;here:</p>  <a href="https://www.global.id/about/airdrops/">Trusted Airdrops with&nbsp;GlobaliD</a>  <p>For projects building on XRPL, they can leverage <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/how-globalid-enhances-trust-for-xrpl-labs-xumm-wallet-d397cc836cf7">GlobaliD’s native integration with XUMM Wallet</a>, the most popular XRP wallet in the ecosystem that boasts over 200,000 active&nbsp;users.</p>  <a href="https://twitter.com/XRPLLabs/status/1410301192702410757">How to verify your XUMM Wallet with&nbsp;GlobaliD</a>  <p>It’s also incredibly cool to see the many projects come up with hacky solutions for custom needs.

<p>The online sports betting market in Ontario, Canada is seeing rapid expansion after lawmakers passed a bill (C-218) in June 2021, removing the prohibition of single-game betting in Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This bill allows players to make single bets, rather than the previously allowed combination-only betting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The result of this bill is hugely increased flexibility for both operators and bettors, as single bets make up a sizable portion of gambling activity and are some of the simplest to both place and offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sports betting regulation in Canada comes down to local governments, with each province having authority over the regulations in their jurisdiction and Ontario is no different.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Key iGaming Regulations in Ontario&nbsp; 



<p>In July 2021, shortly after the passing of C-218, Ontario created iGaming Ontario (iGO) – a body to conduct and manage iGaming in Ontario, serving directly as a subsidiary of the pre-existing Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario (AGCO).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The aim of iGaming Ontario is to enter into agreements with operators, allowing them to offer online gaming experiences to residents of Ontario, so long as they are compliant with the new legal code and provincial law. One of the four iGO and AGCO’s market objectives is Consumer protection quoted on <a href="https://igamingontario.ca/en">IGO website</a> are 3 bullet points:&nbsp;</p>



  Ensure safe and responsible play, and game integrity&nbsp;  Prevent underage access  Ensure compliance by private operators with applicable laws, including compliance with anti-money laundering rules and regulations and compliance with relevant privacy and information security laws&nbsp;  



<p>A full list of <a href="https://www.agco.ca/lottery-and-gaming/registrars-standards-gaming">Registrar’s Standards for Gaming</a> details what is expected of operators and what kind of rules and regulations are being enforced for iGaming in Ontario. These are largely based on existing standards of Ontario’s regulatory body, AGCO, and there are some key things to note for operators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Canada’s iGaming sector is also subject to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA), which is regulated by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre (FINTRAC). Although, iGaming Ontario has established a strict set of regulations, which go beyond the basic FINTRAC requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most importantly, there are a strict set of anti-money laundering (AML) regulations and know your customer (KYC) requirements. Operators are required to maintain internal AML operating procedures that comply with Canadian federal regulatory requirements, which include a wide range of rules and regulations, such as reporting suspicious transactions, prohibited players, and much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, there are detailed KYC requirements in place, such as in-depth identity verification standards. This means players will have to provide official government documents, recent photos (or selfies), and liveness (such as a video) to verify their identity during the registration process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Becoming Compliant With Ontario’s iGaming Regulations&nbsp; 



<p>Considering the depth and complexity of iGaming requirements in Ontario, entering the region as an operator may prove to be difficult. Operators will have to meet strict PCMLTFA and FINTRAC standards, as well as go above and beyond those to meet iGaming Ontario-specific regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key barriers will also include meeting iGO’s AML and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC</a> program requirements, which could require operators to complete overhauls of data storage, tracking, and verification systems. This is something that has already been a hot topic around the world, with more and more regulators calling for stricter iGaming systems and regulations. A good example of this were <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/german-online-gambling-regulations/">the changes for operators in Germany</a> which was challenging to say the least. Having experienced partners in a situation like this will be key to success.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One solution to overcoming this is working with an identity verification partner like IDnow. As an identity verification specialist, IDnow has the experience and tools to aid operators in entering new markets. This is done with the help of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">Autoident</a> – an AI-powered verification tool that quickly and securely verifies users identities, while being completely AML compliant.</p>







<p>Autoident is very well suited to the FINTRAC standard set by Ontario, already supporting verification processes that include Document verification, selfie and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/liveness-detection/">liveness detection</a>, while also being backed by an experienced team with years of success and experience, globally in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">iGaming</a> industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, there are also other ways to become compliant with Ontario’s regulations, such as adjusting things like the onboarding process, looking at AML reporting requirements, and much more that is required by iGO. Depending on an operator’s current systems, this could be an expensive and time-consuming process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whichever way operators choose to tackle Ontario’s regulatory climate, it will be a complicated and tough battle to become compliant in a reasonable timeframe. </p>



<p>However, utilizing an identity verification partner to help smoothen the bumps in the road and provide a guiding hand will prove to be an incredible advantage. KYC and AML should not be a burden but an enabler for your success.&nbsp;</p>

				  Helen Garneau joins the Hyperledger Foundation as Vice Chair of the Marketing Committee and Trevor Butterworth joins the Steering Committee of the Covid Credentials Initiative.  
			  
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/">Hyperledger Foundation</a>, an open source collaborative effort created to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies hosted at the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foundation</a>, has welcomed <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/helengarneau/">Helen Garneau</a>, Chief Marketing Officer of <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> as Vice Chair of its Marketing Committee.</p>
<p>This is the second leadership role for Indicio in recent months at a Linux Foundation Project. In December, Vice President of Governance, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevorwbutterworth/">Trevor Butterworth</a>, was elected to the Steering Committee for the <a href="https://www.covidcreds.org/">COVID Credentials Initiative</a> (CCI), a part of <a href="https://www.lfph.io/">Linux Foundation Public Health</a> (LFPH), the leading organization for hosting and nurturing open-source technology for the benefit of public health initiatives.</p>
<p>Garneau has an extensive track record in implementing successful marketing strategies for a range of Hyperledger Foundation projects, including <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/indy">Hyperledger Indy</a>,<a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/aries"> Hyperledger Aries</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/ursa">Hyperledger Ursa</a>. She also played a key role in project launches and the growth of Hyperledger communities.</p>
<p>As Vice Chair of the Marketing Committee, Garneau is committed to broadening Hyperledger’s membership base during her one-year term.</p>
<p>“It is an honor to be named vice-chair of the Hyperledger Foundation Marketing Committee alongside Chair, Duncan Johnston-Watt, CEO &amp; Co-founder at Blockchain Technology Partners (BTP),” said Garneau. “One of the things I enjoy most&nbsp; in the Hyperledger community has been seeing the technology, use cases, and contributions from other members and companies. The dollars that companies put into their Hyperledger Foundation membership are valuable and I’ve seen the return in business growth first hand. The Hyperledger marketing team does an incredible job and I look forward to helping articulate that value proposition in my role as Vice-Chair.” </p>
<p>Butterworth was already involved in Linux Foundation Public Health as Chair of the Steering Group for the Cardea Project, an open-source ecosystem built on Hyperledger Indy&nbsp; and Hyperledger Aries for digital health credentials developed by Indicio and SITA and donated to LFPH.</p>
<p>“At Indicio, we are at the front end of building and implementing digital health credentials with commercial partners—and our success in this area, in open-sourcing the results, and in creating a community of developers to extend functionality is a win for both the Hyperledger Foundation and Linux Foundation Public Health,” said Butterworth. “Joining the Covid Credentials Initiative will help us learn from its experts, build better products, and drive adoption of technology that is sustainable and solves fundamental problems in privacy and security.”</p>
<p>Indicio is both a member and active contributor to the Hyperledger Foundation and Linux Foundation Public Health and has taken a significant leadership role in the open sourcing of a number of technologies. Among others, Indicio has helped lead the development and contributions to several projects at Linux Foundation including:</p>
 
 <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node-monitor">Hyperledger Indy Node Monitor</a> (August 2020): A set of tools for monitoring the status of Hyperledger Indy networks.

 Malcolm Wright Joins Shyft Network as Head of Strategy for its Global Regulatory &amp; Compliance Solutions  BitMEX’s former Chief Compliance Officer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/malcolmwright/">Malcolm Wright</a> will oversee the expansion of <a href="https://veriscope.network/">Veriscope</a>, Shyft’s FATF Travel Rule solution &amp; Travel Rule interoperability tooling, along with strategy and growth for upcoming core public network products including institutional DeFi, NFT’s &amp; The Shyft Network’s DAO. <p>Malcolm Wright, a veteran of the blockchain industry is departing <a href="https://www.bitmex.com/">BitMEX </a>as the Chief Compliance Officer to join Shyft Core, the core development team of the Shyft Network ($SHFT). Malcolm, whose experience has spanned over three decades across strategy, technology, operations, and risk and compliance will join <a href="https://shyft.network/">Shyft</a> Network to lead Veriscope while also acting as the Head of Strategy for Global Regulatory &amp; Compliance Solutions.</p><p>He will be responsible for the expansion of Veriscope, the open source Travel Rule protocol built on the Shyft network, for leading strategy and growth for upcoming ecosystem infrastructure that includes Shyft’s Cross-chain Institutional DeFi System &amp; the Shyft DAO’s regulatory and compliance solutions, and&nbsp;more.</p> BitMEX to&nbsp;Shyft <p>Malcolm is joining the Shyft Network Core team from BitMEX, one of the world’s leading crypto derivatives exchanges. Malcolm has been instrumental in global policy work and advocacy on behalf of the digital asset ecosystem, and is the founder of InnoFi Advisory, a consulting firm supporting innovation and growth in DeFi, DAOs, and&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>Malcolm is currently the co-lead of the anti-money laundering (AML) working group at Global Digital Finance (GDF), a virtual asset industry body that supports policymakers to develop supportive legislation to assist the industry in its goal to understand and comply with regulation, and was instrumental in the development of open data sharing standard requirements such as&nbsp;IVMS101.</p><p>Malcolm said “I have long supported Shyft’s approach to resolving the FATF Travel Rule as one that provides the least friction for crypto firms’ customers whilst maintaining the decentralized community-driven ethos that underpins the Blockchain and crypto industries.</p><p>“With DeFI, DAOs, and NFTs reaching critical mass over the past 12 months, Shyft is trailblazing the way in addressing multiple challenges for financial services firms and governments that go far beyond Travel Rule. This is very much aligned to my own desire to provide the governance foundations upon which responsible innovators can design impactful, transformational, successful solutions.”</p><p><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/11/bitmex-compliance-chief-malcolm-wright-jumps-to-shyft-network/">BitMEX Compliance Chief Malcolm Wright Jumps to Shyft Network (coindesk.com)</a></p> Shared beliefs <p>Joseph Weinberg, Co-founder of Shyft Network said: “Over the last 3+ years a group of incredible individuals have been working to guide policy and educate regulators across this space. Malcolm and I were among several of that group who share a belief that decentralization and maintaining the ecosystem is critical to its foundational success.</p><blockquote>“As Malcolm and the policy side of Shyft had already been working together, both in his capacity at BitMEX, and through policy development across regulators, bringing on Malcolm to drive this next phase of institutional development &amp; growth was a 1+1 = 6 equation.</blockquote><blockquote>“We began working on Shyft Network &amp; its public infrastructure out of a belief that we can apply the open innovations built from within the ecosystem to bridge the gap between the traditional world’s regulatory &amp; compliance requirements, identity &amp; decentralized economies without eroding privacy, decentralization &amp; openness.</blockquote><blockquote>“As these two worlds collide and we see rapid acceleration in both regulatory requirements, as well as adoption, we also need the best and brightest people who continue to bring balance for the ecosystem to be driving critical infrastructure like Veriscope &amp; other public utilities for the new market participants who need identity-based compliance capabilities to operate across all verticals. Malcolm’s deep expertise across the space, from policy makers, to Open Standards, as well as his vast experience prior to entering crypto, makes him an excellent person to lead all compliance related aspects of the public utility smart contracts that the Shyft Core team developed for the Shyft network.”</blockquote> Leading role <p>In this role, Malcolm will be tasked with leading the Veriscope teams both inside of Shyft Core, and across all VASPs &amp; Travel rule solutions that are globally utilizing or contributing to the public network, while also managing the open governance task force responsible for proposing policy changes across the counterparty processes that are universal to Veriscope through the Shyft Network&nbsp;DAO.</p><p>Along with this, Malcolm will lead all regulatory compliance &amp; institutional strategy for upcoming extension systems of Veriscope that includes universal cross chain layers for Institutional Defi, NFT’s, DAO’s and&nbsp;more.</p><p>As Shyft Network is an open source project, and it’s infrastructure is being deployed to open source, Malcolm’s work will focus across regulators, institutions currently joining Veriscope, the Shyft DAO &amp; continued open standards development across the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p><p>Malcolm will be tasked with designing and documenting the frameworks and critical policy requirements across Shyft Network’s products and maintain his already impressive status as an industry thought leader recognized by virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and financial institutions.</p><p>On behalf of the Core team, the Shyft Community, Veriscope’s open Network of VASPs&amp; institutions, and all developers building atop of Shyft Network, We are excited to welcome Malcolm to the Community</p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p>The Shyft Network aggregates and embeds trust into data stored on public and private ecosystems, allowing an opt-in compliance layer across all systems. The key pillar for Shyft is user consent, allowing users to track the usage of their data. Therefore, no one can use personal data without consent from the owner.

 Web3Auth raises $13M Series A to drive mass adoption on Web3 applications and wallets via simple, non-custodial authentication infrastructure  Led by Sequoia Capital India with participants such as Union Square Ventures and Multicoin Capital, the Series A funding round advances our mission to eliminate seed phrases and make blockchain authentication decentralized and accessible to&nbsp;all. <p>We are excited to announce that we have raised $13M led by Sequoia Capital India, Union Square Ventures, Multicoin and others, to drive mass adoption in Web3 through simple, secure, and non-custodial auth infrastructure for apps and wallets. The round follows demonstrable success, with our infrastructure securing over 1M monthly users and 8M keys, on wallets and applications such as Binance Extension Wallet, Ubisoft, Kukai, Skyweaver, and more. We are also proud to reveal Web3Auth, which kickstarts the decentralization of the Torus&nbsp;Network.</p><p>The Series A was raised with additional participation from FTX, Bitcoin.com, DARMA Capital, Chainstry, Hash, KOSMOS Capital, Kyros Ventures, LD Capital, Minted Labs, P2P Capital, Phoenix VC, Staking Facilities, YBB Capital, Moonwhale Ventures, and Decentralab.</p><p>For those who don’t know us, the Torus team (now specifically more known as <a href="https://web3auth.io">Web3Auth</a>) have been working on improving onboarding and non-custodial key management in the crypto space. A critical problem that quantifiably has contributed to the loss of nearly 20% of all Bitcoin in circulation. Fear of loss and unfamiliarity of keys/seed phrases presents a significant barrier to entry that deters non-technical users from exploring Web3 and participating in the ecosystem.</p> Introducing Web3Auth <p>Web3Auth is simple, non-custodial auth infrastructure for Web3 wallets and applications. For your crypto native users Web3Auth makes them feel right at home, allowing them to connect or use their key management of choice, be it Metamask, Phantom, Ledger and so on. For new users developers can use Web3Auth to build intuitive login flows, such as single sign-on with Google and Twitter, eliminating the need for users to directly interface with vulnerable public-private key&nbsp;pairs.</p><p>Under the hood, Web3Auth’s mainstream UX is powered by the Torus Network (which Torus now refers exclusively to), it enables users to use multiple factors to access their wallet, leveraging on existing things a user has to secure these factors. These include their social login, existing devices, backups/passwords and in the future even family. This immediately improves on the existing key management standard of seed phrases, which is essentially a single point of&nbsp;failure.</p><p>For those who have known Torus before Web3Auth, Web3Auth consolidates our existing products, and draws a clear distinction between the products we build and the underlying infrastructure, allowing us to take further steps towards further decentralizing this infrastructure. Moving forward, the Torus Network will refer to the underlying infrastructure that supports our products, and Web3Auth will refer to the one stop pluggable product that Web3 apps/wallets know &amp;&nbsp;love.</p><p>Developers can integrate Web3Auth into their application just with a couple lines of code and allow users to connect to any blockchain. And can start&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.web3auth.io/">here</a>.</p><p>Apart from the initial connection, Web3Auth also provides:</p>  Customizable UI / even fully whitelabel  Plugging in your own existing auth and user&nbsp;base  Fiat-to-crypto aggregator, so users can also choose the best fiat-to-crypto provider for your application and the user’s&nbsp;region.  Incremental security and better redundancy, which drastically reduces support tickets for mainstream users.  Broad platform support, including SDKs for iOS, Android, React Native and&nbsp;Unity.   What will happen to existing users/developers and the Torus&nbsp;Network? <p>Existing users and developers on our current products (i.e. CustomAuth, OpenLogin, Torus Wallet) do not have to do anything, and they can be rest assured that these products will continue to be developed and supported as they are used as components of Web3Auth. No action is required from developers or end-users.</p><p>We will continue working on the underlying infrastructure to improve efficiency and security, but the priority for us is to further decentralize the Torus Network. This means major improvements to the capability for new nodes to join and leave the Torus Network, as well as additional features that formalize the interactions between dApps and nodes. Stay tuned for more updates on this over the next few&nbsp;months!</p><p>As usual, we’re always hiring and if you’re interested in solving some of the hardest problems in this industry, we welcome you to apply. If you’re an application or wallet looking to use Web3Auth, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:hello@web3auth.io">hello@web3auth.io</a>, and let’s&nbsp;discuss!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/web3auth-raises-13m-series-a-to-drive-mass-adoption-on-web3-applications-and-wallets-via-simple-948b6008cdb5">Web3Auth raises $13M Series A to drive mass adoption on Web3 applications and wallets via simple…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Community Growth   5,539 new members joined our global community this week. Over the past four years, Ontology Harbingers have always been our most dedicated supporters, driving the growth of the global community. We welcome more new members to <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">join us</a> to experience and promote a more decentralized future together with Ontology.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1471563278023217152?s=20">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, with the theme “EVMs”. The Ontology EVM will be launched in Q1 2022. The EVM aims to establish seamless interoperability between Ontology and the Ethereum platform, and offer an inclusive experience to developers and users. The new VM will join a suite of existing VMs, which include the Native (Ontology) VM, NeoVM, and WasmVM. Community members believe that this is a crucial step in the realization of the Ontology Multi-VM. It adds to the opportunities provided by the WasmVM, which allows more traditional developers to deploy apps on the blockchain.  We held our Telegram weekly Community Discussion, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He talked with community members about ENS, including its application scenarios, how to participate in the ecology, and more. Community members discussed the differences between Ontology DID and ENS. For example, ENS currently focuses more on associated addresses, while DID focuses on a wider range of information and is more inclined to personal&nbsp;data.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a>, where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Gizmodo — 《<a href="https://gizmodo.com/what-is-web-3-and-why-should-you-care-1848204799">What Is Web3 and Why Should You&nbsp;Care?</a>》</p><p>“In recent months, you may have come across a phrase growing in popularity: Web3. You might be wondering what it is, what it will mean for the future, and how exactly the third-generation internet differs from the first two. And now the dawn of Web3 is upon us. People define it in a few different ways, but at its core is the idea of decentralization, which we’ve seen with cryptocurrencies (key drivers of Web3). Key to this decentralization is blockchain technology, which creates publicly visible and verifiable ledgers of record that can be accessed by anyone, anywhere. The blockchain already underpins Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as well as a number of fledging technologies, and it’s tightly interwoven into the future vision of everything that Web3 promises. The idea is that everything you do, from shopping to social media, is handled through the same secure processes, with both more privacy and more transparency baked&nbsp;in.”</p><p>Ontology has worked on bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 through providing decentralized identity (DID) and data solutions. From the very inception of the project, the aim has been to build the infrastructure required for users to interact with this new generation of decentralized applications, and that aim has not changed. 2021 draws to a close and 2022 promises to bring us closer to Web3 than ever before. Four years of work has positioned Ontology as a leader in the space, through the development of products focused on DID and data, and by taking a Multi-VM approach.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>With millions of people boarding flights every day, customer data and experiences are the most important elements to the travel industry. As airports increasingly ramp up to meet the digital age, they are more prone to cyberattacks and data breaches. One such incident occurred when <a href="https://www.airport-technology.com/features/five-times-airports-were-involved-in-cyberattacks-and-data-breaches/">Heathrow airport</a> was fined £120,000 when they lost sensitive data stored on a memory stick, which included the Queen’s travel history and passport numbers.</p>



<p>To prevent such data leaks in the future and avoid heavy fines, airports are constantly evolving and adapting biometric security in airports.</p>



 Why Are Biometrics Used in Airports? 



<p>The technology associated with air travel has advanced considerably in recent years. Biometrics for airports have provided passengers with a faster, safer end-to-end experience. It may go unnoticed at first but biometric technology is used widely in airports. Be it filling your visa application from the comfort of your home or automated barrier control at the airports.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Biometrics for airports can provide a contactless experience using facial recognition for the ease of passengers and to meet growing concerns around health concerns with contact methods. Biometric technology can identify individuals, measuring dozens of physical attributes, such as fingerprint, voice recognition, and facial recognition, among others.&nbsp;</p>



  



<p>Biometrics for airports can be used for security checks, luggage, boarding, and check-in facilities. Implementing biometrics at airports helps automate the verification process, and sharing a digital identity can expedite the immigration process.</p>



 Benefits of Using Biometric for Airports 



<p>Biometric authentication and its use cases in the travel industry and airports provide several advantages including:</p>



 High Security 



<p>Biometrics provide increased levels of security to the airlines that the person is truly who they claim to be. The identification is done by tangible and real-world traits that relate to the passenger. Nearly any username, passwords, and PINs can be compromised, and a data breach can leak sensitive information to the hackers.&nbsp;</p>



 Improved User Experience 



<p>The internal implementation of biometric technology may be difficult, but it provides a smooth user experience to passengers at the airport. Placing a finger on a scanner and getting border access is much easier and fast than going through the long processes of physical verification.&nbsp;</p>



 Non-Transferable and Unique 



<p>Every individual has a unique set of biometrics which are impossible to duplicate with current technology. Also, biometrics are not transferable. The only way to access biometric data at airports is through the physical application.&nbsp;</p>



 4 Biometric Technologies Used at Airports 



<p>There are currently four biometric technologies being used at airports. These include:</p>



 Facial Recognition 



<p>Facial recognition identifies facial features such as distance between eyes, eye shape, nose shape, and more, through stored facial patterns and data to find a match. Facial recognition enhances security, is contactless, and is easy to integrate.&nbsp;</p>



 Fingerprint Recognition 



<p>Fingerprint recognition automatically identifies someone based on a comparison between a stored and live fingerprint. Fingerprint recognition is one of the most popular biometrics and is being implemented at airports all over the world.&nbsp;</p>



 Iris Recognition 



<p>Iris scanning or <a href="https://imageware.io/the-eyes-have-it-what-is-iris-recognition">iris recognition</a> is the process of using infrared light to take a high contrast image of your iris. Similar to fingerprints, iris patterns are unique to each individual and provide exceptional accuracy. Iris recognition is another contactless biometric method which is considered to be one of the most accurate.</p>



 Palm Recognition 



<p>Palm recognition evaluates the unique patterns and characteristics in the palms of an individual’s hands. The systems use a scanning device that processes data from a digital photo of an individual’s hand and compares it to the stored biometric template in the database. Many airports have started deploying palm recognition as a part of their authentication processes.&nbsp;</p>

 Web3Auth has allowed Binance Smart Chain users to seamlessly create and manage their extension wallets with their Social&nbsp;Accounts  About Binance Chain Extension Wallet&nbsp;(BEW) <p>Binance Chain Extension Wallet is the official Binance cryptocurrency wallet for accessing Binance Smart Chain, Binance Chain, and Ethereum. The extension allows users to securely store crypto and connect to thousands of projects across different blockchains. It currently supports Chrome, Firefox, and&nbsp;Brave.</p> The Story Behind the Integration <p>Key management is a long-standing problem in crypto. Users have lost crypto worth over $150bn (Worth more than even GDPs of several nations) due to inefficient management of their private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>The Binance Smart Chain (BSC) ecosystem knew how important it was to make key management and onboarding easy for mainstream crypto adoption. Especially with the increase in the adoption of decentralized apps, mismanagement of private keys was rampant leading to significant financial loss.</p> The search for a perfect non-custodial key management solution <p>To fix this — the BSC community started considering multiple private key management solutions. Few solutions had made significant progress in streamlining the user onboarding experience but had long been plagued by the trilemma of sacrificing security or redundancy for convenience. Many of these systems also had points of centralization that reduced censorship resistance.</p><p>They were then introduced to Web3Auth.</p> Onboarding thousands of users through&nbsp;Web3Auth <p>Binance chain Extension Wallet (BEW) introduced a new seamless and secure user onboarding process through Web3Auth in early 2021 and has since onboarded hundreds of thousands of users into the BEW&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>Designed with a simple and straightforward user experience for mainstream users, the onboarding includes OAuth logins, key management that reduces account loss while retaining the non-custodial guarantees that the decentralized ecosystem requires.</p> How Web3Auth handles users’ private&nbsp;keys <p>Web3Auth is a model of threshold key management that solves the trilemma without sacrificing user experience while retaining end-user autonomy and security. The model implements the Shamir Secret Shares (SSS) scheme using the user’s device, private input, and wallet service provider.</p><p>The user’s private key is split into multiple factors, and these split factors are used to reconstruct the original encrypted secret key. Like 2FA systems, as long as the user has access to 2 out of 3 of their factors, they will be able to retrieve their private key and gain access to the&nbsp;wallet.</p> BEW — Web3Auth pave the way for crypto’s&nbsp;future <p>BEW’s partnership with Web3Auth ensures that no user in the future will ever lose access to their valuable Cryptos just because they forgot or misplaced their private keys. This revolutionary approach paves the way for the mainstream adoption of cryptos across the industry.

 Kukai: A go-to wallet for leading NFT projects on&nbsp;Tezos  About Kukai <p>Kukai is the longest-running web-based Tezos wallet. It allows you to manage your tokens, NFTs and digital assets in a single easy-to-use and secure platform. As a Tezos wallet, Kukai includes the ability to store, transfer and delegate your Tezos (XTZ) tokens, so you can easily receive XTZ rewards through staking. Kukai supports the fast-growing Tezos ecosystem with features like an NFT gallery, DeFi token support and more. Kukai has been pivotal to the success of Ubisoft, HicEtNunc, OneOf, and other notable NFT launches.</p> The Origin <p>The origin of Kukai goes back to 2018 when it was started as an open-source community project. The team spent the initial days figuring out the technical aspects and focused on security. Once the tech was sorted and the wallet started gaining traction — the team realized how the onboarding experience was integral to achieving their goals of acquiring millions of mainstream users.</p><p>That’s when Web3Auth came into the&nbsp;picture.</p> Deciding on&nbsp;Web3Auth <p>Kukai discovered Web3Auth at the perfect time when they decided to redesign the wallet user experience to drive user adoption. The ease of onboarding provided by Web3Auth’s social logins and key management solution made a lot of sense. The primary reasons they chose to integrate Web3Auth SDK&nbsp;were:</p>  The Decentralised Non-custodial nature of the private key&nbsp;handling  The Social logins to onboard blockchain non-native users  The Web3Auth’s Lookup feature to send crypto/NFTs to socials&nbsp;directly  The single-click setup, the documentation, and the dev support throughout  <p>The Kukai team was evaluating other solutions as well but did not proceed with them because of their inflexibility, low maturity, and centralized method of managing&nbsp;keys.</p><p>“We have been so happy with Web3Auth, and whenever we do our regular reviews of other solutions we continue to be convinced we made the right choice for Kukai users” <br>— Klas Harrysson, Co-Founder, Kukai</p> Winning the NFT space with&nbsp;Web3Auth <p>Kukai took less than two weeks to integrate Web3Auth SDK. The detailed documentation and the code examples made the integration process straightforward and easy to complete. With Web3Auth developer support readily available, our engineers worked closely with the Kukai team to build the final product within a short developmental time&nbsp;frame.</p><p>It’s been one year since Kukai launched with Web3Auth handling their authentication and key management, and the SDK has processed more than a million social logins thus&nbsp;far.</p><p>“We never faced any roadblocks during integration because the Web3Auth team was always available at every step” <br>— Klas Harrysson, Co-Founder, Kukai</p><p>Kukai has onboarded hundreds of thousands of non-native crypto users with ease and they devote the success to the Web3Auth SDK which has made their app’s onboarding look like any other web2 app’s. The Tezos community loves Kukai and Web3Auth is excited to support the Tezos ecosystem in their Kukai 2.0 and the upcoming mobile wallet where they expect to multiply their user-base threefold.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs/how-kukai-reached-a-million-user-logins-with-web3auth-sdk-58bdc08ca83d">How Kukai Reached a Million User Logins with Web3Auth SDK</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/toruslabs">Web3Auth</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and welcome to the first episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity for this New Year 2022. And we have a very special guest who has been in very short clips in an episode we had in October, very recently in October. A very special episode, a storytelling episode called <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/openid-connect/" title="<em>How OpenID Connect took over the World</em>">How OpenID Connect took over the World</a>, and today’s guest was there. We are talking about our super special guest called Nat Sakimura, one of the creators of the OpenID Connect standard.</p>
<p>Nat Sakimura is a well-known identity and privacy standardisation architect and a representative partner of NAT Consulting. Besides being an author and editor of such widely standards such as the OpenID Connect, FAPI, JWT, OAuth PKCE among others, he helps communities to organise themselves to realise the ideas around identity and privacy. As the chairman of the board of the OpenID Foundation, he streamlined the process, bolstered the IPR management, and greatly expanded the breadth of the Foundation spanning over 10 working groups whose members included large internet services, mobile operators, financial institutions, government, etc. He has been serving in various committees in the Japanese government, including a Study Group on the Platform Services of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications and a Study Group on the competition in Digital Market of the Fair-Trade Commission of Japan.</p>
<p>Hello, Nat.</p>
<p>Nat Sakimura: Hi, Oscar. Thanks for inviting me.</p>
<p>Oscar: Welcome. It’s a great pleasure talking with you, Nat. And well, Happy New Year. And let’s talk about digital identity.</p>
<p>Nat: Likewise, yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. And I think we know a lot of your involvement, of course, you are leading one of the most important standardisation organisations in the digital space. We’d like to hear a bit about yourself, something personal, of course, how life led you to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Nat: OK. So you wanted to know, how was my journey to the world of identity?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah. There are three reasons. They all converge to identity. In the middle 1990s, I was working on VPN as an alternative way to secure communications than having dedicated leased lines. And at that time, we were using dedicated leased lines in the financial institutions. And that actually amounts to the identification and the authentication of machines and people as well as integrity protection and encryption of the communication channel. So there you have identity.</p>
<p>Then also, the second reason was that I found in the hard way that access to our personal data is not granted. My daughter had a failed surgery, she was three years old then, and for re-operation I needed to access the medical record quickly but it was not granted. So it was not useful for us. That was a surprise for me. We didn’t have the right nor technology in place to access our own data in a meaningful timeframe. So I started on the combination, the identity and privacy then.</p>
<p>The third one was the research commissioned by the Japanese Postal Agency. It’s been subsequently privatised, but it was still a government agency at the time, on the future of mails. And as part of the research, I got acquainted with Drummond Reed, who dragged me into the standardisation part of the identity arena.</p>
<p>All of these combined paved the way for me to get into the digital identity standardisation work.</p>
<p>Oscar: I see, it’s very interesting you mentioned these three points. One very technical, solving the security problem so that those time- the VPNs in ‘90s, 1990s. Then you needed to access personal data of your daughter, right? And even though I’m sure it was stored somewhere, but you were not able to access it in a timely manner, as you said so.</p>
<p>Nat: Right.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. And then I think the opportunity came, as you mentioned in the Japanese Postal Agency to start working on the standard. So, yeah, super interesting. And we have talked recently and you say you wanted to talk about FAPI, one of the… yeah, one of the main – well children of OpenID Foundation. We have <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/don-thibeau-openid-foundation/" title="interviewed also Don Thibeau">interviewed also Don Thibeau</a> a bit more than one year ago. He a little bit talked about that standard. He has been very enthusiastic about talking that standard and I’m sure you have much more to tell us. But please tell us what is the… what – where is the beginning of that? So what were the challenges that you were working on OpenID Foundation found, led that – led to the, yeah, to start working on the creation of FAPI?</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah. So, right after we have finished OpenID Connect in 2014, I think I have started working on FAPI- preparation for FAPI in 2015. OAuth and OpenID Connect are designed to scale from the point of view of security. If you use only the very basic, you can achieve entry-level security quite simply. Since you’re not using options, it was not that hard to achieve interoperability.</p>
<p>However, when you wanted to achieve more security, you had many options to choose from. And the different combinations not only led to different security properties, but also a lack of interoperability. We needed to bolt the options down so that we have known security properties as well as interoperability.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed, I think interoperability is a word that always come to any standard because there are so many different… yeah, so many possibilities can be done and so many different needs in different, yeah, different industries, different places in the world. Yeah. FAPI is Financial-grade API, correct? And I understand also that from the beginning, it has been, as the name says it’s for financial transactions. Please tell us a bit, what is FAPI in practice?</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, the FAPI is a general purpose security profile of OAuth and OpenID Connect to protect APIs. It started off from financial use case, from which the letter F comes from. But later, it also made clear that it has general purpose. So we changed the name from Financial API to Financial-grade API. It can be used by for example, healthcare, transportation, and name any.</p>
<p>So there are two notable characteristics of FAPI. Number one is that all the communication is integrity protected, so that it’s tamper-evident. All messages are authenticated. And the second characteristic is that no bearer token is used.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah. So even if the token was stolen, it cannot be used. You know, the bearer token is like metro ticket or something like that. So if you drop it, and if somebody picks it up, it can be used, right? And instead, in the case of FAPI, we decided to use something called sender constrained tokens. Sender constrained token is much like international airline ticket, I mean the boarding pass. So when you use it, it’s got your name, and you need to show your passport, for example, or travel card so that the person at the entrance can match that you are the rightful user of that boarding pass. So that’s the sender constrained token. And in FAPI, we have stopped using bearer token completely and went all the way to the sender constrained tokens.</p>
<p>So another way to look at it is that it fulfils four authentication properties. In many cases, when we talk about these things, we kind of focus on the user authentication. But there are many other kinds of authentication, which is really important. The number one is strong server authentication. Number two, strong client authentication. Number three, strong message authentication. And these combined with strong user authentication, you will have a pretty complete security picture. So that’s the security part.</p>
<p>And also, we wanted to address the interoperability. So to improve our interoperability, we also needed to provide a testing framework. That is now provided by the OpenID Foundation as FAPI Certification. There are now over 150 implementations that are certified and number is increasing quite rapidly now.</p>
<p>Oscar: And there is some sort of self-certification, correct?</p>
<p>Nat: Yes, it’s a self-certification. So, the test suite is also available as open source. So you can, for example, use it for the continuous development – some banks are actually using it like that. But when you are done with the development, and you have passed all the tests, you can submit the result to OpenID Foundation, and then it will be published from the OpenID Foundation site, and they can be checked by your peers as well so that you know, you have a conformant implementation.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Yeah. One thing I was not aware now that I said just before asking you is FAPI’s Financial-grade API. And when I read and when I heard for the first time that term, to me sound like yeah, it’s financial, but now you clarified that initially it was Financial API but then now it’s financial-grade, so as secure as the financial transaction, I guess that’s the idea, right? So now it’s more general purpose in a very secure profile from OpenID Connect and OAuth 2, so that’s interesting.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, that’s correct. Yeah. I mean, so I think it was by 2017 or ‘18, we had a request from both the healthcare sector as well as the international travel sector, you know airlines, that they wanted to use it. But their request was to change the name because having labelled as financial, it’s going to be harder for them to actually make industry-wide adoption of it. So we kind of searched for the name. By then the acronym FAPI was quite popular so we didn’t want to change the acronym and we wanted to generalise the F part. And we couldn’t come up with anything better than financial-grade. But the intent is that it is for any industry, and it’s secure. That’s what we wanted to communicate.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Thank you. Thank you for that clarification. I think it’s very important also, for the ones who are not so familiar with the term yet, so yeah. And also, the fact you mentioned in the description that in FAPI, as a profile of OpenID Connect, you don’t – you get rid of the bearer token so that already tells a lot about how much secure it is per se, the bearer token is just – it’s not a possibility in this profile.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah. So we have removed the bearer token, removed completely to the sender constrained token, as well as other communications even through the browser, is integrity protected. That’s not the case in the usual OAuth or OpenID Connect. So…</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that is correct.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sounds very interesting. I have to play myself in the browser, what can I see, what I cannot see, so it’s super interesting.</p>
<p>Nat: So unless the sender and the receiver is using the encryption model, you can still see it, but you cannot tamper it.</p>
<p>Oscar: Oh, yes.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly.</p>
<p>Nat: &nbsp;It’s signed. Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. Exactly. The integrity, you cannot, yeah. You cannot modify it. OK, excellent. Please tell us, yeah, you mentioned that initially it was for financial, then at least healthcare and aviation or transport were interested, what are the – nowadays, let’s say, what are the main use cases? Those are still the main use cases or it’s even broader?</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, as I’ve said, it’s general-purpose, so it can be used for any use cases that require high level security. Having said that, since we have started off from the financial world, they are leading in the implementation. They had like two years of head start. So the most popular implementation scenario currently is banking. So like accessing banking data, or making payments, and things like that.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. And I know, I read from some examples from FAPI, the documentation is available. They mentioned some has been already – FAPI has been made part of some, I don’t know standards or regulations in few different countries, including UK, open banking is the most known. Could you tell us about those? How has FAPI being implemented in different countries?</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, so as you mentioned, the first mainstream usage was the UK Open Banking. Nine biggest banks were mandated by Competitive Market Authority, CMA, to open up the API and FAPI was chosen as the protocol to secure them. And I understand the first reason for that is to make banking data portable. But subsequently, PSD2 kicked in, and now it was expanded into the payment.</p>
<p>And then after that, Australian Consumer Data Standard adopted FAPI. So as the name suggests, it’s much wider than just banking. It’s for any consumer data costs. Again, they have started from banking, and if I remember correctly, they are now expanding into electricity and things like that.</p>
<p>And then Brazil followed the step. I actually had the opportunity to talk with the Vice Governor, I think of the Brazilian Central Bank in London, just before the COVID outbreak. And we agreed that adopting a standardised approach for the testing or certification coming together is going to be really, really vital for widespread adoption and quick adoption. So I think that was taken by Brazilian Central Bank and they are now mandating that to the banks and TPPs, they’re like parties in FinTechs.</p>
<p>And then more recently FDX in the United States announced its adoption, so did the Russian FinTech Association, they have been public. While FDX has made a written statement in the blog post on their website, in the case of the Russian FinTech Association, it’s still verbal, but they’ve been speaking about that in the conferences. So I think it’s, you know, public knowledge now.</p>
<p>Of course, there are a little bit of tweaks that are required for the Russian use cases. In the case of current FAPI, for the purpose of bolting down the options, we have specified a few encryption algorithms and signature algorithms to be used. But in the case of Russia, they need to use their own cost standard for those algorithms. So we need to expand it, modify it and expand it a bit. But that can be done as extension. We are talking about that right now.</p>
<p>And then most recently, we have started joint workshop with the Berlin Group, which is very prominent in continental Europe to seek a way to converge. So, it’s getting good traction now.</p>
<p>Oscar: Berlin Group, I’m not so familiar. It’s also into financial or what it covers, Berlin Group?</p>
<p>Nat: So Berlin Group is mainly… how can I put it? It’s an association of mainly banks. And then there are advisory groups made up which includes FinTechs and other industries as well. But although the name says Berlin, it’s not only Germany. It’s from many other countries as well. So it’s quite widespread in the continent of Europe. And also, I heard some of the Berlin Group banks are now implementing FAPI, or they have already implemented FAPI as well. So that’s an interesting development as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: And it’s also possible that some – in other countries, in different institutions they can implement independently, right, without having a regulation or a main association that – say it force them to use them.</p>
<p>Nat: Sure. Sure. It’s a standard and standards, unless required by regulations like in some other cases, it’s totally optional. It’s totally voluntary. But at the same time, you know, anybody can actually use it. So you don’t have to wait for regulators to come in, and mandating you to use it.</p>
<p>Oscar: So it’s very likely that we will hear in the next, well, in the new year and in the coming months, coming years more associations like this, or banking or even in other industries, more regulations in different other geographies that are embracing FAPI.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, so one of the reasons for FDX I understand to adopt FAPI is to move ahead. Well, I don’t know if that’s correct in other countries, but in many countries, if industries or industrial body actually self-regulate themselves, the government regulations do not kick in and you’ll get more freedom. So I think it’s actually better for the industry to adopt something like this without being mandated by the government.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what about <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/podcast/global-assured-identity-network-gain-elizabeth-garber/" title="GAIN">GAIN</a>, the project you are heavily involved also, a project that was released a few months ago that also requires GAIN, or – I’m sorry, FAPI. Is FAPI part of GAIN, or could you tell us?</p>
<p>Nat: So GAIN itself is technology neutral, so…</p>
<p>Oscar: OK.</p>
<p>Nat: It’s not mandating any particular technology. It’s open, but FAPI can also be used. And certainly, that is envisaged by some of the participants in GAIN as the first step. So certainly, you can use FAPI and there are people who are using FAPI in the GAIN POC that they’re self-organising right now.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. And could you tell us – leaving a bit outside of the main topic of FAPI, but could you tell us a bit what was also coming from in GAIN, what is happening lately and what is coming in the next months?</p>
<p>Nat: So, there are two distinct paths, at least two, or maybe depending on how you count, it can be three. One is a technical working group, which is hosted by OpenID Foundation and the others are the legal and the business working groups, which are hosted by IIF and Open Identity Exchange. IIF stands for International Institute of Finance, right?</p>
<p>And as to the technical part, we are currently working on the legal agreement, a legal participation agreement so that we can create a safe space for all the participants whose taking part in GAIN POC. We’re in the final phase of drafting such a legal agreement, so that we can participate in POC feeling safe.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. So yes, more… the POCs are coming for GAIN. Excellent. And tell us, core FAPI is the project that has ended, I know you are you’re working on that. So tell us what is coming next for the FAPI Working Group?</p>
<p>Nat: So FAPI Working Group is very far from being done, right? And we have ever more work to do. In the beginning, we didn’t create a profile for dynamic client registration, or consent or intent grant, and every jurisdiction says it slightly differently, but grant management will be core. We had enough work to work then as well. So we kind of postpone the work.</p>
<p>However, after UK, EU, Australia and Brazil went online, it became quite clear, painfully clear, that there are compatibility and security headaches because of no standardised way of doing it. So we decided to start work to address them. So the new technical specification called Grant Management for OAuth is being drafted. And it’s gone through the first implementers draft for OAuth successfully so that it can be implemented by implementers without fear of being sued or something like that. And people are just ironing out the kinks about the draft. We’ll probably need multiple rounds of these things to get to the finalisation but it’s a good start, right.</p>
<p>And then now we’re just starting, just in this, like, a month or so, we’ve been starting dynamic client registration part. It’s been done slightly differently in the UK, Australia and Brazil, as well. And, you know, we are gaining a lot of knowledge from that as well. So we are trying to codify the best practices about those. And hopefully, that’s going to be a very good guidance for other jurisdictions to follow.</p>
<p>Oscar: So that relates to the enrolment of customers or identity for customers.</p>
<p>Nat: Well, actually, no, that’s KYC, right. The dynamic client registration is so the end users uses software to interact with the, for example, banks, in the case of open banking, right? And this software actually needs to be registered to those banks. And we have to exchange the keys and things like that. And that can, of course, be done manually but that doesn’t scale. So we needed to have some kind of programmatical way of doing it. That’s called dynamic client registration. And again, we have a lot of options there. And we need to fold it down for the interoperability purpose and to have predictable security. So that’s what we are doing.</p>
<p>When it comes to the KYC part, KYC is a big field. And it’s a headache for all the financial institutions. It hasn’t been too effective to date, but we’re trying and one of the ways to help the pain there is to create a protocol which would make it easier and more secure to exchange those KYC data among the participants, like GAIN. And that’s not being worked on by FAPI Working Group, but in the adjacent working group called eKYC and IDA Working Group.</p>
<p>Actually, if you join the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI Working Group</a> call without dropping off and calling another number or accessing new URL, you will be seamlessly taken to eKYC and IDA Working Group. It’s just happening at the same time, I mean at the same location, just they are connected to each other. And that working group is working on the data and metadata side. That is how to express verified attributes and how they were verified. And these attributes, in the first phase we are sorting out the natural persons, but in the coming days we will also be doing legal entities as well, just passing that this person has been verified as, for example, Nat Sakimura isn’t good enough, you really can’t trust it, right? You need more information and, for example, how it was verified, why it was verified, which evidence you have used, under which legal framework, and so on, so forth, and when.</p>
<p>So, these we call metadata needed to be sent with the data itself. And the specification called OIDC for identity assurance, or OpenID Connect for identity assurance, deals with it. And using that standard, you can get those data and metadata together in a signed format. So the combination of the standard, together with FAPI will be very, very powerful.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I can see it’s needed definitely. It’s powerful as you said. So yeah, fantastic job that the FAPI Working Group and this other adjacent group is doing together. Nat, just one final question, for all business leaders who are listening to this conversation we had, what is the one actionable idea that you would like them to write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Nat: OK. So while it’s been talked a lot about – the data economy, that it will be over 5% of GDP, it’s yet to be seen. Why? The data economy needs a secure and interoperable data network. And we are finally getting there with FAPI and eKYC standards. So, you guys need to get ready for the ride. It’s the time. You need to start acting, start preparing for that.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. And that will affect all industries.</p>
<p>Nat: Yeah, it’s not only financial institutions. Yeah, it’s for everybody.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I couldn’t agree more. Thanks a lot Nat for this very interesting conversation. We had knowing a lot more about FAPI and all the great work you do. And please let us know for people who like to continue the conversation with you or know more about the work you are doing, what are the best ways to find you on the net, get in touch?</p>
<p>Nat: OK. So, I’m in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/natsakimura/">LinkedIn</a>. If you search Nat Sakimura, you can get there. I’m on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NatSakimura">YouTube</a> as well, so you can get to me there as well, so is <a href="https://twitter.com/_nat_en">Twitter</a>. And of course, if you’re technical, I highly recommend you to join <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi/">FAPI Working Group</a> so we can share the technical ideas in a safe IPR environment.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Again, thanks a lot Nat for this interview and all the best and Happy New Year!</p>
<p>Nat: Thanks, much obliged and likewise.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>
 
   Basic knowledge of C# 
   <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0">.NET 5.0 runtime and SDK</a>, which includes the .NET CLI 
   Your favorite IDE that supports .NET projects, such as <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio</a>, <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/">Visual Studio for Mac</a>, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>, or <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/">JetBrains Rider</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a> 
   A <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/">Microsoft Azure Account</a> (Azure free account) 
 

 Create a new ASP.NET project 

<p>Let’s create a new ASP.NET project. We’ll use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/">.NET CLI</a> to scaffold the project.</p>

<p>Run the following commands to create the solution, the project, and add the project to the solution.</p>

   <code>dotnet new sln -n OktaProfilePicture
dotnet new mvc --auth none --framework net5.0 -o OktaProfilePicture
dotnet sln add ./OktaProfilePicture/OktaProfilePicture.csproj
</code>   

<p>Now you can open the project in your favorite IDE and run the app to ensure everything runs correctly. If you are using the command line to build and serve, use the following commands.</p>

   <code>dotnet build
dotnet run --project OktaProfilePicture
</code>   

 Secure your app with Okta 

<p>You’ll use Okta to secure the application quickly with Okta SDKs, so you don’t have to spin up an identity provider and deal with the tricky details of authentication.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Other. 
    Then, change the Redirect URI to <code>https://localhost:5001/authorization-code/callback</code> and use <code>https://localhost:5001/signout/callback</code> for the Logout Redirect URI.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: /path/to/app/.okta.env
</code>   

<p>Run <code>cat .okta.env</code> (or <code>type .okta.env</code> on Windows) to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>

   <code>export OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6"
export OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS"
</code>   

<p>Your Okta domain is the first part of your issuer, before <code>/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Web App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Okta CLI will configure a new OIDC application and save some secret properties in the solution folder in a file called <code>.okta.env</code>. We’ll use the values in the app.</p>

<p>Some of the values in the <code>.okta.env</code> are secret, and ideally, they should be in a trusted store or in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-6.0&amp;tabs=windows">Secrets Manager</a> for local development. Since you’ll be making updates to configuration through this post, we’ll use App Settings so you can set up your configuration as you go along.</p>

<p>Open <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> to add a new section, <code>Okta</code>, with authentication details of your app as shown below. The <code>Domain</code> is the URL of the <code>Issuer</code> value without the path segments.</p>

   <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
    "Default": "Information",
    "Microsoft": "Warning",
    "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "ClientId": "{clientId}",
    "ClientSecret": "{clientSecret}",
    "Domain": ""
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s add authentication to the app. Open a terminal window, then run the following command to add Okta’s authentication middleware package.</p>

   <code>dotnet add OktaProfilePicture package Okta.AspNetCore --version 4.0.0
</code>   

<p>To set up authentication services and register Okta’s authentication middleware services, open <code>Startup.cs</code> and add the following code in the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method before the <code>services.AddControllersWithViews();</code>.</p>

   <code>services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
  {
    options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultSignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme;
  })
  .AddCookie()
  .AddOktaMvc(new OktaMvcOptions
    {
      OktaDomain = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:Domain"),
      ClientId = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientId"),
      ClientSecret = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientSecret")
    });
</code>   

<p>Next, in the <code>Configure()</code> method, add a call to use authentication before adding authorization. Your code will look like this:</p>

   <code>app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();
</code>   

<p>If your IDE is having trouble figuring out references, add the following <code>using</code> statements:</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Okta.AspNetCore;
</code>   

<p>Next, you’ll add a controller that handles login, logout, and protected data. Let’s add the methods for login and logout.</p>

<p>Create a controller named <code>AccountController</code> in the <code>Controllers</code> folder. Add the two methods to support login and logout. Your <code>AccountController</code> code will look like the following.</p>

   <code>namespace OktaProfilePicture.Controllers
{
  public class AccountController : Controller
  {
    public IActionResult LogIn()
    {
      if (!HttpContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
      {
        return Challenge(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme);
      }

      return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
    }

    public IActionResult LogOut()
    {
      return new SignOutResult(
        new[]
        {
          OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme,
          CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme,
        },
        new AuthenticationProperties { RedirectUri = "/Home/" });
    }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>We’ll create an empty view for the <code>Account</code> controller as a placeholder. Create a new folder named <code>Account</code> in the <code>Views</code> directory. The <code>Account</code> folder is where the views to display and edit your profile will go. Add the file <code>Profile.cshtml</code> to the new <code>Account</code> folder, and paste in the following code.</p>

   <code>@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "User Profile";
}

&lt;h1&gt;Your Profile&lt;/h1&gt;
</code>   

<p>Next we can update the initial view to add login and logout. Open <code>Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml</code> and add the following markup above the <code>&lt;ul class="navbar-nav flex-grow-1"&gt;</code> tag:</p>

   <code>@if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
{
  &lt;ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;p class="navbar-text"&gt;Hello, @User.Identity.Name&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    @* &lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="nav-link" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="Profile" id="profile-button"&gt;Profile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; *@
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;form class="form-inline" asp-controller="Account" asp-action="LogOut" method="post"&gt;
        &lt;button type="submit" class="nav-link btn btn-link text-dark" id="logout-button"&gt;Sign Out&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
}
else
{
  &lt;a&gt;@Html.ActionLink("Sign In", "LogIn", "Account")&lt;/a&gt;
}
</code>   

<p>The parent <code>div</code> for the element we added needs some updates to the styles. Replace the</p>

<p><code>&lt;div class="navbar-collapse collapse d-sm-inline-flex justify-content-between"&gt;</code></p>

<p>with</p>

<p><code>&lt;div class="navbar-collapse collapse d-sm-inline-flex flex-sm-row-reverse"&gt;</code></p>

<p>If you run the app now, you can log in and log out, but there’s nothing to see yet.</p>

 View user details 

<p>We’ll use the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-dotnet">Okta .NET management SDK</a> to get and update user data. Add the Nuget package by running the following command.</p>

   <code>dotnet add OktaProfilePicture package Okta.Sdk --version 5.3.1
</code>   

<p>The Okta management SDK requires an API token that we manually generate. Log in to the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login/">Okta admin dashboard</a>. Then navigate to Security &gt; API &gt; Tokens tab and press the Create Token button. Enter a name for the token (I will use “OktaProfilePicture”) and press the Create Token button to finish creating the token. Make sure you copy the token value because you won’t be able to view it again:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now we can add the token to the settings file. Open <code>appSettings.Development.json</code>, and add a new property named <code>ApiToken</code> inside the Okta section. Add your token value. Your settings file should look like this.</p>

   <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
    "Default": "Information",
    "Microsoft": "Warning",
    "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "ClientId": "{clientId}",
    "ClientSecret": "{clientSecret}",
    "Domain": "",
    "ApiToken": "{token}"
  }
}

</code>   

<p>We want to add the Okta management SDK client to the Dependency Injection (DI) system to use it in the controller. Open <code>Startup.cs</code> and add the following code to <code>ConfigureServices</code> method before the method call <code>services.AddControllersWithViews();</code>.</p>

   <code>services.AddSingleton((serviceProvider) =&gt; new OktaClient(new OktaClientConfiguration()
{
  OktaDomain = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:Domain"),
  Token = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ApiToken")
}));
</code>   

<p>Add the following using statements if your IDE didn’t already add them for you.</p>

   <code>using Okta.Sdk;
using Okta.Sdk.Configuration;
</code>   

<p>Now we can use the service in the controller. Open <code>Controllers/AccountController.cs</code> and add a private field of type <code>OktaClient</code> and add a constructor to set the field to the <code>AccountController</code> class. The DI system injects an instance of <code>OktaClient</code> that you will use. Your code will look like this.</p>

   <code>private readonly OktaClient _oktaClient;

public AccountController(OktaClient oktaClient)
{
  _oktaClient = oktaClient;
}
</code>   

<p>In the <code>AccountController</code> class, create a private method to interact with Okta management SDK and retrieve user information.</p>

   <code>private async Task&lt;IUser&gt; GetOktaUser()
{
  var subject = HttpContext.User.Claims.First(claim =&gt; claim.Type == JwtRegisteredClaimNames.Sub).Value;
  return await _oktaClient.Users.GetUserAsync(subject);
}
</code>   

<p>If your IDE is confused about which packages to use, add the following using statements.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.IdentityModel.JsonWebTokens;
using Okta.Sdk;
</code>   

<p>Let’s get your profile info. Create a new public method in <code>AccountController</code> named <code>Profile</code> to handle interacting with the Profile view. You’ll use the user model from Okta. Your code will look like the following.</p>

   <code>public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Profile()
{
  var user = await GetOktaUser();

  return View(user);
}
</code>   

<p>We want to protect the <code>Profile</code> method against non-authenticated calls. With the Okta middleware configured, you can add guards. Add the <code>[Authorize]</code> attribute directly above the <code>Profile</code> method.</p>

<p>Let’s update the profile view with user information. Open <code>Views/Account/Profile.cshtml</code> and replace the existing code displaying your user info and a profile pic. You won’t have a profile pic to show yet, but that’s coming up soon!</p>

   <code>@model Okta.Sdk.IUser

@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "User Profile";
}

&lt;h1&gt;Your Profile&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class="card" style="width: 36rem;"&gt;
  &lt;div class="card-header d-flex justify-content-center"&gt;
    @if (ViewData["ProfileImageUrl"] != null)
    {
      &lt;img class="rounded-circle border border-info" src="@ViewData["ProfileImageUrl"]" alt="Profile picture" width="300px"/&gt;
    }
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="card-body"&gt;
    &lt;h2 class="card-title h3"&gt;@Model.Profile.FirstName @Model.Profile.LastName&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p class="card-subtitle h6 mb-2 text-muted"&gt;@Model.Profile.Email&lt;/p&gt;
    @if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(@Model.Profile.City) || !string.IsNullOrEmpty(@Model.Profile.CountryCode))
    {
      &lt;p class="mt-3 card-text"&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;📍&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ml-2"&gt;@Model.Profile.City, @Model.Profile.CountryCode&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
    }
    &lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-end"&gt;
      @* @if (ViewData["ProfileImageUrl"] != null) *@
      @* { *@
      @*    &lt;a class="btn btn-outline-danger mr-4" asp-action="DeleteProfilePic"&gt;Delete Profile Picture&lt;/a&gt; *@
      @* } *@
      @* &lt;a class="btn btn-primary" role="button" asp-action="EditProfile"&gt;Edit Profile&lt;/a&gt; *@
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Now that we have a <code>Profile</code> method, we can update the main navbar. Open <code>Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml</code> and uncomment the line of code that links to the “Profile” view.</p>

<p>You can view your profile, but the edit button doesn’t work yet.</p>

<p></p>

 Edit your Okta profile 

<p>We’ll add the support to edit your profile info, except for your profile picture. We need a new model that supports the form fields for editing profiles. Add a new file named <code>UserProfileViewModel.cs</code> to the <code>Models</code> directory. Copy and paste the following code into the file.</p>

   <code>#nullable enable
using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;

namespace OktaProfilePicture.Models
{
  public class UserProfileViewModel
  {
    [Required]
    public string? FirstName { get; set; }

    [Required]
    public string? LastName { get; set; }

    [Required]
    [EmailAddress]
    public string? Email { get; set; }

    public string? City { get; set; }

    [Display(Name = "Country Code")]
    public string? CountryCode { get; set; }

    [Display(Name = "Profile Image")]
    public IFormFile? ProfileImage { get; set; }
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Next open the <code>AccountController</code> class. We need to add the methods to support editing your profile. First, we need a method to populate the view for editing, and we need another method to handle the profile update. Because both methods relate to editing the profile, we’ll name them the same and create a method overload.</p>

<p>Add a public method <code>EditProfile</code> to <code>AccountController</code> to populate the view and guard it against unauthenticated users. The method looks like the code below.</p>

   <code>[Authorize]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; EditProfile()
{
  var user = await GetOktaUser();

  return View(new UserProfileViewModel()
  {
    City = user.Profile.City,
    Email = user.Profile.Email,
    CountryCode = user.Profile.CountryCode,
    FirstName = user.Profile.FirstName,
    LastName = user.Profile.LastName
  });
}
</code>   

<p>Next, we’ll overload the <code>EditProfile</code> method with the user profile model. This method calls Okta management SDK to apply updates. Add the following method to <code>AccountController</code>.</p>

   <code>[Authorize]
[HttpPost]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; EditProfile(UserProfileViewModel profile)
{
  if (!ModelState.IsValid)
  {
    return View(profile);
  }

  var user = await GetOktaUser();
  user.Profile.FirstName = profile.FirstName;
  user.Profile.LastName = profile.LastName;
  user.Profile.Email = profile.Email;
  user.Profile.City = profile.City;
  user.Profile.CountryCode = profile.CountryCode;

  await _oktaClient.Users.UpdateUserAsync(user, user.Id, null);
  return RedirectToAction("Profile");
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s add the view for editing. Create a new view named <code>EditProfile.cshtml</code> in <code>Views/Account</code> folder. Copy the code below and replace the contents of <code>EditProfile.cshtml</code> with it.</p>

   <code>@model UserProfileViewModel

@{
  ViewData["Title"] = "Edit Profile";
}

&lt;h1&gt;Edit Profile&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class="row"&gt;
  &lt;div class="col-md-4"&gt;
    &lt;form asp-action="EditProfile" enctype="multipart/form-data"&gt;
      &lt;div asp-validation-summary="ModelOnly" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label asp-for="FirstName" class="control-label"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input asp-for="FirstName" class="form-control" /&gt;
        &lt;span asp-validation-for="FirstName" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label asp-for="LastName" class="control-label"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input asp-for="LastName" class="form-control" /&gt;
        &lt;span asp-validation-for="LastName" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label asp-for="Email" class="control-label"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input asp-for="Email" class="form-control" /&gt;
        &lt;span asp-validation-for="Email" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label asp-for="City" class="control-label"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input asp-for="City" class="form-control" /&gt;
        &lt;span asp-validation-for="City" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label asp-for="CountryCode" class="control-label"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input asp-for="CountryCode" class="form-control" /&gt;
        &lt;span asp-validation-for="CountryCode" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;label asp-for="ProfileImage" class="control-label"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;div class="custom-file"&gt;
          &lt;input asp-for="ProfileImage" class="custom-file-input" id="customFile"&gt;
          &lt;label class="custom-file-label" for="customFile"&gt;Choose file&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;span asp-validation-for="ProfileImage" class="text-danger"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="form-group"&gt;
        &lt;input type="submit" value="Save" class="btn btn-primary" /&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a asp-action="Profile"&gt;Back to Profile&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

@section Scripts {
  @{await Html.RenderPartialAsync("_ValidationScriptsPartial");}

  &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    const fileInput = document.querySelector('.custom-file-input');
    fileInput.addEventListener('change', (event) =&gt; {
      const fileName = event.target.value.split("\\").pop();
      document.querySelector('.custom-file-label').textContent = fileName;
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;
}
</code>   

<p>Lastly, open <code>Views/Account/Profile.cshtml</code> to uncomment a line of code towards the bottom of the file. Uncomment the line that displays a button to edit profile - the line with <code>&lt;a class="btn btn-primary" role="button" asp-action="EditProfile"&gt;EditProfile&lt;/a&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Now you should be able to edit your profile information except for your profile picture. Next we’ll make it so your app persists your profile picture.</p>

<p></p>

 Add Azure Storage 

<p>To make your profile picture viewable, we need to persist the image somewhere. We’ll use Azure Storage to do this and use a custom attribute in Okta to store a unique identifier associated with the file in Azure. You’ll be able to upload and display a profile picture in the app.</p>

<p>First, we’ll create the custom attributes in Okta using the Okta admin dashboard.</p>

<p>Log in to the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login/">Okta admin dashboard</a>. Then navigate to Directory &gt; Profile Editor. You should see an item named User (default) in the list, which is Okta’s default user profile template. Select User (default) to open the Profile Editor. Press the +Add Attribute button.</p>

<p>You’ll add two string attributes, <code>profileImageKey</code> and <code>personId</code>:</p>
 
   Use “Profile Image Key” as the display name and <code>profileImageKey</code> as the variable name. 
   Use “Person Id” as the display name for the second attribute and <code>personId</code> as the variable name. 
 

<p>See the image below for the “Profile Image Key” attribute inputs.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Create another attribute named <code>personId</code>. If you look at the “User (default)” user type attribute list, you should see your two new attributes listed at the bottom.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, we’ll create Azure Storage. If you don’t already have an Azure subscription, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F">make a free account</a> before you begin. We’ll walk through the steps using the Azure Portal, but if you are an Azure pro, feel free to use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli">Azure CLI</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/?view=azps-7.0.0">Azure PowerShell</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have an Azure subscription, open the <a href="https://portal.azure.com">Azure Portal</a>. Open the menu by pressing the hamburger menu on the left, and select Storage accounts. Press +Create to create a storage account. In the Create a storage account view, create a Resource Group if you don’t already have one for test projects. I named my Resource Group “OktaDemo”. Enter <code>oktaprofilepicture</code> as the storage name, select a region (Azure’s default selection is fine here), then select Standard performance and Locally-redundant storage (LRS) for redundancy. Press the Review + create button at the bottom as the default options for the remaining selections are acceptable. Press Create to complete creating the storage account.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, we need to get the access keys for integrating the storage account SDK in the app. In the <code>oktaprofilepicture</code> storage account, open Access keys below the Security + networking section in the nav menu. Then press Show keys and copy the first Connection string field. Now we can move to the code!</p>

<p></p>

<p>We’re going to add a new section for Azure resources to the <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> file in the solution to connect to the Azure resource. Open <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> and add a new key named “Azure” with a property called “BlobStorageConnectionString” like the following code snippet.</p>

   <code>{
  ... Logging and Okta sections here,
  
  "Azure": {
    "BlobStorageConnectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=oktaprofilepicture;AccountKey=eWlJUj.....A==;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, we’ll need to add the packages and set up the service. Add two Nuget packages — one for Azure Storage and the other for integrating Azure clients into the DI system. Add the packages by running the following commands in the terminal.</p>

   <code>dotnet add OktaProfilePicture package Azure.Storage.Blobs --version 12.9.1
dotnet add OktaProfilePicture package Microsoft.Extensions.Azure --version 1.1.1
</code>   

<p>Open <code>Startup.cs</code> and add the following code to the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method before <code>services.AddControllersWithViews();</code>.</p>

   <code>services.AddAzureClients(builder =&gt;
{
  builder.AddBlobServiceClient(Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Azure:BlobStorageConnectionString"));
});
</code>   

<p>We can inject the blob service client into the <code>AccountController</code> and connect to the blob container. We’ll create the blob container that we’ll use in the constructor. Open <code>Controllers/AccountController.cs</code> and add the blob container client as shown below.</p>

   <code>private readonly OktaClient _oktaClient;
private readonly BlobContainerClient _blobContainerClient;

public AccountController(OktaClient oktaClient, BlobServiceClient blobServiceClient)
{
  _oktaClient = oktaClient;
  _blobContainerClient = blobServiceClient.GetBlobContainerClient("okta-profile-picture-container");
  _blobContainerClient.CreateIfNotExists();
}
</code>   

<p>Update the <code>Profile()</code> and <code>EditProfile(UserProfileViewModel profile)</code> methods to upload and view the blob container image. First, let’s update the <code>Profile()</code> method.</p>

<p>The blob container’s access level is private, so we need to generate a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview">shared access signature</a> that creates a read-only, temporary URL that we can use in the view. We’ll also use the custom attribute <code>profileImageKey</code> to retrieve an existing image if one exists.</p>

<p>Replace the existing <code>Profile()</code> method with the following code.</p>

   <code>[Authorize]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Profile()
{
  var user = await GetOktaUser();
  var profileImage = (string)user.Profile["profileImageKey"];
  if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(profileImage))
  {
    return View(user);
  }

  var sasBuilder = new BlobSasBuilder
  {
    StartsOn = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow,
    ExpiresOn = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddMinutes(15)
  };

  sasBuilder.SetPermissions(BlobSasPermissions.Read);
  var url = _blobContainerClient.GetBlobClient(profileImage).GenerateSasUri(sasBuilder);
  ViewData["ProfileImageUrl"] = url;

  return View(user);
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>EditProfile(UserProfileViewModel profile)</code> changes to</p>

   <code>[Authorize]
[HttpPost]
[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; EditProfile(UserProfileViewModel profile)
{
  if (!ModelState.IsValid)
  {
    return View(profile);
  }

  var user = await GetOktaUser();
  user.Profile.FirstName = profile.FirstName;
  user.Profile.LastName = profile.LastName;
  user.Profile.Email = profile.Email;
  user.Profile.City = profile.City;
  user.Profile.CountryCode = profile.CountryCode;

  if (profile.ProfileImage != null)
  {
    await UpdateUserImage();
  }

  await _oktaClient.Users.UpdateUserAsync(user, user.Id, null);
  return RedirectToAction("Profile");

  async Task UpdateUserImage()
  {
    var blobName = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty((string)user.Profile["profileImageKey"]))
    {
      await _blobContainerClient.DeleteBlobAsync((string)user.Profile["profileImageKey"]);
    }
    await _blobContainerClient.UploadBlobAsync(blobName, profile.ProfileImage?.OpenReadStream());
    user.Profile["profileImageKey"] = blobName;
  }
}
</code>   

<p>If you run the app, you can select a picture from local files to add to your profile and see your profile picture on the “Profile” page.</p>

 Add Azure Cognitive Services 

<p>Finally, we get to check out Azure Cognitive Services for facial analysis. We’ll use facial analysis in two different ways — for face detection and face verification.</p>

<p>First, we need to create the Azure resource and get the access keys. Open the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesFace">Cognitive Services Face</a> resource page in the Azure portal. Press + Create to open the Create Face view. Select “OktaBlog” as the Resource group (or a Resource group of your choosing) and name the instance “OktaProfilePicture”. Since this is for demo purposes, I used the “Free F0” pricing tier. Press Review + create to create the resource. Open “OktaProfilePicture” Face service instance and open Keys and Endpoint. You will need both the key and the Endpoint.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Open the <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> file and add two new fields in the <code>Azure</code> section named <code>SubscriptionKey</code> and <code>FaceClientEndpoint</code>. Copy and paste the key and endpoint values from the Azure Keys and Endpoint view. The <code>Azure</code> section of your <code>appsettings.Development.json</code> will now look like the following.</p>

   <code>{
  ... Logging and Okta sections here,
  
  "Azure": {
    "BlobStorageConnectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=oktaprofilepicture;AccountKey=eWlJUj.....A==;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net",
    "SubscriptionKey": "{FaceResourceKey}",
    "FaceClientEndpoint": "https://{FaceResourceName}.cognitiveservices.azure.com/"
  }
}
</code>   

<p>To add the packages, run the following command in the terminal.</p>

   <code>dotnet add OktaProfilePicture package Microsoft.Azure.CognitiveServices.Vision.Face --version 2.8.0-preview.2
</code>   

<p>Let’s add the face service to the DI system to use it in the controller. Open <code>Startup.cs</code> and add the following code to the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method before the call to <code>services.AddControllersWithViews();</code>.</p>

   <code>services.AddSingleton((serviceProvider) =&gt;
  new FaceClient(
    new ApiKeyServiceClientCredentials(Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Azure:SubscriptionKey")))
  {
    Endpoint = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Azure:FaceClientEndpoint")
  }
);
</code>   

<p>Now we can incorporate the service into the controller. Open <code>Controllers/AccountController.cs</code>, inject the face service in the constructor, then connect it to a private instance that we’ll use throughout the controller class. Your code will look like this:</p>

   <code>private readonly OktaClient _oktaClient;
private readonly BlobContainerClient _blobContainerClient;
private readonly FaceClient _faceClient;

public AccountController(OktaClient oktaClient, BlobServiceClient blobServiceClient, FaceClient faceClient)
{
  _oktaClient = oktaClient;
  _faceClient = faceClient;

  _blobContainerClient = blobServiceClient.GetBlobContainerClient("okta-profile-picture-container");
  _blobContainerClient.CreateIfNotExists();
}
</code>   

<p>The first thing we want to do with the cognitive service is ensure there’s only one face in an image. To do so, we’ll use a built-in method to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.azure.cognitiveservices.vision.face.faceoperationsextensions.detectwithstreamasync?view=azure-dotnet">detect faces</a>.</p>

<p>In <code>EditProfile(UserProfileViewModel profile)</code> method, we’ll add code to open the image file, detect the number of faces, and set an error if there isn’t exactly one face in the image. Replace the <code>if(profile.PageImage != null){await UpdateUserImage();}</code> statement with the following code.</p>

   <code>if (profile.ProfileImage == null)
{
  await _oktaClient.Users.UpdateUserAsync(user, user.Id, null);
  return RedirectToAction("Profile");
}

var stream = profile.ProfileImage.OpenReadStream();
var detectedFaces = await _faceClient.Face.DetectWithStreamAsync(stream, recognitionModel: RecognitionModel.Recognition04, detectionModel: DetectionModel.Detection01);

if (detectedFaces.Count != 1 || detectedFaces[0].FaceId == null)
{
  ModelState.AddModelError("", $"Detected {detectedFaces.Count} faces instead of 1 face");
  return View(profile);
}

await UpdateUserImage();
</code>   

<p>The <code>RecognitionModel.Recognition04</code> is the most accurate model currently available, and <code>DetectionModel.Detection01</code> is a model that avoids detecting small and blurry faces.</p>

<p>Now, if you try running the app and upload an image with you and your friends, you’ll see an error.</p>

 Perform facial analysis 

<p>Next, let’s add the facial analysis. We need to handle two scenarios.</p>
 
   You’re adding a profile picture for the first time — this sets the baseline for the facial features to use in future comparisons 
   You’re updating your profile picture — facial analysis runs against the face in this image and compares it to the baseline 
 

<p>Let’s handle the first scenario.</p>

<p>The Face API only stores the extracted facial features for 24 hours by default, so we need to set a baseline that we can refer to beyond the 24-hour window. We can store facial features within the “OktaProfilePicture” Azure Cognitive Services resource, which we’ll do for the first upload scenario.</p>

<p>In the <code>EditProfile(UserProfileViewModel profile)</code> method, replace the line of code that calls <code>await UpdateUserImage();</code> with the code snippet below.</p>

   <code>var personGroupId = user.Id.ToLower();

if (string.IsNullOrEmpty((string)user.Profile["personId"]))
{
  await _faceClient.PersonGroup.CreateAsync(personGroupId, user.Profile.Login, recognitionModel: RecognitionModel.Recognition04);

  stream = profile.ProfileImage.OpenReadStream();
  var personId = (await _faceClient.PersonGroupPerson.CreateAsync(personGroupId, user.Profile.Login)).PersonId;
  await _faceClient.PersonGroupPerson.AddFaceFromStreamAsync(personGroupId, personId, stream);

  user.Profile["personId"] = personId;
  await UpdateUserImage();
} else {

}
</code>   

<p>The <code>PersonGroup</code> is a container object for a group of people. We’re using your Okta user ID as the unique identifier for this group, so each group is truly individualized. Other options could be group or department IDs. The <code>PersonGroupPerson</code> object is an individual within the group, so there is usually a 1:n relationship between <code>PersonGroup</code> and <code>PersonGroupPerson</code>. We’re also associating one face to a <code>PersonGroupPerson</code>, although you can add multiple images of an individual so you can train the service to analyze an individual better. We’re using a simple case here to showcase how this service works by a single image of an individual.</p>

<p>Now we want to handle the second scenario — where we want to perform facial analysis compared to the baseline facial features. We want only to allow the image to update when we have some measure of confidence that the new face image matches the baseline. Add the following snippet inside the <code>else</code> block from the code above.</p>

   <code>var faceId = detectedFaces[0].FaceId.Value;

var personId = new Guid((string)user.Profile["personId"]);
var verifyResult = await _faceClient.Face.VerifyFaceToPersonAsync(faceId, personId, personGroupId);

if (verifyResult.IsIdentical &amp;&amp; verifyResult.Confidence &gt;= 0.8)
{
  await UpdateUserImage();
}
else
{
  ModelState.AddModelError("", "The uploaded picture doesn't match your current picture");
  return View(profile);
}
</code>   

<p>We used a confidence level of 80% in positive identifications since we only have one facial feature for comparison. With better training, you can increase the confidence level.</p>

<p>Now you can upload a picture of yourself and then upload a photo of a friend to see what happens.</p>

 Resetting profile pictures 

<p>Sometimes you need to clear everything out and start over. I uploaded a picture of myself wearing oversized sunglasses and a hat, and the face service no longer recognized me. 😎</p>

<p>Let’s add in the delete functionality so you can reset everything.</p>

<p>In <code>AccountController</code> we’ll add a new method called <code>DeleteProfilePic()</code>. This method deletes the image from container storage, removes links to stored facial features, and clears out the custom attributes set in your Okta profile. Copy the code below and add it to the end of the <code>AccountController</code> class.</p>

   <code>[Authorize]
public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; DeleteProfilePic()
{
  var user = await GetOktaUser();

  await CleanAzureResources();

  user.Profile["profileImageKey"] = null;
  user.Profile["personId"] = null;
  await _oktaClient.Users.UpdateUserAsync(user, user.Id, null);
  return RedirectToAction("Profile");

  async Task CleanAzureResources()
  {
    // remove image from blob
    await _blobContainerClient.DeleteBlobAsync((string)user.Profile["profileImageKey"]);

    // remove face from Face services
    var personId = Guid.Parse((string)user.Profile["personId"]);
    await _faceClient.PersonGroupPerson.DeleteAsync(user.Id.ToLower(), personId);
    await _faceClient.PersonGroup.DeleteAsync(user.Id.ToLower());
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, open <code>Views/Account/Profile.cshtml</code> and uncomment the remaining commented out code. Doing so allows the “Delete Profile Picture” button to display.</p>

<p>Now you can reset your profile picture and upload that picture of you wearing a hat and sunglasses to test out the facial comparison ability.</p>

<p>How people pay bills, shop online, open accounts and experience their finances is evolving quickly. Fintech innovations are altering the way consumers think about and relate to money. The COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated the digital transition. The shifting reality of how finances are managed is underway. Bank branches and paper checks are an afterthought to a growing number of consumers. Eight in 10 Americans are linking their bank accounts digitally, using these connections to automate everyday tasks like paying credit card and utility bills, according to Mastercard’s new study, <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking/">The Rise of Open Banking</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sea change in consumer expectations is already in motion. With every leap in speed, security, and ease of use, open banking apps and services usher in the next generation of finance. The advent of the internet has trained the human mind to process far more information than in the past, and to do it quickly. When it comes to their personal finances, people want the real-time data whenever they want it. Save them time and money, and enhance their financial health, or they won’t adopt your platform.</p>
 1. Saving More Time, Creating Less Work 
<p>Just a handful of years ago, a group of friends out to dinner would have to all reach into their wallets and purses, chip in cash, write a check or stack a pile of credit cards on top of the bill, and wait for the server to swipe them all. With the massive adoption and growth of P2P payment apps, these antiquated processes are quickly becoming a thing of the past.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In real time, payments can be split between friends with a few taps on the mobile screen. Digital wallets allow a busy shopper to tap their phone against a payment terminal and breeze through checkout at retail stores. Encrypted credit card info auto-populates, saving time and reducing user error when shopping online. The countless hours these new processes save is the biggest driver for adoption. 59% of study respondents cited this as their number one motivator.&nbsp;</p>
 2. Saving Money 
<p>65% of Americans <a href="https://mint.intuit.com/blog/budgeting/spending-knowledge-survey/">don’t know</a> how much money they spent last month. Saving doesn’t come naturally to many people, and our <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/08/why-are-we-so-emotional-about-money">emotionally-charged relationship</a> with money certainly doesn’t help. So much emphasis is placed on new and better ways to spend that saving becomes just a lurking afterthought. Open banking innovators are addressing this huge segment of consumers with a rich slate of apps and services. AI and machine-learning engines do the heavy lifting of savings calculation, goal-setting and projection, raising the level of users’ financial literacy. 42% of Americans surveyed wanted help saving their money, and trust technology to give them the advantage they need.</p>
<p>Open banking technology powers some of the most effective fintech apps for saving money, using artificial intelligence and machine learning to take a deep dive into spending habits and cash flow. Some even <a href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/how-gamification-can-help-you-meet-financial-goals/">gamify finances</a>, injecting the process with fun and some healthy self-competition.&nbsp;</p>
  
 3. Improving Financial Health 
<p>Open banking and AI make a powerful duo. Open banking connections to third-party financial service providers are flipping the data experience to favor the consumer. Anyone can download a financial management app, grant permission to access their bank accounts, and be guided easily through opening accounts, investment suggestions, and loan applications. This happens in moments, not hours or days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fintech AI systems process massive amounts of data in milliseconds. App and service developers can leverage this power to analyze a consumer’s subscription payments, utility bills, direct deposits and loan obligations near-instantaneously. Machine learning and AI engines can use this rich, real-time data to suggest smart financial planning and investing options. It’s a growing expectation that has to be accounted for in app development. Exposure to the open banking ecosystem is raising the level of consumer financial literacy, and it’s happening quickly. As a result, financial decision-making can improve dramatically. Consumers are seeing the positive results of adoption in their bank balances: 35% of respondents to the survey say improved financial health is why they use fintech.&nbsp;</p>
 4. Automate It! 
<p>No one leaps out of bed in the morning in wild anticipation of paying the electricity bill. Mundane, time-consuming financial tasks don’t actually have to absorb anyone’s time. Open banking allows easy setup and maintenance of connections to financial institutions, allowing consumers to set a variety of monthly payments and subscriptions to auto-pay. With the average consumer spending <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/average-consumer-spending-273-per-month-on-subscription-services-report/">$273 per month</a> on a mixed bag of small payments, automation saves a considerable amount of time, and it ensures payments aren’t missed. U.S. households average <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/04/18/deloitte-consumers-load-up-on-subscriptions-but-are-frustrated-with-fragmentation/">nine separate payments</a> per month just for entertainment subscriptions. Add gym memberships, retail subscriptions and utilities to an ever-growing list of small, recurring transactions, and the benefit of utilizing technology to manage these payments becomes obvious. 26% of North Americans surveyed are attracted to technology to help them automate these little chores, freeing up their time for more important concerns.&nbsp;</p>
 5. Getting a Better Holistic View of Finances 
<p>Gone are the days when consumers used file drawers stuffed with manila folders, neatly tabbed, in an attempt to keep checking the pulse of their financial health. Open banking data has spawned a wealth of apps and services that give consumers and small businesses an up-to-the-moment picture of their finances. Open banking connections across accounts and across financial institutions power the apps that consumers are using to take their financial temperature. The growing expectation is that individuals should be able to see what their money is doing and where it’s going, 24 hours a day. 18% of North American users said that tracking their money was a major driver for fintech adoption.&nbsp;</p>

And a rapidly changing economy has the Federal Reserve playing catch-up, Axios’ Neil Irwin&nbsp;writes.</blockquote>  Less than a month ago, the Fed made an abrupt pivot toward a more hawkish monetary policy stance. By the end of last week, the data was pointing toward an even faster withdrawal of stimulus.  <blockquote>Why it matters: Cheap money has become baked into the economy, so the Fed’s moves to take it away will bring risks of abrupt swings in markets that could spill back over into the&nbsp;economy.</blockquote><blockquote>By the numbers: Friday’s jobs data are Exhibit A. While initial headlines focused on soft growth in payroll numbers, the report points toward a labor market that has become exceptionally tight, contributing to already high inflation.</blockquote>  The unemployment rate is down to 3.9%. In the last economic cycle that level was not reached until May 2018 — at which point the Fed had already raised interest rates six times (now:&nbsp;zero).  Wages are not only rising, but rising at an accelerating pace. Average hourly earnings rose 4.7% over the entire course of 2021, but at a 6.2% annual rate in the final three months of the&nbsp;year.  <blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>The bottom line: The labor market has gotten tighter, faster than most people, including at the Fed, thought possible just a few months ago. Now, policy is on track to follow&nbsp;suit.</blockquote><p>Goldman Sachs now predicts <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/10/goldman-predicts-the-fed-while-hike-rat%20es-four-times-this-year-more-than-previously-expected.html">the Fed will hike rates four times next&nbsp;year</a>.</p><p>Once the Fed starts hiking rates, they’ll also start <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/fed-minutes-december-2021.html">shedding their balance sheet</a>, essentially sucking easy money out of the&nbsp;system.</p><p>When that money gets sucked out, it gets sucked out of riskier assets like certain equities and&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>We’re now entering that part of the&nbsp;cycle.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/10/goldman-predicts-the-fed-while-hike-rates-four-times-this-year-more-than-previously-expected.html">Goldman predicts the Fed will hike rates four times this year, more than previously expected</a>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-10/goldman-now-expects-four-fed-hikes-sees-faster-runoff-in-2022">Goldman Now Expects Four Fed Hikes, Sees Faster Runoff in&nbsp;2022</a>  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/fed-minutes-december-2021.html">Federal Reserve puts wheels in motion for balance sheet reduction</a>  <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/treasury-yields-build-on-post-fed-minutes-rise-11641472017">2-year Treasury yield hits an almost 2-year high as Fed’s Bullard says first rate hike could come as soon as&nbsp;March</a>  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/05/business/economy/federal-reserve-minutes-interest-rates.html">Fed officials discussed raising rates sooner and faster in&nbsp;2022.</a>   2.

Regulatory wrangling continues <p>One of the other <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-193-the-6-stories-that-matter-in-2022-e85e16c59aa9">6 stories that matter in 2022</a> was regulators.</p><p>The big story last week is that the CFTC fined Polymarket, concluding <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-23/crypto-venue-for-bets-on-trump-jlo-and-covid-faces-u-s-probe?sref=3REHEaVI">an investigation that was first reported back in&nbsp;October</a>.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/01/03/cftc-fines-crypto-betting-service-polymarket-14m-for-unregistered-swaps/">Coindesk</a>:</p><blockquote>Polymarket is a crypto betting service that allows users to pick one of at least two options on given trades, such as who might win the 2020 presidential election. According to the order published by the CFTC, Polymarket offered at least 900 such markets over the last 18&nbsp;months.</blockquote><blockquote>These markets are swaps under federal&nbsp;law.</blockquote><blockquote>Polymarket cooperated with the investigation, according the CFTC’s press release, leading to a reduced fine. The company will stop offering markets by Jan. 14 and commit to making all funds available to users by Jan. 24, according to the order. Polymarket will also cease and desist any further violations of the CEA, though it doesn’t appear the company itself will be shut&nbsp;down.</blockquote><blockquote>Elsewhere, Berlin-based Neuhaus is<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/01/10/why-were-shutting-our-successful-fundraising-platform/"> preemptively shutting down a “viable security token business” due to lack of regulatory clarity</a> (via /gregkidd):</blockquote><blockquote>Our concept-proving case — Greyp Bikes — made the full cycle, from issuing tokenized shares for retail investors, through corporate governance on blockchain, to the exit to Porsche and proceeds distribution via ERC20 tokens. Effectively, there were never any compliance issues, technical problems or security breaches. An European tech company fundraised through the issuance of securities using a decentralized technology. And more than 1,000 investors from dozens of countries participated. How&nbsp;cool.</blockquote><blockquote>Yet, we are closing the Neufund business.</blockquote><blockquote>Why?

<p><a href="http://dock.io/">Dock</a> is a bespoke blockchain designed and built to be used for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials. One of the many important use cases where Dock’s technology can be used is alongside NFTs to reduce fraud and preserve the privacy of NFT owners. To help illustrate how this could work, we are sharing a specific use case with world-renowned vintage watch dealer, <a href="https://www.fogcityvintage.com/">Fog City Vintage</a>.</p><p>Before we dive into the use case, it’s important to understand the differences between NFTs and Verifiable Credentials, and how they can work together.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials contain cryptographically signed pieces of information that can be instantly verified and authenticated based on the identity and trustworthiness of the issuer of the Verifiable Credential. Information contained in the Verifiable Credential is specific to the holder of the credential, which can be an individual, entity, or even an object, and Verifiable Credentials aren’t considered transferable or able to change ownership. In addition, Verifiable Credentials are stored off-chain, typically in a holder’s wallet, and the only data on-chain is the DID and a hash pointing to the credential ensuring data privacy. Some common use cases for Verifiable Credentials include credentials used to prove identity, skills, and achievements.</p><p>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are blockchain-based tokens that contain digitally unique data and identifiers. They are designed to be transferable and can contain digital artwork, collectibles, or representation of real-world assets. Most NFTs today exist on the Ethereum blockchain and so their ownership is tied to a public Ethereum address. Dock has integrated with Ethereum to enable NFTs to be created directly on the Dock blockchain.</p> How can NFTs &amp; Verifiable Credentials work together? <p></p><p>Although they are fundamentally different, there are some very interesting use cases for Verifiable Credentials to be used alongside NFTs. Verifiable Credentials can provide a privacy preserving yet cryptographically provable identity linked to an NFT, and therefore provide tamper-proof information about the identity of an NFT owner, creator, or buyer.</p><p>Fraud is rampant both within and outside of the blockchain space, and NFTs are no exception with scammers setting up fake accounts and selling fake NFTs. A Verifiable Credential can be used to verify the identity of all parties involved in creating, buying, and selling NFTs, to ensure the reputation and authenticity of everyone involved without divulging private information. For example, an NFT creator could share a Verifiable Credential that demonstrates a history of creating legitimate NFTs, or a seller can have a Verifiable Credential that shows a reputation score based on their previous NFT sales. Verifiable credentials issued via Dock use Zero-Knowledge Proofs to ensure data privacy, so the parties involved in the NFT transaction can prove their legitimacy without actually revealing their real-world identities or private information.</p><p>Another way that Verifiable Credentials can be used alongside NFTs is to prove qualifications in order to access an NFT or an NFT marketplace. For example, an artist may want their NFTs to only be accessible by their fans or specific members of a community who meet certain criteria. In this instance, Verifiable Credentials could be issued to community members demonstrating they meet the criteria and can then present the Verifiable Credential to enable them to receive the NFT. There could also be an NFT marketplace that is only appropriate for certain ages or populations; a Verifiable Credential could be used to prove that someone meets this criteria without compromising their identity in order to be able to transact in the NFT marketplace.</p> Dock and Fog City Vintage Watches <p>Fog City Vintage is a world-renowned vintage watch dealer who is using NFTs to address specific problems that exist in the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/luxury-watch-shortage-drives-growth-of-20-billion-secondhand-market.html">$20 billion vintage watch industry</a>. Vintage watches are inherently unique, highly tradeable, and very expensive, but the market for these watches is highly susceptible to fraud and there are no quality standards. Most trades are based on loose connections and it’s not uncommon for sellers to be defrauded out of &nbsp;tens of thousands, sometimes hundreds of thousands, of dollars. Tim Bender, CEO of Fog City Vintage, estimates that well over $1 billion is lost annually by buyers of fraudulent vintage watches.</p><p>Fog City Vintage is planning to use NFTs to represent the authenticity of the watch in order to prevent fraud and enhance the tradability of the watches. Fog City will be issuing NFTs that represent the vintage watches and provide an expert evaluation of the condition of the watches based on a new standard they are developing. By issuing NFTs, which can be done on the Dock blockchain, Fog City can provide watch buyers with the assurance that they are purchasing legitimate watches from reputable buyers.</p><p>Dock’s technology can be used to enhance Fog City’s watch marketplace in several ways. Verifiable Credentials can be issued to marketplace buyers and sellers that reflect their purchase history to eliminate fraudsters and ensure only legitimate parties are involved in the transactions. In addition, Fog City, as well as other vintage watch dealers, can have a Verifiable Credential that proves their own identity as reputable experts who are qualified to evaluate the condition of the watches. The watch dealers would issue certificates of authenticity for the watches based on their evaluations to ensure only genuine watches are being traded and therefore provide further trust and transparency in the marketplace.</p><p>Since Dock provides technology to issue anonymous credentials, all of the Verifiable Credentials shared in the transactions would protect the real identity of the marketplace participants without compromising the integrity of the marketplace. Verifiable Credentials and NFTs are stored in the holder's own digital wallets rather than in a centralized database, which removes the risk of holding customer data while giving customers control of their own identity and assets. Combining Verifiable Credentials with NFTs is a powerful and secure way to add trust and authenticity to marketplaces while ensuring the privacy of everyone participating.</p>

Description: Welcome to lucky episode number 13! Your new host Aubrey Turner, Executive Advisor at Ping, is thrilled to welcome Katryna Dow, CEO &amp; Founder of the award-winning data platform Meeco. Katryna discusses Meeco’s mission to enable everyone on the planet access to equity and value in exchange for the data and information they share. She talks about why she saw a need for Meeco’s services, what we need to know as we approach a more “physigital”world, and how her vision all started with a Tom Cruise film. &nbsp; Key Takeaways: [1:34] Katryna talks about her journey of founding Meeco, and how she was inspired by Tom Cruise’s movie Minority Report. In early 2012 she sat down and wrote a Manifesto, and asked the question: what would happen if everyday people had the power to make really good decisions on data, the way that social networks, government, and enterprise do? How can we create meaningful value and make better decisions with our data? [8:12] Katryna shares some of her concerns around modern privacy and where she sees things evolving, both good and bad. [9:35] Technology is neutral. It’s what we do with it that gives it bias and can make it either creepy or cool. [11:33] What does Katryna mean when she says it starts with trust by design? [17:22] The next wave may be just starting to bring people and things into the direct value chain, through wearables or IoT devices for example. [18:31] How can we create better digital onboarding for employees, knowing that even post-COVID-19 our world will not go back to how it was in December 2020? One thing that Katryna is sure of is that we must lean into innovation rather than doing nothing and waiting to see. [36:13] We must make sure we are paying attention to the misalignment between law and technology, especially when it comes to ethics and the safety of children growing up in a digital-forward world. &nbsp; Quotes:    “I think the challenge for any kind of technology and regulation is a lag  factor, not a lead factor.”—Katryna         “The line between creepy and cool is one of the things we are always trying to address from a technology point of view.”—Katryna   “There isn’t really the option to not find better ways of digitally engaging.”—Katryna    Mentioned in This Episode: PingIdentity AubreyTurner KatrynaDow Meeco “HowCOVID-19 has pushed companies over the technology tipping point—and transformed business forever”     &nbsp;       &nbsp;  &nbsp;    &nbsp;

<p>Today, January 11, is the International Day of Gratitude. What better time then, to tell partners that you cherish their work and thank them for the inspiration they have given you? We at Jolocom reflect on amazing projects that became possible by joining forces with partners such as T-Labs, Bundesdruckerei, Stacks, and TIB – the Technical Information Library Hanover.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s been a privilege to work with you and we hope to continue our work together.&nbsp;</p>



 About Us&nbsp; 



<p>Jolocom is a leading steward of self-sovereign identity (SSI) in Europe with a long-term commitment to open source and open standards. We bring a full SSI tech stack, including library, software development kit (SDK), SSI protocol and the Jolocom SmartWallet application, as well as our technical expertise, to the community. Our aim is to accelerate the deployment of DIDs and verifiable credentials, ensuring interoperability between available solutions and increasing the self-sovereignty of users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve had the chance to engage with multiple partners in the past year, allowing us to broaden and deepen our SSI knowledge and, what’s more, partnering up in projects that mark a significant turn in the SSI world and increase engagement from both users and developers.&nbsp;</p>



 &nbsp;<br>Thank You to..&nbsp; 



<p>T-Labs/T-Systems (Deutsche Telekom)&nbsp;</p>



<p>T-Labs is the Research &amp; Development Department of Deutsche Telekom, focusing on bringing new technology trends to the market and delivering tangible results into Deutsche Telekom’s innovation portfolio.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Starting in November 2017, Jolocom has partnered with T-Labs to launch the development, bringing together a group of blockchain startups to build the prototype operating stack: the idea being that enterprises can build a decentralized back-end in a matter of minutes. Jolocom is developing a modular solution that enables individuals, organizations and companies to get a self-sovereign digital identity. In the T-Labs prototype, Jolocom provides the tool to create and securely verify claims about identity. This allows for the modeling of a trustworthy and complex relationships between entities (e.g. ownership structures of IoT devices with organizations/individuals). Modeling these relationships with a self-sovereign solution enables a frictionless bridge between different ecosystems and network environments. What we have begun with T-Labs in 2018, we are happy to continue from early 2021 into the middle of 2022 with T-Systems and others as part of our current project portfolios.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>Bundesdruckerei&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bundesdruckerei (BDR)&nbsp; is home to the digital experts supplying Germany’s ID cards and passports. They are working with different ID management solutions and technologies at the federal government security company. One of these approaches made use of Jolocom’s identity library and wallet. In 2019, the BDR demonstrated the potential of decentralized self-sovereign identity solutions in NAME OF PILOT, where identity information remains under the complete control of the citizen via the Jolocom SmartWallet downloaded onto their mobile device.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>More precisely, researchers at BDR merged the Jolocom software for decentralized identity and access management with the existing government IT infrastructure for verification and identification. The goal: creating one of the earliest proof-of-concepts (POCs) for a decentralized digital ID in Germany.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This particular POC was an early example of an issuing and verification authority merging its existing technology with self-sovereign identity software. Jolocom’s software is fully open source. The part we played was adjusting our app interface to support BDR’s work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With more governments exploring the advantages of blockchain and, more specifically, self-sovereign identity solutions for common identity and access management challenges, we look forward to offering our open source library more widely.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, we have engaged with the BDR in another main project of which you might have heard: ONCE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft: ‘Showcase Secure Digital Identities’ projects ONCE, ID-Ideal and SDIKA&nbsp;</p>



<p>The project is part of the competitive innovation program “Showcase Secure Digital Identities” (SDI) funded by Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi), where a dozen consortia were invited to present their concepts in an innovation competition and&nbsp;four projects that qualified for a fully-funded three year implementation phase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom is a partner in three of these four SDI implementation projects, to which we will lend our expertise in self-sovereign identity, years of experience in developing digital identity wallets and the open-source Jolocom stack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ONCE is the first of these projects to launch, followed by ID-Ideal and SDIKA. A few words about each:&nbsp;</p>



<p>ONCE aims to harmonize eID with SSI in user-controlled wallets. ID-Ideal has the goal of harmonizing trust providers and consumers from multiple networks and legal setups under one coherent trust framework. Finally, SDIKA pursues the realization of cross-use case identities in open ecosystems with widespread adoption. We thank our new and old partners for joining us on this path.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these projects are funded and supported by the BMWi, and we are grateful for using this huge opportunity to bring SSI to the individual citizen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Technical Information Library Hanover&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Technical Information Library in Hanover is the German specialist library for technology as well as architecture, chemistry, computer science, mathematics and physics. TIB is the world’s largest specialist library for technology and natural sciences. What’s more, TIB and Jolocom have both been early adopters and pioneers of distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) and the Web 3.0 approach in Germany. Multiple encounters within the DLT community have led to a growing desire to join forces so we can further develop interoperability, open standards and open access. Together, we created the Conference Digital Identifier Integration (conDIDi) project. The idea was to implement the SSI approach in the academic sector, while also increasing global collaboration and interoperability due to the gradual integration of different solutions (i.e. ORCID, ConfIDent and conDIDi) into one single system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simply put, conDIDi seeks to reduce the management burden for both participants and organizers: Automating the process of verifying that participants fulfilled requisite criteria, such as having paid fees, met requirements for paper submission, agreed to chair a panel, checked into the venue, etc, would reduce a large part of the bureaucratic, time-consuming and costly overhead of conference management.&nbsp; At the same time, automated exchange of verifiable participation credentials reduces the waiting time for academics to build their CVs and paper portfolios, and – more recently – for medical professionals to collect proofs of training and education requirements. ConDIDi is now an ongoing pilot project within TIB and we are excited to see what it will grow into and to support its continuous development in future collaborations with our partners at TIB. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Stacks&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom also partnered with Stacks, integrating the Stacks into Jolocom SSI solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The integration will enable any developer to easily add support for Stacks-based identities to their SSI service, and to build new SSI services (e.g. issuers, verifiers, mediators) with identities secured by the Stacks blockchain. Furthermore, the developed tools will also allow any user who owns a BNS name to easily derive a valid, globally resolvable DID and use it with various SSI services. Finally, the Jolocom SmartWallet will allow regular users to easily interact with SSI services secured by DIDs anchored on the Stacks network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, real-world activities providing any verifiable information for renting a bike or hotel room would happen in a much more seamless, secure, and privacy-preserving way. While the benefits of this technology will be globally available and relevant, we are applying to the Stacks Foundation with a time-sensitive opportunity to reach the European market with pilot projects that can really scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We at Jolocom are looking forward to continuing our great partnerships in current and upcoming projects, as well as building many more partnerships in 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

				  In just a year, the Indicio Network has grown into the leading platform for enterprise-grade decentralized products and services—and a community of ground-breaking companies in decentralized and Web3 identity products and services  
			  
				
				
				 <p>What a year.</p>
<p>Last January, we launched the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-mainnet/">Indicio MainNet</a>, the keystone of the Indicio Network, a global platform designed to support mission critical uses of decentralized identity built on the open-source Hyperledger Indy code base.</p>
<p>The MainNet joined its older <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-testnet/">TestNet</a> sibling, launched in 2020, and — in the summer of 2021 — both were joined by the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-demonet/">DemoNet</a>.</p>
<p>Together, they enabled companies to build and test their products (TestNet), demonstrate their products in a safe environment (DemoNet), and then deploy their products in a global &nbsp;marketplace with the assurance that they were backed by a robust, professionally staffed, global MainNet.</p>
<p>That assurance is critical. We know how long it takes to test and demo products. We know what enterprises need to create and sell products. We saw the need, we heard, repeatedly, from our earliest clients that’s what they needed; and so we made it a reality.</p>
<p>Now, in January 2022, our growing global network of nodes is supported by twenty-six diverse companies on five continents. Each is an innovator. All are committed to building a better way to manage digital identity and to create the trust in data needed for the machine, spatial, and Web3 age. Indicio is a global network for a technology that brings value to everyone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What makes the Indicio Network the best network for decentralized identity solutions?<br>Decentralized identity networks are often likened to utilities for identity, so what do people, typically, want from utilities? Dependability, affordability, and simplicity</p>
<p>Dependability. There can’t be outages. If technical problems occur, they need to be fixed fast. The Indicio Network meets these challenges, first by scale. Each node on the network supports a copy of the ledger, so unlike Facebook going down, there are 26 other Facebooks to make sure your product, company, or organization isn’t in the dark.</p>
<p>Second, our network is staffed and monitored by experts using state-of-the-art monitoring tools. This may sound obvious—surely every network has this? But it isn’t and they don’t. We as a company build solutions on the Indicio Network. We have skin in the network working dependably. We need it to be the best functioning utility for identity out there. This means our staff are your staff in this endeavor. We’re here for you — all the time. Your success is our success.</p>
<p>Affordability. Writes to the ledger are one way to monetize decentralized identity. We believe in making fees for writing to our ledger simple, cost effective, and predictable. We also believe that these fees should not be an obstacle to implementing the right architecture for a solution. No decentralized identity system should cut corners to save money or from fear of unexpected future costs. We see affordability driving reliability, and reliability driving and sustaining adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simplicity. It’s no secret that decentralized identity can be tough to understand if you’re delving into it for the first time (and especially if you’re not an engineer). We get it! We want to make everything about decentralized identity as simple as possible, from onboarding a node to providing wizards to simplify technical processes and enabling machine-readable governance.</p>
<p>Still too complicated? We will host and run a node for you.</p>
<p>We also have the largest range of hands-on <a href="https://indicio.tech/training-workshops/">training workshops</a> for all aspects of decentralized identity—and we were chosen by Hyperledger to develop and run technical training programs.</p>
<p>This is what we built in 2021—and it’s amazing to look back at the year and all we — and our node operators — achieved. But it was even more exciting to see what people began building and releasing on this foundation, projects such as the <a href="https://www.sita.aero/resources/videos/happy-traveler-card/">Aruba Health Pass</a>, <a href="https://liquidavatartechnologies.com/the-liquid-avatar-verifiable-credentials-ecosystem/">LAVCE</a>, and <a href="https://www.thenewswire.com/press-releases/1k98Fpjr0-liquid-avatar-technologies-and-dynamics-inc-tap-payment-infrastructure-for-verification-of-digital-credentials.html">Passmate</a>.</p>
<p>As we move toward a more trustworthy digital world, 2022 is going to be one long, energetic build-athon. And if that excites you,<a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/"> we should talk</a>.</p>

<p>Do you know that until 2021 <a href="https://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html">82.4 million people</a> have been forcibly displaced from their homes due to wars and conflicts? That’s almost the size of Germany’s population!</p><p>Yet, they are struggling for basic human needs such as food, clothing, and&nbsp;shelter.</p><p>Why?</p> An Identity&nbsp;Crisis <p>Much of their woes stem from the fact that they do not have the documents to prove their nationality or for that matter, even their refugee&nbsp;status.</p><p>Unfortunately, a majority of the documents that prove identity and nationality are in the form of physical documents such as a passport or driver’s license that can get lost, damaged, or stolen while fleeing from their country. Sometimes, it may even be left behind for security&nbsp;reasons.</p><p>As a result, many of these people become stateless and are unable to get refugee status or its benefits, and for the most part of their lives, languish in camps and work only in low-paying jobs.</p><p>The sad part is that this trickles down to their children as well, and the next generation of refugees are unable to study or find jobs because the parents don’t have the required documents.</p><p>In this sense, the state of refugees today is an identity crisis as they do not have documents to prove their identity and nationality.</p> What is the Solution? <p>From the above discussion, it’s clear that every refugee requires an <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-links-identity-and-vcs-together-across-applications-9523af3884a9">identity</a> that would enable that person and his/her family members to get the refugee benefits offered by the host&nbsp;country.</p><p>Ideally, the document must&nbsp;be,</p>  Verifiable, so the refugee can get access to financial and non-financial benefits under treaties and host nation programs.  Easy to access from anywhere, so an individual can digitally prove his or her educational credentials and job experience to make it easy for them to find work in the host&nbsp;nation.  Stored in a safe&nbsp;place.  Tamper-proof.  From a competent authority that is trustable by anyone in any part of the world. For example, the government of a&nbsp;nation.  <p>While these conditions may sound daunting at first, the truth is we already have such an identity in place. It’s called <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/is-ssi-the-disruptor-for-a-better-world-aec34cef6275">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> and this is implemented through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>.</p><p>The existing format of these VCs has to be simply extended to meet the requirements of the host nation, so every refugee can prove his or her identity and credentials in no&nbsp;time.</p> How can Verifiable Credentials Help? <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">VCs</a> meet all of the requirements mentioned above.</p><p>It is machine-verifiable, tamper-proof, and has the digital signatures of the entity that is authorized to issue&nbsp;it.</p><p>Here is how a VC&nbsp;looks.</p><p>As you can see, the cryptographic proof in the VC proves that it has come from an authorized entity while the identification details show the credentials of the holder. Furthermore, it cannot be tampered with or censored.</p><p>Let’s understand this with a real-world example.</p> Real-world Example <p>Let’s say Mr.X is forced out of his country due to war and he reaches the neighboring country but doesn’t have any physical document to prove his identity such as name, address, educational qualifications, work experience, etc.</p><p>Thankfully, he has them all in the form of a verifiable credential. So, he visits the Foreign Office of the host nation, logs into the office’s computer, generates a verifiable presentation, and shares the same with the government officials.</p><p>In turn, the officials scan the QR code and learn all about Mr. X. They check if he qualifies for the refugee status and grants the same through a&nbsp;VC.</p><p>Now, Mr.X is all set to move around the host nation, collect refugee allowances, study, find a job, and get on with&nbsp;life.</p><p>As you can see, the entire process takes only a few minutes and gives Mr. X a chance to start his life all over again. That’s the true power of&nbsp;VCs.</p><p>Before we start dreaming about a pain-free world, note that VCs may not work well in all situations.</p> Are There Any Downsides? <p>There are a few problems that come with using VCs to handle refugee identities.</p><p>Let’s say Mr. X is going to his neighboring country because of political persecution. Knowing this, his country revokes all the VCs issued for him. As a result, he can no longer use the VCs to prove his identity, though he can use VCs issued by his employer and educational institutions, provided they are not <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-vc-revocation-846e47ce3e90">revoked</a>. In this sense, VCs can be used for political revenge.</p><p>The second issue is that <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">VCs</a> can become inaccessible if Mr.X forgets the password of his digital wallet where the credentials are&nbsp;stored.</p><p>So, is VC a solution at&nbsp;all?</p><p>Yes, in most cases. These VCs can be a life-saver for most refugees as it proves their identity, work experience, and&nbsp;skills.</p><p>Curious to know how else VCs can be <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">used</a> across different industries and situations?

 Stories from the UK and&nbsp;Ghana <p>In 2021, together with <a href="https://habitusinsight.com/">Habitus Insight</a>, we explored stories on the human impact of identity exclusion for <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/cpages/home">Women in Identity</a>. This is the first of two blogs on that research — the following blog will share the findings from the UK and&nbsp;Ghana.</p><p>As part of that work, we spoke to several people who have experienced ID exclusion. Va-Bene is a transwoman — or as she calls herself, a transvatar — based in Kumasi, Ghana. She faces challenges every time she goes to a physical bank branch. Her IDs (and particularly the photos on them) don’t reflect who she is&nbsp;now.</p><p>“If I have to withdraw money with my ATM card, that is fine. But any other thing I will do directly in the bank. Believe me, either we are going to fight in the bank or I’m just going to be delayed for several hours without any money.” Being denied access to her own money not only has a direct financial impact on Va-Bene. It also has an emotional impact: “it is very frustrating when I am excluded. Very, very frustrating. Very depressing.”</p> “Know Your Customer” and existing challenges of exclusion <p>In her book <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780199463510.001.0001/oso-9780199463510">In Pursuit of Proof</a>, Tarangini Sriraraman documents how “identification” began as a need to recognise individuals for governance, but has become a process heavily shaped by social norms. Why is gender an important characteristic for identification? Who decides how that is categorised (male/female)? What happens when gender goes beyond binary, as in Va-Bene’s case?</p><p>“Know Your Customer” (KYC) is a legal requirement to comply with anti-money laundering regulations (AML) in most countries. Verification requirements to access financial services often include database checks, identity document verification, and, increasingly, biometric checks. For proof of address, utility bills or bank statements can often serve as acceptable documentation. By verifying a customer’s identity and intentions when they open an account, and then understanding transaction patterns, financial institutions can more accurately pinpoint potential account takeover or other suspicious activities.</p><p>However, many people get stuck when trying to prove who they are (like Va-Bene) or where they live. Obtaining an ID can be a time-consuming and expensive process, made more challenging for those who are <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/why-is-id-important-for-women/home">female</a>, from an ethnic or racial minority background, live in a rural area or with a disability, or are <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/report-launch-identity-at-the-margins-identification-systems-for-refugees-69466244fa62">refugees or migrants</a>. <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/early-financial-inclusion-can-lead-to-exclusion-experiences-of-kenyan-youth-eb99c7476d7d">Youth, too, are emerging as a demographic</a> facing barriers to ID. Often these issues include not having a proof of address (being without a fixed address, having recently arrived in the country, or for other reasons) or not being able to easily prove who one is (not having <a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/guide/types-id-systems">foundational ID</a> documentation). These challenges can become even harder to address without knowledge of where to go or what to do&nbsp;next.</p><p>Interview with Payal, a recently arrived migrant in northwest London, UK, who faced challenges opening a bank account without proof of&nbsp;address.</p> Next steps <p>In addition to Va-Bene and Payal, we spoke to a range of participants who are or who have felt excluded from financial systems for different reasons and we’ll be sharing these stories over the next few months. This research is the foundation for Women in Identity to build an Identity Code of Conduct — a set of guiding principles and a framework for inclusive ID-product development.</p><p>Nowhere is this more necessary than in financial services, where ID is needed to protect users (e.g., from financial crime), but at the same time provide access to specific products. Service providers need to know who users are, but how does that process happen, why, and when does it become problematic? The Identity Code of Conduct will establish a set of guiding principles around inclusion, building on the broader <a href="https://id4d.worldbank.org/principles">Digital ID Principles</a>. It will offer a practical set of tools to address inclusion at every stage of identification.</p> Note from Women in Identity: <p>At <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/">Women in Identity</a> we believe identity solutions should be inclusive, built for all, by all. But we also believe this does not happen by&nbsp;chance.</p><p>The aim of our initial research and videos is to work towards this Code of Conduct: a practical guide for product designers to gain deeper empathy for the challenges experienced at the user end of the ID lifecycle and the knowledge to take these challenges into account when designing products.</p><p>Other sectors already take this approach to product development. The pharmaceutical industry, for instance, has an ongoing Code of Practice based on principles of care, fairness, honesty, and respect that impact agreed standards of product development (e.g., clear and transparent information on packaging).</p><p>We believe we can learn from other industries and create an Identity Code of Conduct which ensures inclusion is built into identity product design, thus making these products better for the organisations that rely on them and for the people that use&nbsp;them.</p><p>We look forward to you joining us on this journey and welcome feedback and suggestions. Please reach out to us on @WomenInID on Twitter or @WomenInIdentity on LinkedIn!</p><p>Read more about this project at <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/cpages/code-of-conduct">ID Code of Conduct</a> and follow us at @womeninID @WomenInIdentity @CaribouDigital @habitusinsight #DiversityByDesign #ForAllByAll #IDCodeofConduct #IdentityExclusion</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-human-impact-of-identity-exclusion-in-financial-services-ce1e0d769389">The human impact of identity exclusion in financial services</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
