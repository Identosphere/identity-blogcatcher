  <p>We’re excited to announce the general availability of Microsoft Graph activity logs! Microsoft Graph activity logs give you visibility into HTTP requests made to the Microsoft Graph service in your tenant. With rapidly growing security threats and an increasing number of attacks, this log data source allows you to perform security analysis, threat hunting, and monitor application activity in your tenant. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some common use cases include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 Identifying the activities that a compromised user account conducted in your tenant.&nbsp; 
 Building detections and behavioral analysis to identify suspicious or anomalous use of Microsoft Graph APIs, such as an application enumerating all users, or making probing requests with many 403 errors.&nbsp; 
 Investigating unexpected or unnecessarily privileged assignments of application permissions.&nbsp; 
 Identifying problematic or unexpected behaviors for client applications, such as extreme call volumes that cause throttling for the tenant.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’re currently able to collect sign-in logs to analyze authentication activity and audit logs to see changes to important resources. With Microsoft Graph activity logs, you can now investigate the complete picture of activity in your tenant – from token request in sign-in logs, to API request activity (reads, writes, and deletes) in Microsoft Graph activity logs, to ultimate resource changes in audit logs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Microsoft Graph activity logs in Log Analytics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re delighted to see many of you applying the Microsoft Graph activity logs (Preview) to awesome use cases. As we listened to your feedback on cost concerns, particularly for ingestion to Log Analytics, we’ve also enabled <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/microsoft-graph-activity-logs-overview#cost-reduction-for-log-analytics">Log Transformation and Basic Log capabilities</a> to help you scope your log ingestion to a smaller set if desired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To illustrate working with these logs, we can look at some basic queries:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Summarize applications and principals that have made requests to change or delete groups in the past day:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs&nbsp;</p>
<p>| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(1d)&nbsp;</p>
<p>| where RequestUri contains '/group'&nbsp;</p>
<p>| where RequestMethod != "GET"&nbsp;</p>
<p>| summarize UriCount=dcount(RequestUri) by AppId, UserId, ServicePrincipalId, ResponseStatusCode&nbsp;</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See recent requests that failed due to authorization:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs&nbsp;</p>
<p>| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(1h)&nbsp;</p>
<p>| where ResponseStatusCode == 401 or ResponseStatusCode == 403&nbsp;</p>
<p>| project AppId, UserId, ServicePrincipalId, ResponseStatusCode, RequestUri, RequestMethod&nbsp;</p>
<p>| limit 1000&nbsp;</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identify resources queried or modified by potentially risky users:</p>
<p>Note: This query leverages <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-investigate-risk">Risky User</a> data from Entra ID Protection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>MicrosoftGraphActivityLogs&nbsp;</p>
<p>| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(30d)&nbsp;</p>
<p>| join AADRiskyUsers on $left.UserId == $right.Id&nbsp;</p>
<p>| extend resourcePath = replace_string(replace_string(replace_regex(tostring(parse_url(RequestUri).Path), @'(\/)+','/'),'v1.0/',''),'beta/','')&nbsp;</p>
<p>| summarize RequestCount=dcount(RequestId) by UserId, RiskState, resourcePath, </p>
<p>RequestMethod, ResponseStatusCode&nbsp;</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Graph activity logs are available through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/concept-log-monitoring-integration-options-considerations">Azure Monitor Logs integration of Microsoft Entra</a>. Administrators of Microsoft Entra ID P1 or P2 tenants can configure the collection and storage destinations of Microsoft Graph activity logs through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/howto-integrate-activity-logs-with-azure-monitor-logs">diagnostic setting</a> in the Entra portal. These settings allow you to configure the collection of the logs to a storage destination of your choice. The logs can be stored and queried in an Azure Log Analytics Workspace, archived in Azure Storage Accounts, or exported to other security information and event management (SIEM) tools through Azure Event Hubs. For logs collected in a Log Analytics Workspace, you can use the full set of Azure Monitor Logs features, such as a portal query experience, alerting, saved queries, and workbooks. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shyft Network is excited to announce that Giottus, one of India’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has integrated Shyft Veriscope as its FATF Travel Rule Solution. Giottus’ decision to choose Shyft Veriscope proves once again that Veriscope is one of the most trusted and effective Travel Rule Solutions among VASPs worldwide.</p><p>This strategic partnership establishes Veriscope, the Shyft Network’s one-of-a-kind compliance technology solution, as a leader in the secure exchange of personally identifiable information (PII) for frictionless Travel Rule compliance. The collaboration is timely, aligning with India’s new crypto regulatory measures, which <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-india">include the FATF Travel Rule</a> that the country implemented in&nbsp;2023.</p> Why did Giottus Choose Veriscope? <p>As an entity already reporting to India’s Financial Intelligence Unit and an Alliance of Reporting Entities for AML/CFT (ARIFAC) member, Giottus must take a more efficient approach to Travel Rule compliance, and Veriscope facilitates this with its streamlined and automated system.</p><p>Moreover, by adopting Veriscope, Giottus is positioned advantageously over other Indian VASPs, which may still rely on manual means to collect Travel Rule information, such as Google Forms and email. These traditional methods are less efficient and user-friendly compared to Veriscope’s automated and privacy-oriented approach.</p><p>Speaking about Giottus’ integration with Shyft Veriscope, Zach Justein, Veriscope co-founder, said:</p><blockquote>“Giottus’ integration of Veriscope as its Travel Rule Solution demonstrates the unique advantages it offers to VASPs with its state-of-the-art compliance infrastructure for seamless FATF Travel Rule compliance. This is a significant development for the entire crypto ecosystem, as with this integration, both Veriscope and Giottus are setting a new standard for unwavering commitment to safety, transparency, and user experience.”</blockquote><p>Vikram Subburaj, Giottus CEO, too, welcomed this development, noting:</p><blockquote>“Since its inception in 2018, Giottus has been at the forefront of innovation and compliance in the Indian VDA space. Our partnership with Veriscope is timely and pivotal to establish us as part of a global compliance network and to strengthen our offering to all Indian crypto enthusiasts. We believe that collaboration and data exchange are crucial in shaping the future of this industry and are thankful to Veriscope for integrating us. We look forward to driving a positive change in the Indian VDA ecosystem.”</blockquote> Conclusion <p>Overall, we expect our collaboration with Giottus to yield positive outcomes not only for Giottus and Shyft Veriscope but also for India’s crypto ecosystem. This partnership sets a new precedent for the country’s VASPs, as they can now comply with the FATF Travel Rule effortlessly while continuing with their privacy and user-friendly developments.</p> About Giottus <p>Giottus, with over a million users, is a customer-centric, all-in-one crypto investment platform that is changing the way Indian investors trade their virtual digital assets. Giottus aims to shed barriers that arise from the complexity of the asset class and the need to transact in English. We focus on building a simplified platform that is vernacular at heart. Investors can buy and sell crypto assets on Giottus in eight languages, including Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Bengali. Giottus is currently India’s top-rated crypto platform as per consumer ratings on Facebook, Google, and Trustpilot.</p> ‍About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule. Enhanced by User Signing, it enables VASPs to directly request cryptographic proof from users’ non-custodial wallets, streamlining the compliance process.</p><p>For more information, visit our<a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope"> website</a> and<a href="https://www.shyft.network/contact"> contact</a> our team for a discussion.

 New VideoIdent Flex elevates trust with a human touch in the face of rising fraud and the closing of physical bank branches 



<p>London, April 16, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification provider in Europe, has unveiled VideoIdent Flex, a new version of its <a href="https://www.idnow.io/expert-led-verification/">expert-led video verification service</a> that blends advanced AI technology with human interaction. The human-based video call solution, supported by AI, has been designed and built to boost customer conversion rates, reduce rising fraud attempts, increase inclusivity, and tackle an array of complex online verification scenarios, while offering a high-end service experience to end customers.</p>



<p>The company’s original expert-led product, VideoIdent, has been a cornerstone in identity verification for over a decade, serving the strictest requirements in highly regulated industries across Europe. VideoIdent Flex, re-engineered specifically for the UK market, represents a significant evolution, addressing the growing challenges of identity fraud, compliance related to Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes and ensuring fair access and inclusivity in today’s digital world outside of fully automated processes.</p>



<p>Empowering businesses with flexible human-based identity verification</p>



<p>As remote identity verification becomes more crucial yet more challenging, VideoIdent Flex combines high-quality live video identity verification with hundreds of trained verification experts, thus ensuring that genuine customers gain equal access to digital services while effectively deterring <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-mules/">fraudsters and money mules</a>. Unlike fully automated solutions based on document liveness and biometric liveness features, this human-machine collaboration not only boosts onboarding rates and prevents fraud but also strengthens trust and confidence in both end users and organizations. VideoIdent Flex can also serve as a fallback service in case a fully automated solution fails.</p>



<p>Bertrand Bouteloup, Chief Commercial Officer at IDnow, commented: “VideoIdent Flex marks a groundbreaking advancement in identity verification, merging AI-based technology with human intuition. In a landscape of evolving fraud tactics and steady UK bank branch closures, our solution draws on our decade’s worth of video verification experience and fraud insights, empowering UK businesses to maintain a competitive edge by offering a white glove service for VIP onboarding. With its unique combination of KYC-compliant identity verification, real-time fraud prevention solutions, and expert support, VideoIdent Flex is a powerful tool for the UK market.”</p>



<p>Whereas previously firms may have found video identification solutions to be excessive for their compliance requirement or out of reach due to costs, VideoIdent Flex opens up this option by customizing checks as required by the respective regulatory bodies in financial services, mobility, telecommunications or gaming, to offer a streamlined solution fit for every industry and geography.</p>



<p>Customizable real-time fraud prevention for high levels of assurance</p>



<p>VideoIdent Flex has a number of key features and benefits:</p>



  Customizable: Pre-defined configurations to meet specific industry requirements and regional regulations.  Expert-led: High-quality live video verification conducted by trained identity verification experts, ensuring accuracy, reliability, and compliance for high levels of assurance.  Extensive document coverage: Support for a wide range of documents, facilitating global expansion and inclusivity.  Real-time fraud prevention: Advanced fraud detection capabilities, including AI-driven analysis and manual checks, combat evolving fraud tactics and help protect against social engineering fraud, document tampering, projection and deepfakes, especially for high-risk use cases and goods.  Verification of high-risk individuals: Reviewing applications from high-risk persons, such as Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), high-risk countries; or assessing where fraud might be expected with real-time decisions, without alerting suspicion.  



<p>Bouteloup concluded: “Identity verification is incredibly nuanced; it’s as intricate as we are as human beings. This really compounds the importance of adopting a hybrid approach to identity – capitalizing on the dual benefits of advanced technology when combined with human knowledge and awareness of social cues. <a href="https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/closure-of-high-street-banks-impact-on-local-communities/">With bank branches in the UK closing down</a>, especially in the countryside, and interactions becoming more and more digital, our solution offers a means to maintain a human relationship between businesses and their end customers, no matter their age, disability or neurodiversity. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“VideoIdent Flex is designed from the ground up for organizations that cannot depend on a one-size-fits-all approach to ensuring their customers are who they say they are. In a world where fraud is consistently increasing, our video capability paired with our experts adds a powerful layer of security, especially for those businesses and customers that require a face-to-face interaction.”</p>

 We sit down with our Principal Product Manager, Nitesh Nahta and Senior Product Marketing Manager, Suzy Thomas to find out why VideoIdent Flex is all set to become a game changer. 



 



<p>In April 2024, we launched <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/videoident-flex/">VideoIdent Flex</a>, a customizable video identity verification solution aimed specifically at the UK market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our original expert-led product, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">VideoIdent</a>, has been a cornerstone in identity verification for over a decade, serving the strictest requirements in highly regulated industries across Europe. VideoIdent Flex, re-engineered specifically for the UK market addresses the nation’s growing challenges of identity fraud and compliance related <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know-Your-Customer (KYC)</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering (AML)</a> requirements. It also ensures <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/identity-verification-services-inclusivity/">fair access and inclusivity</a> in today’s digital world.</p>



 Can you tell us a little more about VideoIdent Flex? 



<p>Nitesh: VideoIdent Flex, from our expert-led video verification toolkit, will revolutionize the onboarding process by focusing on the human touch in KYC onboarding. Our proprietary technology will boost conversion rates while thwarting escalating fraud attempts. What sets it apart? Unlike its predecessors, VideoIdent Flex transcends its origins as a German-centric product. Leveraging years of refinement, insights and unmatched security, we’re extending its capabilities beyond German borders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Suzy: VideoIdent Flex caters to a diverse range of global use cases, including boosting customer conversion rates, reducing fraud attempts, verifying high-risk individuals and onboarding VIPs. It offers a face-to-face service or provides an accessible and personalized alternative to automated identification processes. </p>



<p>Further differentiating IDnow in the market, VideoIdent Flex can also be combined with our digital signature solutions, allowing us to expand into loan and investment use cases from financial services, as well as recruitment, legal and insurance. With its advanced technology and expert-led verification, VideoIdent Flex offers three pre-configured packages tailored to suit different risk levels within organizations.</p>



 How important do you think VideoIdent Flex will be to the UK market? 



<p>Nitesh: Video verification is already a trusted AML-compliant onboarding solution across many European countries. Enter VideoIdent Flex: a versatile product catering to both AML and non-AML needs, boasting a seamless process, high conversion rates, and budget-friendly pricing. This marks a significant shift for IDnow, offering a distinctive value proposition that sets us apart. It’s a game-changer, enticing customers outside of the DACH region who hadn’t previously explored expert-led video verification. </p>



<p>Already embraced by numerous EU clients, this launch signifies our expansion beyond the DACH market, solidifying our foothold across the continent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Suzy: I’m excited about the potential impact of VideoIdent Flex! It not only expands our market reach beyond the DACH and France+ regions, but also allows IDnow to break into new territories, including regulated and unregulated sectors in the UK, and non-regulated markets in DACH, France and beyond. With the UK’s highly competitive document and biometric verification market, VideoIdent Flex serves as a powerful differentiator, offering a face-to-face, fraud busting solution that will drive organizations to better recognize, trust and engage with IDnow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I believe there are three main drivers that make this an excellent time to launch our new solution:&nbsp;</p>



  The economic pressures to close expensive physical branches.  



  Increasing consumer demand for remote digital experiences that can be accessed anytime, anywhere.  



  Societal pressure driving environmental and corporate governance concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>We’re excited to launch and see the market reaction. We believe it significantly enhances our value proposition and solidifies our position as industry leaders in identity verification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interested in more information about VideoIdent Flex? Check out our recent<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/video-identity-verification-fraud-prevention/"> blog, ‘How video identity verification can help British businesses finally face up to fraud.’</a></p>

<p>Technology – it gives with one hand and takes with the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Technology, and the internet in particular, has afforded consumers incredible convenience, providing 24/7 access to services, across every industry imaginable. Unfortunately, technology has also <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/work-chatgpt/">empowered criminals to commit fraud</a> with an effortless ease and at an unprecedented level.<br>&nbsp;<br>Discover more about the scourge of fraud in the UK, in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">blog, ‘UK fraud strategy declares war on fraud, calls on tech giants to join the fight.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>On average, multinational banks are subjected to <a href="https://www.cosive.com/fraud-detection-in-banking-guide">tens of thousands of fraud attacks</a> every single month, ranging from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/social-media-fraud-investment-romance-scam/">account takeover fraud</a> all the way to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/red-flags-money-laundering/">money laundering</a>. It is this reason, among many others, that it’s paramount to verify the identity of customers as a preventative measure against fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As businesses scale and the need to onboard customers quickly increases, many banks have implemented AI-assisted <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">automated identity verification solutions</a>. In certain high-risk circumstances, however, the importance of human oversight cannot be overstated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As bank branches continue to close (<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eb3f99a2-bd4c-4ba1-8cb9-432ecfbf73ab">almost three-fifths of the UK’s bank network closing since 2015</a>), many UK banks are beginning to look for alternatives to data checks and automatic checks and are turning to expert-led video verification solutions.</p>

<p>Our recently launched <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/videoident-flex/">VideoIdent Flex</a>, specially designed for the UK market, works in two ways: full service or self-service, meaning banks can choose to either use our extensive team of multilingual identity experts, or have their bank staff trained to the highest standard of fraud prevention experts. Here’s how VideoIdent Flex can help.</p>



 Tackling fraud, in all 4 forms. 



<p>At IDnow, we categorize fraud into four different buckets. Here’s how VideoIdent Flex can help tackle fraud, in all its forms.</p>



 1. Fake ID fraud. 



<p>We classify fake ID fraud as the use of forged documents or fraudulent manipulations of documents. Common types of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/document-fraud/">document fraud</a> – the act of creating, altering or using false or genuine documents, with the intent to deceive or pass specific controls – include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Counterfeit documents: reproduction of an official document without the proper authorization from the relevant authority.<br>  Forged documents: deliberate alteration of a genuine document in order to add, delete or modify information, while passing it off as genuine. Forged documents can include photo substitution, page substitution, data alteration, attack on the visas or entry/exit stamp.<br>  &nbsp;Pseudo documents: replicates codes from official documents, such as passports, driver’s licenses or national identity cards.  



<p>How VideoIdent Flex identifies and stops fake ID fraud.</p>



<p>As a first step, IDnow’s powerful automated checks can detect damaged documents, invalid/cut corners, photocopies and much more. As a second step and additional layer of assurance, identity experts, specially trained in fraud prevention request document owners to cover or bend certain parts of documents as a way of detecting fake IDs and document deepfakes.</p>



 2. Identity theft fraud. 



<p>Identity theft fraud is when individuals, without permission, use stolen, found or given identity documents, or when another person pretends to be another person. Although popular among teenagers to buy age-restricted goods like alcohol and tobacco, fake IDs are also used for more serious crime like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fintech-spotlight-interview-jinisha-bhatt/">human trafficking</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-theft/">identity theft</a>. There are numerous forms of identity theft, with perhaps the darkest being ‘ghosting fraud’.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discover more about the fraudulent use of a deceased person’s personal information in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ghosting-fraud-dead/">‘Ghosting fraud: Are you doing business with the dead?’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>How VideoIdent Flex identifies and stops identity theft fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s identity verification always begins with powerful automated identity checks of document data. Our identity specialists will then perform interactive motion detection tests like a hand movement challenge to detect deepfakes. To prevent cases of account takeover, VideoIdent Flex can be used to help customers reverify their identity when any changes to accounts (address, email etc) are made.</p>



 3. Social engineering fraud. 



<p>Worryingly, according to our recently published UK Fraud Awareness Report, more than <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/attitudes-awareness-uk-fraud/">half of Brits (54%) do not know what social engineering is</a>. Social engineering fraud refers to the use of deception to manipulate individuals into divulging personal information, money or property and is an incredibly prevalent problem. Common examples of social engineering fraud include <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/social-media-fraud-investment-romance-scam/">social media fraud</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exposing-romance-scammers-becky-holmes/">romance scams</a>.</p>



<p>How VideoIdent Flex identifies and stops identity theft fraud.</p>



<p>To help prevent social engineering, in all its forms, our identity experts ask a series of questions specifically designed to identify whether someone has fallen victim to a social engineering scam. There are three different levels of questions: Basic; Advanced; and Premium, with questions ranging from “Has anyone promised you anything in return (money, loan etc) in return for this identification?” to “Has anyone prepared you for this identification?”</p>



 4. Money mules.&nbsp; 



<p>Although many may initially envisage somebody being stopped at the airport with a suitcase full of cash, money mules, like every fraudulent activity, has gone digital, and has now been extended to persons who receive money from a third party in order to transfer it to someone else. It is important to distinguish between “<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-mules/">money mules</a>” and “<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/social-engineering/">social engineering</a>“. Money mules are involved in fraud scenarios (i.e. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/bank-drop/">bank drops</a>) and cooperate as part of the criminal scheme.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a social engineering scenario, a person is seen as a victim of fraud and are usually unaware that they are breaking the law with their behaviour. They are tricked into opening accounts, e.g. through job advertisements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How VideoIdent Flex identifies and stops money mule fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our fraud prevention tools like IP address collection and red flag alerts of suspicious combinations of data, such as email domains, phone numbers and submitted documents, can go some way to help prevent money mule fraud. However, as an additional safeguard, when combined with VideoIdent Flex, agents can be trained to pick up on suspicious social cues and pose certain questions.</p>

 Lisbon Land Ownership Mapping: Unpacking Regulatory Mechanisms Behind Lisbon’s Spatial (In)justice <p>This blog post is the 4th article in the <a href="https://medium.com/urban-land-ownership-mapping">series</a>. The collaboration between <a href="https://darkmatterlabs.org/">Dark Matter Labs</a> and the <a href="https://www.ihrb.org/">Institute of Human Rights and Business</a> (IHRB) has previously resulted in <a href="https://medium.com/urban-land-ownership-mapping/urban-land-ownership-mapping-in-copenhagen-eb13bfbbded1">mapping of Copenhagen</a> and <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/prague-land-ownership-mapping-unearthing-the-foundations-of-affordability-crisis-8b9f931eba2d">Prague, </a>and aims to continue its investigation further in&nbsp;Athens.</p><p>Through findings in this blog, we aim to flag the role of the state and city councils as active agents — alongside many others — shaping neoliberal development as opposed to the prevailing belief that solely the market forces may jeopardize spatial justice. The example of Lisbon shows that whereas transparent and accessible land ownership information is an important enabler for public oversight and policy, it is not the only key factor shaping a city’s ability to safeguard local livelihoods and affordability. This blog post expands on the thesis that land ownership patterns are foundational to spatial (in)justice, broadening the definition by encompassing the state- and city council-led regulatory mechanisms that govern property&nbsp;markets.</p> Introduction <p>Lisbon is currently the 3rd <a href="https://www.idealista.pt/en/news/property-for-rent-in-portugal/2023/05/08/5468-long-term-rentals-in-portugal-lisbon-is-the-3rd-most-expensive-european#:~:text=Rent%20for%20a%201%2Dbedroom,city%20after%20Amsterdam%20and%20Reykjavik.&amp;text=Property%20for%20rent%20in%20Portugal%20is%20getting%20more%20and%20more%20expensive.">most expensive city in Europe for rental accommodation.</a> Given Portugal’s lower salary levels compared to other European member states, the recent penetration of vast amounts of foreign capital into the housing market has <a href="https://jacobin.com.br/2023/02/a-especulacao-imobiliaria-fez-de-lisboa-uma-das-cidades-mais-inabitaveis-do-mundo/">made everyday life increasingly unmanageable for its citizens.</a></p><p>Lisbon can be considered as a flagship example of the dynamics where the public debt of the European “semi-periphery” to the financial European and global market “core” (see: <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02723638.2023.2245302">Lima, 2023</a>) creditors turns the city into space for capital accumulation and its repayment. The public assets, municipal land, cultural heritage, housing, service sector and public space all become tools for economic growth often measured solely by abstract metrics such as real estate value appreciation.</p><p>Financialization means that even greater amounts of capital decoupled from the real economy and local realities (livelihoods, salaries etc.) flow into the city’s square meters turning them into financial assets that demand continuous returns on investments. In a context where finance is linked to space, new waves of capital need to continue finding physical room to act, with major impacts on people’s lives. The true debtors of this logic are not only the state or the municipality balance sheets, but the <a href="https://radicalhousingjournal.org/2022/informal-modes-of-governance/">displaced</a> citizens whose apartments needed to be freed for urban rehabilitation, struggling middle-class families facing soaring housing costs, the <a href="https://radicalhousingjournal.org/2022/informal-modes-of-governance/">22,812 families on the waiting list for social housing</a>, and the young; future generations who might never afford a home, forced to live with their&nbsp;parents.</p><p>In Lisbon, state-aided deregulation of the rental market, commodification of the existing housing stock, land and new housing developments speculation are the forces that have shaped this condition. Based on existing research, this blog aims to explain these&nbsp;forces.</p><p>Due to a lack of data transparency, it is difficult to precisely assess and depict who owns land and properties in the city, as well as what are the historical transactions which could bring actors in power into the public eye. What is known, however, through qualitative interviews with leading housing justice researchers, is that the main factors that have been shaping the catastrophic housing affordability crisis in Lisbon are those known to many other cities in&nbsp;Europe.</p> Structure of the&nbsp;blog <p>The structure of the blog aims to guide the reader through the dynamics which led Lisbon to its current condition.</p><p>1.

Further narrative tools which the author points towards&nbsp;are:</p>  § Complaining about bureaucracy and “context-risk” — as means to justify lack of possibility of affordable housing provision, and needing to sell housing at more premium&nbsp;prices.  Positioning as the only ones able to build in the city due to lack of capital and institutional capacity from the state to&nbsp;deliver.  Lamenting the historical lack of public investment to make the case for private investment.  Differentiating themselves from the previous “short-term”, speculative investors through the “long-term” rhetoric — emphasising the role of institutional investors as actors responding to city’s&nbsp;needs.  <p>Against the backdrop of liberalised rental laws, institutional investors drove the creation of a “new supply” of speculative rental apartment units extending beyond the historical core.

The permanent certificate of land registry provides, online, all the data regarding a property, even the pending requests. It is always updated and available for consultation. The <a href="https://www.predialonline.pt/PredialOnline/">WEBSITE</a> (<a href="https://www.predialonline.pt/PredialOnline/docs/Pedido_Certidao_Online.pdf">INSTRUCTION (in Portuguese)</a> of the Registo Predial Online offers the possibility of creating a ticket based on Town, parish (however, outdated taxonomy) and building number. The building number however can only be known if the interested party knows it (e.g. from a legal document such as a property sales contract) or applies for it in a physical office in&nbsp;Lisbon.</p><p>Application based on the property number (not land plot) is possible but costs 1 euro per entry (each apartment is one entry). For for purposes of this project, obtaining the scale of data would be simply beyond budget, and it may not even give much information on land. No data has therefore been purchased from this&nbsp;source.</p><p>As a test, a random search for buildings in the area of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Catarina,_Lisbon">Santa Catarina</a> (which is now part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miseric%C3%B3rdia_(Lisbon)">Misericórdia</a> parish) revealed 650 possible buildings, several of which may contain multiple housing units. One could reduce the cost of the purchase by filtering out some buildings (for example, those known to be owned by the municipality), but this is not an option, as the cadaster building number is decoupled from its&nbsp;address.</p><p>Interviews with researchers conducting similar investigations (<a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=m4fCcQ4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Cocola-Gant, A</a>; Gago A.; Lima, R, and Silva R.) confirmed that large-scale land ownership investigations are an impossible or very costly task. Applications for buildings by their address costs 14 euro, need to be submitted via a physical office in Lisbon and are limited to 10 inquiries per day. According to some researchers, even the municipality’s own planning department may not have a clear overview on the municipal assets.</p> Conclusion &amp; Recent developments <p>Lisbon serves as a prime illustration of how gentrification processes, initially disconnected from land ownership, originate in the city core and radiate outwards. Initially, urban rehabilitation efforts and incentives for transnational individuals and corporate investors attract foreign capital, which primarily targets properties such as apartments and housing units, and are not necessarily land focused. In the second instance, however, as the market matures, land plays an important role as the large-scale investors attracted by promising returns seek space for large-scale developments. Thus, as the property market in the central areas gets saturated, the new wave of large-scale investments provides a new supply of housing units, inflating the market&nbsp;further.</p><p>Amid rising cost of living, Lisbon city council has recently introduced measures to mitigate the effects of increased financialisation of the housing&nbsp;sector.</p><p>This February (2024) the municipality approved the new <a href="https://www.idealista.pt/news/imobiliario/habitacao/2024/02/15/61478-lisboa-cede-terrenos-a-cooperativas-para-criar-habitacao-acessivel">“Cooperativas 1ª Habitação Lisboa”</a> programme which involves making municipal assets available to housing cooperatives for 90 years. This includes small plots of land for construction of affordable housing by the cooperatives. Furthermore, Lisbon’s Municipal Housing Charter just went through a <a href="https://www.idealista.pt/news/imobiliario/habitacao/2023/11/08/60185-carta-municipal-de-habitacao-de-lisboa-ja-esta-em-consulta-publica">3-month long public consultation process</a> (see also <a href="https://www.am-lisboa.pt/101000/1/022072,112023/index.htm">Civic Assembly’s website</a>, <a href="https://www.am-lisboa.pt/documentos/1699880411C3iFM1sm7Ge45OM3.pdf">the Report</a>, and <a href="https://www.am-lisboa.pt/documentos/1699880475F6cYA8wx1Lq65AP0.pdf">Maps</a>). The Charter defines a strategy for the implementation of municipal housing policies between 2023 and 2033, representing an investment of 918 million euros. Its future is yet to be&nbsp;seen.</p> Acknowledgements <p>Special thanks to <a href="http://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=m4fCcQ4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Agustín Cocola-Gant</a>, <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0308518X19869012">Ana Gago</a>, <a href="https://ces.uc.pt/en/ces/pessoas/doutorandas-os/ana-rita-silva">Rita Silva</a>, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02723638.2023.2245302">Rafaella Lima</a> for your valuable research and time sharing insights that enabled the writing of this blog post.

<p>The manufacturing industry is in an unenviable position. Facing a constant onslaught of cost pressures, supply chain volatility and disruptive technologies like 3D printing and IoT. The industry must continually optimize process, improve efficiency, and improve overall equipment effectiveness.</p>



<p>At the same time, there is this huge sustainability and energy transition wave. Manufacturers are being called to reduce their carbon footprint, adopt circular economy practices and become more eco-friendly in general.</p>



<p>And manufacturers face pressure to constantly innovate while ensuring stability and safety. An inaccurate AI prediction in a marketing campaign is a minor nuisance, but an inaccurate AI prediction on a manufacturing shopfloor can be fatal.</p>



<p>Technology and disruption are not new to manufacturers, but the primary problem is that what works well in theory often fails in practice. For example, as manufacturers, we create a knowledge base, but no one can find anything without spending hours searching and browsing through the contents. Or we create a data lake, which quickly degenerates to a data swamp. Or we keep adding applications, so our technical debt continues to increase. But we are unable to modernize our applications, as logic that is developed over the years is hidden there.</p>



 The solution lies in generative AI &nbsp; 



<p>Let’s explore some of the capabilities or use cases where we see the most traction:</p>



 1. Summarization 



<p>Summarization remains the top use case for generative AI (gen AI) technology. Coupled with search and multi-modal interaction, gen AI makes a great assistant. &nbsp;Manufacturers use summarization in different ways.</p>



<p>They may use it to design a better way for operators to retrieve the correct information quickly and effectively from the vast repository of operating manuals, SOPs, logbooks, past incidents and more. This allows employees to focus more on their tasks and make progress without unnecessary delays.</p>



<p>IBM® has gen AI accelerators focused on manufacturing to do this. Additionally, these accelerators are pre-integrated with various cloud AI services and recommend the best LLM (large language model) for their domain.</p>



<p>Summarization also helps in n harsh operating environments. If the machine or equipment fails, the maintenance engineers can use gen AI to quickly diagnose problems based on the maintenance manual and an analysis of the process parameters.</p>



 2. Contextual data understanding  



<p>Data systems often cause major problems in manufacturing firms. They are often disparate, siloed, and multi-modal. Various initiatives to create a knowledge graph of these systems have been only partially successful due to the depth of legacy knowledge, incomplete documentation and technical debt incurred over decades.</p>



<p>IBM developed an AI-powered <a href="https://research.ibm.com/publications/siware-contextual-understanding-of-industrial-data-for-situational-awareness">Knowledge Discovery system</a> that use generative AI to unlock new insights and accelerate data-driven decisions with contextualized industrial data. IBM also developed an accelerator for context-aware feature engineering in the industrial domain. This enables real-time visibility into process states (normal/abnormal), alleviates frequent process obstructions, and detects and predicts golden batch.</p>



<p>IBM built a workforce advisor that uses summarization and contextual data understanding with intent detection and multi-modal interaction. Operators and plant engineers can use this to quickly zero in on a problem area. Users can ask questions by speech, text, and pointing, and the gen AI advisor will process it and provide a response, while having awareness of the context. This reduces the cognitive burden on the users by helping them do a root cause analysis faster, thus&nbsp;reducing their time and effort.</p>



 3. Coding Assistance  



<p>Gen AI also helps with coding, including code documentation, code modernization, and code development. As an example of how gen AI helps with IT modernization, consider the Water Corporation use case. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/water-corporation">Water Corporation adopted Watson Code Assistant</a>, which is powered by IBM’s gen AI capabilities, to help their transition into a cloud-based SAP infrastructure.</p>



<p>This tool accelerated code development by using AI-generated recommendations based on natural language inputs, significantly reducing deployment times and manual labor. With Watson Code Assistant, Water Corporation achieved a 30% reduction in development efforts and associated costs while maintaining code quality and transparency.</p>



 4. Asset Management 



<p>Gen AI has the power to transform asset management.</p>



<p>Generative AI can create foundation models for assets. When we must predict multiple KPIs on the same process or there is a fleet of similar assets. It is better to develop one foundation model of the asset and fine-tune it multiple times.</p>



<p>Gen AI can also train for predictive maintenance. Foundation models are very handy if failure data is scarce. Traditional AI models need lots of labels to provide reasonable accuracy. However, in foundation models, we can pretrain models without any labels and fine-tune with the limited labels.</p>



<p>Also, generative AI can provide technician support and training. Manufacturers can use gen AI technologies to create a training simulator for the operators and the technicians. Further, during the repair process, gen AI technologies can provide guidance and generate the best repair procedure.</p>



 Build new digital capabilities with generative AI 



<p>IBM believes that the agility, flexibility, and scalability that is afforded by generative AI technologies will significantly accelerate digitalization initiatives in the manufacturing industry.</p>



<p>Generative AI empowers enterprises at the strategic core of their business. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-adoption-has-more-than-doubled-since-2017-brian-hagaman/">Within two years, foundation models will power about a third of AI</a> within enterprise environments.</p>



<p>In IBM’s early work applying foundation models, time to value is&nbsp;up to 70% faster than a traditional AI approach. Generative AI makes other AI and analytics technologies more consumable, which helps manufacturing enterprises realize the value of their investments.</p>

<p>The latest findings of the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence">IBM X-Force® Threat Intelligence Index report</a> highlight a shift in the tactics of attackers. Rather than using traditional hacking methods, there has been a significant 71% surge in attacks where criminals are exploiting valid credentials to infiltrate systems. Info stealers have seen a staggering 266% increase in their utilization, emphasizing their role in acquiring these credentials. Their objective is straightforward: exploit the path of least resistance, often through unsuspecting employees, to obtain valid credentials.</p>



<p>Organizations have spent millions developing and implementing cutting-edge technologies to bolster their defenses against such threats, and many already have security awareness campaigns, so why are we failing to stop these attacks?</p>



 Challenges of traditional security awareness programs 



<p>Most security awareness programs today provide employees with information they need about handling data, GDPR rules and common threats, such as phishing.</p>



<p>However, there is one major weakness with this approach: the programs don’t consider human behavior. They typically follow a one-size-fits-all approach, with employees completing annual generic computer-based training with some slick animation and a short quiz.</p>



<p>While this provides necessary information, the rushed nature of the training and lack of personal relevance often results in employees forgetting the information within just 4-6 months. This can be explained by Daniel Kahneman’s theory on human cognition. According to the theory, every individual has a fast, automatic, and intuitive thought process, called System 1. People also have a slow, deliberate and analytical thought process, called System 2.</p>



<p>Traditional security awareness programs primarily target System 2, as the information needs to be rationally processed. However, without sufficient motivation, repetition and personal significance, the information usually goes in one ear and out the other.</p>



 It is crucial to understand employees’ behaviors 



<p>Nearly 95% of human thinking and decision making is controlled by System 1, which is our habitual way of thinking. Humans are faced with thousands of tasks and stimuli per day, and a lot of our processing is done automatically and unconsciously through biases and heuristics. The average employee works on autopilot, and to ensure that cybersecurity issues and risks are ingrained in their day-to-day decisions, we need to design and build programs that truly understand their intuitive way of working.</p>



<p>To understand human behavior and how to change it, there are a few factors we must assess and measure, supported by the COM-B Behavior Change Wheel.</p>



 
 First, we need to know employees’ capabilities. This refers to their knowledge and skills to engage in safe online practices, such as creating strong passwords and recognizing phishing attempts. 



 Then, we need to identify whether there are sufficient opportunities for them to learn, including the availability of resources such as training programs, policies and procedures. 



 Lastly, and most importantly, we need to understand the level of employee motivation and their willingness and drive to prioritize and adopt secure behaviors. 
 



<p>Once we understand and evaluate these three areas, we can pinpoint areas for behavioral change and design interventions that target employees’ intuitive behaviors. Ultimately, this approach aids organizations in fostering a first line of defense through the development of a more cyber aware workforce.&nbsp;</p>



 We need to foster a positive cybersecurity culture 



<p>Once the root causes of behavioral issues are identified, attention naturally shifts toward building a security culture. The prevailing challenge in cybersecurity culture today is its foundation in fear of error and wrongdoing. This mindset often fosters a negative perception of cybersecurity, resulting in low completion rates for training and minimal accountability. This approach requires a shift, but how do we accomplish it?</p>



<p>First and foremost, we must reconsider our approach to initiatives, moving away from a solely awareness-focused, compliance-driven model. While security awareness training remains vital and should not be overlooked, we must diversify our educational methods to foster a more positive culture. Alongside broad organizational training, we should embrace role-specific programs that incorporate experiential learning and gamification, such as the engaging <a href="https://www.ibm.com/services/xforce-cyber-range">cyber ranges facilitated by IBM X-Force</a>. Furthermore, organization-wide campaigns can reinforce the notion of a positive culture, involving activities like establishing a network of cybersecurity champions or hosting awareness months with diverse events.</p>



<p>Once these initiatives are selected and implemented to cultivate a positive and robust cybersecurity culture, it’s imperative that they receive support from all levels of the organization, from senior leadership to entry-level professionals. Only when there is a unified, affirmative message, can we truly transform the culture within organizations.</p>



 If we don’t measure human risk reduction, we don’t know what works 



<p>Now that we’ve identified the behavioral challenges and implemented a program aimed at fostering a positive culture, the next step is to establish metrics and parameters for success. To gauge the effectiveness of our program, we must address a fundamental question: to what extent have we mitigated the risk of a cybersecurity incident stemming from human error? It’s crucial to establish a comprehensive set of metrics capable of measuring risk reduction and overall program success. </p>



<p>Traditionally, organizations have relied on methods such as phishing campaigns and proficiency tests, with mixed results. One modern approach is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/MKEDO97N#:~:text=Security%20risk%20quantification%20translates%20cybersecurity,in%20a%20contextually%20relevant%20manner.">risk quantification</a>, a method that assigns a financial value to the human risk associated with a specific scenario. Integrating such metrics into our security culture program enables us to assess its success and continuously enhance it over time.</p>



 Collaborate with IBM and build the human firewall 



<p>The shifting landscape of cybersecurity demands a comprehensive approach that addresses the critical human factor. Organizations need to cultivate a positive cybersecurity culture supported by leadership engagement and innovative initiatives. This needs to be coupled with effective metrics to measure progress and demonstrate the value.</p>



<p>IBM offers a range of services to help our clients pivot their programs from awareness to focus on human behavior. We can help you assess and tailor your organization’s interventions to your employees’ motivations and habits, and help you foster a resilient first line of defense against emerging threats by empowering every individual to be a proactive guardian of cybersecurity.</p>

<p>Today, cybercrime is good business. It exists because the profits are high while the risks are low. Far from stopping, cybercrime is constantly increasing. In 2023, the FBI received a record number of 880,418 complaints with potential losses exceeding USD 12.5 billion. This is a nearly 10% increase in complaints and <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2023_IC3Report.pdf">22% increase in losses compared to 2022</a>.</p>



<p>According to the 2024 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence">IBM® X-Force® Threat Intelligence Index</a>, ransomware has become the most common attack observed globally in the past four years. Knowing the havoc caused by ransomware, organizations invest in creating lines of defense against this threat, so it is not surprising that today, cybersecurity is the number one expense in business technology.</p>



<p>When a cyberattack strikes, the ransomware code gathers information about target networks and key resources such as databases, critical files, snapshots and backups. Showing minimal activity, the threat can remain dormant for weeks or months, infecting hourly and daily snapshots and monthly full backups. Once the ransomware has collected all the information it needs, it begins the actual attack, encrypting and making critical files and databases unusable. File encryption is fast and the attack can cripple critical business data in a matter of minutes.</p>



 Take data resilience to the next level 



<p>Fortunately, ransomware attacks can be detected and several lines of defense can be built in advance to contain and control the threat. To help organizations face the different variants and strategies used to perpetrate an attack, IBM provides end-to-end data resilience solutions to efficiently defend organizations from ransomware and other malware attacks.</p>



<p><a href="http://ibm.com/flashsystem">IBM Storage FlashSystem</a> provides storage protection based on immutable copies of data logically isolated from production environments. These Safeguarded Copies cannot be modified or deleted through user errors, malicious actions or ransomware attacks. IBM Storage FlashSystem also offers inline data corruption detection through its new Flash Core Modules 4 (FCM4), which continuously monitors statistics gathered from every single I/O using machine learning models to early detect anomalies at block level.</p>



<p>For its part, <a href="http://ibm.com/products/storage-defender">IBM Storage Defender</a> is a purpose-built end-to-end solution that significantly simplifies and orchestrates business recovery processes through a unified view of data protection and cyber resilience status across the hybrid cloud with seamless integration into security dashboards. It deploys AI-powered sensors to rapidly detect anomalies in virtual machines (VMs), file systems, databases and other applications hosted in Linux VMs.</p>



 Better together 



<p>These IBM Storage solutions are a flagship in the cyber resilience industry. Both have capabilities that complement each other, and working together can substantially improve the overall capacity for early threat detection, data protection and fast recovery. The way they interact in a coordinated manner is explained below:</p>







<p>To improve threat detection, IBM Storage Defender combines its software sensors with the inline data corruption detection (IDCD) that comes from the IBM FlashSystem Flash Core Modules. This dual source provides more data to the Machine Learning models, reducing false positives and producing more accurate results.</p>



<p>Additionally, IBM Storage Defender can help clients restore production systems more quickly, identifying the most recent trusted copy and its location. These protected copies can be in primary storage or traditional backups. If the copy is presented on primary storage, the client can use the value of that system to restore operations in minutes rather than wait for restoration over the network.</p>



<p>As an additional layer of protection, workloads can be restored in an isolated “Clean Room” environment to be analyzed and validated before being recovered to production systems. This verification allows clients to know with certainty that the data is clean and business operations can be safely reestablished. Clean Room environments can be configured through seamless integration with partner solutions.</p>



 Business benefits 



<p>The coordinated interaction between IBM Storage Defender and IBM Storage FlashSystem improves the lines of defense to fight ransomware more efficiently, delivering the following benefits:</p>



 
 A unified and clear view of the overall data resilience status across primary and auxilliary storage. 



 Automated creation of Safeguarded Copies logically isolated from production environments that cannot be modified or deleted during ransomware attacks. 



 Ransomware detection at block level in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/flashsystem">60 seconds or less</a>. 



 Detailed information about validated Safeguarded Copies and their location, so they can be used as a trusted source of data to recover business operations quickly. 



 Ability to restore a Safeguarded Copy within <a href="https://www.ibm.com/flashsystem/cyber-resilience">60 seconds or less</a>. 



 Clean room environment to verify that workloads can be safely restored to production. 



 Alerts to Security Operations Center (SOC) and other incident teams to help coordinate the execution of recovery plans. 
 



<p>Today, only IBM can provide end-to-end data resilience across the entire hybrid cloud. IBM continues its commitment to further improve the synergy capabilities between IBM Storage Defender and IBM Storage FlashSystem, delivering the best solutions in the industry to maximize business continuity despite ransomware attacks and other data loss risks.</p>

<p>Domain name system (DNS) resolution is an iterative process where a recursive resolver attempts to look up a domain name using a hierarchical resolution chain. First, the recursive resolver queries the root (.), which provides the nameservers for the top-level domain(TLD), e.g.com. Next, it queries the TLD nameservers, which provide the domain’s authoritative nameservers. Finally, the recursive resolver &nbsp;queries those authoritative nameservers. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>In many cases, we see domains delegated to nameservers inside their own domain, for instance, “example.com.” is delegated to “ns01.example.com.” In these cases, we need glue records at the parent nameservers, usually the domain registrar, to continue the resolution chain. &nbsp;</p>



 What is a glue record?&nbsp; 



<p>Glue records are DNS records created at the domain’s registrar. These records provide a complete answer when the nameserver returns a reference for an authoritative nameserver for a domain. For example, the domain name “example.com” has nameservers “ns01.example.com” and “ns02.example.com”. To resolve the domain name, the DNS would query in order: root, TLD nameservers and authoritative nameservers. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When nameservers for a domain are within the domain itself, a circular reference is created. Having glue records in the parent zone avoids the circular reference and allows DNS resolution to occur. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Glue records can be created at the TLD via the domain registrar or at the parent zone’s nameservers if a subdomain is being delegated away. &nbsp;</p>



 When are glue records required?&nbsp; 



<p>Glue records are needed for any nameserver that is authoritative for itself. If a 3rd party, such as a <a href="https://ns1.com/products/managed-dns">managed DNS provider</a> hosts the DNS for a zone, no glue records are needed.&nbsp;</p>



 IBM NS1 Connect Dedicated DNS nameservers require glue records&nbsp; 



<p>IBM NS1 Connect requires that customers use a separate domain for their Dedicated DNS nameservers. As such, the nameservers within this domain will require glue records. Here, we see glue records for exampledns.net being configured in Google Domains with random IP addresses:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once the glue records have been added at the registrar, the Dedicated DNS domain should be delegated to the IBM NS1 Connect Managed nameservers and the Dedicated DNS nameservers. For most customers, there will be a total of 8 NS records in the domain’s delegation.&nbsp;</p>



 What do glue records look like in the dig tool?&nbsp; 



<p>Glue records appear in the ADDITIONAL SECTION of the response. To see a domain’s glue records using the dig tool, directly query a TLD nameserver for the domain’s NS record. The glue records in this example are in quotation marks. Quotation marks are used for emphasis below:&nbsp;</p>











 How do I know my glue records are correct?&nbsp; 



<p>To verify that glue records are correctly listed at the TLD nameservers, directly query the TLD nameservers for the domain’s NS records using the dig tool as shown above. Compare the ADDITIONAL SECTION contents of the response to the expected values entered as NS records in IBM NS1 Connect. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The dig command is a powerful tool for troubleshooting queries and responses received from the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/dns-records">Domain Name Service (DNS)</a>. It is installed by default on many operating systems, including Linux® and Mac OS X. It can be installed on Microsoft Windows as part of Cygwin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the many things dig can do is to perform recursive DNS resolution and display all of the steps that it took in your terminal. This is extremely useful for understanding not only how the DNS works, but for determining if there is an issue somewhere within the resolution chain that cause resolution failures for your zones or domains.&nbsp;</p>



 First, let’s briefly review how a query recursive receives a response in a typical recursive DNS resolution scenario:&nbsp; 



 
 You as the DNS client (or stub resolver) query your recursive resolver for www.example.com.&nbsp; 



 Your recursive resolver queries the root nameserver for NS records for “com.”&nbsp; 



 The root nameserver refers your recursive resolver to the .com Top-Level Domain (TLD) authoritative nameserver.&nbsp; 



 Your recursive resolver queries the .com TLD authoritative server for NS records of “example.com.”&nbsp; 



 The .com TLD authoritative nameserver refers your recursive server to the authoritative servers for example.com.&nbsp; 



 Your recursive resolver queries the authoritative nameservers for example.com for the A record for “www.example.com” and receives 1.2.3.4 as the answer.&nbsp; 



 Your recursive resolver caches the answer for the duration of the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/time-to-live">time-to-live (TTL)</a> specified on the record and returns it to you. 
 



<p>The above process basically looks like this: </p>



 Step 1 







 Step 2 







 Step 3 







 Step 4 







 Step 5 







<p>This process occurs every time you type a URL into your web browser or fire up your email client. This illustrates why DNS answer speed and accuracy are so important: if the answer is inaccurate, you may need to repeat this process several times; and if the speed with which you receive an answer is slow, then it will make everything you do online seem to take longer than it should.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Driving both DNS answer speed and accuracy is at the core of the IBM® NS1 Connect® value proposition.  &nbsp;</p>

<p>Data integration stands as a critical first step in constructing any artificial intelligence (AI) application. While various methods exist for starting this process, organizations accelerate the application development and deployment process through data virtualization.</p>



<p>Data virtualization empowers businesses to unlock the hidden potential of their data, delivering real-time AI insights for cutting-edge applications like predictive maintenance, fraud detection and demand forecasting.</p>



<p>Despite heavy investments in databases and technology, many companies struggle to extract further value from their data. Data virtualization bridges this gap, allowing organizations to use their existing data sources with flexibility and efficiency for AI and analytics initiatives.</p>



<p>Virtualizing data acts as a bridge, enabling the platform to access and display data from external source systems on demand. This innovative approach centralizes and streamlines data management without requiring physical storage on the platform itself. A virtual layer establishes itself between data sources and users, enabling organizations to access and manage their data without replication or movement from its original location.</p>



 Why choose data virtualization? 



 
 Data virtualization streamlines the merging of data from diverse sources by eliminating the need for physical movement or duplication. This significantly reduces data integration time and expense, while also minimizing the potential for inaccuracies or data loss. 
 



 
 Organizations can achieve a centralized perspective of their data, regardless of its storage source. This serves as a single point of reference for analytics, reporting and data-based decisions, resulting in increased accuracy and quicker generation of valuable insights. 
 



 
 Organizations gain the ability to effortlessly modify and scale their data in response to shifting business demands, leading to greater agility and adaptability. 
 



 Breaking down data silos: Fueling machine learning success with data virtualization  



<p>AI has significantly transformed large companies, reshaping business operations and decision-making processes through&nbsp;advanced analytics solutions. This transformation heavily relies on data virtualization, which serves as a central hub, connecting real-time data streams from various sources, such as sensor data and equipment logs, and eliminating data silos and fragmentation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data virtualization not only integrates real-time data but also historical data from comprehensive software suites used for various functions, such as&nbsp;enterprise resource planning or customer relationship management. This historical data provides valuable insights into areas like maintenance schedules, asset performance or customer behavior, depending on the suite.</p>



<p>By combining real-time and historical data from diverse sources, data virtualization creates a comprehensive and unified view of an organization’s entire operational data ecosystem.&nbsp;This holistic view empowers businesses to make data-driven decisions, optimize processes and gain a competitive edge.</p>



<p>With the rise of generative AI chatbots, foundation models now use this rich data set. These algorithms actively sift through the data to uncover hidden patterns, trends and correlations, providing valuable insights that enable advanced analytics to predict a range of outcomes. These predictions can identify potential business opportunities like market shifts and customer needs, proactively detect and prevent system issues and failures, and optimize maintenance schedules for maximum uptime and efficiency.</p>



 Design considerations for virtualized data platforms 



 &nbsp;1. Latency and real-time analysis 



 Challenge:&nbsp; 



<p>Accessing stored data directly typically incurs less latency compared to virtualized data retrieval, which can impede real-time predictive maintenance analyses, where timely insights are crucial.</p>



 Design considerations: 



<p>We need a two-pronged approach to ensure real-time insights and minimize delays in accessing virtualized data. First, we’ll analyze the network infrastructure and optimize data transfer protocols. This can involve techniques like network segmentation to reduce congestion or using faster protocols like UDP for certain data types. By optimizing data transfer, we decrease the time it takes to retrieve the information you need. Second, we’ll implement data refresh strategies to maintain a reasonably up-to-date dataset for analysis. This might involve using batch jobs to perform incremental data updates at regular intervals, balancing the update frequency with the resources required. Striking this balance is crucial: too frequent updates can strain resources, while infrequent updates can lead to outdated data and inaccurate predictions. By combining these strategies, we can achieve both minimal latency and a fresh data set for optimal analysis.</p>



 2. Balancing update frequency and source system strain 



 Challenge:&nbsp; 



<p>Continuously querying virtualized data for real-time insights can overload the source systems, impacting their performance. This poses a critical concern for predictive analysis or AI, which depends on frequent data updates.</p>



 Design considerations: 



<p>To optimize query frequency for your predictive analysis and reporting, need to carefully design how it accesses data. This includes focusing on retrieving only critical data points and potentially using data replication tools for real-time access from multiple sources. Additionally, consider scheduling or batching data retrievals for specific crucial points instead of constant querying, reducing strain on data systems and improving overall model performance.</p>



 3. Virtualization layer abstraction and developer benefits 



 Advantage:&nbsp; 



<p>The virtualization layer in the data platform acts as an abstraction layer. This means developers building AI/ML or data mining applications for business once the abstraction layer is ready without worrying about where the data is physically stored or its specific storage details. They can focus on designing the core logic of their models without getting bogged down in data management complexities. This leads to faster development cycles and quicker deployment of these applications.</p>



 Benefits for developers: 



<p>By utilizing an abstraction layer, developers working on data analytics can focus on the core logic of their models. This layer acts as a shield, hiding the complexities of data storage management.&nbsp; This translates to faster development times as developers don’t need to get bogged down in data intricacies, ultimately leading to quicker deployment of the predictive maintenance models.</p>



 4. Storage optimization considerations 



<p>Storage optimization techniques like normalization or denormalization might not directly apply to all functions of a specific data analysis application, but they play a significant role when adopting a hybrid approach. This approach involves integrating both ingested data and data accessed through virtualization within the chosen platform.</p>



<p>Assessing the tradeoffs between these techniques helps ensure optimal storage usage for both ingested and virtualized data sets. These design considerations are crucial for building effective ML solutions using virtualized data on the data platform.</p>



 Data virtualization: A strategic powerhouse for modern applications 



<p>Data virtualization has evolved beyond mere innovation. It serves as a strategic tool for enhancing the capabilities of various applications. A prime example is a data virtualization platform. This platform facilitates the development of a wide range of applications by using data virtualization, thereby significantly improving their efficiency, adaptability and capacity to deliver near real-time insights.</p>



<p>Let’s explore some compelling use cases that showcase the transformative power of data virtualization.</p>



 1. Optimizing supply chains for a globalized world 



<p>In today’s interconnected global economy, vast networks with complex dependencies characterize supply chains. Data virtualization streamlines these intricate systems crucially. A data virtualization platform unifies data from numerous sources, including production metrics, logistics tracking details and market trend data. This comprehensive view empowers businesses, offering a complete picture of their entire supply chain operations.</p>



<p>Imagine having unimpeded visibility across all aspects. You can proactively identify potential bottlenecks, optimize logistics processes and adapt to shifting market dynamics in real time. The result is an optimized and agile value chain delivering significant competitive advantages.</p>



 2. Deep dive into customer behavior: Customer analytics 



<p>The digital revolution has rendered understanding your customers critical for business success. A data virtualization platform breaks down data silos by using data virtualization. It seamlessly integrates customer data from various touchpoints, such as sales records, customer service interactions and marketing campaign performance metrics. This unified data landscape fosters a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior patterns and preferences.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 1st to 15th April&nbsp;2024   With its new crypto regulatory update, Singapore is mandating strict custody and transaction rules.  Brazil, on the other hand, is becoming more crypto-friendly, having started recognizing cryptocurrencies as a valid payment&nbsp;method.  Both countries reflect the dynamic, evolving landscape of global crypto regulation.  <p>In this edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap, we examine the latest crypto regulatory developments in Singapore and&nbsp;Brazil.</p><p>Both countries are revising their stand toward cryptocurrencies, which is reflected in their regulatory responses. This shift is clearly evident from their new measures.</p> Singapore Tightening Up Its Crypto Regulations <p>Until a series of failures rocked the crypto industry in 2022, most rankings identified Singapore as the most crypto-friendly country.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/raylovescrypto/status/1505565139642290177">Image Source</a>)<p>Even founders who moved to Singapore, drawn by its crypto-friendly measures initiated pre-2022, found themselves questioning their decisions.</p><p>Recently, Singapore’s Central Bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), is rolling out <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/mas-singapore-crypto-regulations-digital-asset-custody/">new updates to the Payment Services Act</a> to tighten its grip on the crypto landscape.</p>(<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-15/singapore-wants-to-play-long-game-in-ai-space-mohanty-says">Image Source</a>)<p>These updates extend to crypto custody, token payments or transfers, and cross-border payments, even if transactions don’t physically touch Singapore’s financial system.</p><p>Key among these regulations is the requirement for service providers to keep customer assets separate from their own, with a hefty 90% of these assets to be stored in cold wallets to enhance security.</p><p>Additionally, the MAS is keen on preventing anyone from having too much control over these assets, favoring multi-party computation (MPC) wallets, which require a collaborative effort for transactions.</p><p>Moreover, the MAS is stepping in to protect retail customers by banning them from certain activities, such as crypto staking or lending, which are gaining attention from regulators worldwide.</p> Brazil Harnessing New Affection for&nbsp;Crypto <p>On Brazil’s part, it was never really considered among the top five crypto-friendly countries. Yet, it has initiated several measures that challenge crypto enthusiasts’ notions about the&nbsp;country.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/viktor_kyrrex/status/1669366040055144448">Image Source</a>)<p>It is also among the major global economies (G20 Member Countries) that have rolled out crypto regulations.</p><p>Continuing with its crypto-friendly measures, President Jair Bolsonaro recently <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/cpi-posts/brazilian-president-signs-bill-creating-crypto-regulations/">green-lit a bill</a> that recognizes cryptocurrency as a valid payment method. Although this law, set to take effect in six months, does not declare cryptocurrencies as legal tender, it does incorporate them into the legal framework.</p><blockquote>“With regulation, cryptocurrency will become even more popular.”</blockquote><blockquote>- Sen. Iraja&nbsp;Abreu</blockquote><p>Under this new law, crypto assets classified as securities will fall under the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission’s watch, while a designated government body will oversee other digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>In conclusion, Singapore’s and Brazil’s approaches to crypto regulations prove once again that the crypto industry as a whole is a continuously evolving space and can change significantly within a few years, from narrative to various national governments’ approach to&nbsp;them.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://issuu.com/shyftnetwork/docs/global_crypto_regulatory_outlook_2024_-_shyft_netw#google_vignette">The Visual Guide on Global Crypto Regulatory Outlook&nbsp;2024</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/almost-70-of-all-fatf-assessed-countries-have-implemented-the-crypto-travel-rule">Almost 70% of all FATF-Assessed Countries Have Implemented the Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule</a></p> ‍About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Exploring the relationship between Google Trends data and the cryptocurrency market…</p> Overview <p>This challenge is not just a platform to showcase one’s data science skills; it’s a gateway to gaining deep insights into one of the most dynamic and rapidly evolving markets. Participants will sharpen their data science expertise by analyzing the relationship between Google Trends data and cryptocurrency prices. They will also contribute to our understanding of how online interest influences financial markets. This knowledge could be a game-changer for investors, businesses, and researchers navigating the complexities of the cryptocurrency landscape. So, join us in this journey of discovery and make a significant impact in the world of data-driven finance!</p> Objective <p>Participants will explore the correlation between Google Trends data and cryptocurrency token prices to uncover patterns and draw significant conclusions. Emphasizing the development of predictive models, the challenge asks participants to navigate the complexities of cryptocurrency trading, discovering insights into how public interest influences market trends. This opportunity evaluates participants’ ability to apply data science skills in real-world scenarios and provides a deeper understanding of cryptocurrency market dynamics, extracting insights through exploratory data analysis and advanced machine learning methodologies.</p> Data <p>The data provided for the challenge is organized into two main categories: ‘trends’ and ‘prices.’ In the ‘trends’ section, participants will find web search interest data sourced from Google Trends for 20 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, Cardano, Polkadot, Chainlink, Litecoin, Uniswap, Filecoin, Fetch.ai, Monero, Singularitynet, Kezos, Kucoin, Pancakeswap, Oasis Network, and Ocean Protocol. Meanwhile, the ‘prices’ folder is equally important, containing pricing information and trading volume data for the same set of 20 cryptocurrencies. It’s worth noting that the level of interest for each cryptocurrency is normalized on a scale from 0 (representing the fewest searches) to 100 (reflecting the highest number of searches) over a specific period, ensuring uniformity but not providing a basis for direct comparison between cryptocurrencies.</p> Mission <p>Our mission is clear: to explore and understand the relationship between cryptocurrency market trends and public search behaviors. In this challenge, we identify the factors influencing crypto markets through rigorous analysis. We ask participants to create predictive models to forecast token trends and compile detailed reports sharing their insights and discoveries. The contest aims to foster innovation, collaboration, and learning within the data science community while contributing to a deeper understanding of the complex forces driving cryptocurrency markets.</p> Rewards <p>We’re dedicated to acknowledging excellence and nurturing talent, so we’ve designed a reward system that celebrates top performers while motivating participants of all skill levels.

   Controlling access to resources and data is a critical priority for organizations. When developers are tasked with introducing a new application, one of the first considerations is the authorization model. How will we control access to features? Will there be limitations on who can perform actions? For too long, the answer has been to custom develop a homegrown solution for each application.

<p>Controlling access to resources and data is a critical priority for organizations. When developers are tasked with introducing a new application, one of the first considerations is the authorization model. How will we control access to features? Will there be limitations on who can perform actions? For too long, the answer has been to custom develop a homegrown solution for each application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this approach often means that developers are repeatedly developing an authorization solution time and time again. This is a hidden cost of application development, where developer time is spent building an authorization framework rather than features and functionality that help drive business outcomes. Furthermore, homegrown authorization frameworks are often limited in the use cases they can solve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the pattern of authentication, developers are now turning to IAM platforms to manage authorization controls. For simple needs, authorization may be easily managed with an application permissions model. As more sophisticated use cases and requirements emerge, this simple model is best extended with fine-grained policies to handle user segmentation and dynamic decisioning.</p>

   In a digital age where the management of identity wallets and credentials is becoming increasingly complex, the W3C's Web Incubator Community Group (WICG) has initiated a pivotal work item called Digital Identities. As co-chair of the newly formed Federated Identity Working Group alongside Wendy Seltzer, I delve into why this project may (or may not!) soon find a permanent home within our group. T

<p>About a year ago, a new work item was formed under the W3C’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">Web Incubator Community Group</a> (the WICG). This work item looks at how a browser should behave when it comes to identity wallets and the credentials they hold. While the project has gone through a few name changes, it is currently called Digital Identities; the scope is available in <a href="https://github.com/WICG/digital-identities">GitHub</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why am I writing about it now? Because the W3C is thinking about whether the new working group I’m co-chairing in the W3C with Wendy Seltzer, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/fedid/">Federated Identity Working Group</a>, should be the standardization home for this project.&nbsp;This is definitely a niche post, but IYKYK! </p>



 Background 



<p>Initially, conversations about browsers, wallets, and how individuals are expected to select their credential of choice started in a FIDO Alliance board task force. Given the number of overlapping participants, members of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/fed-id/">Federated Identity Community Group</a> (FedID CG) took up the question as to whether that work should be in scope for the CG. The FedID CG, however, came to the conclusion that they were focused on determining how a different identity architecture, one that covers more traditional federation models via OpenID Connect and SAML, should handle the deprecation of third-party cookies. So, while there was alignment on the problem of “how is an individual supposed to actively select their identity,” the fact that the deprecation of third-party cookies mattered to the federation architecture but not to the wallet architecture suggested a separate incubation effort was necessary. If you don’t have alignment on what problem you’re trying to solve, you’re probably not going to solve the problem.</p>



 A Different Set of Stakeholders 



<p>That wasn’t necessarily a bad thing, that rejection from the FedID CG. The work item there is relatively simple when compared to what needs to come into play for an entirely new identity architecture. There are fewer stakeholders involved in a ‘traditional’ federation architecture. When considering wallet interactions, the number of interested parties goes well beyond a SAML or OIDC federation’s Identity Providers and Relying Parties and the browser. </p>



<p>With a digital identity wallet, we see requirements coming in from operating system developers, browser developers, and privacy advocates, as well as wallet and credential issuers and verifiers. This diversity of needs results in some confusion as to what problem the group is trying to solve. There are several layers to making a digital wallet function in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion; the group is not, however, specifying for all layers.</p>



<p>The WICG’s Digital Identities work may be a good fit for a more structured working group format than it was for a community group focused on incubation; that’s part of what has inspired this post.</p>



 Protocol Layers 



<p>The WICG Digital Identities work item did not start with a single problem statement the way the FedID CG did. Instead, their mission is described in their charter&nbsp;“to specify an API for user agents that would mediate access to, and representation of, verifiably-issued digital identities.”</p>



<p>To understand the totality of the effort to bring digital wallets and credentials to the web, which is a broader scope than that of the Digital Identities work item, you need to understand the many <a href="https://github.com/WICG/digital-identities/blob/main/resources/DigitalCredentialsAPI-Layering-v20240301.pdf">layers</a> involved in enabling an identity transaction on the web and/or across apps.&nbsp;</p>



 Our Layers 



 
 Standardized API (W3C) = Digital Credentials Web Platform API (this is us) 



 Standardized API (Other) = currently FIDO CTAP 2.2 (hybrid transport; a phishing-resistant, cross-device link is already in place for passkeys/WebAuthn) 



 Platform-specific web translation API = platform abstraction of web platform APIs for verifiers* 



 Platform-specific function API = independent platform native API* 



 Protocol-specific = Protocol or deployment-specific request/response 
 



 Digital Credentials Web Platform API 



<p>The output of the WICG Digital Identities work item is the Digital Credentials Web Platform API from that first layer in the stack. In incubating that API, the specification editors are relying on the existence and behavior of other APIs either already in place or being developed by their respective platforms. Having the developers of those other APIs involved to make sure that the end-to-end flow of wallet and credential selection works as anticipated by the Digital Credentials Web Platform API is critical. Requiring change to those other APIs is out of scope for the Digital Identities work item (though we can ask nicely).&nbsp;</p>



 An FAQ 



 
 Should the browser see the details of the request for what’s in a wallet?
 
 That’s not in scope for the W3C (though the question still comes up when people join the group). 
 
 



 Should the OS see the details of what’s in a wallet?
 
 That’s not in scope for the W3C, either, so while of interest to many, it’s not something this group can or should resolve.&nbsp; 
 
 



 Should the API be protocol agnostic when it comes to verifiable credentials?
 
 Some say yes, some say no. The more protocols you have to support, the more expensive maintenance gets. So, while on the one hand, being protocol-agnostic supports the largest number of use cases, it’s also the most expensive thing to do.&nbsp; 
 
 



 What does protocol-agnostic look like in practice when different credentials format similar information differently?
 
 That’s one of the things we talk about.&nbsp; 
 
 



 At what point(s) does the individual consent to the information being requested from a wallet? being requested to be added to a wallet?
 
 We’re still talking about that, too. 
 
 



 Is the use case under consideration primarily remote presentation or in-person presentation?
 
 The scope is online presentation, so the work is focused on the remote use case.&nbsp; 
 
 



 Is the payload of requests in scope for this group, or is the group only concerned with communication channels (leaving payload handling up to the platforms)?
 
 Here’s another area of contention. Of course, the browser wants to prevent bad traffic. But this stuff is encrypted for a reason, and making everything (most things? some things?) viewable to the browser isn’t necessarily the right answer either from a privacy and security perspective.&nbsp; 
 
 



 Is the question of what signal must exist (and who provides that signal) for a wallet to be trusted by the browser in scope for the group? If not, where can those discussions be directed?
 
 This is not in scope as the web platform does not directly communicate with the wallet in this architecture. 
 
 
 



 Wrap Up 



<p>So what happens now? Conversations are happening at the OAuth Security Workshop, within the W3C Advisory Committee, and soon at the Internet Identity Workshop. By the time those wrap up, the Federated Identity Working Group will start meeting and will have its own say as to whether this work belongs in scope or not. If you’re interested in participating in the conversation, there is a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/450">GitHub issue</a> open where we are collecting input on the topic. You are welcome to chime in there, or just grab some popcorn and watch the story unfold!</p>

<p>This blog is the third part of a three-part series, the Hitchhiker’s Guide to&nbsp;KERI:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/finema/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-keri-part-1-51371f655bba">Part 1: Why should you adopt&nbsp;KERI?</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/finema/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-keri-part-2-what-exactly-is-keri-e46a649ac54c">Part 2: What exactly is&nbsp;KERI?</a>  Part 3: How do you use&nbsp;KERI?  <p>Now that you grasp the rationale underpinning the adoption of KERI and have acquired a foundational understanding of its principles, this part of the series is dedicated to elucidating the preliminary steps necessary for embarking upon a journey with KERI and the development of applications grounded in its framework.</p><p>The resources provided below, while presented in no particular order, serve to supplement your exploration of KERI. Moreover, this blog will serve as an implementer guide to further deepen your understanding and proficiency in utilizing KERI.</p> Read the Whitepaper <p>The Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KEI) protocol was first introduced in the <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI whitepaper</a> by Dr. Samuel M. Smith in 2019. The whitepaper kickstarts the development of the entire ecosystem.</p><p>While the KERI whitepaper undoubtedly offers invaluable insights into the intricate workings and underlying rationale of the protocol, I would caution against starting your KERI journey with it. Its length exceeding 140 pages, may pose a significant challenge for all but a few cybersecurity experts. It is advisable to revisit the whitepaper once you have firmly grasped the foundational concepts of KERI. Nevertheless, should you be inclined towards a more rigorous learning approach, you are certainly encouraged to undertake the endeavor.</p>The KERI Whitepaper, first published July&nbsp;2019.<p>I also recommend <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/tree/master/whitepapers">related whitepapers</a> by Dr. Samuel M. Smith as&nbsp;follows:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/IdentifierTheory_web.pdf">Universal Identifier Theory</a>: a unifying framework for combining autonomic identifiers (AID) with human meaningful identifiers.  <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/SPAC_Message.pdf">Secure Privacy, Authenticity, and Confidentiality (SPAC)</a>: the whitepaper that laid the foundation for the <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/blog/2023/01/05/the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">ToIP trust-spanning protocol</a>.  <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/SustainablePrivacy.pdf">Sustainable Privacy</a>: a privacy-protection approach in the KERI ecosystem.   Read Introductory Contents <p>Before delving into the whitepaper and related specifications, I recommend the following introductory materials, which helped me personally:</p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izNZ20XSXR0">KERI Presentation</a> at SSI Meetup Webinar, given by the originator of KERI, Dr. Samuel M. Smith,&nbsp;himself  <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lpzYcPrIox9V4hERtn4Kcf7uq01OVU9u3PuVm1aYzR0/edit#slide=id.ga411be7e84_0_0">KERI for Muggles</a>, by Samuel M. Smith and Drummond Reed. This was a presentation given at the Internet Identity Workshop&nbsp;#33.  <blockquote>Note: the author of this blog was first exposed to KERI by this presentation.</blockquote>  <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity">Section 10.8</a> of “Self-Sovereign Identity” by Alex Preukschat &amp; Drummond Reed, Manning Publication (2021). This section was also written by Dr. Samuel M.&nbsp;Smith.  <a href="https://www.windley.com/archives/2020/09/the_architecture_of_identity_systems.shtml">The Architecture of Identity Systems</a>, by Phil Windley. Written by one of the most prominent writers in the SSI ecosystem, Phil compared administrative, algorithm, and autonomic identity&nbsp;systems.  <a href="https://weboftrust.github.io/WOT-terms/?level=3">KERISSE</a>, by Henk van Cann and Kor Dwarshuis, this an educational platform as well as a search engine for the KERI ecosystem.  <p>More resources can also be found at <a href="https://keri.one/keri-resources/">https://keri.one/keri-resources/</a>. Of course, this Hitchhiker’s Guide to KERI series has also been written as one such introductory content.</p>“Self-Sovereign Identity” by Alex Preukschat &amp; Drummond&nbsp;Reed Read the KERI and Related Specifications <p>As of 2024, the specifications for KERI and related protocols are being developed by the <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ACDC+%28Authentic+Chained+Data+Container%29+Task+Force">ACDC (Authentic Chained Data Container) Task Force</a> under the <a href="https://www.trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP (ToIP)</a> Foundation. Currently, there are four specifications:</p>  <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/">Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</a>: the specification for the KERI protocol&nbsp;itself.  <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/#go.draft-ssmith-acdc.html">Authentic Chained Data Containers (ACDC)</a>: the specification for the variant of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) used within the KERI ecosystem.  <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/">Composable Event Streaming Representation (CESR)</a>: the specification for a dual text-binary encoding format used for messages exchanged within the KERI protocol.  <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-did-method-webs-specification/index.html">DID Webs Method Specification</a>: the specification did:webs method that improves the security property of did:web with the KERI protocol.  <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/">KERI Specification v1.0&nbsp;Draft</a><p>There are also two related protocols, which do not have their own dedicated specifications:</p>  <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/#self-addressing-identifier-said">Self-Addressing Identifier (SAID)</a>: a protocol for generating identifiers used in the KERI protocol. Almost all identifiers in KERI are SAIDs, including AIDs, ACDCs’ identifiers, and schemas’ identifiers.  <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/#out-of-band-introduction-oobi">Out-Of-Band-Introduction (OOBI)</a>: a discovery mechanism for AIDs and SAIDs using&nbsp;URLs.  <p>To learn about these specifications, I also recommend my blog, the <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0">KERI jargon in a nutshell</a>&nbsp;series.</p><blockquote>Note: The KERI community intends to eventually publish the KERI specifications in ISO. However, this goal may take several years to&nbsp;achieve.</blockquote> Check out the KERI Open-Source Projects <p>The open-source projects related to the KERI protocols and their implementations are hosted in <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/">WebOfTrust Github</a>, all licensed under <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache Version&nbsp;2.0</a>.</p><blockquote>Note: Apache License Version 2.0 is a permissive open-source software license that allows users to freely use, modify, and distribute software under certain conditions. It permits users to use the software for any purpose, including commercial purposes and grants patent rights to users. Additionally, it requires users to include a copy of the license and any necessary copyright notices when redistributing the software.</blockquote><p>Here are some of the important projects being actively developed by the KERI community:</p> Reference Implementation: KERIpy <p>The core libraries and the reference implementation for the KERI protocol have been written in Python, called KERIpy. This is by far the most important project that all other KERI projects are based&nbsp;on.</p>  KERIpy (Python): <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy</a>  <p>KERIpy is also available in Dockerhub and&nbsp;PyPI:</p>  Dockerhub: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/weboftrust/keri">https://hub.docker.com/r/weboftrust/keri</a>  PyPI: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/keri/">https://pypi.org/project/keri/</a>   Edge Agent:&nbsp;Signify <p>The KERI ecosystem follows the principle of “key at the edge (KATE),” that is, all essential cryptographic operations are performed at edge devices. The Signify projects have been developed to provide lightweight KERI functionalities at edge devices. Currently, Signify is already in Python and Typescript.</p>  SignifyPy (Python) <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signifypy">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signifypy</a>  Signify-TS (Typescript) <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts</a>  <p>Signify is also available in PyPI and&nbsp;NPM:</p>  PyPI: <a href="https://pypi.org/project/signifypy/">https://pypi.org/project/signifypy/</a>  NPM: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/signify-ts">https://www.npmjs.com/package/signify-ts</a>   Cloud Agent:&nbsp;KERIA <p>Signify is designed to be lightweight and is reliant on a KERI cloud agent, called KERIA. KERIA helps with data storage and facilitates communication with external parties. As mentioned above, all essential cryptographic operations are performed at the edge using KERIA. Private and sensitive data are also encrypted at the edge before being stored in a KERIA&nbsp;server.</p>  KERIA (Python): <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria</a>  <p>KERIA is also available in Dockerhub:</p>  Dockerhub: <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/weboftrust/keria">https://hub.docker.com/r/weboftrust/keria</a>   Browser Extension: Polaris <p>The browser extension project is based on Signify-TS for running in browser environments.</p>  Signify Browser Extension: <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-browser-extension">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-browser-extension</a>  Polaris: <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/polaris-web">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/polaris-web</a>  <blockquote>Note: The Signify browser extension project was funded by <a href="https://provenant.net/">Provanant Inc.</a> and developed by <a href="https://www.rootsid.com/">RootsID</a>. The project has been donated to the WebOfTrust Github project under Apache License Version&nbsp;2.0.</blockquote> Study KERI Command Line Interface (KLI) <p>Once you grasp the basic concept of KERI, one of the best ways to start learning about the KERI protocol is to work with the KERI command line interface (KLI), which uses simple bash scripts to provide an interactive experience.</p><p>I recommend the following tutorials on&nbsp;KLI:</p>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqjsRuu0V5A&amp;list=PL6wYtOHmJEBNqoQ7OURLPz2eXa8J_Mcjt&amp;index=1">KERI &amp; OOBI CLI Demo</a>, by Phillip Feairheller &amp; Henk van&nbsp;Cann.  <a href="https://kentbull.com/">KERI KLI Tutorial Series</a>, by Kent Bull.

These projects were specifically designed to complement each other, enabling the implementation of “key at the edge (KATE)”. That is, essential cryptographic operations are performed at edge devices, including key pair generation and signing, while private and sensitive data are encrypted before being stored in an instance of KERIA cloud&nbsp;agent.</p><p>The Signify-KERIA protocol by Philip Feairheller can be found&nbsp;here:</p>  Signify/KERIA Request Authentication Protocol (SKRAP): <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria/blob/main/docs/protocol.md">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria/blob/main/docs/protocol.md</a>  <p>The API between a Signify client and KERIA server can be found&nbsp;here:</p>  KERI API (KAPI): <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/kapi/blob/main/kapi.md">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/kapi/blob/main/kapi.md</a>  <p>Example Signify scripts for interacting with a KERIA server can also be found&nbsp;here:</p>  Example scripts: <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts/tree/main/examples/integration-scripts">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts/tree/main/examples/integration-scripts</a>   Join the KERI Community! <p>To embark on your KERI journey, I recommend joining the KERI community. As of April 2024, there are three primary ways to&nbsp;engage:</p> Join the WebOfTrust Discord&nbsp;Channel <p>The WebOfTrust Discord channel is used for casual discussions and reminders for community meetings. You can join with the link&nbsp;below:</p>  <a href="https://discord.gg/YEyTH5TfuB">https://discord.gg/YEyTH5TfuB</a>.   Join the ToIP ACDC Task&nbsp;Force <p>The ACDC Task Force under the ToIP foundation focuses on the development of the KERI and related specifications.

<p>To foster innovation in fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), IBM® researchers have begun publishing challenges on the <a href="https://fherma.io/challenges">FHERMA platform</a> for FHE challenges launched in late 2023 by Fair Math and the OpenFHE community.</p>



 FHE: A new frontier in technology 



<p>Fully homomorphic encryption is a groundbreaking technology with immense potential. One of its notable applications lies in enhancing medical AI models. By enabling various research institutes to collaborate seamlessly in the training process, FHE opens doors to a new era of possibilities. The ability to process encrypted data without decryption marks a pivotal advancement, promising to revolutionize diverse fields.</p>



<p>IBM has been working to advance the domain of FHE for 15 years, since IBM Research scientist Craig Gentry introduced the first plausible fully homomorphic scheme in 2009. The “bootstrapping” mechanism he developed cleans and reduces the amount of “noise” in encoded information, which made possible the widespread use of FHE commercially.</p>



 Progress in FHE 



<p>FHE has experienced significant progress since the introduction of its first scheme. The transition from theoretical frameworks to practical implementations has been marked by countless issues that need to be addressed. While there are already applications that are using FHE, the community is constantly improving and innovating the algorithms to make FHE more popular and applicable to new domains.</p>



 Fostering innovation through challenges 



<p>The FHERMA platform was built to incentivize innovation in the FHE domain. Various challenges can be seen on the <a href="https://fherma.io/challenges">FHERMA site</a>. The challenges are motivated by problems encountered by real-world machine learning and blockchain applications.</p>



<p>Solutions to challenges must be written by using known cryptographic libraries such as openFHE. The developers can also use higher-level libraries such as IBM’s HElayers to speed up their development and easily write robust and generic code.</p>



<p>The best solutions to the various challenges will win cash prizes from Fair Math, alongside contributing to the FHE community. Winners will also be offered the opportunity to present their solutions in a special workshop currently being planned.</p>



<p>The goal of the challenges is to foster research, popularize FHE, and develop cryptographic primitives that are efficient, generic, and support different hyperparameters (for example, writing matrix multiplication that is efficient for matrices of dimensions 1000×1000 and 10×10). This aligns with IBM’s vision for privacy-preserving computation by using FHE.</p>



 Driving progress and adoption 



<p>Introducing and participating in challenges that are listed on the FHERMA site is an exciting and rewarding way to advance the extended adoption of FHE, while helping to move development and research in the domain forward. We hope you join us in this exciting endeavor on the <a href="https://fherma.io/challenges">FHERMA challenges platform</a>.</p>



<p>Teams and individuals who successfully solve the challenges will receive cash prizes from Fair Math. More importantly, the innovative solutions to the published challenges will help move the FHE community forward—a longstanding goal for IBM.</p>

In the case of certain specified transactions, VDASPs have to conduct enhanced due diligence (EDD) on their&nbsp;clients.</p><p>- In addition to identifying the customers, exchanges have to maintain records of updated client identification and transactions for up to five years after the business relationship between the two has ended or the account has been&nbsp;closed.</p><p>- VDASPs are also required to appoint a principal officer and a director who will be responsible for ensuring that the entity complies with rules. Their details, which include name, phone number, email ID, address, and designation, must be submitted to the Financial Intelligence Unit — India (FIU-IND).</p><p>Meanwhile, FIU’s guidelines further require VDASPs to conduct counterparty due diligence and have adequate employee screening procedures. These entities must also provide instruction manuals for onboarding, transaction processing, KYC, due diligence, transaction review, sanctions screening (which must be done when onboarding and transferring crypto), and record&nbsp;keeping.</p> ‍<br>Compliance Requirements <p>In line with global efforts to regulate crypto assets, the Indian government has introduced AML guidelines similar to those already followed by&nbsp;banks.</p><p>Per the guidelines, a designated service provider in India must have policies and procedures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. This includes verifying customer identity, for which VDASPs must obtain and hold certain information that must be made available to appropriate authorities on request. Moreover, this applies regardless of whether the value of the crypto transfer is denominated in fiat or another crypto.<br> <br>For the originating (sender) VDASP, the following information must be acquired and&nbsp;held:</p><p>- Originator’s full verified name.<br>- The Permanent Account Number (PAN) of the sending person.<br>- Originator’s wallet addresses used to process the transaction.<br>- Originator’s date and place of birth or their verified physical address.<br>- Beneficiary’s (receiver) name and wallet&nbsp;address.</p><p>For the beneficiary (receiver) VDASP, the following information must be acquired and&nbsp;held:</p><p>- Beneficiary’s verified name.<br>- Beneficiary’s wallet address used to process the transaction.<br>- Originator’s name<br>- Originator’s National Identity Number or Permanent Account Number (PAN).<br>- Originator’s wallet addresses and physical address or date and place of&nbsp;birth.</p><p>When it comes to reporting obligations, the entity must report any suspicious transactions within a week of identification. Reporting entities are further prohibited from disclosing or “tipping off” that a Suspicious Transactions Report (STR) is provided to the&nbsp;FIU-IND.</p><p>However, the minimum threshold for Travel Rule compliance is unclear, as the Indian government hasn’t mentioned it in the circular. However, a few Indian exchanges are requesting Travel Rule data for compliance even when the transaction amount is less than&nbsp;$1000.</p><p>Unfortunately, instead of adopting a fully automated, privacy-oriented, frictionless Travel Rule solution like <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Veriscope</a>, a few exchanges in India depend on manual methods to collect personally identifiable information from users (i.e., Google forms, emails,&nbsp;etc).</p><p>When it comes to unhosted or non-custodial wallets, the FIU classifies any crypto transfers made to and from them as “high risk” as they may not be hosted on an obligated entity such as an exchange. As per the guidelines, P2P transfers also fall into this category, given that one of the wallets is not&nbsp;hosted.</p><p>Hence, when crypto transfers are made between two wallets where at least one of them is a hosted wallet, the compliance responsibility falls on the entity where the wallet is&nbsp;hosted.</p><blockquote>“Additional limitations or controls may be put in place on such transfers with unhosted wallets,” according to FIU — IND.</blockquote> ‍<br>Concluding Thoughts <p>The implementation of the Crypto Travel Rule shows that India is gradually regulating the crypto sector and requiring businesses dealing with crypto to adhere to the same AML requirements as registered financial institutions like&nbsp;banks.</p><p>While it may lead to some short-term challenges, India’s crypto businesses believe this is expected to create a more trustworthy environment in the long&nbsp;run.</p> ‍<br>About Veriscope <p>‍<br>‍<a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">‍Veriscope</a>, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule. Enhanced by User Signing, it enables VASPs to directly request cryptographic proof from users’ non-custodial wallets, streamlining the compliance process.</p><p>For more information, visit our<a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope"> website</a> and<a href="https://www.shyft.network/contact"> contact</a> our team for a discussion.

<p>This blog series discusses the complex tasks energy utility companies face as they shift to holistic grid asset management to manage through the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/guides/business-operations/sustainably-accelerating-decarbonization/">energy transition</a>. The first post of this series addressed the challenges of the energy transition with holistic grid asset management. The second post in this series addressed the integrated asset management platform and data exchange that unite business disciplines in different domains in one network.</p>



 Breaking down traditional silos 



<p>Many utility asset management organizations work in silos. A holistic approach that combines the siloed processes and integrates various planning management systems provides optimization opportunities on three levels:</p>



 
 Asset portfolio (AIP) level: Optimum project execution schedule 



 Asset (APMO) level: Optimum maintenance and replacement timing 



 Spare part (MRO) level: Optimum spare parts holding level 
 



<p>The combined planning exercises produce budgets for capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx), and set minimum requirements for grid outages for the upcoming planning period, as shown in the following figure:</p>







<p>Asset investments are typically part of a grid planning department, which considers expansions, load studies, new customers and long-term grid requirements. Asset investment planning (AIP) tools bring value in optimizing various, sometimes conflicting, value drivers. They combine new asset investments with existing asset replacements. However, they follow different approaches to risk management by using a risk matrix to assess risk at the start of an optimization cycle. This top-down process is effective for new assets since no information about the assets is available. For existing assets, a more accurate bottom-up risk approach is available from the continuous health monitoring process. This process calculates the health index and the effective age based on the asset’s specific degradation curves. Dynamic health monitoring provides up-to-date risk data and accurate replacement timing, as opposed to the static approach used for AIP. Combining the asset performance management and optimization (APMO) and AIP processes uses this enhanced estimation data to optimize in real time.</p>



<p>Maintenance and project planning take place in operations departments. The APMO process generates an optimized work schedule for maintenance tasks over a project period and calculates the optimum replacement moment for an existing asset at the end of its lifetime. The maintenance management and project planning systems load these tasks for execution by field service departments.</p>



<p>On the maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) side, spare part optimization is linked to asset criticality. Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) defines maintenance strategies and associated spare holding strategies. The main parameters are optimizing for stock value, asset criticality and spare part ordering lead times.</p>



<p>Traditional planning processes focus on disparate planning cycles for new and existing assets in a top-down versus bottom-up asset planning approach. This approach leads to suboptimization. An integrated planning process breaks down the departmental silos with optimization engines at three levels. Optimized planning results in lower outages and system downtime, and it increases the efficient use of scarce resources and budget.</p>

How DePINs Can Disrupt Tech Monopolies and Put People Back in&nbsp;Control<p>Written by <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/chriswere">Chris Were</a> (Verida CEO &amp; Co-Founder), this article was originally published on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/37798095/how-depins-can-disrupt-tech-monopolies-and-put-people-back-in-control-chris-were">Bazinga</a>.</p><p>Decentralized Infrastructure Physical Networks — DePINs — have the potential to transform how we access and use real-world services.</p><p>Potential use cases are only restricted by your imagination.</p> What if…   Internet hotspots could be established in rural areas where there is little coverage?  Homeowners could be rewarded by selling excess solar energy back to the&nbsp;grid?  Consumers could share unused storage space on their devices with&nbsp;others?  Entrepreneurs could unlock peer-to-peer microloans to build local projects?  <p>Underpinned by blockchain technology, DePINs make all of this possible — at a time when the infrastructure powering the global economy is experiencing seismic change. Figures from Statista <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/">suggest</a> 33.8% of the world’s population don’t use the internet, with people in low-income countries most likely to be shut out of the modern information society. The International Energy Agency <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/approximately-100-million-households-rely-on-rooftop-solar-pv-by-2030">estimates</a> that 100 million households will depend on rooftop solar panels by 2030, and enhancing economic incentives will be a crucial catalyst for adoption. And let’s not forget that the rise of artificial intelligence means the need for storage and computation is booming, with McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/investing-in-the-rising-data-center-economy">projecting</a> demand for data centers will rise 10% a year between now and the end of the decade. DePINs have the power to cultivate a cloud storage network that’s much cheaper than traditional players including Google and&nbsp;Amazon.</p><p>DePINs mount a competitive challenge to the centralized providers who dominate the business landscape. Right now, most of the infrastructure we use every day is controlled by huge companies or governments. This creates a real risk of monopolies where a lack of choice pushes up prices for consumers and businesses — with the pursuit of profits stymying innovation and shutting out customers based on geography and&nbsp;income.</p> The need for&nbsp;change <p>Blockchains are at the beating heart of these decentralized networks. That’s because individuals and businesses who contribute physical infrastructure can be rewarded in crypto tokens that are automatically paid out through smart contracts. Consumers can also use digital assets to unlock services on&nbsp;demand.</p><p>This approach isn’t about modernizing access to infrastructure, but changing how it is managed, accessed and owned. Unlike centralized providers, the crypto tokens issued through DePINs incentivize all participants to get involved. Decentralized autonomous organizations (known as DAOs for short) play a vital role in establishing the framework for how these projects are managed. Digital assets can be used to vote on proposals ranging from planned network upgrades to where resources should be allocated. Whereas big businesses are motivated by profit, community-driven projects can focus on meeting the needs of underserved areas. The issuance of tokens can also provide the funding required to build infrastructure — and acquire the land, equipment and technical expertise needed to get an idea off the&nbsp;ground.</p><p>Web3 has been driven by a belief that internet users should have full control over their data, and tech giants should be stopped from monetizing personal information while giving nothing in return. DePINs align well with these values, all while reducing barriers to entry and ensuring there’s healthy competition. Multiple marketplaces for internet access, data storage and energy will result in much fairer prices for end users — and encourage rivals to innovate so they have compelling points of difference. It also means an entrepreneur with a deep understanding of what their community needs can start a business without large capital requirements. Open access and interoperability are the&nbsp;future.</p> Challenges on the&nbsp;road <p>Certain challenges must be overcome for DePINs to have a lasting global impact. There’s no denying that multibillion-dollar corporations currently benefit from economies of scale, vast user bases, and deep pockets. That’s why it’s incumbent on decentralized innovations to show why their approach is better. Reaching out to untapped markets that aren’t being served by business behemoths is a good first step. Another obstacle standing in the way of adoption concerns regulatory uncertainty, which can prevent investors and participants from getting involved. Careful thought also needs to be paid to the ramifications that DePINs can have on data privacy. Unless safeguards are imposed, someone who accesses an internet hotspot through blockchain technology could inadvertently disclose their particular location.</p><p>Ecosystems have been created that allow DePINs to be established while ensuring that user privacy is preserved at all times — championing data ownership and self-sovereignty. As well as reducing the risks surrounding identity theft, they have been built with the evolving nature of global regulation in mind — with measures such as GDPR in the EU forcing companies to rethink how much data they hold on their customers.</p> DePINs and the future of the&nbsp;internet <p>Zooming in on Europe as a use case, and how these regulatory headwinds will affect more than 400 million citizens on the continent, gives an invaluable insight into how DePINs — and the infrastructure they’re built on — can have an impact in the years to&nbsp;come.</p><p>For one, the current internet landscape means that we need to create a new digital identity every time we want to join a website or app — manually handing over personal information by filling out lengthy forms to open accounts. Users are then confronted by lengthy terms and conditions or privacy notices that often go unread, leaving people in the dark about how their data is going to be used in the future. That’s why the EU has proposed singular digital identities that could be used for multiple services — from “paying taxes to renting bicycles” — and change the dynamic about how confidential information is shared. This approach would mean that consumers are in the driving seat, and decide which counterparties have the right to learn more about who they&nbsp;are.</p><p>The European Union’s approach is ambitious and requires infrastructure that is fast, inexpensive and interoperable — allowing digital signatures, identity checks and credentials to be stored and executed securely across the trading bloc. Another element that must be thrown into the mix is central bank digital currencies, with the European Central Bank <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2023/html/ecb.pr231018~111a014ae7.en.html">spearheading</a> efforts to create an electronic form of the euro that is free to use and privacy preserving — all while enabling instant cross-border transactions with businesses, other consumers and governments.</p><p>High-performing and low-cost infrastructure will be essential if decentralized assets are going to be used by consumers across the continent — not to mention regulatory compliance. Privacy-focused wallets need to support multiple blockchains — as well as decentralized identities, verifiable credentials and data storage. A simple, user-friendly mobile application will be instrumental in guaranteeing that DePINs gain momentum.</p><p>The future is bright, and we’re yet to scratch the surface when it comes to the advantages decentralization can bring for all of us. But usability and efficiency are two key pillars that must be prioritized if this new wave of innovation is to match the unparalleled impact of the internet.</p> About Chris <p>Chris Were is the CEO of <a href="http://verida.io">Verida</a>, a decentralized, self-sovereign data network that empowers individuals to control their digital identity and personal data.

 Harnessing Zero-Knowledge Proofs for Secure Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>In the digital realm, where privacy and security are paramount, the concept of anonymous credentials presents a revolutionary approach to safeguarding personal data. This technology leverages the power of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP), enabling individuals to prove their identity or credentials without revealing any personal information. Let’s see if we can demystify anonymous credentials and ZKPs, and improve our understanding of their significance, how they work, and their potential to transform digital security and&nbsp;privacy.</p> Understanding Anonymous Credentials <p>Anonymous credentials are at the forefront of enhancing digital privacy and security. They serve as a digital counterpart to physical identification, allowing users to prove their identity or possession of certain attributes without disclosing the actual data. This method ensures that personal information remains private, reducing the risk of data breaches and misuse. Through the strategic use of cryptographic techniques, anonymous credentials empower individuals with control over their online identity, marking a significant leap toward a more secure digital&nbsp;world.</p> The Parties&nbsp;Involved <p>The ecosystem of anonymous credentials involves three critical parties: the issuer, the user (prover), and the verifier. The issuer is the authority that generates and assigns credentials to users. Users, or provers, possess these credentials and can prove their authenticity to verifiers without revealing the underlying information. Verifiers are entities that need to validate the user’s claims without accessing their private data. This tripartite model forms the foundation of a secure, privacy-preserving digital identification system.</p> Technical Background: The BBS+ Signature Scheme <p>At the heart of anonymous credentials lies the BBS+ signature scheme, a cryptographic protocol that enables the creation and verification of credentials. This scheme utilizes advanced mathematical constructs to ensure that credentials are tamper-proof and verifiable. While the underlying mathematics may be complex, the essence of the BBS+ scheme is its ability to facilitate secure, anonymous credentials that uphold the user’s privacy while ensuring their authenticity to verifiers.</p> Key Concepts Explained  Setup <p>The setup phase is crucial for establishing the cryptographic environment in which the BBS+ signature scheme operates. This involves defining the mathematical groups and functions that will be used to generate and verify signatures. It lays the groundwork for secure cryptographic operations, ensuring that the system is primed for issuing and managing anonymous credentials.</p> Key Generation (KeyGen) <p>In the KeyGen phase, unique cryptographic keys are created for each participant in the system. This process involves generating pairs of public and private keys that will be used to sign and verify credentials. The security of anonymous credentials heavily relies on the robustness of these keys, as they underpin the integrity of the entire&nbsp;system.</p> Signing and Verifying <p>Signing is the process by which issuers create digital signatures for credentials, effectively “stamping” them as authentic. Verifying, on the other hand, allows a verifier to check the validity of a credential’s signature without seeing the credential itself. This dual process ensures that credentials are both secure and privacy-preserving.</p> Non-Interactive Proof of Knowledge (PoK) <p>The Non-Interactive Proof of Knowledge (PoK) protocol is a cryptographic technique that allows a prover to demonstrate knowledge of a secret without revealing it. In the context of anonymous credentials, it enables users to prove possession of valid credentials without disclosing the credentials themselves. This non-interactive aspect ensures a smooth, privacy-centric verification process.</p> The Process in&nbsp;Action  Issuer’s Key Pair&nbsp;Setup <p>The journey begins with the issuer’s key pair setup, where the issuer generates a pair of cryptographic keys based on the attributes to be included in the credentials. This setup is critical for creating credentials that are both secure and capable of supporting the non-interactive proof of knowledge protocol.</p> Issuance Protocol <p>The issuance protocol is an interactive process where the issuer and user exchange information to generate a valid credential. This involves the user creating a credential request, the issuer verifying this request, and then issuing the credential if the request is valid. This step is vital for ensuring that only legitimate users receive credentials.</p> Generating a Credential Request <p>To request a credential, users generate a credential request that includes a commitment to their secret key and a zero-knowledge proof of this secret. This request is sent to the issuer, who will then verify its authenticity before issuing the credential. This process ensures that the user’s identity remains anonymous while their credential request is being processed.</p> Issuing a Credential <p>Upon receiving a valid credential request, the issuer generates the credential using their private key. This credential is then sent back to the user, completing the issuance process. The credential includes a digital signature, attribute values, and a unique identifier, all encrypted to protect the user’s&nbsp;privacy.</p> Presentation Protocol <p>When users need to prove possession of a credential, they engage in the presentation protocol. This involves generating a proof of possession that selectively discloses certain attributes of the credential while keeping others hidden. The verifier can then confirm the credential’s validity without learning any additional information about the user or the undisclosed attributes.</p> Use Cases and Applications <p>Anonymous credentials are not just a theoretical construct; they have practical applications that can transform various industries by enhancing privacy and security. For instance, in healthcare, patients can verify their eligibility for services without revealing sensitive health information. In the digital realm, users can prove their age, nationality, or membership status without disclosing their full identity, opening doors for secure, privacy-focused online transactions and interactions. Governments can implement anonymous credential systems for digital identities, allowing citizens to access services with ease while protecting their personal data. These applications demonstrate the versatility and transformative potential of anonymous credentials in creating a more secure and private digital&nbsp;world.</p> Challenges and Considerations <p>While anonymous credentials offer significant benefits, their implementation is not without challenges. Technical complexity and the need for widespread adoption across various platforms and services can hinder their immediate integration into existing systems. Moreover, ethical considerations arise regarding the potential for misuse, such as creating undetectable false identities. Therefore, deploying anonymous credentials requires careful planning, clear regulatory frameworks, and ongoing dialogue between technology developers, users, and regulatory bodies to ensure they are used ethically and effectively.</p> Closing Thoughts <p>Anonymous credentials and zero-knowledge proofs represent a significant advancement in digital privacy and security. By allowing users to verify their credentials without revealing personal information, they pave the way for a more secure and private online world. While challenges remain, the potential of these technologies to transform how we think about identity and privacy in the digital age is undeniable. As we continue to explore and implement these solutions, we move closer to achieving a balance between security and privacy in our increasingly digital&nbsp;lives.</p><p>The journey towards a more private and secure digital identity is ongoing, and anonymous credentials play a crucial role in this evolution. We encourage readers to explore further, engage in discussions, and contribute to projects that aim to implement these technologies. By fostering a community of informed individuals and organizations committed to enhancing digital privacy, we can collectively drive the adoption of anonymous credentials and shape the future of online security and identity management. Together, let’s build a digital world where privacy is a right, not an&nbsp;option.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/empowering-privacy-with-anonymous-credentials-2881d616b16b">Empowering Privacy with Anonymous Credentials</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Pete Corke's love for nature, nurtured through his walks in the coastal rainforests of British Columbia, Canada, inspired him to find ways to invest in the preservation of these precious ecosystems. </p><p>As the Director of Vision &amp; Leadership at <a href="http://www.kwaxala.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kwaxala</a>, an Indigenous-led and majority owned organization focused on protecting at-risk forests, Pete brings a unique perspective to the challenges and opportunities of creating a regenerative economic system.</p><p>With a background spanning technology, brand marketing, and supply chain management, Pete recognized that traditional conservation methods often left local economies poorer, relying heavily on philanthropy and government programs. He saw the need for a new approach that could generate sustainable economic value while protecting the environment.</p><p>Regenerative economics offers a solution by providing a for-profit orientation to conservation, benefiting communities and promoting biodiversity. However, accounting for the value of ecosystem services and ensuring the reliability of carbon credit markets can be complex. This is where Web3 technologies play a crucial role, providing tools to create transparency, trust, and custom solutions for documenting nature's value and connecting it to global markets.</p> Problems With the Current Extractive Economic System&nbsp; <p></p><p>The current economic system primarily focuses on removing resources from the earth — creating a world that often overlooks the value of living nature.</p><p>As Pete Corke explains, "Living nature isn't represented in [our economy]. It's all dead and extracted from nature. And in fact, the only way of creating value-flows from the current system into protected nature is by literally burning the transactional medium, burning money through philanthropy."</p><p>In other words, the current economic system only recognizes the value of nature when it is extracted and sold, and the only way to direct money towards conservation is through philanthropic donations, which do not generate any economic returns or retain asset value.</p><p>This approach has led to a lack of ways to recognize the value of ecosystems and the services they provide. Remote communities, like those in British Columbia, Canada, face a tough choice between participating in the resource extraction that makes up most of the local economy or supporting conservation efforts that often lack economic incentives.</p><p>Additionally, the established laws and structures around land use are deeply rooted in this resource-focused economic system, making it difficult to create change. So how can one aim to operate within the current structure and transform the economics?</p><p>Pete emphasizes that "Traditional conservation makes British Columbia poorer. It's giving up tax revenues, it's giving up export revenues. And that's at a provincial level. At a local level, they're giving up jobs in remote communities."</p><p>The extractive industry's control over these structures poses a significant challenge to those seeking to create a regenerative economic system. As Pete points out, "It's not about replacing extractive economics. It's about creating an economic counterbalance to it."</p><p>Achieving this balance requires not only developing new economic models but also navigating complex laws and governance frameworks that have long prioritized resource extraction over regeneration.</p> Opportunities for Regenerative Economics <p></p><p>Despite the challenges posed by the current extractive economic system, there are significant opportunities for regenerative economics to create a counterbalance. Specifically, regenerative economics would be creating incentive-based conservation efforts that spur economic growth while protecting nature.</p><p>As Pete Corke explains, "The whole point of the regenerative economics space is, hey, we need a two polled [economic] world here to create a counterbalance."</p><p>One key opportunity lies in generating value flows to conserve natural areas and the local communities that support these ecosystems. Pete emphasizes the importance of creating "an economic activity that's based on regeneration [which] counteracts extractive economic value."&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www.kwaxala.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kwaxala</a> is building a global network of protected forest areas that, at scale, generate economic markets for natural systems. Their projects demonstrate on-going returns for both forest communities and mindful investors.&nbsp;</p><p>Most resource extraction happens on public lands, with companies buying the rights (to log, mine, or drill for oil) that give them use of that land. By buying these rights and safeguarding them, managing the land appropriately, and documenting the revitalization of these ecosystems, it’s possible to demonstrate the value of conservation in a global market.&nbsp;</p><p>These thriving ecosystems provide numerous benefits to the people, industries, and municipalities who interact with them. They clean the air and water, offer mental health benefits to individuals, provide educational opportunities and recreational spaces for children, and attract tourism to communities.&nbsp;</p><p>This only scratches the surface of the economic and social benefits of rich, site specific ecosystems, on both local and global levels, but we don’t have great ways to account for these benefits within our economy. One market tool is high quality carbon credits, which can be produced through the act of conservation to start accounting for these benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>By developing mechanisms that allow individuals and businesses to invest in and hold value in living natural assets, regenerative economics can provide a viable alternative to extractive industries. Whilst carbon offsets and biodiversity credits represent an economic mechanism for recognising the services provided by nature, there are very few mechanisms that enable you to hold equity/investment value in the supply side of that value flow. But that is changing and Kwaxala is leading in that space.</p> The Next Economic Mechanism <p></p><p>Web3 tools, such as blockchain and smart contracts, offer promising solutions for creating transparency, provenance, and liquidity in regenerative economic systems.&nbsp;</p><p>As Pete points out, "Web3 is so powerful because we're not trying to just build regenerative products, we're trying to build an entire regenerative stack and entire economic ecosystem that counterbalances the extractive ecosystem."</p><p>These tools enable the creation of new financial products and value flows that can be quickly prototyped and scaled, providing a more efficient means of realizing the potential of regenerative economics.&nbsp;</p><p>Web3 technologies can help ensure the authenticity and on-the-ground truth of regenerative assets, such as carbon offsets, by embedding due diligence and provenance information directly into the digital tokens representing these assets.&nbsp;</p><p>These technologies also allow transparent value redistribution back into the communities on the ground, ensuring that the regenerative economy is built from the foundations up in a far more equitable way than the extractive/colonial economy ever was.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, the success of regenerative economics hinges on shifting mindsets and creating a new paradigm that recognizes the inherent value of nature. As Pete states, "Nature doesn't just need a seat at the economic table, we need to acknowledge that it is the table and it's also the air in the room! The human economic system is a subsidiary of the natural economic system."</p><p>As the world faces mounting environmental challenges, the need for a regenerative economic system has never been more pressing. Pete Corke and Kwaxala's work in partnering with Indigenous communities, protecting at-risk forests, and generating regenerative returns through innovative financial mechanisms that allow anybody to hold equity value in a living forest serves as a powerful example of how we can begin to create a true counterbalance to the extractive economy.</p><p>By leveraging Web3 tools such as Holochain, regenerative projects can create a trustworthy data layer that ensures transparency and trust in regenerative economic systems. Holochain's architecture allows for the distributed storage and processing of vast amounts of data, essential for documenting ecosystem interactions and ensuring the integrity of regenerative assets.</p><p>Centralized solutions have often proved untrustworthy, with instances of carbon credit markets failing to deliver on their promises due to lack of oversight and accountability. These examples highlight the need for trustable solutions that provide transparent, verifiable, and tamper-proof records of regenerative assets and their associated impacts. Holochain's distributed data layer creates a system resistant to manipulation and greenwashing, ensuring the value generated by regenerative economics is genuine and long-lasting.</p><p>Recognizing the intrinsic worth of healthy ecosystems can create a new economic paradigm that prioritizes the well-being of both human communities and the natural world. The path forward requires collaboration, innovation, and a willingness to challenge entrenched structures. </p>

			 Fedor Bolotnov is QA&nbsp;Engineer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself! 
<p>Hi, my name is Fedor, and I’m a QA Engineer at Tokeny. I prefer the QA Engineer position over Tester because QA involves more than just testing. While testing is a significant aspect, QA also encompasses communication, processes, and creating an error-prone environment.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Before joining Tokeny, I held various QA roles, ranging from QA to Team Lead, in several companies in Russia. However, in 2022, I unexpectedly relocated to Spain and had to restart my QA career.</p>
<p>The concept of revolutionizing the traditional finance sector intrigued me, prompting my decision to join Tokeny. As a QA professional, part of my role involves “ruining” someone else’s code, but only to enhance its quality and resilience. Essentially, we strive to challenge the current system to pave the way for a newer and superior one.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Fun, educational, and collaborative. With a diverse team, each member brings their unique life and career experiences and expertise, fostering continuous learning and knowledge sharing every day.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Sleep, haha! I cherish a good 10-11 hours at least once a week. But on a serious note, learning something new is what really motivates me to get out of bed every morning. Of course, I also adore spending time with my wife and our cat (fortunately, she can’t read, so she won’t find out she’s second on the list!). Additionally, I’m a bit obsessed with sports, both playing and watching American football.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>To borrow from Archimedes: “Give me a point that is firm and immovable, and I will fall asleep.” So, I don’t have a single ultimate dream, but rather an endless list of tasks to accomplish to ensure my family’s happiness.</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>Don’t be afraid to experiment and never give up.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>The borderlessness of it all. It opens up endless possibilities beyond any limits we can currently dream or imagine.</p>

<p>This is the transcript to my <a href="https://youtu.be/1eX7_3sqLxM">YouTube explainer video</a> on why privacy and personalization are so hard to balance. Likes and subscriptions are always welcome!</p>



<p>Welcome to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheDigitalCowNetwork">Digital Cow Network</a>! I’m your host, Heather Flanagan. In today’s explainer, we’re going to look at some of the challenges of balancing privacy with the desire for personalization on the web. This is important because the standards and regulations under development today are trying to do this, too.&nbsp; Sneak preview: asking for user consent is not particularly helpful here. Think of it as necessary but not sufficient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we surf the web, we want to see more of what’s of interest to us, and we also want to know that our privacy is being protected. Let’s look at this dichotomy—the desire for privacy versus the desire for personalization—that’s at the heart of our digital lives. How much are we willing to share for a tailored online experience?</p>



 The Personalization Phenomenon 



<p>Personalization is everywhere – from your social media feed to shopping recommendations. Millennials and Gen Z in particular expect a level of personalization that older generations aren’t quite used to. But ever wondered how it works? Websites and apps collect data about our preferences, activities, and more to create a custom experience. Sometimes that is as simple as optimizing for whatever web browser you use (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or something else). Other times it’s a lot more invasive.</p>



 The Data Behind Personalization 



<p>Let’s break down the data journey. It starts with what you click, what you search, and even how long you linger on a page. This data forms a digital profile, which then guides the content you see.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s where the magic of Real-Time Bidding comes in! Real-time bidding only works because the Internet is blindingly fast for most, especially compared to the days of old-school dial-up connections. It works like this:&nbsp;</p>



 
 You visit a website.&nbsp; 



 The website has a space on it for an ad.&nbsp; 



 That space includes a piece of code that says “go to this ad exchange network, and take information about this website AND information about the user (either via cookies, or their browser fingerprint) AND the physical location of the user because their device probably knows that and send it all to the ad exchange.”&nbsp; 



 The ad exchange has a list of advertisers who have preloaded information on what they’re willing to pay to promote their ad based on specific criteria about the website, the user, and even who the user is physically close to.&nbsp; 



 The ad exchanger immediately figures out who wins the auction and returns the winning ad to be embedded in the website.&nbsp; 
 



<p>All this takes milliseconds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Real-time bidding: the Internet is fast enough to stream movies… and to collect information about you, where you are, what you’re looking at, and even where you focus your attention on the screen in real-time.</p>



 Privacy in the Personalized World&nbsp; 



<p>And there’s the catch: this level of personalization requires access to a lot of personal data. That’s where privacy concerns come in. How do companies ensure our data is safe? How much control do we have over what’s collected?</p>



<p>Thanks to laws and regulations like the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), individuals do have some ability to control this flow of information. For example, there are cookie banners on many websites that are supposed to let you decide what type of information you’re willing to share. There are also authenticated ids for when an individual has logged in and provided consent to be tracked. Google’s Privacy Sandbox has several mechanisms they’re testing out, like the Protected Audience API and the Topics API to help with ethical advertising.</p>



 Navigating the Trade-offs 



<p>But ultimately, accommodating privacy, personalization, and legal requirements around both is a trade-off, both for advertisers and for individuals. Personalization can make people’s online life more convenient and enjoyable. The increase in regulatory pressure, though, means that every entity involved in serving up a website and its associated ads to an individual needs to be a part of the consent process. It’s a barrage of “are you ok with us collecting data? How about now? Is now ok? What about over here? And here? And here, too?” This is a terrible user experience.</p>



 Best Practices for Users and Developers&nbsp; 



<p>So, what can we do? For individuals, it’s about making informed choices, understanding privacy settings, and being patient with the barrage of consent requests. For developers, the challenge is to respect user privacy while providing value. This is all still a very new space, which is why there is so much activity within the W3C and the browser vendors to find a path forward that satisfies the business requirements while still keeping on the right side of privacy law. The best thing organizations that are in the business of benefiting from tracking need to get involved in the standards process to test out those APIs under development and offer feedback the API developers can use.&nbsp;</p>



 Wrap Up: The Future of Privacy and Personalization&nbsp; 



<p>Looking ahead, the landscape is ever-evolving. New technologies, stricter privacy laws, and changing user attitudes are reshaping this balance. If you’re looking at the One True Way for your business to thread this needle, I’m afraid you’ve still got some waiting around to do. The browser vendors are trying different things at the same time lawyers are trying to find different ways to interpret the legal requirements into technical requirements. If it were easy, it would have been solved already.</p>

None of this would have been possible without the valuable collaboration of various partners in Stuttgart: Bernd Junge, Clemens Hartmann, Ekkehard Schäfer, Elisabeth Bender, Fridtjof Harwardt, Hauke Diederich, Holger Wemmer, Jan Kohlmeyer, Johannes Wolff, Juliane Rausch, Katja Siegmann, Niels Barth, Sophie Mok, Sven Baumstark.</p><p>TreesAI Stuttgart is cofunded by Stuttgarter Klima-Innovationsfonds and The Nature Conservancy</p> (1) Introduction <p>Since 2023, TreesAI has been working in Stuttgart, Germany, after successfully applying to the nature-based solutions funding line by the Stuttgarter Klima-Innovationsfonds and The Nature Conservancy.</p><p>TreesAI is being implemented in partnership with several city departments and municipal facilities: the Stuttgart climate protection unit, the urban planning department, the civic engineering office, the health department, the tree management teams for city trees, and trees on state premises.</p><p>The project kicked off in September 2023 with an in-person, cross-divisional workshop with all involved city departments in Stuttgart to align on project&nbsp;goals.</p><p>Two key goals came out of the workshop. The first one was around the quantification of benefits trees provide — for which Stuttgart is using <a href="https://gus.earth/">GUS</a> which is essentially a comprehensive, AI-powered platform created to support stakeholders in forestation projects. It accommodates various forest types, scales, and geographic locations, maintaining scientific rigour with its peer-reviewed framework. GUS is now being developed and maintained by Lucidminds.</p><p>The second goal, which is this blog's focus, was to synthesise existing data to support decision-making around the location and prioritisation of projects. In this blog, we share our experience to date of working with the city departments through a co-created process of scoring projects through their location — what we call “Location-Based Scoring”</p><blockquote>TreesAI Location-based Scoring (LBS) provides an overlay and weighting process of location-based vulnerabilities to climate risks in the city — like heavy rainfall hazards, air pollution and heat islands — and helps decision-makers assess the most effective locations for maintaining and increasing green infrastructure to mitigate climate risk across the&nbsp;city.</blockquote>Part of our TreesAI team in Stuttgart, where we went on excursions with Clemens Hartmann (center) and Fridtjof Harwardt (not in the picture) to the Stuttgart Schloßgarten, Rosensteinpark and Europaviertel on the topic of tree&nbsp;care. How can Location-Based Scoring (LBS) be used to make the case for urban&nbsp;nature? <p>The LBS methodology applied in Stuttgart is a tool designed by TreesAI to perform a risk-based vulnerability assessment. This helps to evaluate how patterns of risks and potential benefits on natural and human systems are shifting due to climate&nbsp;change.</p><p>Climate risks result from an interplay between hazards, stress factors, exposure and vulnerability. Vulnerability is special in that it is not only determined by the sensitivity to damage yet also by the coping capacity to deal with&nbsp;it.</p><p>The overall aim of this analysis was to facilitate an understanding of:</p>  Hazard-Exposure relationships of climate change in the local&nbsp;context.  Identify geographical hotspots that lack green in relation to their level of risk and potential.  Consolidate compound site factors — including population density, surface water flooding risk, heat island effect, air pollution concentration, site accessibility — into a single overall location-based score.  <p>For this purpose, the LBS methodology involves developing a risk score for geographical areas based on the different focus areas in Stuttgart, and it is a methodology adapted from the “Impact and Vulnerability Analysis of Vital Infrastructures and built-up Areas Guideline” (<a href="https://resin-cities.eu/resources/ivavia/">IVAVIA</a>) (Resin, 2018) that is based on the concepts of risks defined by the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report.</p><blockquote>LBS reveals which areas would highly benefit from specific Nature-based Solution typologies to increase their coping capacity to climate risks in the&nbsp;city.</blockquote>Nature’s gifts aren’t always in plain sight: while maintenance, and increasing tree survival is essential, this image of a dead tree actually hides an important biodiversity habitat (2) The story so&nbsp;far  Scoping assessment in Stuttgart: defining focus climate&nbsp;themes <p>The first step of the onboarding process for Stuttgart was the definition of the most pressing risks in the city’s local context that NbS could help mitigate and adapt, which could also damage green infrastructure. In other words, this step was about defining the hazards and exposed assets or systems for assessing risks in the city of Stuttgart. Therefore, the TreesAI team, in partnership with the involved city departments and municipal facilities, jointly crystalised the following five hazard-exposure relationships:</p>  Heat Risk on Population Health  Drought Risk on Green Infrastructure  Air Pollution Risk on Population Health  Surface Water Flooding Risk on Built-up&nbsp;Areas  Surface Water Flooding Risk on Transport Network  <p>For each hazard-exposure combination, an impact chain was crafted. These impact chains describe the cause-and-effect dynamics between hazard and exposure components. Subsequently, indicators were established to delineate the three primary facets for assessing climate risk: hazard, exposure, and vulnerability, which includes coping mechanisms and sensitivity. Each of the five impact chains and the selection of these indicators were guided by the data available in Stuttgart and, crucially, by co-creation workshops and interviews with experts, policymakers and through scientific research.</p><p>Given that LBS focuses on spatial analysis to rank NbS according to their necessity gathering spatial data on pertinent urban indicators was an essential stage of this partnership with the city. The team secured a variety of inventory data from the city alongisde open-source satellite data, encompassing aspects like population density, surface water flooding risk, urban heat island effect, the extent of impermeable surfaces in built-up areas, and a tree register. These data sets were then synthesized using the TreesAI LBS methodical approach.</p><p>An impact chain diagram shows the relationship between these components. Below is an example of the impact chain diagram developed for Stuttgart to visualise the factors needed to evaluate the impact of heat (hazard) on population health (exposure)</p>Schematic diagram of indicators used in LBS, at the example of a heat-to-population impact&nbsp;chain. Scoring the city according to NbS potential to mitigate&nbsp;risks <p>After gathering all the necessary data and establishing the analysis resolution, initially set as a 500x500m grid, we processed all data to fit this spatial framework using GIS software. This processing allowed us to compute a location score for each spatial unit by calculating the various indicators of risk components in the LBS Modeling. This calculation involved weighting, normalizing, and aggregating the different indicators.</p><p>The weighting of indicators enabled us to prioritize among risk components, such as hazards, vulnerabilities, and exposures. In the case of Stuttgart, the assignment of weights to these indicators was achieved through collaborative workshops with the city’s municipal departments. Each workshop focused on a specific impact chain, gathering representatives from departments relevant to the climate theme under discussion. For example, in the workshop addressing the risk of drought to green infrastructure, the attendees included experts and stakeholders directly involved in this area, including the Stuttgart tree management teams for city trees as well as trees on state premises, the Stuttgart climate protection unit and the Stuttgart urban planning department.</p><p>During these sessions, we presented all the indicators, and participants allocated points based on their perception of the indicators’ importance and relevance to reflect the level of&nbsp;risk.</p> User Interface <p>To present the results of the LBS in spatial data, maps are produced using a Geographical Information System (GIS) and a web-based interface is developed to provide an interactive dashboard geared to the needs of the city of Stuttgart.</p><p>Maps can effectively present geographical comparisons of climate damage in the city for either spatial unit. Charts can also illustrate the combined risks of one hazard or show the risks of one impact chain in the&nbsp;city.</p><p>The platform features two approaches for the spatial analysis (a) “Explore the risk of a location” and (b) “Find locations (with characteristic X)”.</p><p>The dashboard function “Explore the risk of a location” analyses each (project) location in the Stuttgart city area preferred by users, supported by an address field input and zoom function.</p>Screenshots of the platform: “Explore specific risk &amp; NbS adaptation potential of a location” on the left, “Find locations with characteristic X” on the&nbsp;right (3) What comes&nbsp;next <p>Now that we have the platform for Stuttgart, there are various opportunities for the municipality to choose to use the results to support decision-making and enable more effective development, maintenance, and monitoring of&nbsp;NbS.</p>  Guide the location of NbS by identifying areas susceptible to climate risks. LBS can potentially connect different urban structures with specific Nature-Based Solution (NBS) types, optimizing resilience strategies tailored to distinct risk profiles.  Guide the design of NbS by pointing out the location's risk profile, for example, choosing SuDS-enabled trees in areas of flood&nbsp;risk.  Guide the development of maintenance schedules, as LBS can highlight areas where existing trees are at higher risk of drought or pests due to factors like soil conditions, urban heat islands, or insufficient care.  Guide policy by providing data to policymakers for creating and implementing environmental regulations based on spatial&nbsp;risks.  <p>Beyond this, we are exploring how LBS could be linked to ecosystem valuation tools to support a more radical and collaborative approach to delivering and financing urban forestry, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Raising private capital as outcome payments for the benefits provided by&nbsp;trees.  Supporting private land-owners to contribute to risk mitigation through nature-based adaptation.  Assist utility companies and infrastructure developers in choosing optimal locations for integrating green infrastructure in their locations.  Integrate LBS into real estate databases or insurance risk assessment models  Repurposing budgets from preventive health initiatives to fund&nbsp;NBS  <p>If you are based in Stuttgart and want to get involved, or if you are from another city and want to find out more, don’t hesitate to get in touch at: <a href="mailto:treesai@darkmatterlabs.org">treesai@darkmatterlabs.org</a></p><p>TreesAI LBS in Stuttgart: Sebastian Klemm, Chloe Treger, Sofia Valentini, Gurden&nbsp;Batra</p><p>GUS in Stuttgart: Oguzhan Yayla, Bulent Ozel, Cynthia Mergel and Jake Doran<br><br>Platform Design &amp; Code: Arianna Smaron, Alessandra Puricelli, Gurden&nbsp;Batra</p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/treesai-is-implementing-location-based-scoring-in-stuttgart-c54c752bdaaf">TreesAI is implementing location-based scoring in Stuttgart</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Bem-vindo ao aplicativo Bluesky! Este é um guia do usuário que responde a algumas perguntas comuns.</p>
<p>Para perguntas gerais sobre a empresa Bluesky, por favor, visite nosso FAQ <a>aqui</a>.</p>
 Entrando no Bluesky 
<p>Como faço para me juntar ao Bluesky?</p>
<p>Você pode criar uma conta em <a href="https://bsky.app/">bsky.app</a>. (Não é necessário código de convite!)</p>
<p>Você pode baixar o aplicativo Bluesky para <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bluesky-social/id6444370199">iOS</a> ou <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.blueskyweb.app&amp;hl=en_US">Google Play</a>, ou usar o Bluesky via <a href="https://bsky.app/">desktop</a>.</p>
 Moderação 
<p>Qual é a abordagem do Bluesky para a moderação?</p>
<p>A moderação é uma parte fundamental das redes sociais. No Bluesky, estamos investindo em segurança de duas formas. Primeiro, construímos nossa própria equipe de moderação dedicada a fornecer cobertura contínua para manter nossas diretrizes comunitárias. Além disso, reconhecemos que não existe uma abordagem única para a moderação — nenhuma empresa pode garantir a segurança online corretamente para todos os países, culturas e comunidades do mundo. Portanto, também estamos construindo algo maior — um ecossistema de moderação e ferramentas de segurança de código aberto que dá às comunidades o poder de criar seus próprios espaços, com suas próprias normas e preferências. Ainda assim, usar o Bluesky é familiar e intuitivo. É um aplicativo simples à primeira vista, mas por baixo do capô, habilitamos uma verdadeira inovação e competição nas mídias sociais ao construir um novo tipo de rede aberta.</p>
<p>Você pode ler mais sobre nossa abordagem para moderação <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation">aqui</a>.</p>
<p>O que a função de silenciar faz?</p>
<p>Silenciar impede que você veja quaisquer notificações ou postagens principais de uma conta. Se eles responderem a um tópico, você verá uma seção que diz "Postagem de uma conta que você silenciou" com uma opção para mostrar a postagem. A conta não saberá que foi silenciada.</p>
<p>O que o bloqueio faz?</p>
<p>O bloqueio impede a interação. Quando você bloqueia uma conta, tanto você quanto a outra conta não poderão mais ver ou interagir com as postagens uma da outra.</p>
<p>Como eu denuncio abuso?</p>
<p>Você pode denunciar postagens clicando no menu de três pontos. Você também pode denunciar uma conta inteira visitando o perfil dela e clicando no menu de três pontos lá.</p>
<p>Onde posso ler mais sobre seus planos para moderação?</p>
<p>Você pode ler mais sobre nossa abordagem para moderação <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation">aqui</a>.</p>
 Feeds Personalizados 
<p>O que são feeds personalizados?</p>
<p>Feeds personalizados é um recurso no Bluesky que permite escolher o algoritmo que define sua experiência nas mídias sociais. Imagine querer que sua linha do tempo exiba apenas postagens dos seus contatos mútuos, ou apenas postagens com fotos de gatos, ou somente postagens relacionadas a esportes — você pode simplesmente selecionar seu feed preferido de um mercado aberto.</p>
<p>Para os usuários, a capacidade de personalizar seu feed devolve o controle de sua atenção para si mesmos. Para os desenvolvedores, um mercado aberto de feeds proporciona a liberdade de experimentar e publicar algoritmos que qualquer um pode usar.</p>
<p>Por exemplo, experimente <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:z72i7hdynmk6r22z27h6tvur/feed/hot-classic">este feed</a>.</p>
<p>Você pode ler mais sobre feeds personalizados e escolha algorítmica em nosso <a>post no blog aqui</a>.</p>
<p>Como eu uso feeds personalizados?</p>
<p>No Bluesky, clique no ícone de hashtag na parte inferior do aplicativo. A partir daí, você pode adicionar e descobrir novos feeds. Você também pode explorar diretamente os feeds através <a href="https://bsky.app/feeds">deste link</a>.</p>
<p>Como posso criar um feed personalizado?</p>
<p>Desenvolvedores podem usar nosso <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/feed-generator">kit inicial de gerador de feeds</a> para criar um feed personalizado. Eventualmente, forneceremos ferramentas melhores para que qualquer pessoa, incluindo não desenvolvedores, possa construir feeds personalizados.</p>
<p>Além disso, <a href="https://skyfeed.app/">SkyFeed</a> é uma ferramenta criada por um desenvolvedor independente que possui um recurso de Construtor de Feeds que você pode usar.</p>
 Domínios Personalizados 
<p>Como posso configurar meu domínio como meu identificador?</p>
<p>Por favor, consulte nosso tutorial <a>aqui</a>.</p>
<p>Posso comprar um domínio diretamente pelo Bluesky?</p>
<p>Sim, você pode comprar um domínio e definí-lo como seu nome de usuário pelo Bluesky <a href="https://account.bsky.app/">aqui</a>.</p>
 Privacidade de Dados 
<p>O que é público e o que é privado no Bluesky?</p>
<p>O Bluesky é uma rede social pública. Pense nas suas postagens como postagens de blog – qualquer pessoa na web pode vê-las, mesmo aquelas sem um código de convite. Um código de convite simplesmente concede acesso ao serviço que estamos executando e que permite publicar uma postagem você mesmo. (Desenvolvedores familiarizados com a API podem ver todas as postagens, independentemente de terem ou não uma conta própria.)</p>
<p>Especificamente:</p>
 
 Postagens e curtidas são públicas. 
 Bloqueios são públicos. 
 Silenciamentos são privados, mas as listas de silenciamento são listas públicas. Suas assinaturas de lista de silenciamento são privadas. 
 
<p>Por que minhas postagens, curtidas e bloqueios são públicos?</p>
<p>O Protocolo AT, no qual o Bluesky é construído, foi projetado para suportar conversas públicas. Para tornar as conversas públicas portáteis em todos os tipos de plataformas, seus dados são armazenados em repositórios de dados que qualquer pessoa pode visualizar. Isso significa que, independentemente de qual servidor você escolher para se juntar, você ainda poderá ver postagens em toda a rede, e se escolher mudar de servidor, poderá facilmente levar todos os seus dados com você. É isso que faz com que a experiência do usuário do Bluesky, um protocolo federado, seja semelhante a todos os outros aplicativos de mídia social que você usou antes.</p>
<p>Posso definir meu perfil para ser privado?</p>
<p>Atualmente, não existem perfis privados no Bluesky.</p>
<p>O que acontece quando eu excluo uma postagem?</p>
<p>Depois de excluir uma postagem, ela será imediatamente removida do aplicativo voltado para o usuário. Qualquer imagem anexada à sua postagem também será imediatamente excluída em nosso armazenamento de dados.</p>
<p>No entanto, leva um pouco mais de tempo para o conteúdo de texto de uma postagem ser completamente excluído no armazenamento. O conteúdo do texto é armazenado de forma não legível, mas é possível consultar os dados via API. Realizaremos periodicamente exclusões no back-end para apagar completamente esses dados.</p>
<p>Posso obter uma cópia de todos os meus dados?</p>
<p>Sim — o Protocolo AT mantém os dados do usuário em um <a href="https://github.com/web3-storage/ipfs-car">arquivo endereçado por conteúdo</a>. Este arquivo pode ser usado para migrar dados de conta entre servidores. Para desenvolvedores, você pode usar <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/blob/main/lexicons/com/atproto/sync/getRepo.json">este método</a> para exportar uma cópia do seu repositório. Para não desenvolvedores, as ferramentas ainda estão sendo construídas para facilitar.</p>

<p>Vocês implementarão autenticação de dois fatores (2FA)?</p>
<p>Sim, a implementação da 2FA está em nosso plano de desenvolvimento a curto prazo.</p>
 Bluesky, o Protocolo AT e Federação 
<p>Qual a diferença entre Bluesky e o Protocolo AT?</p>
<p>Bluesky, a empresa de benefício público, está desenvolvendo dois produtos: o <a href="https://atproto.com/">Protocolo AT</a>, e o aplicativo de microblogging Bluesky. O aplicativo Bluesky tem como objetivo demonstrar as funcionalidades do protocolo subjacente. O Protocolo AT é construído para suportar um ecossistema inteiro de aplicativos sociais que vai além do microblogging.</p>
<p>Você pode ler mais sobre as diferenças entre Bluesky e o Protocolo AT em nosso FAQ geral <a>aqui</a>.</p>
<p>Como a federação me afeta, como usuário do aplicativo Bluesky?</p>
<p>Estamos priorizando a experiência do usuário e queremos tornar o Bluesky o mais amigável possível. Independentemente de qual servidor você se juntar, você pode ver postagens de pessoas em outros servidores e levar seus dados com você se escolher mudar de servidor.</p>
<p>O Bluesky é construído em uma blockchain? Ele usa criptomoeda?</p>
<p>Não e não.</p>
<p>O Bluesky suporta domínios Handshake (HNS)?</p>
<p>Não, e não há planos para isso.</p>
 Diversos 
<p>Como posso enviar feedback?</p>
<p>No aplicativo móvel, abra o menu lateral esquerdo e clique em "Feedback". No aplicativo web, há um link para "Enviar feedback" no lado direito da tela.</p>
<p>Você também pode enviar e-mails para <a href="mailto:support@bsky.app">support@bsky.app</a> com solicitações de suporte.</p>

				  Indicio recently released its European Central Cloud Scale Mediator to provide better latency and service to local users. Here’s what you need to know to build an effective decentralized identity solution in Europe.<br>  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Faster mediation, happier customers</p>
<p>Indicio recently unveiled its dedicated European cloud scale mediator. Now, customers across Europe have access to better latency and faster service when sending messages through a decentralized network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those not familiar, a mediator plays a key role in delivering messages in a decentralized network. You can think of it almost like a post office: the mediator receives messages and can find and deliver them to the correct recipient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is important because in a decentralized network there is no direct connection between you and the party you are trying to communicate with. Having a faster mediator allows a decentralized identity solution to process more messages and provide a better experience to the end user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The European Cloud Scale Mediator is part of Indicio’s commitment to helping customers in Europe build powerful and fast identity solutions. Interest in the technology has been growing as the European Union looks to allow for easier travel and better identity management for its citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>European Identity Standards</p>
<p>If you are looking to build identity technology or processes in Europe, there are a number of regulations and standards to keep in mind. The two that are most important are the “electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services” (eIDAS) and OpenID Standards. If you’re not familiar with them, here’s a quick overview.</p>
<p><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">eIDAS&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>The goal of eIDAS Regulation is to ensure that electronic interactions are safer, faster and more efficient, regardless of the European country in which they take place. The net result of the regulations is a single framework for electronic identification (eID) and trust services, making it more straightforward to deliver services across the European Union.</p>
<p>eIDAS2 (New!)</p>
<p>eIDAS was a good start, but as the technology has evolved, the European Union has recognized some issues and problems that the original regulations didn’t address. Namely, eIDAS does not cover how certificates or professional qualifications are issued and used (for example medical or attorney licenses), making these electronic credentials complicated to implement and use across Europe. More worryingly for the individual, it does not allow the end user to control the data exchanged during the verification process.</p>
<p>eIDAS2 proposes creating a European digital identity that can be controlled by citizens through a European Digital Identity Wallet (EDIW) that anyone can read to verify the identity of citizens.</p>
<p><a href="https://openid.net">OpenID</a></p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation was created to “lead the global community in creating identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy-preserving.” This group is a non-profit standards body that you don’t technically need to be compliant with, but building along their guidelines will add interoperability to your project and allow more people to make use of it easier.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OpenID for VC or OID4VC</a></p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation also provides some specifications specifically for verifiable credentials and their issuance, presentation and how they are stored. You can learn more at the above link.</p>
<p>Indicio makes building easy</p>
<p>Indicio offers a full package of support to our European customers. Not only do we have all the pieces to help you put together the decentralized identity solution to best meet your needs, we make it our priority to offer solutions that are universal in accommodating current and emerging protocols and standards.</p>

<p>IDC estimates that <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS49760222">750 million cloud native </a>will be built by 2025. Where and how these applications are deployed will impact time to market and value realization. The reality is that application landscapes are complex, and they challenge enterprises to maintain and modernize existing infrastructure, while delivering new cloud-native features. Three in four executives reported <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/application-modernization-hybrid-cloud">disparate systems in their organizations</a> and that a lack of skills, resources and common operational practices challenge business objectives. </p>



<p>Executives know they must modernize. In fact, 83% of IT executives feel that modernization is central to their organization’s strategy, but only 27% say their organizations have <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/application-modernization-hybrid-cloud">modernized the requisite workflows</a> (including applications, data and underlying systems). But it’s clear that CIOs who prioritize modernization capture greater returns from business transformation. </p>



 CIOs can enable application modernization through several factors 



 1. Access to new software innovation: 



<p>Software has become the lifeline of all domains. The effect has increased exponentially with the advent of AI, ML, Hybrid Cloud, DevSecOps and there are more advances coming. Organizations must keep up with the technology of today so they can innovate and satisfy the ever-changing needs of the customers.</p>



<p>Each organization is trying to excel by adopting modern innovative software practices—not just to grow, but to survive. Many organizations have disappeared from the technology map because of failing to adapt and adopt innovation quickly.</p>



 2. Improved speed and agility: 



<p>The world is changing rapidly and technology is the biggest enabler for this change. Organizations need full flexibility to address important questions, including:</p>



 
 How soon can you test your hypothesis (such as how many geographies or which user personas)? 



 How quickly can features be introduced into the market (from concept to production) and beat the competition? 



 How can you pivot efficiently in response to the changing market conditions? 



 How can you realise value from your innovation sooner? 



 How can you keep innovating consistently while delivering value? 



 How efficient is your release process? 
 



<p>If your responses are negative to the questions above, then, you are losing ground to your competitors. Adopt developer tooling and agile processes to increase your velocity and help you address these issues.</p>



 3. Value delivery and reduced business cost 



<p>Decreasing production costs helps drive agility by realigning with new business goals sooner. It is imperative that you save costs in everything: automation will help drive faster feature go-lives, faster feedback loops, less waiting and coordination times, high quality test frameworks, resilient platforms, easy and fast upgrades, zero downtimes among others.</p>



<p>Beyond traditional cost reduction methods, addressing sustainability has emerged as an essential part of modern cost reduction approaches. <a href="https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/globalassets/en/publications/documents/2024-gartner-top-strategic-technology-trends-ebook.pdf?_gl=1*1s7l71d*_ga*ODMyNzA4ODE1LjE3MDc3Njc0MDQ.*_ga_R1W5CE5FEV*MTcwNzc5NDMyNy4yLjEuMTcwNzc5NDM3MS4xNi4wLjA.">By 2027, 25% of CIOs will have compensation linked to their sustainable technology impact</a>.</p>



<p>Modernization can substantially address sustainability goals. Decreasing your dependence on hardware, increasing your usage of auto-provisioned infrastructure and leveraging reusable components and modules are concrete ways to improve your impact on the environment.</p>



 4. Reduced risk and technical debt: 



<p>All legacy releases are inherently risky due to a longer release cycle. The risks of not modernizing your applications include increased downtime, combined with a limited and slow response time to rapidly changing customer needs. Downtimes and slow releases can have a huge impact on an organization’s economics and impair customer relationships. Your existing applications also form a large part of your organization’s technical debt, with monolithic architectures and development processes. And in many cases, there is a lack of knowledgeable developers that know how to update and build them.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.leanix.net/en/download/enterprise-architects-on-it-priorities-2022">In a survey</a><a href="https://www.leanix.net/en/ty/content?hsCtaTracking=9c5afa7e-aadc-421d-a2fa-d70a7cd224e3%7Ce2aa941a-a4ed-41f0-a40c-2563737df386">,</a> 41% of the respondents selected ‘Reducing Tech debt/Upgrading Legacy Systems’ as the top priority. Technical debt is also very expensive and incurs with time. For example, <a href="https://www.it-cisq.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/CPSQ-Report-Nov-22-2.pdf">the cost of the technical debt in US</a> was $1.52 trillion in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The glossy features take the limelight, while technical debt is pushed to the bottom of the backlogs. Gradually, the technical debt impedes the new feature development, thus increasing the risk and the cost to fix the former.</p>



<p>Runtime modernization is a big step to curb such issues. It needs minimal setup. It supports futureproofing by allowing an easy progression to containers and microservices.</p>



 5. Developer Experience: 



<p>A truism is emerging in the software industry: good developer experience leads to great customer experience.</p>



<p>By 2026, approximately <a href="https://emt.gartnerweb.com/ngw/globalassets/en/publications/documents/2024-gartner-top-strategic-technology-trends-ebook.pdf?_gl=1*1s7l71d*_ga*ODMyNzA4ODE1LjE3MDc3Njc0MDQ.*_ga_R1W5CE5FEV*MTcwNzc5NDMyNy4yLjEuMTcwNzc5NDM3MS4xNi4wLjA.">80% of software engineering organizations</a> will establish platform teams as internal providers of reusable services, components and tools for application delivery. Many organizations are focusing their efforts to improve the developer experience to become more agile and responsive.</p>



<p>This also cuts down the cognitive load and connects the developers’ morale with the business value. The few areas which yield great results are breaking up complex architectures, increasing the use of modern development tooling and processes, and creating internal platforms with reusable configurable components.</p>



 Adopt the right technology and tooling for success

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Only a bit more than two months to go until the global Digital Identity and IAM community gathers again at the European Identity and Cloud Conference (<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">EIC</a>) in Berlin. From June 4th to 7th, we will spend four days packed with interesting sessions. More than 230 sessions, more than 250 speakers – this again will become a great event and the place to be.</p>
<p>When looking back at EIC 2023, I remember the Closing Keynote where I have been talking about three main topics and trends I had observed during that edition of EIC:</p>
 
 Decentralized Identity becoming a reality: My observation has been that decentralized identity started to shift from a discussion about early protocol developments and concepts to the real-world impact, on enterprise IAM and consumer business. 
 AI and Identity: Intensely discussed as a challenge we need to tackle. 
 Policy-based Access Controls: Not a new thing, but coming back with strong momentum, for instance in the development of modern digital services. Back in the spotlight. 
 
<p>So, where do we stand with this?</p>
<p>With the recent approval of eIDAS 2.0 by the European Parliament, which involves the EUDI Wallet (EU Decentralized Identity Wallet), the momentum for decentralized identity has experienced a massive leverage. It is the topic in Digital Identity and IAM of today, with many sessions around this at EIC.</p>
<p>AI and Identity also has also got its own track now. For a good reason. It is such an important topic with so many facets: the identity of AI and autonomous components powered by AI, AI empowering IAM, and so on. We started the discussion in 2023 and will continue in 2024.<br> <br> Policy-based Access Controls still is evolving. We see more and more traction, also in the conversations we have on both the research and the advisory side. More and more organizations are looking at how to make PBAC a reality.</p>
<p>Looking forward to EIC 2024: What can we expect from the next edition? Let me try a prediction of what I will cover on June 7th in the closing keynote:</p>
 
 Decentralized Identity again: With the momentum in the EU and beyond, it becomes increasingly clear what we already can do and where we need to join forces to meet the needs of businesses, consumers, citizens, and, last but not least, governments. 
 AI and Identity or “AIdentity”: I expect the conversations increasingly shift from discussing the challenge (as in 2023) to discussing the solutions. 
 Identity Security: There is Digital Identity. There is Cybersecurity. There is Identity Security, which is about the identity impact on cybersecurity. With the ever-increasing threats, this is a topic that will be covered in many sessions. 
 
<p>While you may argue that two out of three will be the same as in 2023, this is not entirely true. On one hand, this demonstrates what the mega-trends are. On the other, we will look at the next level of evolution for these areas. What does it need for the perfect EUDI wallet that everyone wants to use? How will we deal with the identities of autonomous agents or bots acting on our behalf? So many questions. There will be many answers at EIC, but also a lot of food for thought for 2024 and beyond.</p>
<p>But with more than 230 sessions covering such a broad range of topics, from running your IAM well and modernizing it towards an Identity Fabric to Decentralized Identity and the future of CIAM (Consumer IAM), it is hard to predict what finally will be the hottest topics that are not only discussed during sessions throughout the conference, in the breaks, in the evening events, and on all the other occasions EIC provides.</p>
<p>See you in Berlin. Don’t miss booking your individual time with the KuppingerCole Analysts and Advisors early. Looking forward to meeting you in person.</p>

			<p>9th of April, Luxembourg – <a href="https://silcgroup.com/">The SILC Group</a> (SILC), a leading alternative assets solutions provider based in Australia with more than $2 billion in funds under supervision, announced today it will partner with <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, the leading institutional tokenization solution provider. Together, they aim to realize SILC’s ambitious digitalization vision by upgrading alternative assets onto blockchain through tokenization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collaboration begins with a pilot project aimed at tokenizing a test fund using Tokeny’s unique tokenization infrastructure. The pilot project will assess the potential of blockchain to ultimately replace the various legacy centralized systems that are used to administer funds used by SILC to unite investors and capital seekers within the alternative assets industry.</p>
<p>By combining both parties’ deep expertise, it is intended they will be able to offer the compliant tokenization of alternative assets in Australia and across the region, by delivering institutional-grade solutions in the issuance and lifecycle management of real-world asset tokens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The announcement marks a transformative step within the alternative assets industry as institutional involvement across blockchain begins to ramp up and significant players enter the market. The traditional way of issuing financial products is time-consuming, multi-tiered and involves many steps using cumbersome systems and processes. Through blockchain technology, parties can benefit from using one single and global infrastructure that can compliantly improve transaction speeds, utilize automation, and is accessible 24/7/365 days a year.</p>
<p>By using the ERC-3643 token smart contract standard, SILC will have the ability to automate compliance validation processes and control real-world asset tokens while preserving typical features of a blockchain like immutability and interoperability.</p>

		 
	 
    Blockchain technology offers a potential paradigm shift in the efficiency of capital markets, with The SILC Group seeking to pass these efficiency and service improvement gains along to our clients. We are excited to be working with Tokeny on this pilot as we explore ways to further support our clients and enhance risk management activities, as well as increase the velocity and scalability of the solutions we provide.  Koby JonesCEO of The SILC Group       Alternative assets are one of the most suitable assets to be tokenized to make it transparent, accessible, and transferable, which has been historically hard to do. Our collaboration with The SILC Group underscores the growing recognition among regulated institutions of tokenization's tremendous potential. It's no longer a question of if tokenization will occur, but rather, when it will fundamentally transform the financial landscape.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny

<p>Last month, the world got a preview of a looming catastrophe: the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to bypass antiquated identity and security systems. The news outlet 404 Media reported the discovery of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-the-underground-site-where-ai-neural-networks-churns-out-fake-ids-onlyfake/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">an “underground” service called OnlyFake</a>&nbsp;that created and sold fake IDs for 26 countries through Telegram, and one of 404’s reporters used one of OnlyFake’s IDs to bypass the “KYC,” or “know your customer,” process of crypto exchange OKX.</p><p>There’s nothing terribly new there, except that OnlyFake claims it uses AI to create the bogus documents. 404 wasn’t able to confirm OnlyFake’s claim to use AI, but OnlyFake’s deep-discount pricing may suggest the claims are real.</p><p>Either way, this should be a wake-up call: It’s only a question of when, not if, AI tools will be used at scale to bypass identity controls online.</p> New AI-Enabled Tools for Online Identity Fraud <p>The scariest thing about AI-generated fake IDs is how quickly and cheaply they can be produced. The OnlyFake team was reportedly selling AI-generated fake driver’s licenses and passports for $15, claiming they could produce hundreds of IDs simultaneously from Excel data, totaling up to 20,000 fakes per day.</p><p>A flood of cheap, convincing fake physical IDs would leave bars, smoke shops and liquor stores inundated with fake-wielding teenagers. But there would be some chance at detection, thanks to anti-fraud features, like holograms, UV images, and microtext, now common on physical ID cards.</p><p>But OnlyFakes’ products are tailored for use online, making them even more dangerous. When a physical ID is used online, the holograms and other physical anti-fraud measures are rendered useless. OnlyFakes even generates fake backdrops to make the images look like photos of IDs snapped with a cell phone.</p><p>One tentative method of making online identity more secure is video verification, but new technologies like OpenAI’s Sora are already undermining that method. They’re frighteningly effective in one-on-one situations, such as when a finance staffer was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">tricked out of $25 million by ‘deepfake’ versions of their own colleagues</a>.</p><p>With critical services moving online en masse, digital fraud is becoming even more professionalized and widespread than the offline version.</p> The Numbers Don’t Add Up, But They Don’t Have To <p>You might wonder how those generative fakes work without real driver’s licenses or passport numbers. If you submit an AI-generated driver’s license number for verification at a crypto exchange or other financial institution, the identity database would immediately flag it as a fake, right?</p><p>Well, not exactly. Police or other state entities can almost always directly access ID records, but those systems don’t give third parties easy access to their database—partly out of privacy concerns. Therefore, many verification systems simply can't ask the issuing agency if a driver’s license or ID is valid, hence why 404 Media was able to use an AI-generated card to fool OKX.</p><p>A KYC provider might instead rely on third-party data brokers for valid matches or pattern-based alphanumeric verification—in other words, determining whether or not an ID number is valid by whether it matches a certain pattern of letters and numbers used by issuers.</p><p>This would make such systems particularly vulnerable to AI fakes since detecting and reproducing patterns is where generative AI shines.</p><p>The OnlyFakes instance is just one example of a growing fraud problem that exploits flaws in our identity systems. The U.S. estimated losses&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106696?ref=blog.spruceid.com#:~:text=Fast%20Facts,benefits%20paid%20during%20the%20pandemic.">between $100-$135 billion</a>&nbsp;in pandemic unemployment insurance fraud, which is often perpetuated by false identities. Even scarier, there has been a rise in fake doctors, whether&nbsp;<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-06-significant-threat-world-doctors-impersonators.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">selling fake treatments online</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/he-delivered-their-babies-and-examined-their-bodies-now-patients-are-suing-after-learning-he-used-a-fake-name-and-stolen-social-security-numbers-for-credentials/2017/12/30/b2732232-e43a-11e7-ab50-621fe0588340_story.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">practicing in American hospitals</a>, enabled by identity fraud.</p><p>We can do better.</p> How Do We Fight AI Identity Fraud? <p>It’s clearly time to develop a new kind of identification credential—a digital ID built for the internet, and resistant to AI mimicry. An array of formats and standards are currently being adopted for this new kind of digital ID, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/california-rolls-out-digital-drivers-licenses-for-phones-how-to-sign-up-for-pilot-program/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">mDLs (mobile driver’s licenses)</a>&nbsp;and digital verifiable credentials.</p><p>At the core of these digital credentials are counterparts to the holograms and other measures that let a bartender verify your physical ID. That includes cryptographic security schemes, similar to what the<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/white-house-cryptographically-verify-official-communications-ai-deep-fakes-surge-2024-2?ref=blog.spruceid.com">&nbsp;White House is supposedly considering</a>&nbsp;to distinguish official statements from deepfakes. These cryptographic attestations use unique codes as long as 10 to the 77th power, making it computationally impossible for an AI to mimic.</p><p>However, new approaches are not without new risks. While digital ID systems may promise to prevent fraud and provide convenience, they must be implemented carefully to enshrine privacy and security throughout our infrastructure. When implemented without consideration for the necessary policy and data protection frameworks, they may introduce challenges such as surveillance, unwanted storage of personal information, reduced accessibility or even increased fraud.</p><p>Fortunately, many mitigations exist. For example, these digital IDs can be bound to physical devices using security chips known as secure elements, which can add the requirement for the same device to be present when they are being used. This makes digital IDs much harder to steal than just copying a file or leaking a digital key from your cloud storage. The technology can also be paired with privacy and accessibility laws to ensure safe and simple usage.</p><p>This new kind of ID makes it easier for the user to choose what data they reveal. Imagine taking a printed ID into a liquor store and being able to verify to the clerk that you’re over 21—without sharing your address or even your specific birthday. That flexibility alone would greatly increase privacy and security for individuals and society as a whole.</p><p>Privacy-preserving technology would also make it safer to verify a driver’s license number directly with the issuer, potentially rendering OnlyFake’s AI-generated fake ID numbers useless.</p><p>We’ve already sacrificed too much—in safety and in plain old dollars—by sticking with physical IDs in a digital world. Transitioning to a modernized, privacy-preserving, digital-first system would be a major blow to fraudsters, money launderers and even terrorists worldwide. It’s time.</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

One study reports that over <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/more-than-two-thirds-of-financial-institutions-lost-over-500k-to-fraud-in-2022-alloy-report-finds-301715626.html">70% of financial institutions lost at least $500,000 to fraudulent activity</a> in 2022. The hardest-hit institutions were fintech companies and regional banks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On top of that, the financial services industry is becoming increasingly regulated, particularly when it comes to verifying customer identities and incorporating anti-money laundering protocols.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Establishing mutual trust between customers and financial institutions goes a long way in preventing bank fraud. With the right practices in place, users enjoy a frictionless experience while financial institutions can prevent multiple types of consumer fraud using increased identity verification and monitoring — all while staying compliant with federal regulations.</p>

<p>Written by <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/chriswere">Chris Were</a> (Verida CEO &amp; Co-Founder), this article was originally published on <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2024/03/28/top-three-data-privacy-issues-facing-ai-today/">DailyHodl.com</a></p><p>AI (artificial intelligence) has caused frenzied excitement among consumers and businesses alike — driven by a passionate belief that LLMs (large language models) and tools like ChatGPT will transform the way we study, work and&nbsp;live.</p><p>But just like in the internet’s early days, users are jumping in without considering how their personal data is used — and the impact this could have on their&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>There have already been countless examples of data breaches within the AI space. In March 2023, OpenAI temporarily took ChatGPT <a href="https://openai.com/blog/march-20-chatgpt-outage">offline</a> after a ‘significant’ error meant users were able to see the conversation histories of strangers.</p><p>That same bug meant the payment information of subscribers — including names, email addresses and partial credit card numbers — were also in the public&nbsp;domain.</p><p>In September 2023, a staggering 38 terabytes of Microsoft data was inadvertently <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/microsoft-ai-employee-accidentally-leaks-38tb-of-data">leaked</a> by an employee, with cybersecurity experts warning this could have allowed attackers to infiltrate AI models with malicious code.</p><p>Researchers have also been able to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5aceb7a6-9d5a-4f1f-af3d-1ef0129b0934">manipulate</a> AI systems into disclosing confidential records.</p><p>In just a few hours, a group called Robust Intelligence was able to solicit personally identifiable information from Nvidia software and bypass safeguards designed to prevent the system from discussing certain&nbsp;topics.</p><p>Lessons were learned in all of these scenarios, but each breach powerfully illustrates the challenges that need to be overcome for AI to become a reliable and trusted force in our&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Gemini, Google’s chatbot, even admits that all conversations are processed by human reviewers — underlining the lack of transparency in its&nbsp;system.</p><p>“Don’t enter anything that you wouldn’t want to be reviewed or used,” says an alert to users&nbsp;warns.</p><p>AI is rapidly moving beyond a tool that students use for their homework or tourists rely on for recommendations during a trip to&nbsp;Rome.</p><p>It’s increasingly being depended on for sensitive discussions — and fed everything from medical questions to our work schedules.</p><p>Because of this, it’s important to take a step back and reflect on the top three data privacy issues facing AI today, and why they matter to all of&nbsp;us.</p> 1. Prompts aren’t&nbsp;private <p>Tools like ChatGPT memorize past conversations in order to refer back to them later. While this can improve the user experience and help train LLMs, it comes with&nbsp;risk.</p><p>If a system is successfully hacked, there’s a real danger of prompts being exposed in a public&nbsp;forum.</p><p>Potentially embarrassing details from a user’s history could be leaked, as well as commercially sensitive information when AI is being deployed for work purposes.</p><p>As we’ve seen from Google, all submissions can also end up being scrutinized by its development team.</p><p>Samsung took action on this in May 2023 when it banned employees from using generative AI tools altogether. That came after an employee <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2023/05/02/samsung-bans-chatgpt-and-other-chatbots-for-employees-after-sensitive-code-leak/?sh=3db17e386078">uploaded</a> confidential source code to&nbsp;ChatGPT.</p><p>The tech giant was concerned that this information would be difficult to retrieve and delete, meaning IP (intellectual property) could end up being distributed to the public at&nbsp;large.</p><p>Apple, Verizon and JPMorgan have taken similar action, with reports suggesting Amazon launched a crackdown after responses from ChatGPT bore similarities to its own internal&nbsp;data.</p><p>As you can see, the concerns extend beyond what would happen if there’s a data breach but to the prospect that information entered into AI systems could be repurposed and distributed to a wider audience.</p><p>Companies like OpenAI are already <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/jan/08/ai-tools-chatgpt-copyrighted-material-openai">facing</a> multiple lawsuits amid allegations that their chatbots were trained using copyrighted material.</p> 2. Custom AI models trained by organizations aren’t&nbsp;private <p>This brings us neatly to our next point — while individuals and corporations can establish their custom LLM models based on their own data sources, they won’t be fully private if they exist within the confines of a platform like&nbsp;ChatGPT.</p><p>There’s ultimately no way of knowing whether inputs are being used to train these massive systems — or whether personal information could end up being used in future&nbsp;models.</p><p>Like a jigsaw, data points from multiple sources can be brought together to form a comprehensive and worryingly detailed insight into someone’s identity and background.</p><p>Major platforms may also fail to offer detailed explanations of how this data is stored and processed, with an inability to opt out of features that a user is uncomfortable with.</p><p>Beyond responding to a user’s prompts, AI systems increasingly have the ability to read between the lines and deduce everything from a person’s location to their personality.</p><p>In the event of a data breach, dire consequences are possible. Incredibly sophisticated phishing attacks could be orchestrated — and users targeted with information they had confidentially fed into an AI&nbsp;system.</p><p>Other potential scenarios include this data being used to assume someone’s identity, whether that’s through applications to open bank accounts or deepfake&nbsp;videos.</p><p>Consumers need to remain vigilant even if they don’t use AI themselves. AI is increasingly being used to power surveillance systems and enhance facial recognition technology in public&nbsp;places.</p><p>If such infrastructure isn’t established in a truly private environment, the civil liberties and privacy of countless citizens could be infringed without their knowledge.</p> 3. Private data is used to train AI&nbsp;systems <p>There are concerns that major AI systems have gleaned their intelligence by poring over countless web&nbsp;pages.</p><p>Estimates suggest 300 billion words were used to train ChatGPT — that’s 570 gigabytes of data — with books and Wikipedia entries among the datasets.</p><p>Algorithms have also been known to depend on social media pages and online comments.</p><p>With some of these sources, you could argue that the owners of this information would have had a reasonable expectation of&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>But here’s the thing — many of the tools and apps we interact with every day are already heavily influenced by AI — and react to our behaviors.</p><p>The Face ID on your iPhone uses AI to track subtle changes in your appearance.</p><p>TikTok and Facebook’s AI-powered algorithms make content recommendations based on the clips and posts you’ve viewed in the&nbsp;past.</p><p>Voice assistants like Alexa and Siri depend heavily on machine learning, too.</p><p>A dizzying constellation of AI startups is out there, and each has a specific purpose. However, some are more transparent than others about how user data is gathered, stored and&nbsp;applied.</p><p>This is especially important as AI makes an impact in the field of healthcare — from medical imaging and diagnoses to record-keeping and pharmaceuticals.</p><p>Lessons need to be learned from the internet businesses caught up in privacy scandals over recent&nbsp;years.</p><p>Flo, a women’s health app, was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/us/period-apps-health-technology-women-privacy.html">accused</a> by regulators of sharing intimate details about its users to the likes of Facebook and Google in the&nbsp;2010s.</p> Where do we go from&nbsp;here <p>AI is going to have an indelible impact on all of our lives in the years to come. LLMs are getting better with every passing day, and new use cases continue to&nbsp;emerge.</p><p>However, there’s a real risk that regulators will struggle to keep up as the industry moves at breakneck speed.</p><p>And that means consumers need to start securing their own data and monitoring how it is&nbsp;used.</p><p>Decentralization can play a vital role here and prevent large volumes of data from falling into the hands of major platforms.</p><p>DePINs (decentralized physical infrastructure networks) have the potential to ensure everyday users experience the full benefits of AI without their privacy being compromised.</p><p>Not only can encrypted prompts deliver far more personalized outcomes, but privacy-preserving LLMs would ensure users have full control of their data at all times — and protection against it being&nbsp;misused.</p><p>Chris Were is the CEO of <a href="https://www.verida.network/">Verida</a>, a decentralized, self-sovereign data network empowering individuals to control their digital identity and personal data.

<p></p>
<p>Digital identity shapes every facet of our online interactions. The quest for a system that balances decentralization, scalability, security, and user experience has been relentless. Today, I'm thrilled to share that TBD has birthed a new solution: the DID DHT method. This leap forward is not just a technical achievement; it's a foundational component for the more inclusive and trust-based digital world we want for tomorrow.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://did-dht.com/">specification</a> is nearing its first major version, and our team has produced client software in all of our <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/">open source SDKs</a> in more than five languages. We have also built and deployed a publicly-available developer gateway, which has already registered many thousands of DIDs, with staging and production-ready gateways coming soon.</p>
<p>Some of you may already be <a href="https://youtu.be/23lCRO2CIIY?si=R-a79TEKQQmv6Vj_">familiar with DID DHT</a> and why we’ve chosen to make it our default DID method, but if not, or if you’re curious to find out more, read on to learn more about how the method was created, and how we’ve ended up here today.</p>
 What Makes a Good DID Method?<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-dht#what-makes-a-good-did-method" title="Direct link to What Makes a Good DID Method?">​</a> 
<p>Our vision for a superior DID method hinged on several critical features:</p>
 
 Sufficient Decentralization — a foundational principle to mitigate censorship and enhance user autonomy. 
 Scalability and Accessibility –&nbsp;making digital identity accessible to billions, without a prohibitive cost barrier. 
 Comprehensive Feature Set — supporting multiple cryptographic key types, services, and other core DID properties. 
 Reliable and Verifiable History — enabling trust through transparency historical data. 
 Global Discoverability – facilitating easy access and independent verification of digital identifiers. 
 
 The Evolution of Our DID Strategy<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-dht#the-evolution-of-our-did-strategy" title="Direct link to The Evolution of Our DID Strategy">​</a> 
<p>Historically our software has supported <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">did:key</a>, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">did:web</a>, and <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec">did:ion</a>, and some other methods within certain segments of our stack. Recognizing the impracticality of a "one-size-fits-all" approach, we embraced a multi-method strategy. Today that strategy incorporates three key DID methods: <a href="https://github.com/quartzjer/did-jwk/blob/main/spec.md">did:jwk</a>, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">did:web</a>, and <a href="https://tbd54566975.github.io/did-dht-method/">did:dht</a>, each catering to specific scenarios with their unique strengths.</p>
<p>Within our SDKs, JWK replaces did:key, a simple and widely adopted method that uses standard JSON Web Keys (JWKs), limiting complexity over did:key’s approach to using multi-formats. DID Web is an obvious choice for entities with existing brands, as trust can be easily linked to existing domains without the use of any special or complex technology. DID DHT is a new method that we view as a replacement for ION, which has strong decentralization characteristics, a robust feature set, and a simpler architecture.</p>
 Leaping Beyond ION<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-dht#leaping-beyond-ion" title="Direct link to Leaping Beyond ION">​</a> 
<p>The biggest change we’ve made is going from ION to DID DHT.</p>
<p>ION is a <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree-based DID method</a> that is a L2 on the Bitcoin blockchain. ION is a fully-featured DID method, and one of the few that supports root key rotation and discoverability of all DIDs with complete historical state. However, there are three main reasons that led us to move away from using ION — architectural complexity, centralization risk, and a sub-optimal user experience.</p>
<p>While ION presented a robust DID method with admirable features, its complexity, centralization risks, and user experience challenges prompted us to explore alternatives. DID DHT stands out as our choice for a new direction, offering simplicity, enhanced decentralization, and a user-friendly approach without compromising on the core features essential for a comprehensive DID method.</p>
 Enter DID DHT<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-dht#enter-did-dht" title="Direct link to Enter DID DHT">​</a> 
<p>DID DHT is built upon <a href="https://github.com/Nuhvi/pkarr">Pkarr</a>, a community-created project. Pkarr stands for Public Key Addressable Resource Records and acts as a bridge between our DID method and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainline_DHT">Mainline Decentralized Hash Table</a>, overlaying DNS record semantics and providing a space-efficient encoding mechanism for DID Documents. The choice of Mainline DHT, with its over 20 million active nodes and a 15-year successful run, guarantees exceptional decentralization out of mainline nodes, but can also leverage Pkarr nodes and DID DHT gateways for additional functionality.</p>
<p>DID DHT trades off use of a blockchain for immediate decentralization, fast publishing and resolution, and trustless verification. That’s right — the DID Document’s records are signed by its own key before entering the DHT — there’s no need to trust nodes, as you can verify payloads yourself client-side. Similar to ION, DID DHT documents support multiple keys, services, type indexing, and other DID Document properties.</p>
<p>DID DHT, however, is not without its limitations. The main three being: a need to republish records to nodes regularly to prevent them from expiring from the DHT and reliance on a non-rotatable Ed25519 key called the “identity key,” as is required by the DHT and <a href="https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0044.html">BEP44</a>, and historical DID state not being shared between nodes. Our ongoing development and the community-driven enhancements aim to address these challenges, refining DID DHT's architecture for broader applicability and reliability.</p>
 DID DHT Opportunities<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-dht#did-dht-opportunities" title="Direct link to DID DHT Opportunities">​</a> 
<p>One of the most interesting opportunities we have identified for DID DHT is <a href="https://did-dht.com/#interoperability-with-other-did-methods">interoperability</a> with existing single-key methods like <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">did:key</a> and <a href="https://github.com/quartzjer/did-jwk/blob/main/spec.md">did:jwk</a>. Essentially, you can continue to use single-key methods as you do today, with an optional resolution step to the DHT to extend the functionality of these methods, like adding additional keys or service(s) to a DID Document. We have begun to define this interoperability in the <a href="https://did-dht.com/registry/index.html#interoperable-did-methods">method’s registry</a>.</p>
<p>Another interesting opportunity for DID DHT is with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/WorkMode/">W3C DID working group</a>, which is currently going through a rechartering effort to focus on interoperability and DID Resolution. Depending on how the charter ends up, there could be an opportunity to promote the DID DHT method as one that is broadly interoperable, decentralized, and does not necessitate the use of a blockchain — a common critique of DIDs by community members in the past.</p>
<p>We have additional ideas such as associating human-readable names with DIDs, tying DIDs into trust and discoverability services, and supporting gossip between DID DHT gateways. We encourage you to <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/did-dht-method/">join us on GitHub</a> to continue the discussion.</p>
 Looking Forward<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-dht#looking-forward" title="Direct link to Looking Forward">​</a> 
<p>The introduction of DID DHT represents a significant milestone in our journey toward a more decentralized, accessible, and secure digital identity landscape. We believe DID DHT has the characteristics to make it widely useful, and widely adopted. <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/build/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did/">Try it out</a> for yourself, and let us know what you think.</p>
<p>As we continue to refine and expand its capabilities, we invite the community to join us in this endeavor, contributing insights, feedback, and innovations to shepard DID DHT toward becoming your default DID method.</p>

   This blog entry explores the insane world of non-human identity, a subject as complicated as the world’s many cloud computing environments. My journey from the early days of digital identity management to the revelations at IETF 119 serves as the backdrop, and I share what I’m learning based on those experiences.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>I’ve recently started to explore the world that is non-human identity. Coming out of <a href="https://youtu.be/zIadPdCQsJE?si=9S-KrcbOCYsM22tU">IETF 119</a>, where some of the best (and most terrifying) hallway conversations were about physical and software supply chains, I realized this was a space that didn’t look like what I’d experienced early in my digital identity career.</p>



<p>When I was first responsible for the group managing digital identity for a university, our issues with non-human identity centered around access cards. These were provisioned in the same system that provisioned employee badges: the HR system. Having entities that were not people in a people-driven system always involved annoying policy contortions. It was fitting a square peg in a round hole.</p>



<p>That kind of non-human identity has nothing to do with what I learned at IETF 119. Personally, I blame cloud computing.</p>



 Cloud Computing 



<p>Depending on the person you’re talking to, cloud computing is often seen as the answer to a company’s computing cost and efficiency problems. Rather than paying for a data center, equipment, network capacity, and all the staff that goes with it, the company can buy only the computing power it needs, and the rest magically disappears. IT staff tend to look at cloud computing another way: the same headaches, just more complicated to manage because they are on someone else’s computers.</p>



<p>However, cost and some dimensions of efficiency are the driving force behind business costs, and cloud computing has become even more attractive. Companies regularly purchase cloud computing services from a variety of vendors. A cloud here via Microsoft for Azure, a cloud there at Amazon Web Services for database computing, and another cloud there at Google for storage. It looks fantastic on paper (or at least on a monitor), but it’s introduced big identity problems as a result.</p>



 Authorization in the Cloud 



<p>Processes and APIs are not people. They don’t get hired and fired over the course of years like people do. They may never be associated with a person at all. And yet, they usually have a start and an end. They need to be constrained to access or accomplish only the specific things they are supposed to do. They may delegate specific tasks to other processes. They need authorization and access control at a speed and scale that makes human authorization look like a walk in the park.</p>



<p>If all authorizations happen in one environment, it’s not too bad. Everything gets their data from the same sources and in the format they expect. It might be like those old key cards managed via a people system, even when they aren’t themselves people, but it is a simple enough model.</p>



 Authorization in Many Clouds 



<p>However, if the authorization has to happen across environments, things get hairy. The format of the code may change. The source of truth may vary depending on where the process started. There may be hundreds, thousands, millions more of these processes and APIs than there are people in the company. And these processes are almost entirely independent of any human involvement.</p>



<p>This new kind of non-human identity operates in ways human identities don’t. Batch processing is a great example since the process does not necessarily act on behalf of a user. Training an AI model is batch processing that runs for a week and has no human involved. Batch transactions in the bank, such as payroll, run unsupervised and aren’t handled as a person. Furthermore, a human may be flagged by a computer’s security system as showing strange behavior when they are logging in from both Brisbane and Chicago simultaneously. An application, in all its glory, may suddenly expand to be in data centers around the world because it’s dealing with a Taylor Swift concert sale. What would be anomalous for a person is just another day in cloud computing.</p>



<p>Sorry, HR badge system, you’re just not suited for managing authorization here.</p>



 DevOps, IT Admins, and IAM Practitioners 



<p>Developing and deploying code in a cloud environment is generally in the hands of the DevOps and IT teams. DevOps traditionally move quickly to develop and manage the applications a company needs to deliver its products or services. IT teams deal with the applications that have been developed and deployed. The staff in these groups often specialize in one cloud computing environment or another; it’s not easy to be a generalist in this space.</p>



<p>DevOps is often the fastest in terms of getting new code in place, and the IT admin tries to deal with the symptoms of what’s been developed and deployed. Neither group tends to think in terms of identity management; most IAM teams are focused on people. This is a problem.</p>



<p>Identity administrators are beginning to understand there is an authorization problem, but solutions are sparse. DevOps teams also realize they have an identity problem (ask your favorite DevOps person how much fun it is to manage API permissions without leaking a password or private key). But the DevOps team is not going to the IAM people and say, “Create all these millions of identities and manage them for us, kthxbai.” For one thing, it wouldn’t occur to them. For another, the IAM staff would have a nervous breakdown.</p>



 Standards to the Rescue! 



<p>And here’s where the hallway conversations at IETF 119 enter the story. The whole reason I learned about the authorization-in-the-cloud problem was because of discussions around two working groups and an almost-working group:</p>



 
 <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/scitt/about/">Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust (scitt)</a> 



 <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/wimse/about/">Workload Identity in Multi System Environments (wimse)</a> 



 <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/spice/about/">Secure Patterns for Internet CrEdentials (spice)</a> 
 



 SCITT 



<p>The big picture here is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_supply_chain">software supply chain</a>. A software supply chain is the collection of components, libraries, tools, and processes used to develop, build, and publish software. Software is very rarely one monolithic thing. Instead, it’s made up of lots of different components. Some may be open-source libraries, and some may be proprietary to the company selling them.</p>



<p>Just like a physical bill of materials is required when importing or exporting physical goods, there is also a software bill of materials (SBOM) that is supposed to list all the components of a software package. Now, wouldn’t it be fantastic if, based on a computer-readable, standardized format of an SBOM, a computer could decide in real-time whether a particular software package was safe to run based on a quick check for any severe security vulnerabilities associated with any of the components listed in the SBOM?</p>



<p>It’s an entirely different way of looking at authorization, and that’s what scitt is working on.</p>



 WIMSE 



<p>Workload identity is a term that’s still struggling to find a common, industry-wide definition (not an unusual problem in the IAM space). I do like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_supply_chain">Microsoft’s definition</a>, though: “an identity you assign to a software workload (such as an application, service, script, or container) to authenticate and access other services and resources.”</p>



<p>I mentioned earlier that there can be a ridiculous number of applications and services running across multiple cloud environments. DevOps gets to develop and deploy those, but IT admins need to keep track of all the signals from all the services to make sure everything is running as expected and uninfluenced by hackers. There needs to be a standardized format for the signals all these workloads will send, regardless of any particular cloud environment.</p>



<p>Enter WIMSE. WIMSE is standardizing secure identity presentation for workload components to enable least-privilege access and obtain signals from audit trails so that IT admins get visibility and exercise control of over workload identities. To make it more challenging, this must be platform agnostic because no one is deploying single-platform environments.</p>



 SPICE 



<p>Sometimes, processes and APIs have nothing to do with humans. But sometimes, they do. They might run as a person in order to do something on that person’s behalf. In those cases, it would make life a lot easier to have a credential format that is lightweight enough to support the untold number of workload identities out there AND the human identities that might exist in the same complex ecosystem.</p>



<p>Here is where the proposed working group, spice, sits. Personally, I think it might have the hardest job of the three. While standardizing a common format makes a lot of sense, we can’t ignore that with human identities, issues like privacy, identity verification and proofing, and revocation are an incredibly big deal. Those same issues, however, either don’t apply or don’t apply in the same way for workload identities. If you insist on constraining the credential to be entirely human in its concerns, it’s too burdensome for the millions of apps and processes to handle at the speeds necessary. If you don’t constrain the credentials, security problems may creep in if the developers misuse the credentials.</p>



<p>So, of course, this is the group I volunteered to co-chair. I’m insane.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>Non-human identity is identity at an unprecedented scale. It’s a whole new world because there are many more workload instances than users. The same tooling and standards for human identity are not designed to operate at this new scale or velocity.</p>



<p>I have a lot more to learn in this space, and one person I follow (literally, I will chase him down in hallways) who knows a LOT about this stuff is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pieter-kasselman-0259862/">Pieter Kasselman</a> (Microsoft). He and several others are engaged within the IETF and the broader world to make sense of this complicated and anxiety-inducing space. If you work in IAM and you default to only thinking about the people in your organization, I’m afraid you need to start thinking much more broadly about your field. If you need a place to start, come to <a href="https://identiverse.com/">Identiverse 2024</a> or <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/120/">IETF 120</a> and hang out with me as we all learn about the non-human identity landscape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As society becomes more reliant on technology, the protection of confidential data increases. One innovative way organizations are keeping information safe is through fingerprint biometrics. In this article, we will explore the science of fingerprint biometrics and highlight its potential for security. We will analyze how security biometrics can be utilized and how this technology shapes our present and future security landscapes.</p>
 Key Takeaways 
 
 Fingerprint Uniqueness: The patterns of an individual’s fingerprints are uniquely influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. They serve as an effective and dependable identification method. 
 Scanner Diversity: Different fingerprint scanners (optical, capacitive, ultrasonic, and thermal) address diverse security requirements. These scanners differ in cost, accuracy, durability, and spoofing resistance. 
 Biometrics Future: Despite the powerful security advantages of fingerprint biometrics, issues like potential data theft and privacy violations demand continuous technological evolution and robust legal safeguards. Future prospects for the field include 3D fingerprint imaging, AI integration, and advanced anti-spoofing techniques. 
 
 What Are Fingerprint Biometrics? 
<p>Fingerprint biometrics is the systematic study and application of unique physical attributes inherent in an individual’s fingerprints. Representing a more dependable identification method than traditional passwords or identity cards, fingerprint biometrics eliminates the issues of misplacement, forgetfulness, or theft. The distinctive nature of each person’s fingerprint ensures a robust barrier against unauthorized access to secure data.</p>
 The Science of Uniqueness: Fingerprints Origins 
<p>Fingerprints are nature’s signature of a person’s identity. Using fingerprints as a biometric identification tool dates back to ancient Babylon and has roots in our evolutionary biology. The friction ridges on our fingertips that comprise these prints have been crucial to human survival, helping us grip and touch objects.</p>
 Genetics and Environmental Factors: The Roots of Fingerprint Uniqueness 
<p>Fingerprints are formed during the embryonic stage and remain unaltered throughout an individual’s life. No two individuals, not even identical twins, share the same fingerprint. The basis for this uniqueness can be traced back to the genetic and environmental factors that influence the development of fingerprints.</p>
<p>Aspects of fingerprints that are analyzed include:</p>
 
 Patterns: The general pattern or type of fingerprint (arch, loop, or whorl) is inherited through genetics. 
 Minutiae: The precise details of the ridges, known as minutiae, are influenced by random and unpredictable factors such as pressure, blood flow, and position in the womb during development. 
 Ridges: Each ridge in a fingerprint contains several minutiae points, which can be bifurcations (where one ridge splits into two) or ridge endings. 
 
<p>The distribution and layout of minutiae points vary in every individual, contributing to the specific characteristics of each fingerprint. It is these characteristics that biometric systems analyze when comparing and matching fingerprints.</p>
 Behind the Screen: How Fingerprint Biometrics Work 
<p>Fingerprint recognition is achieved through three steps.</p>
 
 A fingerprint scanner captures the fingerprint, converting the physical pattern into a digital format. 
 The automated recognition system then processes this image to extract distinctive features, forming a unique pattern-matching template. 
 Finally, the facial recognition system matches this template against stored identification or identity verification templates. 
 
<p>Depending on the exact type of fingerprint scanner a business uses, the scanner may use optical, capacitive, ultrasonic, or thermal technologies. Each fingerprint technology has its strengths and weaknesses and will vary in cost, accuracy, and durability.</p>
<p>While the efficacy of biometric scanners is unquestionable, questions about their safety often arise. Potential challenges of fingerprint and facial recognition systems include false acceptance or rejection and biometric data theft.</p>
<p>Although rare, false acceptance of biometric technology can lead to unauthorized access, while false rejection can deny access to legitimate users. Furthermore, if biometric data is compromised, the repercussions can be severe, given that fingerprints cannot be changed, unlike passwords.</p>
<p>However, continuous technological advancements aim to mitigate these risks. Enhanced encryption techniques, anti-spoofing measures, identity verification, and continuous authentication are ways technology addresses these concerns. Together, these enhancements can improve the reliability and security of fingerprint biometrics.</p>
 In-depth Look at Fingerprint Scanners: Optical vs. Capacitive vs. Ultrasonic vs. Thermal 
<p>There are various types of fingerprint scanners, each with strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Optical scanners are the most traditional type. They take a digital fingerprint picture using a light source and a photodiode (a device that turns light into electrical current). Optical scanners are simple to use but can be easily fooled with a good-quality fingerprint image.</p>
 Capacitive scanners 
<p>Commonly found in smartphones, capacitive scanners use electrical current to sense and map the ridges and valleys of a fingerprint. They offer higher resolution and security than optical scanners but can be sensitive to temperature and electrostatic discharge.</p>
 Ultrasonic scanners 
<p>Ultrasonic scanners are considered more secure than optical and capacitive scanners. They use high-frequency sound waves to penetrate the epidermal layer of the skin. This allows them to capture both the surface and sub-surface features of the skin. This information helps form a 3D image of the fingerprint and makes the scanner less prone to spoofing.</p>
 Thermal scanners 
<p>This type of scanner is the least common of the four. Thermal scanners detect minutiae based on the temperature differences of the contact surface. However, their high costs and sensitivity to ambient temperature make them less popular choices.</p>
 Protecting Biometric Identities: Emerging Methods 
<p>As different biometric authentication technologies become more prevalent, safeguarding these identifiers from data breaches has become increasingly crucial. Biometric data, once compromised, cannot be reset or altered like a traditional password, making its protection paramount.</p>
<p>One of the most cost-effective methods for protecting biometric identities is liveness detection. This technology helps differentiate between a live biometric sample from a synthetic or forged one. These systems can differentiate between a live finger and a spoof by analyzing properties of live skin, such as sweat pores and micro-texture.</p>
<p>By detecting bodily responses or using AI to analyze input data for anomalies, liveness detection can add another layer of security to our biometric identification systems.</p>
<p>Decentralized storage methods, such as blockchain technology, are another avenue for safeguarding biometric data. Instead of storing the data in a central database, it’s dispersed across multiple nodes. These numerous locations make it nearly impossible for hackers to access the entire dataset. While this technology is promising, it’s still nascent and faces scalability and energy efficiency issues.</p>
 Potential Issues with Fingerprint Biometrics and Solutions 
<p>Fingerprint biometrics has its challenges; a common issue users face is the quality of the scanned fingerprint. Poor-quality images can deny legitimate users access to facilities, databases, or other secure locations.</p>
<p>Factors that can affect a person’s fingerprint quality include:</p>
 
 A person’s age 
 Substances on an individual’s hand 
 Skin conditions like dermatitis 
 Manual labor 
 
<p>Furthermore, some systems can be fooled by artificial fingerprints made from various materials like silicone or gelatin, a practice known as spoofing.</p>
<p>Multi-factor authentication, which requires more than one form of identification, is an increasingly used method to enhance security.</p>
 Securing Biometric Data: Ethical and Legal Considerations 
<p>While biometric authentication offers many significant benefits, it presents unprecedented privacy and data security challenges. Biometric data, unlike other forms of personal data, is intimately tied to our physical bodies. This makes its theft or misuse potentially more invasive and damaging.</p>
<p>The legal landscape for biometric data is still evolving. In many jurisdictions, existing privacy laws may not be sufficient to cover biometric data. This leaves gaps in protection. Stricter regulations and law enforcement may be necessary to ensure that all biometric information is collected, stored, and used in a manner that respects individual privacy.</p>
<p>Biometric data security isn’t just about preventing unauthorized access to biometric identifiers. It also involves ensuring that the biometric data, once collected, isn’t used for purposes beyond what was initially agreed. This could include selling the data to third parties or using it for surveillance.</p>
 Fingerprint Biometrics in Action: Real-world Applications and Impact 
<p>Fingerprint biometrics extends beyond personal devices and is a cornerstone of modern security across various sectors.</p>
<p>Fingerprints provide irrefutable evidence for law enforcement and forensics teams by helping identify and track suspects. Moreover, businesses and institutions leverage fingerprint biometrics for physical access control, ensuring that only authorized personnel can enter certain premises.</p>
<p>The advent of smartphones equipped with fingerprint sensors has furthered the customer experience and fortified personal device security. Users can unlock their phones, authenticate payments, and secure apps by simply touching a sensor. This biometric authentication offers convenient access control and security while remaining cost effective.</p>
<p>Smart ID cards incorporating fingerprint biometrics are increasingly used in various sectors</p>
 
 Not surprisingly, government and military operations make frequent use of this type of biometric security. 
 However, an automated fingerprint identification system can also be employed in the healthcare industry to allow individuals to gain access to restricted areas. 
 Employees in the education sector can use fingerprint biometrics to enter schools and universities. 
 The corporate world can use this technology to prevent identity theft. 
 Financial systems also integrate fingerprint biometrics, adding a layer of protection over transactions and access to financial services. It helps reduce fraud and ensure customer trust, making it a valuable tool in banking and financial security. 
 
<p>As these real-world case studies illustrate successful implementations of fingerprint identification and other security biometrics. These include visa applications and the distribution of government benefits. Whether securing a company’s computer systems and premises or identifying criminals, fingerprint biometrics have proven their value and substantially impacted security.</p>
 Beyond the Horizon: Future Trends and Innovations in Fingerprint Biometrics 
<p>Fingerprint biometrics, like all technologies, continues to evolve. Several trends and innovations promise to enhance the capabilities and applicability of this technology.</p>
<p>The most recent advancements include 3D fingerprint imaging, which provides a more detailed fingerprint representation that enhances accuracy. Anti-spoofing techniques are also being developed to combat attempts at tricking fingerprint sensors with fake digital fingerprints too.</p>
<p>Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning offers immense possibilities. These technologies can help improve voice recognition algorithms, making them more highly accurate and adaptable.</p>
<p>Despite these advancements, it’s essential to acknowledge that striking a balance between security and privacy with fingerprint technologies remains challenging. As biometric techniques evolve, unfortunately, so will privacy concerns.</p>
 Diversifying Biometric Security: Face and Iris Recognition 
<p>While fingerprints are common biometric security, they aren’t the only biometric technology method available. For instance, facial recognition technology and iris scanning add more layers of protection.</p>
 Facial recognition 
<p>Facial recognition technology uses machine learning algorithms to identify individuals based on their facial features. This technology has seen an increase in use in recent years, especially in surveillance systems and mobile devices. Despite concerns about privacy and misuse, facial recognition is undeniably a powerful tool in biometrics and homeland security.</p>
 Iris scanning 
<p>Another form of biometric identification is iris scanning. This technique scans a person’s irises using infrared technology and analyzes their individual patterns. Iris scans offer a higher level of security due to the iris’s complex structure, which remains stable throughout an individual’s life. However, it can be more expensive and more complicated to implement than other forms of biometrics.</p>
<p>Integrating these methods with fingerprint biometrics can create a multi-modal biometric system, providing businesses with businesses more reliable and robust security.</p>

 Although Peru has a long-standing relationship with gambling and is one of a few South American countries to have allowed local and international companies to operate online casinos and betting sites, recent regulations have changed the game. Here’s what domestic and international operators need to know. 



 



<p>Hot on the heels of Colombia, Argentina (Buenos Aires, Mendoza and Córdoba), and, most recently, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">Brazil</a>, Peru has decided to introduce new regulations and gaming licenses for local and international operators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prior to October 2023, although online gambling in Peru was permitted by the constitution, it operated within a rather relaxed regulatory framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Peruvian market has grown exponentially in the last few years and from the point of view of the customers, the operators and the government, it was mandatory to be on the regulated side of the industry. Recent changes will attract investors, generate an increase in government collection, protect players from responsible gaming and reduce illegal operators,” said Nicholas Osterling, Founder of Peru gaming platform, Playzonbet.</p>



 Brief history of gambling in Peru. 



<p>Peru’s gambling industry has undergone significant changes since it legalized land-based casinos in 1979. Key milestones over the past four decades have included tax regulations and ethical guidelines for casinos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Online gambling regulations emerged later, with the first online casino license issued in 2008. Unlike other South American countries, Peru has never explicitly banned offshore or local online casinos, as long as they met the established domestic standards for any company. This relatively open market approach has attracted numerous international and local brands.</p>



 Clearing the regulatory path for operators. 



<p>MINCETUR is the national administrative authority in charge of regulating, implementing, and overseeing all aspects of online gaming and sports betting in Peru.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Responsibilities include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Issuing licenses to qualified operators.<br>  Monitoring operator activities for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/gambling-compliance/">compliance</a> with regulations.<br>  Enforcing fines, sanctions, or criminal proceedings for non-compliance.<br>  Fostering a safe gambling environment especially for players.&nbsp;  



<p>Within MINCETUR, the Directorate General of Casino Games and Gaming Machines (DGJCMT) is an important executive body that is particularly instrumental in ensuring player protection, improving game quality, and enforcing regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In August 2022, Peru passed Law No. 31557 and its amendment, Law No. 31806, which established a comprehensive legal framework for most gambling activities. These laws were further clarified in 2023 by <a href="https://img.lpderecho.pe/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Decreto-Supremo-005-2023-Mincetur-LPDerecho.pdf">Supreme Decree No. 005-2023</a>, which provided detailed regulations for online sports betting and other real-money gaming services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under these new regulations, international online casino operators must obtain a license from the DGJCMT to operate legally. The decree also outlines the process for obtaining and maintaining a license. Penalties for non-compliance include hefty fines and possible exclusion from the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MINCETUR set a pre-registration phase from February 13 – March 13 for domestic and international gambling operators already active in the market. During this phase, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">remote gaming</a> and sports betting operators, certification laboratories, and service providers could register their interest for preliminary consideration of their applications. Juan Carlos Mathews, Peru’s Minister of Foreign Trade and Tourism, confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamesbras.com/english-version/2024/3/21/peru-receives-145-licence-applications-for-online-gambling-in-30-days-43638.html">145 requests had been received</a> from both national and international companies and for both casino and sports betting business units. Although this stage is now closed, newcomers to the Peru market can continue to apply.</p>

 Objectives of the new Peru gaming license. 



<p>The new Peru gambling license places safety and consumer protection at the forefront of its objectives. With a focus on ensuring a secure environment for players, promoting responsible gambling practices, and formalizing online gaming and sports betting activities, these regulations aim to create a robust and transparent framework for the Peruvian gambling industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, the Peruvian government is opting for a more simplified approach compared to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">complex structure of the Brazilian gambling license.</a></p>



 Secure gaming environment for consumers. 



<p>The regulations prioritize security by implementing measures to protect consumers. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/age-verification/">Age verification</a> requirements and participation restrictions ensure that only adults engage in gambling activities, while strict measures will be in place to prevent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a> and fraud, fostering a safe and secure environment for players. A <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> process must also be in place to verify the age, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/?utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;hsa_acc=5234001163&amp;hsa_cam=21059765194&amp;hsa_grp=&amp;hsa_ad=&amp;hsa_src=x&amp;hsa_tgt=&amp;hsa_kw=&amp;hsa_mt=&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gad_source=1">identity, and nationality of players</a>.</p>



<p>Registration and verification.</p>



<p>To create an account on a gaming platform, players must register with the following data:&nbsp;</p>



<p>i. Full name(s) and surname(s);</p>



<p>ii. Type of identification document;</p>



<p>iii. Identification document number;</p>



<p>iv. Date of birth;</p>



<p>v. Nationality;</p>



<p>vi. Address (address, district, province, and department); and</p>



<p>vii.Statement regarding their status as a Politically Exposed Person (PEP).</p>



<p>Promotion of responsible gaming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new Peruvian regulations promote responsible gaming practices by encouraging operators to implement self-exclusion tools and support programs for players struggling with problem gambling. By raising awareness of the potential risks, the regulations aim to mitigate harm and promote responsible behavior within the industry.&nbsp;Only individuals of legal age (18 years) can register and access a user and gaming account. Gaming accounts will be blocked when the verification of the person’s identity is unsuccessful or is determined the player is registered on any exclusion list.</p>



<p>Preparing for compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the application process, certification laboratories, remote sports betting and gaming operators, and service providers will be asked to enter their details on the <a href="https://extranet.mincetur.gob.pe/extranet2/Home/Inicio">MINCETUR website</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the website is only available in Spanish, international operators are advised to devote the necessary resources to enter information correctly. Accurate information provided during pre-registration is critical to avoid delays and ensure the smooth processing of license applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operators must also ensure they have the necessary technical infrastructure in place, such as robust <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC checks</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operators who do not have a license or fail to comply will face:</p>



  Significant fines.<br>  Revocation of licenses.<br>  Potential criminal charges.  



 Fines for non-compliance in the Peru gambling market. 



<p>Operators who fail to obtain a license while continuing to offer remote gaming could face fines of up to 990,000 Sol, which amounts to approximately £207,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a licensee fails to verify the identity, age, and nationality of players as required by MINCETUR regulations, a fine of between 50-150 Peru tax units will be imposed, which amounts to between £53,500-160,600. It is therefore crucial for operators to implement solid KYC procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Article 243-C of the new law also imposes prison sentences of up to four years for those found to be operating online casino games or sports betting without a proper license.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operating in the Peruvian market without a license may result in exclusion from the market and possible prosecution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Peru aims to generate more revenue from the new Peruvian gaming license by introducing a special gaming tax. The tax rate is set at 12% of the net profits from online gambling activities, to be paid by licensed operators, both domestic and foreign alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The government estimates that the new regulations will generate tax revenues of approximately 162 million Sol (£33.9 million) per year, putting the total size of the Peru gambling market at around £1 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Full enforcement of the new regulations, including licensing requirements and potential penalties for non-compliance, began on April 1, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All companies, both domestic and foreign, operating in the Peruvian online gaming market must comply with the new regulations. Failure to obtain a license while continuing operations will result in fines, exclusions, and criminal charges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To be eligible for a Peruvian gambling license, operators must adhere to security protocols, implement KYC processes to verify player identity and age, and have sound responsible gaming policies in place. Provisions of around £1.2 million must also be in place to prevent money laundering and financial <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/fraud/">fraud</a>.</p>



 The future of gambling in Peru. 



<p>Implementing a licensing regime will obviously have an impact on the profitability of gaming operators in the market. However, the online gaming market in Peru is also expected <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/peru">to grow at a minimum rate of 6.4% per annum.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A regulated online gambling market ensures a clear legal framework for operators to conduct their business and reduces potential legal risks. Increased consumer confidence also leads to higher revenues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Peru is a very traditional market when it comes to sports betting. We Peruvians love soccer, and we are very passionate about betting. The industry here has had several years of growth and now that it will become a regulated market it will be even more attractive for vendors and operators that are only interested in these types of jurisdictions,” added Nicholas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a stable economy and a growing middle class among its 33 million inhabitants, Peru is considered one of the most attractive markets for international gaming operators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Peru emerges as a key player in the Latin American gaming market, operators must quickly adapt to the new regulatory landscape to ensure sustainable growth and success in this dynamic industry.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p><p>When an organization uses a cloud service, it must make sure that it does this in a way that is secure and complies with their obligations. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) provides a broad set of integrated cloud security services to help its customers achieve these objectives. Oracle continuously innovates to improve these services and Oracle Cloud Guard has now been enhanced to provide a complete Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) for OCI.</p>
 Complementary User Entity Controls 
<p>To meet their security and compliance obligations when using OCI the tenant must implement the appropriate controls. The American Institute of CPAs® (AICPA)&nbsp;provides attestations of the security and compliance of cloud services. OCI has a Service Organization Controls (SOC) 2 type 2 attestation that affirms that controls relevant to the&nbsp;AICPA Trust Services Security and Availability Principles&nbsp;are implemented effectively within OCI. This includes a consideration of the <a href="https://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/au-c-00402.pdf">Complementary User Entity Controls</a> (CUECs) that the OCI tenant is expected to implement as well as the capabilities provided by OCI to support these.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Complementary User Entity Controls</p>
<p>OCI offers a full stack of cybersecurity capabilities to help the tenant prevent, protect, monitor, and mitigate cyber threats and control access and encrypt data.&nbsp; These include Oracle Cloud Guard that was first launched in 2020 and enhanced in 2022 to provide Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) for OCI. This detects misconfigurations, insecure activity, and threat activities and provides visibility to triage and resolve cloud security issues.</p>
<p>Oracle Cloud Guard CSPM, together with the other OCI security services, helps the OCI tenant to demonstrate how their CUECs meet their security and compliance objectives.</p>
 Oracle Cloud Guard for CSPM 
<p>Oracle Cloud Guard is an OCI service that helps OCI tenants to maintain a strong security posture on Oracle Cloud.&nbsp; The tenant can use the service to examine their OCI resources for security weakness related to their OCI configuration and monitor their OCI administrators for risky activities. When Cloud Guard detects weaknesses, it can identify appropriate corrective actions and assist in or automate implementing these.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 2: OCI CSPM Storage Bucket Risks Example</p>
<p>Cloud Guard detects security problems within a tenant OCI environment by ingesting activity and configuration data about their resources in each region, processing it based on detector rules, and correlating the problems at the reporting region level. Identified problems can be used to produce dashboards and metrics and may also trigger one or more inbuilt responders to help resolve the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oracle Cloud Guard works together with Oracle Security Zones to provide an always-on security posture. With Security Zones&nbsp;and Cloud Guard the OCI tenant can define policy compliance requirements for groups of resources. Security Zones and Cloud Guard can then enforce these policies to automatically correct and log any violations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cloud Security Posture Management is a valuable tool for organizations to ensure that they use OCI in a secure and compliant manner. OCI provides a very comprehensive range of capabilities for the tenant to secure their use of the services.&nbsp; Oracle Cloud Guard CSPM is one of these and is backed by the expertise and experience of Oracle’s technical teams.&nbsp;</p>
 Cloud Guard for CNAPP 
<p>The distinctive feature of CNAPP is the integration of several capabilities that were previously offered as standalone products. These most often include Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) for identifying vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in cloud infrastructures, Cloud Workload Protection Platforms (CWPP) that deal with runtime protection of workloads deployed in the cloud (such as virtual machines, containers, and Kubernetes, as well as databases and APIs), and Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) for centralized management of rights and permissions across (multi-) cloud environments. Cloud Service Network Security (CSNS) is sometimes included as well, combining such capabilities as web application firewalls, secure web gateways, and DDoS protection. OCI Security Services include many of these capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cloud Guard has provided CSPM capabilities since its launch in 2020.&nbsp; It has now been enhanced to offer further cloud native application security capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cloud Guard Log Insights Detector</p>
<p>Cloud Guard Log Insights Detector, which is not yet generally available, provides a flexible way to capture specific events from logs available in the OCI Logging service. It allows customers to mine all their logs, augmenting out of the box controls to cover all resources and services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It continuously monitors audit, service, and custom logs from Oracle IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS across all subscribed regions, and can be used to detect malicious events that may indicate a threat or a risk that needs to be investigated based on user-defined queries. Data from all services (like VCN flow logs, Object Storage or WAF), the OCI event audit trail and custom application logs can be accessed in every region, and results be centralized for consolidated alerting.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 3: OCI Log Insights Detector</p>
<p>Cloud Guard Instance Security</p>
<p>This provides controls to manage risks and exposures at the compute server, microservices instance / container level. It detects suspicious runtime activities within OCI VMs based on MITRE ATT&amp;CK and creates alerts in real time. It also monitors the integrity of critical system and application files. It comes with a range of predefined detection recipes, based on Oracle’s knowledge and OCI recommended best practices. These can be supplemented with ad hoc and custom scheduled queries.</p>
<p>Cloud Guard Container Security</p>
<p>Cloud-Native Applications are built using a microservices architecture based on containers. Microservices, containers, and Kubernetes have become synonymous with modern DevOps methodologies, continuous delivery, and deployment automation and are seen as a breakthrough in the way to develop and manage cloud-native applications and services.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 4: Examples of container related risks.</p>
<p>However, this approach brings new security challenges and attempts to repurpose existing security tools to protect containerized and microservice-based applications have proven to be inadequate due to their inability to adapt to the scale and ephemeral nature of containers. Static security products that focus on identifying vulnerabilities and malware in container images, while serving a useful purpose, do not address the full range of potential risks.</p>
<p>Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) is an OCI platform for running Kubernetes workloads. Oracle Cloud Guard has been extended to include Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM) for OKE. This helps to protect the DevOps pipeline processes and containers throughout their lifecycle from security vulnerabilities.&nbsp; It includes out-of-the-box configuration policies based on Oracle best practices.&nbsp; The rules also align with industry accepted best practices like CIS benchmarks and regulatory frameworks like US FedRAMP.</p>
 From CSPM to CNAPP 
<p>Since its inception in 2020 Oracle Cloud Guard has enabled OCI tenants to measure their security posture for OCI. These new capabilities extend Cloud Guard beyond CSPM to proactively manage the security of cloud native applications developed and deployed in OCI. This supports Oracle’s vision to make OCI the best platform for enterprises to develop and deploy secure and compliant applications.&nbsp; Organizations using OCI should review these new capabilities and adopt them where appropriate.</p>

<p>Fission is winding down active operations. The team is wrapping things up and ending employment and contractor status by the end of May 2024.</p><p>Fission has been a venture investment funded company since 2019. Our last round, led by Protocol Labs, was raised as part of joining the Protocol Labs network as a “blue team”, focused on protocol research and implementation. The hypothesis was to get paid by the network, including in Filecoin FIL grants for alignment with the network.</p><p>In Q4 of 2023, it was clear that our hypothesis of getting paid directly for protocol research wasn’t going to work.</p><p>We did a round of lay offs and focused on productizing our compute stack, powered by the IPVM protocol, as the <a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Everywhere Computer</a>. The team has shipped this as a working decentralized, content-addressable compute system in the past 6 months.</p><p>Unfortunately, we have not been able to find further venture fundraising that is a match for us.</p> What about the projects that Fission works on? <p>The majority of Fission’s code is available under open source licenses. The protocols we’ve worked on have been developed in working groups, with a community of other collaborators, and have their home base in shared Github organizations:</p>  UCAN: capability-based decentralized auth using DIDs <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg">https://github.com/ucan-wg</a>  WNFS: encrypted file system <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg">https://github.com/wnfs-wg</a>  IPVM: content-addressable compute <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">https://github.com/ipvm-wg</a>  <p>Various people on the team, as well as other people and organizations, continue to build on the open source code we’ve developed.</p><p>Fission does have active publishing and DNS infrastructure that we'll be winding down, and will be reaching out to people about timing for that.</p> Thanks <p>Thank you to everyone for your support, interest, and collaboration over the years. Many of us have been involved in protocols and open source implementations for a long time, and have seen them have impact far after they were first created.

<p>In the world of identity management, the struggle is real. Identity management involves controlling and managing user identities, access rights, and privileges within an organization. At YeshID, we’ve seen it all: from Google App Scripts built inside Sheets to Notion databases, full of outdated and fragmented documentation. We’ve seen people who have unexpectedly inherited the identity management job and people spending all their time reacting to HR onboarding and offboarding surprises. We’ve seen managed service providers with creative solutions that too often fall short. And we’ve seen IAM vendors overpromising integration and seamless system management and delivering upgrade prices and uncontrolled manual processes.</p>
<p>It’s like a tangled web of issues that can leave you feeling trapped and overwhelmed. The result? A complex set of challenges that can hinder productivity, security, and growth:</p>
 
 Workflow Issues
 
 Redundant Workflows: You have workflows dedicated to verifying automation, manually handling unautomatable tasks, and fine-tuning access in each app, including sending requests and reminders to app owners and the time-consuming quarterly access reviews. 
 Workflow Dependencies: Intertwined workflows make it hard to untangle them, leading to a domino effect when changes are made. 
 Bottlenecks and Delays: Manual steps and the need to chase approvals slow down processes, causing frustration and reduced efficiency. 
 
 
 Data Management and Accuracy
 
 Data Inconsistency: Manual intervention and multiple workflows increase the likelihood of data inconsistencies, such as discrepancies in user information across different systems, leading to confusion and potential security risks. 
 Email Address Standardization: Maintaining a consistent email address format (e.g., firstName.lastName@) can help with organization, but ensuring conventions are followed can be complex, especially as the organization grows.. 
 
 
 Security
 
 Secure Access: Enforcing secure access practices is non-negotiable, but it’s an uphill battle, including:
 
 MFA: Multi-Factor Authentication adds protection against compromised credentials, but getting everyone to comply can be a challenge. 
 Secure Recovery Paths: Ensuring account recovery methods aren’t easily exploitable is crucial, but often overlooked, leaving potential gaps in security.. 
 Principle of Least Privilege: Limiting user permissions to only what’s necessary for their roles is a best practice, but permissions can creep up over time, leading to excessive access rights and failing compliance audits. 
 Regular Updates and Patching: Keeping systems updated and patched is essential to address vulnerabilities and maintain a secure environment. 
 
 
 
 
 Compliance
 
 Compliance Concerns: Meticulously designing workflows to collect evidence that satisfies compliance and regulatory requirements is time-consuming and often confusing. 
 
 
 Operational and Growth Challenges
 
 Knowledge Silos: Manual processes mean knowledge is held by a few individuals, creating vulnerabilities and making it hard for others to step in when needed, hindering business continuity. 
 Audit Difficulties: A mix of automated and manual workflows without proper documentation makes audits challenging and prone to errors, increasing the risk of non-compliance. 
 Difficulty Scaling: As the organization grows, the complexity of fragmented processes hinders growth potential, making it difficult to onboard new employees and manage access rights efficiently. 
 Complex Offboarding: Workflows must ensure proper, gradual account removal to balance security, archiving, business continuity, and legal compliance concerns. 
 Mandatory Training: Tracking mandatory training like security awareness within the first month of employment is an ongoing struggle. 
 Group and OU Assignments: Correctly placing users in groups and organizational units is key for managing permissions, but automating this requires careful alignment between automation rules and the company’s organizational structure, which can be challenging to maintain. 
 
 
 
 Recommendations: Untangling the Web 
<p>YeshID’s YeshList gives you a way to untangle the process web organizing centrally, distributing the workload, and coordinating actions.&nbsp;</p>
 
 Implement Company-Wide Accountability
 
 Establish a regular cadence for an access review campaign to ensure permissions are regularly reviewed and updated. 
 Create a simple form for managers to review access for their team members, making it easy for them to participate in the process. 
 Use a ticketing system or workflow tool to track requests and ensure accountability, providing visibility into the status of each request. 
 
 
 Embrace Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
 
 Design granular roles based on common job functions to streamline access granting, reducing the need for individual access requests. 
 Track roles in a spreadsheet, including Role Name, Description, Permissions Included, and Role Owner, to maintain a clear overview of available roles and their associated permissions. 
 Upgrade to Google Groups for decentralized role ownership, employee-initiated join requests, and automation possibilities, empowering teams to manage their own access needs. 
 Use RBAC to speed up audits by shifting focus from individual permissions to role appropriateness, simplifying the audit process. 
 Tool Examples: Google Workspace allows custom roles, but other identity management solutions may offer more robust RBAC capabilities. 
 
 
 Conduct Regular Application-Level Access Reviews
 
 Periodically review user access within each critical application to close potential security gaps and ensure that access rights align with job requirements. 
 Restrict access to applications using your company’s domain to improve security and prevent unauthorized access from external accounts. 
 Utilize tools like Steampipe or CloudQuery to automate the integration of application access lists with your employee directory, enabling regular comparisons and alerts for discrepancies, saving time and reducing manual effort. 
 
 
 Invest in Centralized Workflow Management
 
 Consolidate Workflows: Map existing processes, find overlaps, and merge them within a centralized tool. 
 Prioritize High-Impact Automation First: Target repetitive, time-consuming tasks to get the most value. 
 
 
 Prioritize Data Standardization and Integrity
 
 Define clear rules for email addresses, naming, and data entry, and enforce them during account creation to maintain data consistency across systems. 
 Implement input validation to catch inconsistencies early, preventing data quality issues from propagating throughout the organization. 
 Schedule data hygiene checks to identify and correct discrepancies between systems. 
 Use a tool or script for account creation to ensure consistency. 
 
 
 Strengthen Security with Key Enhancements
 
 Mandate MFA for all accounts. 
 Review Recovery Methods: Favor authenticator apps or hardware keys over less secure methods. 
 Regularly review user access levels and enforce least privilege principles. 
 Use your company’s Identity Provider (IdP) for authentication whenever possible to centralize access control and simplify user management. 
 
 
 Make Compliance a Focus, Not an Afterthought
 
 Document Workflows Thoroughly: Include decision points and rationale for auditing purposes. 
 Build requirements for proof of compliance directly into your automated workflows. 
 
 
 Tackle Operational Challenges Head-On
 
 Reduce errors with in-workflow guidance, providing clear instructions and prompts to guide users through complex processes. 
 Cross-train IT team members to reduce single points of failure. 
 Develop templates for recurring processes to streamline efforts and ensure consistency. 
 
 
 Democratize Identity Management
 
 Empower employees and managers to resolve access requests whenever possible through:
 
 Automated Approval Workflows: Set up workflows with pre-defined rules to grant access based on criteria. 
 Manager Approvals: Delegate access request approvals to direct managers for their teams. 
 Self-Service Access Management: Consider a self-service portal for employees to request and manage basic access needs. 
 Empowered Employees and Managers: Enable employees and managers to add or remove employee accounts for specific apps as needed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Light at the End of the Tunnel 
<p>As you evaluate solutions, keep these factors in mind:</p>
 
 Cost-Effectiveness: Prioritize solutions with free tiers or flexible pricing models. 
 Ease of Use: Choose tools with intuitive interfaces to encourage adoption. 
 Scalability: Ensure solutions can grow with your company.

<p>In the fast-paced and high-stakes industry of high-volume card production, minimizing rejects is crucial not only for operational efficiency but also for maintaining a competitive edge. To achieve this, best-in-class manufacturers are turning to data analytics as a powerful tool to identify, analyze, and address the root causes of rejects. Data analytics is revolutionizing the smart card manufacturing landscape and helping businesses enhance their quality control processes.</p>
<p>The Power of Data Analytics in Manufacturing</p>
<p>Data analytics involves the use of advanced algorithms and statistical methods to analyze large sets of data, extracting meaningful insights and patterns. In the context of high-volume card production, data analytics provides manufacturers with a comprehensive understanding of the entire manufacturing process from start to finish. This insight allows for informed decision-making and targeted improvements in areas prone to defects or rejects.</p>
<p>One of the primary benefits of data analytics in minimizing rejects is its ability to identify and highlight patterns and anomalies in the manufacturing process. By analyzing historical data and trends, manufacturers can pinpoint specific stages or conditions that lead to a higher likelihood of rejects. This proactive approach enables preemptive measures to be implemented, reducing the occurrence of defects before they become a serious issue.</p>
<p>Data analytics also facilitates real-time monitoring of the manufacturing process. With sensors on the equipment, manufacturers can collect and analyze data in real-time, allowing for immediate identification of anomalies or deviations from established quality standards. This enables swift corrective actions, minimizing the overall number of card rejects.</p>
<p>Integrating Data Analytics into Quality Control Processes</p>
<p>To fully leverage the potential of data analytics in minimizing rejects, manufacturers must integrate it seamlessly into their quality control processes. This involves:</p>
 
 Data Collection Infrastructure – Establishing a robust infrastructure for data collection, including sensors and monitoring software across the production line. 
 Data Processing and Analysis – Implementing advanced data processing and analysis tools to derive actionable insights from the collected data. 
 Real-Time Reporting – Setting up real-time reporting mechanisms to enable immediate response to deviations from quality standards. This ensures that corrective actions can be taken swiftly, minimizing the impact on production efficiency. 
 Continuous Improvement – Creating a culture of continuous improvement by regularly reviewing and updating the data analytics system based on evolving manufacturing conditions and emerging trends in smart card technology. 
 
<p>Transformative Impact of Data Analytics − A Recent Opportunity &nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently, a large financial client solicited our assistance in analyzing their operational health and overall quality. They simply wanted to track, report, and plan for operational efficiency where minimal measures were currently in place at their issuance facility. They needed clear insight and root cause diagnostics to assess the what, when, and how of production inefficiencies hindering their operational plan. In addition, they needed a solution that helped them maintain complete control of their end-to-end issuance production, from supplies and rejects to idle time and availability.</p>
<p>After a thorough analysis using <a href="https://www.entrust.com/issuance-systems/products/software/adaptive-issuance-production-analytics-solution">Entrust’s Adaptive Issuance Production Analytics Solution</a> (PAS), it was determined that the customer’s biggest Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) impact areas were machine utilization (Availability) and the number of reject cards (Quality). The analysis provided our client with a recommended action plan, including anticipated improvements based on their operational environment, specific machine layout, and configurations. Both outcomes were pivotal in increasing overall quality through deeper data interrogations.</p>
<p>Outcome #1 − Availability</p>
<p>In the above example, our digital intelligence identified compelling trend information in two areas. The first was a noticeable gap in the amount of idle time between machines, which led to further investigation into the operators themselves at each station. By enabling the “idle time tracking” feature, a complete picture of all operator activities between runs and during pause time showed a sizable disparity from machine to machine. This helped the client address critical labor differences and immediately laid the foundation to drive a continuous improvement plan, initiating best practices across the production floor.</p>
<p>Outcome #2 − Quality</p>
<p>The second finding determined that a significant percentage of rejects were all traced to a limited number of error codes. Similar to the first outcome, the client was able to investigate through a focused, root-cause analysis, driving their investigation quickly to assess and pinpoint the failures. The result was a significantly improved reject rate. Without a focused analytics-based assessment of their environment, this client was left to guess how and why inefficiencies were happening. The dynamic PAS dashboard was instrumental in identifying these inefficiencies and leading improvement plans for a more stable, healthy, and efficient operation.</p>
<p>In the dynamic landscape of high-volume card production, where precision and efficiency are paramount to the bottom line, leveraging data analytics is no longer a nice-to-have, but rather a necessity. Manufacturers that embrace data-driven approaches to quality control can minimize card rejects, enhance operational efficiency, and ultimately deliver superior smart card products to the market. As technology continues to advance, the integration of data analytics into manufacturing processes will play an increasingly pivotal role in shaping the future of high-volume card production. By harnessing the power of data, manufacturers can stay ahead of the competition and ensure that every smart card produced meets the highest standards of quality.</p>

<p>The short answer is yes. The long answer is they will, but quick action could ease the damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Quantum computers harness the laws of quantum mechanics to quickly solve problems too complex for classical computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Complex problems” are ones with so many variables interacting in complicated ways that no classical computer at any scale could solve them—at least not within tens of thousands or even millions of years.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing">IBM</a> gives the example of a classical computer being able to sort through a big database of molecules, but struggling to simulate how those molecules behave.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s these complex problems that the world would enormously benefit from solving and that quantum computers are being developed to handle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/tip/Explore-future-potential-quantum-computing-uses">Use cases</a> for quantum computing are emerging across industries for simulations (e.g. simulating molecular structures in drug discovery or climate modelling) and optimization (e.g. optimizing shipping routes and flight paths, enhancing machine learning algorithms, or developing advanced materials).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the quantum age won’t be all upside. The quantum threats you might have read about are real. Here are 4 things you must know:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br></p>



 1. Quantum computers present a massive cyber threat to the world’s secured data&nbsp; 



<p><br>Since quantum computers can solve complex computational problems far faster than any classical computer, the day will come when they will be sufficiently powerful and error-resistant to break conventional encryption algorithms (RSA, DSS, Diffie-Hellman, TLS/SSL, etc.) and expose the world’s vast stores of secured data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The future technology will use what’s known as <a href="https://www.qutube.nl/quantum-algorithms/shors-algorithm">Shor’s algorithm</a> and other quantum algorithms to break all public key systems that employ integer factorization-based and other cryptography, rendering these conventional encryption algorithms obsolete and putting at risk global communications, stored data, and networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>All protected financial transactions, trade secrets, health information, critical infrastructure networks, classified databases, blockchain technology, satellite communications, supply chain information, defence and national security data, and more, will be vulnerable to attack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This video explains exactly how quantum computers will one day “break the internet”:&nbsp;<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-UrdExQW0cs?feature=oembed"></a></p>



<a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-UrdExQW0cs?feature=oembed"></a>



 &nbsp;<br>2. The cyber threat from quantum computing is now urgent&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>If a recent <a href="https://www.govtech.com/blogs/lohrmann-on-cybersecurity/quantum-computers-what-is-q-day-and-whats-the-solution">Chinese report</a> could be proven, <a href="https://www.govtech.com/blogs/lohrmann-on-cybersecurity/quantum-computers-what-is-q-day-and-whats-the-solution">“Q-Day”</a>—the point at which large quantum computers will break the world’s encryption algorithms—could come as soon as 2025. Until now, estimates had put it 5–20 years away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bad actors, as well as nation-states such as <a>Russia and China</a>, are already intercepting and stockpiling data for “steal now, decrypt later” (SNDL) attacks by future quantum computers, and experts are urging organizations to pay attention and prepare now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The financial sector is particularly vulnerable and will require rapid development of robust quantum communication and data protection regimes. The transition will take time and, with Q-Day already on the immediate horizon, experts agree there’s <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/653471/preparing-for-the-post-quantum-cryptography-environment-today.html">no time to waste</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Top of Form&nbsp;</p>



 3.&nbsp; The world is already mobilizing against quantum threats&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Governments and industry have had decades to plan their defence against the encryption-busting potential of quantum computers, and now things are heating up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alibaba, Amazon, IBM, Google, and Microsoft have already launched commercial quantum-computing cloud services and in December 2023 IBM launched its next iteration of a quantum computer, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum/technology#ibm-quantum-system-two">IBM Quantum System Two</a>, the most powerful known example of the technology (but still not there in terms of the power required to crack current encryption techniques).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Importantly, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will this year release four <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2023/08/nist-standardize-encryption-algorithms-can-resist-attack-quantum-computers">post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) standards</a> “to protect against future, potentially adversarial, cryptanalytically-relevant quantum computer (CRQC) capabilities. A CRQC would have the potential to break public-key systems (sometimes referred to as asymmetric cryptography) that are used to protect information systems today.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/571721/collect-today-decrypt-tomorrow-how-russia-and-china-are-preparing-for-quantum-computing.html">goal</a> is to develop cryptographic systems that are secure against both quantum and classical computers and can interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks.&nbsp;<br></p>



 4. Organizations are being urged to prepare now&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>In late August 2023 the US Government published its <a href="http://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/media.defense.gov/2023/Aug/21/2003284212/-1/-1/0/CSI-QUANTUM-READINESS.PDF">quantum readiness guide</a> with advice for organization from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) about how to proactively develop and build capabilities to secure critical information and systems from being compromised by quantum computers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The advice for organizations, particularly those supporting critical infrastructure, is in four parts:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Establish a quantum readiness roadmap.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Engage with technology vendors to discuss post-quantum roadmaps.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Conduct an inventory to identify and understand cryptographic systems and assets.&nbsp; 
 



 
 Create migration plans that prioritize the most sensitive and critical assets.&nbsp; 
 



<p>The US Government says it’s urging immediate action since “many of the cryptographic products, protocols, and services used today that rely on public key algorithms (e.g., RivestShamir-Adleman [RSA], Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman [ECDH], and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm [ECDSA]) will need to be updated, replaced, or significantly altered to employ quantum-resistant PQC algorithms, to protect against this future threat.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Organizations are encouraged to proactively prepare for future migration to products implementing the post-quantum cryptographic standards.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alongside the readiness guide is a <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/matrix-game-quantum-technologies">game</a> from the CISA, designed to help organizations across the critical infrastructure community identify actionable insights about the future and emerging risks, and proactively develop risk management strategies to implement now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The clear message in all the government advice and industry action is to be prepared such that your organization is ready to enact a seamless transition when quantum computing does become reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Rob Joyce, Director of NSA Cybersecurity, says: “The transition to a secured quantum computing era is a long-term intensive community effort that will require extensive collaboration between government and industry. The key is to be on this journey today and not wait until the last minute.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/653471/preparing-for-the-post-quantum-cryptography-environment-today.html">CSO</a> writer sums it up this way: “This is not a light lift, it is indeed a heavy lift, yet a necessary lift. Sitting on the sidelines and waiting is not an option.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>Is your organization already planning for quantum cryptography?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read the US Government’s <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3498776/post-quantum-cryptography-cisa-nist-and-nsa-recommend-how-to-prepare-now/">readiness guide</a>.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Microsoft Entra is not only the identity system for users; it’s also the identity and access management (IAM) system for Azure-based services, all internal infrastructure services at Microsoft, and our customers’ workload identities. This is why our 99.99% service-level promise extends to workload identity authentication, and why we continue to improve our service’s resilience through a multilayered approach that includes the backup authentication system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2021, we introduced the backup authentication system, as an industry-first innovation that automatically and transparently handles authentications for supported workloads when the primary Microsoft Entra ID service is degraded or unavailable. Through 2022 and 2023, we continued to expand the coverage of the backup service across clouds and application types.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we’ll build on our <a href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fblog%2Fadvancing-azure-active-directory-availability%2F&amp;data=05%7C02%7Csdriggers%40affirma.com%7Cf42f60520e8241d6f48108dc4d11a2a1%7C65265dd04b2044a4aca4b7ecbb143664%7C0%7C0%7C638469985375289828%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=4E80MYl8uCYinrptGG1ZUiGZpkrpO9zGTiT8PDAWJsQ%3D&amp;reserved=0">resilience blogpost series </a>by going further in sharing how workload identities gain resilience from the regionally isolated authentication endpoints as well as from the backup authentication system. We’ll explore two complementary methods that best fit our regional-global infrastructure. One example of workload identity authentication is when an Azure virtual machine (VM) authenticates its identity to Azure Storage. Another example is when one of our customers’ workloads authenticates to application programming interfaces (APIs). &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Regionally isolated authentication endpoints&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regionally isolated authentication endpoints provide region-isolated authentication services to an Azure region. All frequently used identities will authenticate successfully without dependencies on other Azure regions. Essentially, they are the primary endpoints for Azure infrastructure services as well as the primary endpoints for managed identities in Azure (<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview">Managed identities for Azure resources - Microsoft Entra ID | Microsoft Learn</a>). Managed identities help prevent out-of-region failures by consolidating service dependencies, and improving resilience by handling certificate expiry, rotation, and trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This layer of protection and isolation does not need any configuration changes from Azure customers. Key Azure infrastructure services have already adopted it, and it’s integrated with the managed identities service to protect the customer workloads that depend on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How regionally isolated authentication endpoints work&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each Azure region is assigned a unique endpoint for workload identity authentication. The region is served by a regionally collocated, special instance of Microsoft Entra ID. The regional instance relies on caching metadata (for example, directory data that is needed to issue tokens locally) to respond efficiently and resiliently to the workload identity’s authentication requests. This lightweight design reduces dependencies on other services and improves resilience by allowing the entire authentication to be completed within a single region. Data in the local cache is proactively refreshed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The regional service depends on Microsoft Entra ID's global service to update and refill caches when it lacks the data it needs (a cache miss) or when it detects a change in the security posture for a supported service. If the regional service experiences an outage, requests are served seamlessly by Microsoft Entra ID’s global service, making the regional service interruption invisible to the customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Performant, resilient, and widely available&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The service has proven itself since 2020 and now serves six billion requests per day across the globe.&nbsp; The regional endpoints, working with global services, exceed 99.99% SLA. The resilience of Azure infrastructure is further protected by workload-side caches kept by Azure client SDKs. Together, the regional and global services have managed to make most service degradations undetectable by dependent infrastructure services. Post-incident recovery is handled automatically. Regional isolation is supported by public and all Sovereign Clouds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infrastructure authentication requests are processed by the same Azure datacenter that hosts the workloads along with their co-located dependencies. This means that endpoints that are isolated to a region also benefit from performance advantages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Backup authentication system to cover workload identities for infrastructure authentication&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For workload identity authentication that does not depend on managed identities, we’ll rely on the backup authentication system to add fault-tolerant resilience.&nbsp; In our <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/advancing-service-resilience-in-azure-active-directory-with-its-backup-authentication-service/">blogpost</a> from November 2021, we explained the approach for user authentication which has been generally available for some time. The system operates in the Microsoft cloud but on separate and decorrelated systems and network paths from the primary Microsoft Entra ID system. This means that it can continue to operate in case of service, network, or capacity issues across many Microsoft Entra ID and dependent Azure services. We are now applying that successful approach to workload identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Backup coverage of workload identities is currently rolling out systematically across Microsoft, starting with Microsoft 365’s largest internal infrastructure services in the first half of 2024. Microsoft Entra ID customer workload identities’ coverage will follow in the second half of 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Protecting your own workloads&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The benefits of both regionally isolated endpoints and the backup authentication system are natively built into our platform. To further optimize the benefits of current and future investments in resilience and security, we encourage developers to use the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) and leverage managed identities whenever possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s next?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to assure our customers that our 99.99% uptime guarantee remains in place, along with our ongoing efforts to expand our backup coverage system and increase our automatic backup coverage to include all infrastructure authentication—even for third-party developers—in the next year. We’ll make sure to keep you updated on our progress, including planned improvements to our system capacity, performance, and coverage across all clouds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Introducing Leandexer: Simplifying Blockchain Data Interaction 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in March 2024.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>A few years ago, Tokeny encountered some challenges in maintaining and scaling its infrastructure as blockchain data indexing can be quite complex with advanced smart contracts. We were limited by existing indexing tools like The Graph and decided to invest massively in the development of our own indexer solution for our tokenization platform.</p>
<p>Issues such as unsynchronized blockchain data and disruptions to other operations during token and event indexing were costly to maintain and hard to use.&nbsp;With our in-house indexer, these challenges were effectively resolved.</p>
 Opening Our Indexer to Third-Parties 
<p>This experience led us to realize that&nbsp;many other companies shared similar frustrations&nbsp;with existing indexing solutions, regardless of their size or industry. Recognizing the widespread need for a reliable indexer solution,&nbsp;we decided to launch&nbsp;Leandexer, a standalone version of our in-house indexer, available as a SaaS solution.</p>

  <p>I’m thrilled to announce the public preview of advanced certificate-based authentication (CBA) options in Conditional Access, which provides the ability to allow access to specific resources based on the certificate Issuer or Policy Object Identifiers (OIDs) properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our customers, particularly those in highly regulated industries and government, have expressed the need for more flexibility in their CBA configurations. Using the same certificate for all Entra ID federated applications is not always sufficient. Some resources may require access with a certificate issued by specific issuers, while other resources require access based on a specific policy OIDs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, a company like Contoso may issue three different types of multifactor certificates via Smart Cards to employees, each distinguished by properties such as Policy OID or issuer. These certificates may correspond to different levels of security clearance, such as Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret. Contoso needs to ensure that only users with the appropriate multifactor certificate can access data of the corresponding classification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Authentication strength - advanced CBA options</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>With the authentication strength capability in Conditional Access, customers can now create a custom authentication strength policy, with advanced CBA options to allow access based on certificate issuer or policy OIDs. For external users whose multifactor authentication (MFA) is trusted from partners' Entra ID tenant, access can also be restricted based on these properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This adds flexibility to CBA, in addition to the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/advancing-cybersecurity-the-latest-enhancement-in-phishing/ba-p/2365681">recent updates we shared in December</a>.

  <p>In November 2023 at <a href="https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/07952ef8-8603-4a94-8185-975ae95e53bb?source=sessions">Microsoft Ignite</a>, we announced Microsoft-managed policies and the auto-rollout of multifactor authentication (MFA)-related Conditional Access&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">policies</a> in customer tenants. Since then, we’ve rolled out report-only policies for over 500,000 tenants. These policies are part of our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/02/announcing-microsoft-secure-future-initiative-to-advance-security-engineering/">Secure Future Initiative,</a>&nbsp;which includes key engineering advances to improve security for customers against cyberthreats that we anticipate will increase over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This follow-up blog will dive deeper into these policies to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of what they entail and how they function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  Multifactor authentication for admins accessing Microsoft admin portals 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Admin accounts with elevated privileges are more likely to be attacked, so enforcing MFA for these roles protects these privileged administrative functions. This policy covers 14 admin roles that we consider to be highly privileged, requiring administrators to perform multifactor authentication when signing into Microsoft admin portals. This policy targets Microsoft Entra ID P1 and P2 tenants, where security defaults aren't enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Multifactor authentication for per-user multifactor authentication users 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Per-user MFA is when users are enabled individually and are required to perform multifactor authentication each time they sign in (with some exceptions, such as when they sign in from trusted IP addresses or when the remember MFA on trusted devices feature is turned on). For customers who are licensed for Entra ID P1, Conditional Access offers a better admin experience with many additional features, including <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-users-groups">user group</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-cloud-apps">application</a> targeting, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-conditions">more conditions</a> such as risk- and device-based, integration with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-strengths">authentication strengths</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-session">session controls</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-report-only">report-only mode</a>. This can help you be more targeted in requiring MFA, lowering end user friction while maintaining security posture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy covers users with per-user MFA. These users are targeted by Conditional Access and are now required to perform multifactor authentication for all cloud apps. It aids organizations’ transition to Conditional Access seamlessly, ensuring no disruption to end user experiences while maintaining a high level of security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy targets licensed users with Entra ID P1 and P2, where the security defaults policy isn't enabled and there are less than 500 per-user MFA enabled enabled/enforced users. There will be no change to the end user experience due to this policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Multifactor authentication and reauthentication for risky sign-ins 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy will help your organization achieve the Optimal level for Risk Assessments in the NIST <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/zero_trust_maturity_model_v2_508.pdf">Zero Trust Maturity Model</a> because it provides a key layer of added security assurance that triggers only when we detect high-risk sign-ins. “High-risk sign-in” means there is a very high probability that a given authentication request isn't the authorized identity owner and could indicate brute force, password spray, or token replay attacks. By dynamically responding to sign-in risk, this policy disrupts active attacks in real-time while remaining invisible to most users, particularly those who don’t have high sign-in risk. When Identity Protection detects an attack, your users will be prompted to self-remediate with MFA and reauthenticate to Entra ID, which will reset the compromised session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks%22%20/l%20%22sign-in-risk-detections">Learn more about sign-in risk</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy covers all users in Entra ID P2 tenants, where security defaults aren't enabled, all active users are already registered for MFA, and there are enough licenses for each user. As with all policies, ensure you exclude any break-glass or service accounts to avoid locking yourself out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies have been created in all eligible tenants in Report-only mode. These policies are suggestions from Microsoft that organizations can adapt and use for their own environment. Administrators can view and review these policies in the <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_ConditionalAccess/ConditionalAccessBlade/~/Policies/fromNav/Identity">Conditional Access policies blade</a>. To enhance the policies, administrators are encouraged to add customizations such as excluding <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-policy-common?tabs=secure-foundation#user-exclusions">emergency accounts and service accounts</a>. Once ready, the policies can be moved to the ON state. For additional customization needs, administrators have the flexibility to clone the policies and make further adjustments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Call to Action 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't wait – take action now. Enable the Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies now and/or customize the Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies according to your organizational needs. Your proactive approach to implementing multifactor authentication policies is crucial in fortifying your organization against evolving security threats.

  <p>Today <a href="https://aka.ms/CopilotforSecurityGA">we announced</a> that Microsoft Copilot for Security will be generally available worldwide on April 1. The following new Microsoft Entra skills will be available in the standalone Copilot for Security experience: User Details, Group Details, Sign-in Logs, Audit Logs, and Diagnostic Logs. User Risk Investigation, a skill embedded in Microsoft Entra, will also be available in public preview.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These skills help identity admins protect against identity compromise through providing identity context and insights for security incidents and helping to resolve identity-related risks and sign-in issues. We’re excited to bring new identity capabilities to Copilot for Security and help identity and security operators <a href="http://aka.ms/copilotforsecurity">protect at machine speed.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Identity skills in Copilot for Security&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at what each of these new Entra Skills in Copilot for Security do to help identity professionals secure access, while easily integrating into any admin's daily workflow via natural language prompts:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User details can quickly surface context on any user managed in Entra, such as username, location, job title, contact information, authentication methods, the account creation date, and account status. Admins can prompt Copilot with phrases like "tell me more about this user”, “list the active users created in the last 5 days”, “what authentication methods does this user have”, and “is this user’s account enabled” to pull up this kind of information in a matter of seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Group details can summarize details on any group managed in Entra.&nbsp; Admins can ask Copilot questions like “who is the owner of group X?”, “tell me about the group that starts with XYZ”, and “how many members are in this group?” for immediate context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sign-in logs can highlight information about sign-in logs and conditional access policies applied to your tenant to assist with identity investigations and troubleshooting. Admins must simply instruct their Copilot to “show me recent sign-ins for this user”, “show me the sign-ins from this IP address”, or “show me the failed sign-ins for this user.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audit logs can help isolate anomalies associated with audit logs, including changes to roles and access privileges. Admins just have to ask Copilot to “show me audit logs for actions initiated by this user” or “show me the audit logs for this kind of event”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An identity admin, who has identified a risky user under the username ‘rashok’, asks Copilot for the March 5th audit logs for ‘rashok’ to discover what actions that user took while at a heightened risk of compromise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diagnostic logs can help assess the health and completeness of your tenant's policy configurations. This helps ensure sign-in and audit logs are correctly set up, and that there are no gaps in the log collection process. Admins can ask “what logs are being collected in my tenant” or “are audit logs enabled” to quickly remediate any gaps.&nbsp;</p>

 Using Copilot in Entra for risk investigation&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get a better picture of how Copilot for Security can increase the speed at which you respond to identity risks, let’s imagine a scenario in which a user is flagged for having a high-risk level due to several abnormal sign-in attempts. With the User Risk Investigation skill in Microsoft Entra, available in public preview with Copilot for Security, admins can get an analysis of the user risk level coupled with recommendations on how to mitigate an incident and resolve the situation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An identity admin notices that a user has been flagged as high risk due to a series of abnormal sign-ins. With Copilot for Security, the admin can quickly investigate and resolve the risk by clicking on the user in question to receive an immediate summary of risk and instructions for remediation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copilot summarizes in natural language why the user risk level was elevated. Then, Copilot provides an actionable list of steps to help nullify the risk and close the alert. Finally, Copilot provides a series of recommendations an identity admin can take to automate the response to identity threats, minimizing exposure to a compromised identity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We came across this recent Joint Cybersecurity Advisory paper: “<a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-02/aa24-046a-threat-actor-leverages-compromised%20account-of%20former-employee.pdf">Threat Actor Leverages Compromised Account of Former Employee to Access State Government Organization</a>,” co-authored by the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Multi-State Information Sharing &amp; Analysis Center (MS-ISAC). The topic strikes a familiar chord, yet we both appreciate the thorough analysis provided by the authors to educate cybersecurity professionals on the details and mitigating factors. In our view, sharing real life experiences helps get the message across more impactfully than discussing abstract threat models and hypothetical attacks.</p>
<p>It makes you think … Do you know how quickly your organization responds to an employee or contractor leaving the organization? How unified are your HR and IT functions? Is your identity and access management (IAM) solution fit for the 21st century? With social engineering attacks such as phishing and man in the middle (MiTM) getting more sophisticated, do you have the tools in place to protect against them?</p>
<p>Let’s first look at the method used by the hacker described in this advisory paper and see what lessons we can learn from this attack.</p>
<p>Unidentified Threat Actor</p>
<p>The hack started with a government agency being alerted to a U.S. government employee’s credentials, host, and user information being offered for sale on the dark web. The incident response assessment determined that “an unidentified threat actor compromised network administrator credentials through the account of a former employee … to successfully authenticate to an internal virtual private network (VPN) access point … .”</p>
<p>The hacker then moved onto targeting the ex-employee’s on-prem environment, running several lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) queries, and then moving laterally into their Azure environment.</p>
<p>The good news is the hacker didn’t appear to have progressed much further, presumably satisfied they had valid credentials that they could sell to other hackers to continue their nefarious acts.</p>
<p>The advisory paper references the MITRE ATT&amp;CK® framework, which we’ve illustrated below.</p>
<p>These are the steps a threat actor would typically follow as they carry out an attack –&nbsp;starting at the 12 o’clock position (Reconnaissance), moving clockwise to Resource Development all the way to Impact.</p>
<p>NOTE: For more details about the typical stages of an attack and a comprehensive database of real threats used by adversaries, visit <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">attack.mitre.org</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: MITRE ATT&amp;CK illustration of the threat actor’s modus operandi</p>
<p>USER1, referenced in the paper, likely followed these steps in sourcing the former employee’s credentials and then used them to access the network. Once on the network, they were able to locate a second set of credentials, labeled USER2. The advisory paper charts the progress of USER1 and USER2 through these stages as far as the Collection stage, where “the actor obtained USER2 account credentials from the virtualized SharePoint server managed by USER1.” As we mentioned, progress seems to have stalled and the paper states: “Analysis determined the threat actor did not move laterally from the compromised on-premises network to the Azure environment and did not compromise sensitive systems.”</p>
<p>Mitigations</p>
<p>What’s clear from the report is several simple errors facilitated this hack. Below, we’ve added some best practices to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK illustration to show how to mitigate those errors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The joint Cybersecurity Advisory paper is a reminder of how threat actors are poised and ready to exploit weaknesses in an organization’s security posture. Some straightforward security measures would’ve halted this attack before it had even started. However, we know that threat actors are evolving and implementing more sophisticated attacks. Organizations might not always leave the door open, but they might not have secured the latch and attached the door chain to bolster their security posture.</p>
<p>We Can Help You Lock the Door</p>
<p>Entrust offers a comprehensive portfolio of solutions that not only would have helped the organization that was the victim in this particular situation, but can also help other organizations protect against more sophisticated attacks being used by threat actors.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/key-management/keycontrol">KeyControl</a> manages keys, secrets, and certificates – including credentials. KeyControl proactively enforces security policies by whitelisting approved users and actions while also recording privileged user activity across virtual, cloud, and physical environments – creating a granular, immutable audit trial of those accessing the system.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/cloud-security-posture-management/cloudcontrol">Entrust CloudControl</a> improves virtual infrastructure security and risk management with features such as role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC), and secondary approval (two-person rule). These are important, especially when overseeing virtualized environments on a large scale with a team of busy system administrators. CloudControl provides the necessary guardrails and control measures to ensure that your system admin team consistently applies policies across your VM estate while also mitigating against inadvertent misconfigurations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/iam/capabilities/multi-factor-authentication-mfa">Entrust Phishing-Resistant MFA</a> delivers precisely as advertised. Identity continues to be the largest attack vector, with compromised credentials and phishing being the leading causes of breaches. The traditional password adds to the poor user experience and is easily compromised. Even conventional MFA methods such as SMS one-time password (OTP) and push authentication are easily bypassed by attackers.</p>
<p>Credential Management and Access Trends</p>
<p>When examining credential management and access, there are prominent trends in identity and IAM that are receiving significant attention in the office of the CEO and the boardroom.</p>
<p>One prominent trend is the increasing adoption of phishing-resistant passwordless adaptive biometrics authentication. This helps prevent fraud and secure high-value transactions with risk inputs that assess behavioral biometrics and look for indicators of compromise (IOCs) based on various threat intelligence feeds.</p>
<p>Another trend is using identity proofing to enhance security layers, seamless onboarding processes, and the integration of digital signing to provide a unified digital identity experience. Many companies are grappling with the complexities of managing multiple identity providers (IDPs) and associated processes, as well as challenges related to MFA fatigue and phishing attacks targeting OTPs via SMS or email – particularly through adversary in the middle (AiTM) attacks.</p>
<p>Then there’s the management of diverse cybersecurity platforms – including various IDPs, MFA solutions, identity proofing tools, and standalone digital signing platforms –&nbsp;that can lead to productivity bottlenecks and costly administration overheads. Employing certificate-based authentication, biometrics, and other passwordless authentication methods – combined with identity proofing and digital signing within an integrated identity solution – helps streamline operations, reduce costs, and enhance user adoption. Plus, it also helps mitigate potential vulnerabilities associated with disjointed platform connections across enterprise IT environments. It’s a lot for organizations to take on board.</p>
<p>Entrust phishing-resistant identity solutions provide a complete identity and access management platform and comprehensive certificate lifecycle management capabilities to help you implement high-assurance certificate-based authentication for your users and devices.</p>
<p>Lessons Learned</p>
<p>Whether your organization is on a Zero Trust journey or just looking to strengthen your security posture, the attack discussed in the Joint Cybersecurity Advisory paper that started this conversation is a reminder that the threats out there are real – and organizations need to have robust security processes and procedures in place to keep that door firmly closed.</p>

Through the creation of tangible artifacts that imply adjacent possible trajectories for computing's futures, Design Fiction allows us to materialize the intangible, make the non-sensical make sense, and imbue these possibilities with ambitions, desires, and dreams of what-could be. Design Fiction allows us to represent challenges, and technological trajectories in grounded form, through the powerful Design Fiction artifact, such as advertisements, magazines, quick-start guides, FAQs, and news stories. In this talk I will briefly describe the methodologies of Design Fiction and the ways it has been used by organizations, teams, and brands to project into possible futures. I will showcase how speculative artifacts, such as industrial designs for new computing platforms or advertisements for future services, act as conduits for discussion and reflection on the evolution of computing.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nearfuturelaboratory.com/">https://www.nearfuturelaboratory.com</a></p><p><a>See more on YouTube</a></p> the poetics of computation <p><a href="https://ivanzhao.me/">ivan zhao</a></p><blockquote>in what ways is a poem a computer? how do the mechanics, the inner working of software, reflect the syntactic and beautiful nature of poetry? this talk dives into the rich history of programmers, poets, writers, and designers and how they've created new worlds with ideas, theories and examples.</blockquote> Using TiddlyWiki For Personal Knowledge Curation <p><a href="https://gavart.ist/">Gavin Gamboa</a></p><blockquote>TiddlyWiki is an open-source software project initiated and maintained by Jeremy Ruston and volunteers since 2004.

				 <p><a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/travel-and-mobile-are-driving-decentralized-digital-identity-ddid-growth/">A new blog from Andras Cser</a>, VP and Principal Analyst at Forrester Research, says standardized use cases, such as<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aruba-makes-steady-progress-in-launching-new-digital-travel-credential-301989815.html"> Indicio and SITA’s development of digital travel credentials</a> will drive adoption of “exciting new identity technology,” what he calls, decentralized digital identity (DDID).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-takes-the-lead-in-indicio-series-a-funding-round-cementing-a-partnership-delivering-trusted-digital-identity-for-travel/">SITA recently announced</a> its role as lead investor in Indicio’s Series A funding round, citing the <a href="https://www.sita.aero/pressroom/news-releases/sita-and-indicio-announce-a-co-innovation-agreement-to-accelerate-the-development-of-digital-identities/">co-innovation agreement</a> as being key to its digital identity strategy. This means offering verifiable credential-based digital identity solutions that meet International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards for a Digital Travel Credential (DTC) to its 400-plus members and 2,500 worldwide customers, which SITA says is about 90% of the world’s airline business.</p>
<p>With the digital travel credential — or DTC — Indicio and SITA have applied decentralized identity technology to enable pre-authorized travel and seamless border crossing using verifiable credentials. The simplicity, speed, and security of the process applied to the often stressful experience of travel will not only drive the adoption of the technology in air travel but show the world how verifiable identity and data can be easily applied to make everything from passwordless login to banking and finance better, more secure, and faster.</p>
<p>“We agree with Cser,” says Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “When you can solve one of the toughest security challenges — crossing a border — and solve it so that it becomes, easy, frictionless, and seamless, you have the opportunity not only to scale the technology across the global travel industry and affect the lives of millions of people, but to show how this simplicity can be applied to any digital interaction that requires personal or high-value data. It is a very exciting technology, these are exciting times, and we’re going to change everything.”</p>
<p>Cser’s observation highlights <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-wins-the-supernova-award-from-constellation-research-for-disruptive-technology-leadership-in-digital-safety-governance-and-privacy/">Indicio as a leader</a> in the development and deployment of decentralized digital identity software and solutions through its growing customer roster of global enterprises, governments, organizations, and financial institutions.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity and verifiable credentials are a new and transformational method for data sharing that allows information to be verified without intervention from a centralized third-party or through creating a direct integration between systems. This means data from disparate sources and systems can be easily and quickly shared directly to organizations and governments by end users to make informed decisions based on accurate, verifiable data.</p>
<p>The key to this, as Cser notes, is standardization: “standardized use cases will drive interoperability and usability and help grow DDID adoption.” Government contracts for IT infrastructure increasingly mandate open source and open standard-based technology over proprietary solutions because the former is easier to scale, easier to sustain, and less expensive. In practice, this means that a verifiable credential solution like the DTC can be easily adapted to other identity verification purposes because it is easy for anyone to access and use verification software combined with governance rules.</p>
<p>Indicio’s engineering team are key leaders, contributors to, and maintainers of open-source projects at the Hyperledger Foundation and Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), and Indicio’s products and solutions align with the open standards of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and Trust over IP Foundation (ToIP). With the DTC, Indicio and SITA not only followed ICAO’s standard for DTC but also the open standards and open-source codebases that enable interoperability.</p>
<p>“Open standards are a decentralized identity superpower,” says Dahl, “and It is, in large part, due to the work of the open-standards Hyperledger Foundation that we have a complete technology solution that meets the needs of global enterprises and governments now and, equally important, will meet them in the future. Technology will evolve and we have to be ready for that, but we know the direction it will evolve towards: universally verifiable identity and data. It’s the only way forward that makes economic sense. That’s why we provide our customers with a universal solution — Indicio Proven®. It can meet current requirements for eIDAS, OpenID4VC, and mobile driver’s licenses but also allow the evolution, expansion, and innovation that will come — that is already coming — from business models using verifiable data.”</p>
<p>As 2024 continues, more global enterprises are learning about this exciting new technology and contracting with the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-academy/">Indicio Academy</a> to help educate and train their workforce on the latest advancements and technologies encompassing decentralized identity.</p>

  <p>Managing the myriad settings and resources within your tenant can be daunting. In an era of escalating security risks and an unprecedented global threat landscape, organizations seek trusted guidance to enhance their security posture That’s why we introduced <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/overview-recommendations">Microsoft Entra Recommendations</a> to diligently monitor your tenant’s status, ensuring it remains secure and healthy. Moreover, they empower you to extract maximum value from the features offered by Microsoft Entra ID. Since the launch of Microsoft Entra recommendations, thousands of customers have adopted these recommendations and resolved millions of resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we’re thrilled to announce the upcoming general availability of four recommendations, and another three recommendations in public preview. We’re also excited to share new updates on Identity secure score. These recommendations cover a wide spectrum, including credentials, application health, and broader security settings—equipping you to safeguard your digital estate effectively.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Presenting new and upcoming recommendations- Learn from our best practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The following list of new and upcoming recommendations help improve the health and security of your applications:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 Remove unused credentials from applications: An application credential is used to get a token that grants access to a resource or another service. If an application credential is compromised, it could be used to access sensitive resources or allow a bad actor to move latterly, depending on the access granted to the application. Removing credentials not actively used by applications improves security posture and promotes application hygiene. It reduces the risk of application compromise and improves the security posture of the application by reducing the attack surface for credential misuse by discovery.&nbsp; 
 Renew expiring service principal credentials: Renewing the service principal credential(s) before expiration ensures the application continues to function and reduces the possibility of downtime due to an expired credential.&nbsp; 
 Renew expiring application credentials: Renewing the app credential(s) before its expiration ensures the application continues to function and reduces the possibility of downtime due to an expired credential.&nbsp; 
 Remove unused applications: Removing unused applications improves the security posture and promotes good application hygiene. It reduces the risk of application compromise by someone discovering an unused application and misusing it. Depending on the permissions granted to the application and the resources that it exposes, an application compromise could expose sensitive data in an organization.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Migrate applications from the retiring Azure AD Graph APIs to Microsoft Graph: The Azure AD Graph service (graph.windows.net) was announced as deprecated in 2020 and is in a retirement cycle. It’ is important that applications in your tenant, and applications supplied by vendors that are consented in your tenant (service principals), are updated to use Microsoft Graph APIs as soon as possible. This recommendation reports applications that have recently used Azure AD Graph APIs, along with more details about which Azure AD Graph APIs the applications are using.&nbsp; 
 Migrate Service Principals from the retiring Azure AD Graph APIs to Microsoft Graph: The Azure AD Graph service (graph.windows.net) was announced as deprecated in 2020 and is in a retirement cycle. It’ is important that service principals in your tenant, and service principals for applications supplied by vendors that are consented in your tenant, are updated to use Microsoft Graph APIs as soon as possible. This recommendation reports service principals that have recently used Azure AD Graph APIs, along with more details about which Azure AD Graph APIs the service principals are using.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find these recommendations that are in general availability on the Microsoft Entra recommendations portal by looking for “Generally Available” under the column titled “Release Type” as shown below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Changes to Secure Score - Your security analytics tool to enhance security.&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re happy to announce some new developments in Identity Secure Score which functions as <a href="https://kateblog.io/iam/identity-secure-score-in-azure-active-directory/">an indicator for how aligned you are with Microsoft’s recommendations for security</a>. Each improvement action in Identity Secure Score is customized to your configuration and you can easily see the security impact of your changes. We have an upcoming Secure Score recommendation in public preview to help you protect your organization from Insider risk. Please see the details below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Protect your tenant with Insider Risk policy: Implementing a Conditional Access policy that blocks access to resources for high-risk internal users is of high priority due to its critical role in proactively enhancing security, mitigating insider threats, and safeguarding sensitive data in real-time. Learn more about this feature <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/how-to-policy-insider-risk">here.</a> 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the new Secure Score recommendation, we have several other recommendations related to Secure Score. We strongly advise you to check your security-related recommendations if you haven't done so yet. Please see below for the current list of recommendations for secure score:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Enable password hash sync if hybrid: Password hash synchronization is one of the sign-in methods used to accomplish hybrid identity. Microsoft Entra Connect synchronizes a hash of the hash of a user's password from an on-premises Microsoft Entra Connect instance to a cloud-based Microsoft Entra Connect cloud sync instance. Password hash synchronization helps by reducing the number of passwords your users need to maintain to just one. Enabling password hash synchronization also allows for leaked credential reporting.&nbsp; 
 Protect all users with a user risk policy: With the user risk policy turned on, Microsoft Entra ID detects the probability that a user account has been compromised. As an administrator, you can configure a user risk Conditional Access policy to automatically respond to a specific user risk level.&nbsp; 
 Protect all users with a sign-in risk policy: Turning on the sign-in risk policy ensures that suspicious sign-ins are challenged for multifactor authentication (MFA).&nbsp; 
 Use least privileged administrative roles: Ensure that your administrators can accomplish their work with the least amount of privilege assigned to their account. Assigning users roles like Password Administrator or Exchange Online Administrator, instead of Global Administrator, reduces the likelihood of a privileged account being breached.&nbsp; 
 Require multifactor authentication for administrative roles: Requiring multifactor authentication (MFA) for administrative roles makes it harder for attackers to access accounts. Administrative roles have higher permissions than typical users. If any of those accounts are compromised, your entire organization is exposed.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Ensure all users can complete MFA: Help protect devices and data that are accessible to these users with MFA. Adding more authentication methods like the Microsoft Authenticator app or a phone number, increases the level of protection if another factor is compromised.&nbsp; 
 Enable policy to block legacy authentication: Today, most compromising sign-in attempts come from legacy authentication. Older office clients such as Office 2010 don’t support modern authentication and use legacy protocols such as IMAP, SMTP, and POP3. Legacy authentication doesn’t support MFA. Even if an MFA policy is configured in your environment, bad actors can bypass these enforcements through legacy protocols. We recommend enabling policy to block legacy authentication.&nbsp; 
 Designate more than one Global Admin: Having more than one Global Administrator helps if you’re unable to fulfill the needs or obligations of your organization. It's important to have a delegate or an emergency access account that someone from your team can access if necessary. It also allows admins the ability to monitor each other for signs of a breach.&nbsp; 
 Do not expire passwords: Research has found that when periodic password resets are enforced, passwords become less secure. Users tend to pick a weaker password and vary it slightly for each reset. If a user creates a strong password (long, complex, and without any pragmatic words present), it should remain as strong in the future as it is today. It is Microsoft's official security position to not expire passwords periodically without a specific reason and recommends that cloud-only tenants set the password policy to never expire.&nbsp; 
 Enable self-service password reset: With self-service password reset in Microsoft Entra ID, users no longer need to engage helpdesk to reset passwords. This feature works well with Microsoft Entra dynamically banned passwords, which prevents easily guessable passwords from being used.&nbsp; 
 Do not allow users to grant consent to unreliable applications: To reduce the risk of malicious applications attempting to trick users into granting them access to your organization's data, we recommend that you allow user consent only for applications that have been published by a verified publisher.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can find your Secure Score recommendations on Microsoft Entra recommendations portal by adding a filter on “Category” and selecting “Identity Secure Score” as shown below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to you leveraging these learnings and best practices for your organization. We’re constantly innovating and improving customers' experience to bring the right recommendations to the right people. In our future release, we’ll introduce new capabilities like email notifications to create awareness of new recommendations and delegation capabilities to other roles, and provide more actionable recommendations so you can quickly resolve them to secure your organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Under this law, the regulator has been granted the authority to supervise and inspect VASPs as well as to impose penalties. This legislative move targets the regulation of unfair trade practices and the protection of&nbsp;assets.</p> Key Features of the Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>Under the country’s mandated AML law, both domestic and foreign VASPs are required to register with the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KoFIU) before commencing business operations.</p><p>To register, VASPs must obtain an Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) certification from the Korea Internet and Security Agency&nbsp;(KISA).</p><p>Further amendments to the AML-related law mandate the implementation of the Crypto Travel Rule for international virtual asset transfers over 1 million won (approximately $740 or €687). Any transfers above this threshold are limited to wallets verified by users and must be flagged by exchanges. Additionally, VASPs are required to verify customers’ identities and report any suspicious actions to the authorities.</p> Compliance Requirements <p>To register with the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KoFIU) and report their business activity, VASPs have to submit their registered company name, their representative’s details, the location of the business contact information, and bank account details. Moreover, VASPs must adhere to all measures prescribed by the Presidential Decree.</p><p>VASPs must also comply with AML regulations, which include the collection and sharing of information regarding customers’ virtual asset transfers exceeding KRW 1&nbsp;million:</p><p>- Name of the originator and beneficiary</p><p>- Wallet address of originator and beneficiary</p><p>Should the beneficiary VASP or authorities request further information, the following must be provided within three working days of the&nbsp;request:</p><p>- Originator’s customer identification number, personal document identity number, or foreigner registration number</p><p>In addition to Crypto Travel Rule compliance, AML regulations require VASPs to appoint a money laundering reporting officer (MLRO) and develop and implement comprehensive internal AML policies and procedures. These procedures necessitate conducting a company-wide risk assessment and performing Customer Due Diligence (CDD), along with Simplified Due Diligence and Enhanced Due Diligence, depending on the specific situation.</p><p>Moreover, AML obligations involve rigorous transaction monitoring, sanctions screening, record keeping, and reporting suspicious activity and transactions.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>When it comes to crypto exchanges, they are defined as business entities that engage in the purchase, sale, transfer, exchange, storage, or management of crypto, as well as the intermediation or brokerage of virtual asset transactions. Thus, South Korean VASPs cover exchanges, custodians, brokerages, and digital wallet service providers, and they all must comply with the Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rules.</p><p>According to South Korea’s Crypto Travel Rule, transactions among individuals are regulated, and there are no rules regarding moving funds to and from self-hosted or non-custodial wallets. Local exchanges, however, have introduced varying rules for users when transacting with foreign exchanges, leading to confusion among&nbsp;users.</p><p>As per the new 2023 regulations that have yet to go into effect, VASPs are required to create real-name accounts with financial institutions and separate their customers’ deposits from their own to provide better user and asset protection. They are further required to have an insurance plan or reserves, maintain crypto records for fifteen years, keep records for five years, and be assessed for AML compliance with a financial institution.</p> Global Context and Comparisons <p>According to FATF’s latest report, <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/publications/Virtualassets/VACG-Snapshot-Jurisdictions.html">less than 30% of surveyed jurisdictions</a> worldwide have started regulating the cryptocurrency industry.</p><p>Of 58 jurisdictions, 33% (19), which includes the likes of Australia, China, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Ukraine, and Vietnam, have not yet passed or enacted the Travel Rule for VASPs. In contrast, jurisdictions such as Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Malta, Mexico, Norway, New Zealand, Türkiye, Thailand, and Seychelles are currently making progress in this&nbsp;area.</p><p>The report emphasizes the need for jurisdictions to license VASPs, scrutinize their products, technology, and business practices, and improve oversight to mitigate the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing risks.</p><p>While not mandatory, jurisdictions that do not abide by the FATF recommendations may have to face consequences, including being placed on the FATF’s watchlist, which can result in a significant drop in their credibility ratings.</p><p>Notably, South Korea, along with a select group of countries like <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-states">the US</a>, Canada, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/comprehensive-guide-to-crypto-regulations-and-fatf-travel-rule-in-singapore">Singapore</a>, and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-kingdom">the UK</a>, has successfully implemented the FATF Travel Rule. This includes mandating compliance for all transactions exceeding the threshold of million Korean won, which is pretty much in line with the watchdog’s US$1,000 threshold.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>South Korea has actively embraced blockchain and cryptocurrencies, responding to the growing popularity of virtual assets. To ensure the market operates safely and securely, the country’s regulators have implemented a series of laws and regulations, including the stringent AML requirements.</p> FAQs on Crypto Travel Rule South&nbsp;Korea  Q1: What is the minimum threshold for the Crypto Travel Rule in South&nbsp;Korea? <p>South Korea has set a 1 million won minimum threshold for the Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> Q2: Who needs to register with KoFIU in South&nbsp;Korea? <p>Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) must register with the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KoFIU) to legally operate in the&nbsp;country.</p> Q3: How does South Korea enforce crypto transaction transparency and asset protection? <p>South Korea enforces crypto transaction transparency and asset protection through a combination of the Crypto Travel Rule, AML compliance requirements for VASPs, and laws targeting the regulation of unfair trade practices and the protection of&nbsp;assets.</p> About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on<a href="https://www.shyft.network"> Shyft Network</a>, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>The CA/Browser Form Code Signing Working Group has recently updated the Signing Service Requirements in the Code Signing Baseline Requirements (CSBRs) through <a href="https://cabforum.org/2024/01/18/ballots-csc-21-and-csc-22/">ballot CSC-21</a>.</p>
<p>The former Signing Service Requirements allowed for a model with risks for secure deployment. Upon receiving a Code Signing Request, the model would allow the Signing Service to perform CA functions, such as providing the Certificate Subscriber Agreement and performing applicant verification.</p>
<p>Definition of Signing Service</p>
<p>The new model requires the CA to provide the Subscriber Agreement and perform verification. The updated requirements now define the Signing Service as: “An organization that generates the key pair and securely manages the private key associated with the code signing certificate on behalf of the subscriber.” The primary focus is to support the subscriber and ensure that their private keys are generated and protected within a cryptographic module to control private key activation.</p>
<p>Advantages of Signing Services</p>
<p>Signing Services play a critical role in mitigating the primary risk of private key compromise for subscribers. Additionally, they provide simplicity by offering alternatives, such as using a subscriber-hosted cryptographic module. This eliminates the need for subscribers to install and configure a server crypto module or use tokens and drivers.</p>
<p>Compliance and Audit Requirements</p>
<p>In addition to providing Signing Service requirements, the CSBRs also provide audit requirements to ensure compliance and private key protection. Signing Services must undergo annual audits to meet the applicable requirements outlined in WebTrust for CSBRs and WebTrust for Network Security.</p>
<p>As your code signing solution partner, Entrust supports these updated requirements and offers <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/learn/what-is-code-signing">Code Signing as a Service</a> for both OV and EV Code Signing Certificates.</p>

  <p>At our latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EGK57wwHfs&amp;t=1027s">Microsoft Ignite event</a>, we announced and demonstrated new capabilities within Microsoft Entra Internet Access, an identity-centric Secure Web Gateway (SWG) solution capable of converging all enterprise access governance in one place. These capabilities unify identity and network access controls to help eliminate the security loopholes and manageability created by using multiple security solutions. This helps protect enterprises against malicious internet traffic and other threats from the open internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Secure access to all internet resources, Software as a Service (SaaS), and Microsoft 365 apps with an identity-centric SWG solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog, we highlight the advantages of Entra Internet Access’ web content filtering capabilities that work across all web-based internet resources and SaaS applications by leveraging the unified policy engine: Entra ID Conditional Access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Extend Conditional Access policies to the internet 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Internet Access extends the contextual sophistication of Conditional Access policies to enterprise SWG filtering. This enables you to&nbsp;apply granular web filtering for any internet destination based on user, device, location, and risk conditions​.&nbsp;The ability to&nbsp;apply different filtering policies​ (and in the future, threat protection policies, DLP policies, and more)&nbsp;based on various contexts and conditions is critical to address the complex demands of today’s enterprise. Bringing identity and network context together to enforce granular policy through Conditional Access is what makes Microsoft Entra Internet Access the first identity-centric SWG solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Filter web content to reduce attack surface&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Internet Access offers extensive web content filtering to prevent access to unwanted web content for enterprise users, using our client connectivity model, available for both Windows and Android platforms. We’ll soon add support for other OS platforms and branch connectivity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-configure-web-content-filtering">web category filtering</a>, you can create policies using an extensive repository of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/reference-web-content-filtering-categories">web content categorization</a> to easily allow or block internet endpoints across categories. Category examples include liability, high bandwidth, business use, productivity loss, general surfing, and security, which includes malware, compromised sites, spam sites, and more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To provide even more granular application layer access control, you can create policies with ​​<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-configure-web-content-filtering">fully qualified domain name (FQDN) </a><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-configure-web-content-filtering">filtering</a> to identify specific endpoints to allow or block through standalone policy configuration or add exceptions to web category policies with ease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Microsoft Entra Internet Access, internet filtering policies are more succinct, readable, and comprehensive, helping to reduce the attack surface and simplifying the administrative experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Web content filtering</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Proactively set conditional security profiles&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security profiles make it easy to create logical groupings of your web content filtering policies (and in the future, treat protection policies, DLP policies, and more) and assign them to Conditional Access policies. Additionally, security profiles can also be organized with priority ordering, allowing imperative control over which users are affected by web content filtering policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Security profile Conditional Access integration</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s how that works. Let’s say only your finance department should have access to finance applications. You can add a block finance web category policy to your baseline profile (priority 65000) which is applied to all users. For the finance department, you can create a security profile (priority 200) that allows the finance web category and attach it to a Conditional Access policy enforced to the finance group. Because the security profile for allow finance is a higher priority than the baseline profile, the finance department will have access to finance apps. However, if a finance department user risk is high then their access should be denied. So, we create an additional security profile at a higher priority (priority 100) that blocks the finance web category and attach it to a Conditional Access policy enforced to users with high user risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Security profile priorities</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our 2023 Ignite release reflects Microsoft’s desire to make your job easier by offering you a fully integrated security service edge (SSE) solution, including SWG, ​​Transport Layer Security (TLS) inspection, Cloud Firewall, Network ​Data Loss Prevention (DLP) and Microsoft Threat Protection capabilities.

<p>Update: Azure AD Graph Retirement&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June of 2023, we shared <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">an update</a> on completion of a three-year notice period for the deprecation of the Azure AD Graph API service. The service is now in the retirement cycle and retirement (shut down) will be done with incremental stages. In the first stage of this retirement cycle, applications that are created after June 30, 2024, will receive an error (HTTP 403) for any requests to Azure AD Graph APIs (<a href="https://graph.windows.net/">https://graph.windows.net</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We understand that some apps may not have fully completed migration to Microsoft Graph. We are providing an optional configuration that will allow an application created after June 30, 2024, to resume use of Azure AD Graph APIs through June 2025.&nbsp; If you develop or distribute software that requires applications to be created as part of the installation or setup, and these applications will need to access Azure AD Graph APIs, you must prepare now to avoid interruption.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have recently begun rollout of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/overview-recommendations">Microsoft Entra recommendations</a> to help monitor the status of your tenant, plus provide information about applications and service principals that are using Azure AD Graph APIs in your tenant. These new recommendations provide information to support your efforts to migrate the impacted applications and service principals to Microsoft Graph.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information on Azure AD Graph retirement, the new recommendations for Azure AD Graph, and configuring applications created after June 30, 2024, for an extension of Azure AD Graph APIs, please reference <a href="https://aka.ms/AApjqqx">this post</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Important update: Azure AD PowerShell and MS Online PowerShell modules are deprecated&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2021, we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/automate-and-manage-azure-ad-tasks-at-scale-with-the-microsoft/ba-p/1942489">described our plans</a> to invest in Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK as the PowerShell experience for Entra going forward, and that we would wind-down investment in Azure AD and MS Online PowerShell modules. In June of 2023, we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">announced</a> that the planned deprecation of Azure AD and MS Online PowerShell modules would be deferred to March 30, 2024. We have since made substantial progress closing remaining parity gaps in Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of March 30, 2024, these PowerShell modules are deprecated:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/overview?view=graph-powershell-1.0">Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK</a> is the replacement for these modules and you should migrate your scripts to Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK as soon as possible. Information about the retirement of these modules can be found below. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Azure AD PowerShell, Azure AD PowerShell Preview, and MS Online will continue to function through March 30, 2025, when they are retired. Note: MS Online versions before 1.1.166.0 (2017) can no longer be maintained and use of these versions may experience disruptions after June 30, 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are making substantial new and future investments in the PowerShell experience for managing Entra. Please continue to watch this space as we announce exciting improvements in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June 2024, users using unsupported versions of the My Apps Secure Sign-in Extension will experience breakages. If you are utilizing Microsoft Edge and Chrome extensions, you will experience no change in functionality. If you are using the unsupported Firefox versions of this extension, all functionalities will stop working in June 2024 (please note, Firefox support ceased in September 2021). Our recommendation is to use the Edge or Chrome versions of this extension.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changes in Dynamic Group rule builder&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To encourage efficient dynamic group rules, the dynamic group rule builder UX in both Entra and Intune Admin Centers has been updated. As of July 2024, the 'match' and 'notMatch' operators have been removed from the rule builder because they are less efficient and should only be used when necessary. However, we want to assure you that these operators are still supported by the API and can be written into rules via the text box in both admin centers. So, if you need to use them, you still can! Please refer to this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/users/groups-dynamic-membership#rule-builder-in-the-azure-portal">document</a> for instructions on how to write rules using the text box.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conditional Access 'Locations' condition is moving&nbsp;</p>
<p>[No action is required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting mid-April 2024, the Conditional Access ‘Locations’ condition is moving up. Locations will become the 'Network' assignment, with the new Global Secure Access assignment - 'All compliant network locations'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This change will occur automatically, admins won’t need to take any action. Here's more details:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 The familiar ‘Locations’ condition is unchanged, updating the policy in the ‘Locations’ condition will be reflected in the ‘Network’ assignment and vice versa.&nbsp; 
 No functionality changes, existing policies will continue to work without changes.&nbsp;

  <p>In June 2023, we shared <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">an update</a> on the completion of a three-year notice period for the deprecation of the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Graph API service. This service is now in the retirement cycle, and retirement (shut down) will be done with future incremental stages. In this update, we’ll provide more details about this first stage and a new <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/overview-recommendations">Entra recommendations</a> experience to help you identify applications that are using retiring Azure AD Graph APIs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re committed to supporting our customers through this retirement with regular updates as we work through this change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Azure AD Graph retirement update 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After June 30, 2024, we’ll start a rollout for the first stage of Azure AD Graph retirement. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/application-model">Entra ID Applications</a> that are created after June 30, 2024 will receive an error for any API requests to Azure AD Graph APIs (https://graph.windows.net). We understand that some apps may not have fully completed migration to Microsoft Graph. We’re providing an optional configuration that will allow an application created after June 30, 2024 to use Azure AD Graph APIs through June 2025.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you develop or distribute software that requires applications to be created as part of the software installation or setup, and these applications will need to access Azure AD Graph APIs, you must prepare now to avoid interruption. You will either need to migrate your applications to Microsoft Graph (recommended) or configure the applications that are created as part of software setup for an extension, as described below, and ensure that your customers are prepared for the change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Applications that are created before June 30, 2024 will not be impacted or experience interruption at this stage. Vendor applications consented in your tenant will also not be impacted if the application is created before June 30, 2024. Later in 2024, we’ll provide timelines for the following stage of the Azure AD Graph retirement, when existing applications will not be able to make requests to Azure AD Graph APIs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How do I find applications in my tenant using Azure AD Graph APIs?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/overview-recommendations">Microsoft Entra recommendations</a> feature provides recommendations to ensure your tenant is in a secure and healthy state, while also helping you maximize the value of the features available in Microsoft Entra ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve recently begun a rollout of two Entra recommendations that provide information about applications and service principals that are using Azure AD Graph APIs in your tenant. These new recommendations provide information to support your efforts to identify and migrate the impacted applications and service principals to Microsoft Graph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Microsoft Entra recommendations</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Configuring a new application for an extension of Azure AD Graph access 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To allow an application created after June 30, 2024 to have an extension for access to Azure AD Graph APIs, you must make a configuration change on the application after it’s created. This configuration change is done through the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/applications-authenticationbehaviors?tabs=http">AuthenticationBehaviors</a> interface. By setting the blockAzureADGraphAccess flag to false, the newly created application will be able to continue to use Azure AD Graph APIs until further in the retirement cycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this first stage, only applications created after June 30, 2024 will be impacted. Existing applications will be able to continue to use Azure AD Graph APIs even if the authenticationBehaviors property is not configured. Once this change is rolled out (after June 30, 2024), you may also choose to set blockAzureADGraphAccess to true for testing or to prevent an existing application from using Azure AD Graph APIs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens to applications using Azure AD Graph after June 30, 2024? &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  Existing applications will not be impacted at this date. &nbsp; 
  Any applications created after June 30, 2024 will encounter errors (HTTP 403) when making requests to Azure AD Graph APIs, unless the blockAzureADGraphAccess attribute has been set to false in the authenticationBehaviors property for the application. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens in future retirement stages?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this update, we’ve discussed the first stage of Azure AD Graph retirement, starting after June 30, 2024. In the coming months, we’ll provide updates on the timeline for the second stage of Azure AD Graph retirement. In the second stage, we’re planning for all applications, including existing applications, to be blocked from using Azure AD Graph APIs unless they’re configured with the AuthenticationBehaviors property (blockAzureADGraphAccess: false) to enable extended access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A minimum of three (3) months of advance notice will be provided before this next stage of retirement. We’ll continue to provide routine updates as we work through this service retirement to provide clear expectations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Current support for Azure AD Graph</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azure AD Graph APIs are in the retirement cycle and have no SLA or maintenance commitment beyond security-related fixes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 About Microsoft Graph 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Graph represents our best-in-breed API surface. It offers a single unified endpoint to access Microsoft Entra services and Microsoft 365 services such as Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Intune. All new functionalities will only be available through Microsoft Graph. Microsoft Graph is also more secure and resilient than Azure AD Graph.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Graph has all the capabilities that have been available in Azure AD Graph and new APIs like identity protection and authentication methods. Its client libraries offer built-in support for features like retry handling, secure redirects, transparent authentication, and payload compression.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What about Azure AD and Microsoft Online PowerShell modules?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of March 30, 2024, AzureAD, AzureAD-Preview, and Microsoft Online (MSOL) PowerShell modules are deprecated and will only be supported for security fixes. You should migrate these to Microsoft Graph PowerShell. Please read more <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/bg-p/Identity">here</a>. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  Identify scripts in your environment that are using Azure AD or MS Online PowerShell modules.&nbsp; 
  Take immediate action to migrate scripts that are using MS Online versions below 1.1.166.0. If you’re not ready to migrate to Microsoft Graph PowerShell, you can update to the latest version of MSOnline PowerShell (<a href="https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MSOnline/1.1.183.81">1.1.183.81</a>) to avoid impact after June 30, 2024. To inspect the version of MS Online module, you can use this PowerShell command:&nbsp;&gt; Get-InstalledModule MSOnline&nbsp; 
 Plan to migrate all MS Online (latest version) and Azure AD PowerShell scripts to Microsoft Graph by March 30, 2025. 
 Migrate these scripts to use Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK.<br>&nbsp; 
 
<p>We’re making substantial new and future investments in the PowerShell experience for managing Entra. Please continue to monitor this space as we announce exciting improvements in the coming months.</p>

<p>In another devastating blow to data privacy, telecommunications behemoth AT&amp;T has disclosed a massive breach involving the personal records of over 73 million current and former customers. The compromised data, spanning names, addresses, dates of birth, social security numbers, and account information, has surfaced on the dark web - a cybercriminal's paradise.</p><p>As AT&amp;T grapples with this crisis, the incident lays bare the vulnerabilities of centralized data storage systems employed by most major corporations. Holding troves of personal data in concentrated databases creates an enticing target for bad actors, jeopardizing the privacy and security of millions.</p><p>This is where decentralized identity solutions pioneered by the Bloom team come into play. By leveraging cryptography, Bloom eliminates the need to centrally store personal data, giving individuals full control over their information through self-sovereign digital identities.</p><p>With Bloom's decentralized approach, there is no honeypot of personal data for hackers to target. Instead, users manage their own encrypted data and share only verifiable credentials when needed, such as proof of identity or credit history. This selective disclosure minimizes the risk of mass data leaks.</p><p>In the wake of AT&amp;T's breach, customers are being advised to vigilantly monitor accounts and credit reports. However, had AT&amp;T utilized Bloom's decentralized model, the compromised data would be severely limited, if exposed at all. Eliminating centralized data storage reduces the attack surface and potential impact of breaches.</p><p>The Bloom ecosystem empowers users to own and fully control access to their personal information through blockchain-based identities and verifiable credentials. This capability could have prevented the indiscriminate exposure of 73 million AT&amp;T customer records.</p><p>As data privacy and security risks escalate, centralized data stores are becoming an outmoded, unacceptable liability. Bloom's decentralized identity solutions represent a paradigm shift - one that severs the reliance on centralized databases and transitions identity ownership to users themselves.</p><p>In today's digital landscape, the question is not if, but when, the next major company will suffer a crippling data breach. Widespread adoption of innovative, user-centric solutions like Bloom's decentralized identity is crucial to halt the onslaught of data privacy crises. The path forward involves empowering people with full ownership and control over their personal data through blockchain-enabled decentralized identity.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://news.verida.io/the-decentralized-verida-acacia-testnet-is-live-81503c119d9f">Verida testnet</a>, which has amassed over 30,000 accounts since its launch in January 2023, is scheduled for deprecation.</p><p>Important: Users must promptly migrate their data to the Verida mainnet to prevent losing any of their data on the Verida&nbsp;testnet.</p><p>This transition has been necessitated by the impending shutdown of the Polygon Mumbai testnet, to be replaced by <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-the-amoy-testnet-for-polygon-pos">the Amoy testnet</a>, set to occur on 13th April 2024. Current Verida testnet accounts are anchored to the Mumbai blockchain for accounts.</p><a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-the-amoy-testnet-for-polygon-pos">Amoy Testnet: A new, Sepolia-anchored testnet has been launched for Polygon&nbsp;PoS</a><p>Concurrently, Verida will introduce a new testnet, Verida Banksia, that can be leveraged by developers and testers. Additionally, to provide increased resilience against future network disruptions, the Verida protocol will undergo upgrades, facilitating the anchoring of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) across multiple blockchains and adopting a more structured approach to network integration.</p><p>Introducing a named testnet offers more flexibility to have multiple testnets in the future and provide more flexibility with the shutdown of anchored blockchains.</p><p>Developers will be required to update to the latest SDK to use the new Banksia Network when it comes&nbsp;online.</p> How to migrate to the Verida&nbsp;Mainnet <p>Users are recommended to migrate to the Verida mainnet to prevent losing any of their data on the Verida testnet. This process can be managed directly in the latest version of the Verida Wallet. Any data on your testnet account will be permanently deleted once this process is completed.</p>  Update to the latest Verida Wallet version (available in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/verida-vault/id1546599632">Apple App Store</a> and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.verida.vault">Google Play&nbsp;Store</a>)  Choose the testnet identity you want to migrate, and select “Migrate to Mainnet” on the home&nbsp;screen.  <p>Important: Do not close the Verida Wallet or switch to a different app while it is migrating.

  Unlike many other countries, Malaysia mandates the sharing of transaction data under the FATF Travel Rule with no minimum threshold.  VASPs must enforce strict AML and CFT compliance measures, including thorough customer due diligence to comply with the Travel Rule in Malaysia.  Companies must retain transaction records for seven years and present them to authorities when demanded.  <p>Malaysia, a Southeast Asia country with a population of 33 million, classifies crypto as a security and requires those involved in crypto activities to maintain the highest standards of compliance for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) by adopting FATF’s Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> The Background of the Crypto Travel Rule in&nbsp;Malaysia <p>In Malaysia, crypto is regulated by the Securities Commission Malaysia (SCM), which in 2019 published <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/api/documentms/download.ashx?id=8c8bc467-c750-466e-9a86-98c12fec4a77">the Capital Markets and Services Order</a>. This classified certain cryptocurrencies as securities, subjecting them to securities laws.</p><p>In April 2021, the Malaysian statutory body responsible for the development and regulation of capital markets in the country made amendments to <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/api/documentms/download.ashx?id=b682d829-38bc-4827-b48d-022726d75a17">officially introduce Travel Rule requirements in the region</a>. Then, in April 2022, the Crypto Travel Rule came into&nbsp;force.</p> What Does Travel Rule&nbsp;Mandate? <p>The Travel Rule mandates that crypto service providers share transaction information for digital assets, complying with AML regulations. This involves detailing both the sender and receiver’s information and implementing robust, risk-based policies and procedures.</p><p>To comply with the FATF Travel Rule, VASPs in Malaysia must appoint a compliance officer, train employees, and apply a risk-based approach tailored to relevant risk&nbsp;factors.</p><p>Additionally, crypto companies must conduct Customer Due Diligence checks, which entail identifying and verifying customers. Moreover, depending on the customer’s risk level, companies must carry out either Simplified Due Diligence (SDD) or Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD).</p><p>Those involved in crypto-related activities are required to monitor transactions closely and perform sanctions and AML screenings, which involve checking if a customer is designated as a Politically Exposed Person (PEP) or appears on sanctions lists. Additionally, they must report any suspicious transactions immediately.</p><p>The companies are also obligated to retain all records for a minimum period of seven years, making the data accessible to authorities upon&nbsp;request.</p> Compliance Requirements <p>When it comes to Malaysia’s Crypto Travel Rule requirements, the Originator VASP is required to collect and then share personally identifiable information (PII) with the Beneficiary VASP. Notably, Malaysia has no minimal threshold for reporting, mandating that information must be gathered and shared regardless of the transaction amount.</p><p>The personally identifiable information (PII) an originating VASP must collect, verify, and transmit from its customer includes:</p><p>- Name</p><p>- National registration identity card number or passport&nbsp;number</p><p>- Account number or unique transaction number to trace the transaction</p><p>- Address or date of birth and place of&nbsp;birth</p><p>When it comes to the beneficiary VASPs, they must collect the following customer information:</p><p>- Name</p><p>- Account number or unique transaction number to trace the transaction</p><p>The beneficiary VASP is required to have an effective risk-based procedure to monitor transactions and identify transfers lacking the required information. It must also have policies to determine when to execute a wire transfer lacking the required originator/beneficiary information or when to reject or suspend it. The beneficiary VASPs must also have the appropriate follow-up action to be&nbsp;taken.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>In Malaysia, a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) facilitates the buying, selling, or transferring of digital assets on behalf of its customers. In order to operate in the country and offer its services, the company must be Malaysian-incorporated and registered with the&nbsp;SCM.</p><p>Besides being locally incorporated, digital asset exchanges must have a minimum paid-up capital of RM5 million (approximately $1 mln). For an IEO applicant as well, the min. paid-up capital is RM5,000,000 (just over $1 mln). A digital asset custodian, meanwhile, is required to have a minimum paid-up capital of RM500,000 (approximately $107,000) and shareholders’ funds of RM500,000 that must be maintained at all&nbsp;times.</p><p>The exact criteria vary based on the type of services one provides, which can be found in the <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/api/documentms/download.ashx?id=942594d3-df78-42af-b2ee-186763fe4ea8">Guidelines on the Recognized Market</a>.</p><p>Moreover, in order to offer the services in Malaysia, VASPs must enforce the Crypto Travel Rule. These rules ensure the crypto company is fully compliant with AML and CFT regulations and provides a secure trading experience.</p><p>When it comes to cross-border transactions, the SCM applies the same scope of Travel Rule information-sharing obligations no matter whether the transaction involves a national or foreign counterparty.</p><p>As for the self-hosted, un-hosted, or non-custodial wallet requirements, the Malaysian regulator doesn’t specify anything.</p> Global Context and Comparisons <p>Only in the last few years has the implementation of the Travel Rule ramped up. So, it is still early in its adoption phase, and Malaysia is among a limited number of countries, including <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-kingdom">the UK</a>, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-states">the US</a>, Germany, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-estonia">Estonia</a>, Gibraltar, Liechtenstein, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-crypto-travel-rule-compliance-in-japan">Japan</a>, that have adopted the Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Different countries interpret the FATF recommendation in their own ways, leading to varied requirements for VASPs. This results in differences in the specifics of the personal data to be collected during transactions, and the threshold, which the FATF sets at $1,000, varies by country. However, with no minimum threshold, unlike Canada (CAD 1,000), Germany (EUR 1,000), <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-hong-kong">Hong Kong (HKD 8,000)</a>, and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/comprehensive-guide-to-crypto-regulations-and-fatf-travel-rule-in-singapore">Singapore (S $1,500)</a>, Malaysia adopts a more stringent stance than other&nbsp;nations.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>Overall, to comply with the FATF Travel Rule in Malaysia, VASPs must rigorously collect, verify, and share transactional and customer data, adhere to strict AML and CFT protocols, and maintain records to ensure transparency and security in the digital asset&nbsp;space.</p> FAQs  Q1: What’s the transaction threshold for the Travel Rule in Malaysia? <p>Malaysia has no minimum threshold for transaction reporting under the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> Q2: What compliance measures must Malaysian VASPs implement? <p>Malaysian VASPs must enforce detailed AML and CFT compliance procedures, including thorough customer due diligence.</p> Q3: How long are transaction records required to be&nbsp;kept? <p>Transaction records in Malaysia must be maintained for seven years, making them accessible to regulatory authorities as&nbsp;needed.</p> Q4: What customer information do VASPs need to collect in Malaysia under the Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>VASPs in Malaysia are required to collect and verify customer names, identity numbers, account numbers, and addresses or dates and places of birth under the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> About Veriscope <p>Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on <a href="https://www.shyft.network">Shyft Network</a>, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>The Discord Community Dynamics Challenge, centered around Ocean Protocol’s Discord server, provided a platform for an in-depth analysis of community interactions and their impact on essential ecosystem metrics, including the $OCEAN token price. The challenge, Spanning 1,645 days of data, began with the first server entry from ‘sheridan_oceanprotocol’ on August 20, 2019, and extended to the most recent contribution by ‘wanderclyffex’ on February 20, 2024. The dataset encompassed 84,754 entries, of which 15,696 were from GitHub bot feeds related to Ocean Protocol’s GitHub Page updates, covering various aspects of community engagement.</p><p>Key elements of each entry, such as channel, author ID, author, date, content, attachments, and reactions, were examined, along with daily $OCEAN token price data from May 4, 2019, to March 7, 2024. Participants explored the correlation between community activities and the $OCEAN token’s valuation, providing a comprehensive view of the server’s dynamics.</p><p>The challenge uncovered diverse trends and patterns across different timescales and categories, revealing insights into the community’s behavior and interests. Rankings, leaderboards, and categorization studies provided insights into the dynamics of community groups and interactions. Thematic discussions were analyzed to identify recurring topics and questions, highlighting the community’s interests.</p><p>Notable outcomes of this challenge are the development of a scam alert analysis procedure and a classification model capable of predicting next-day server statistics, utilizing historical data from the past three days or one week. Participants presented critical findings supported by visual narratives and in-depth discussions. They clarified the approaches and techniques, concluding with suggestions for future technological advancements, such as creating specialized Discord bots and AI assistants to enhance community server experiences.</p> Winners Podium <p>The top submissions for this challenge were outstanding. Participants displayed exceptional skills in leveraging AI and ML models to reveal the complexities of digital community interactions and their impact on the crypto market. The top three submissions are distinguished by their analytical depth, innovative approaches, and insightful predictions.</p><p>Dominikus Brian — 1st&nbsp;Place</p><p>Dominikus’ study on the Ocean Protocol Discord Server analyzed 84,754 entries over 1,645 days, integrating this with the daily $OCEAN token price to examine community engagement and market trends. The research involved a detailed temporal analysis of user activities to identify high-engagement periods, correlating these with significant cryptocurrency events. A key component was sentiment analysis, aiming to link the tone of community discussions with fluctuations in the $OCEAN token&nbsp;price.</p><p>The study also categorized users based on activity levels, identifying key community influencers. A significant technical achievement was developing a RandomForest classification model for scam detection. Additionally, the team employed machine learning models for predictive analysis, forecasting server statistics, and token prices. This approach showcased the potential of combining community data analysis with advanced AI techniques to gain insights into digital community behavior and its potential impact on market&nbsp;trends.</p><p>Anamaria Loznianu — 2nd&nbsp;Place</p><p>Anamaria conducted a comprehensive analysis, beginning with preprocessing a dataset of 84,754 records. She meticulously cleaned the dataset, removing irrelevant messages and bot interactions and extracting features like word and character counts and user reactions. After processing, she reduced the dataset to 30,883 entries spread across 17 columns, providing a rich source for analysis.</p><p>She first explored the general trends in the community, identifying patterns and outlier periods of high activity. This analysis revealed a significant upward trajectory in message volumes over time, suggesting an active and expanding community. She also conducted correlation studies between the $OCEAN token price and server metrics. However, these correlations showed weak relationships, suggesting that other factors might be more influential in server activity.</p><p>Owais Ahmad — 3rd&nbsp;Place</p><p>Owais’ report provides an in-depth analysis of the Ocean Protocol Discord Community, focusing on how the community’s interactions contribute to the advancement of data economy and Web3 vision. The study begins by examining the fluctuations in message volume from 2021 to 2024, revealing significant spikes in activity during certain months, indicative of the community’s evolving engagement. By analyzing different Discord channels, Ahmad identified the most popular ones and observed variations in their activity levels, reflecting the community’s diverse interests and responses to specific events or campaigns.</p><p>The approach involved looking at raw numbers and considering engagement quality, such as the days of the week when members are most active. The analysis also examined the correlation between the $OCEAN token price and community communication patterns. While noting a mild correlation, relying on message volume as a consistent predictor of token price movements was considered insignificant.</p> Interesting Facts  Scam Reports&nbsp;Analysis <p>The studies showed a somewhat even distribution of scam reports throughout the day, with a peak around 23:00, suggesting that scammers might target users during late-night hours. There was no definitive pattern across days of the week, although there was a slight inclination towards the beginning of the week for scam activities.</p> General Trends and&nbsp;Patterns <p>The Ocean Protocol Discord server saw rapid activity growth from 2019 to 2022, with a peak in the summer of 2022 and a decline in 2023. Data revealed user activities were more prominent from April to August than in other months. Notably, there was a record-breaking surge in user activity in early July 2022, likely due to the launch of Ocean V4 (“Onda”) and the Ocean Data Bounty&nbsp;program.</p> Correlation between $OCEAN Token Price and Server&nbsp;Metrics <p>There was a noticeable correlation between the $OCEAN token price and specific server metrics. Sentiment value and average word count per message were the most correlated metrics, with a positive Pearson correlation of 0.63 and 0.46, respectively. An increase in positive sentiment value often preceded a rise in the $OCEAN token&nbsp;price.</p> Technical Inquiries and Sentiment Analysis <p>The community shows a significant interest in technical aspects. This enthusiasm is evident in the many inquiries about blockchain, innovative contract development, and other technical issues. General information and price-related inquiries also showed varying degrees of sentiment.</p> Channel Popularity <p>The ‘General Chat’ and ‘Welcome’ channels were the most active, with more than 11,000 and 5,000 messages sent by 646 and 856 unique users, respectively. It demonstrates that these channels are vital hubs of community interaction.</p> 2024 Championship: <p>Each challenge offers a $10,000 prize pool divided among the top 10 participants. Furthermore, our championship points system distributes 100 points among the top 10 finishers in every event. In each challenge, a single championship point is worth&nbsp;$100.</p><p>By participating in challenges, contestants accumulate points toward the 2024 Championship.

<p>Authors: Yanisa Sunanchaiyakarn &amp; Nuttawut Kongsuwan, Finema Co.&nbsp;Ltd.</p><p>This blog is the second part of the vLEI Demystified series. <a href="https://medium.com/finema/vlei-demystified-part-1-comprehensive-overview-212349c09643">Part 1</a> of the series outlines different stakeholders, their roles, and six types of credentials that are involved in the trust chain and the foundational structures of the vLEI ecosystem. This part delves deeper into the qualifications and verification procedures that persons representing these organizations have to go through prior to the issuance of vLEI credentials.</p> Overview of vLEI Identity Verification <p>Before participating in the vLEI ecosystem, including obtaining and issuing vLEI credentials, the representatives of all organization stakeholders must undergo rigorous identity verification processes to confirm their legal identity.</p><blockquote>Note: Legal identity is defined as the basic characteristics of an individual’s identity. e.g. name, sex, place, and date of birth conferred through registration and the issuance of a certificate by an authorized civil registration authority following the occurrence of birth. [Ref: <a href="https://unstats.un.org/legal-identity-agenda/]">https://unstats.un.org/legal-identity-agenda/]</a></blockquote><p>With some exceptions, authorized representatives of each organization stakeholder are responsible for performing identity verification on representatives of organizations downstream within the vLEI trust chain. That is, GLEIF verifies qualified vLEI issuers (QVIs), QVIs verify legal entities (LEs), and LEs verify role representatives, as shown&nbsp;below.</p>The vLEI trust&nbsp;chain<blockquote>Note: The authorized representatives are the persons designated by an organization (either GLEIF, a QVI, or a legal entity) to officially represent the organization.</blockquote><blockquote>Note: There are two types of role representatives: official organization role (OOR) and engagement context role&nbsp;(ECR).</blockquote> GLEIF Authorized Representative (GARs) <p>GARs are controllers of the GLEIF Root AID, GLEIF Internal Delegated AID (GIDA), and GLEIF External Delegated AID&nbsp;(GEDA).</p><p>As the root of trust of the vLEI ecosystem, GLEIF established an internal process to verify their GARs, as outlined in the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2022-12-16_verifiable-lei-_vlei_-ecosystem-governance-framework-gleif-identifier-governance-framework_v1.0_final.pdf">GLEIF Identifier Governance Framework</a>. This includes:</p>  The policies and processes for the genesis events of the GLEIF Root AID, GIDA, and&nbsp;GEDA  Detailed identity verification process of all GARs where they mutually authenticate each&nbsp;other  Contingency plans such as a designated survivor policy as well as restrictions on joint travel and in-person attendance of meetings.   Designated Authorized Representative (DAR) <p>DARs are representatives authorized to act on behalf of a Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI) or an&nbsp;LE.</p>  Identity verification on a QVI’s DAR is performed by an external&nbsp;GAR.  Identity verification on an LE’s DAR is performed by a&nbsp;QAR.   Qualified vLEI Issuer Authorized Representatives (QARs) <p>A QAR is a representative designated by a QVI’s DAR to carry out vLEI operations with GLEIF and&nbsp;LEs.</p>  Identity verification on a QAR is performed by an external&nbsp;GAR.  <p>This process is detailed in <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2023-12-15_vlei-egf-v2.0-qualified-vlei-issuer-identifier-governance-framework-and-vlei-credential-framework_v1.3_final.pdf">Qualified vLEI Issuer Identifier Governance Framework and vLEI Credential Framework</a>.</p> Legal Entity Authorized Representatives (LARs) <p>An LAR is a representative designated by an LE’s DAR to request the issuance and revocation of LE vLEI credentials and Role vLEI credentials.</p>  Identity verification on an LAR is performed by a&nbsp;QAR.  <p>This process is detailed in <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2023-12-15_vlei-egf-v2.0-legal-entity-vlei-credential-framework_v1.2_final.pdf">Legal Entity vLEI Credential Framework</a>.</p> Role Representatives (OOR and ECR&nbsp;Persons) <p>A role representative, either an OOR or ECR person, is designated by an LAR to represent an LE in a functional or official organization role, respectively. The identity verification process for a role representative depends on whether an authorization vLEI credential is used, see <a href="https://medium.com/finema/vlei-demystified-part-1-comprehensive-overview-212349c09643">Part 1</a> of the series for more&nbsp;detail.</p>  In the case where an authorization vLEI credential is used, identity verification on a role representative is performed by both a QAR and an&nbsp;LAR.  In a case where an LE issues a role vLEI credential directly without using an ECR authorization vLEI credential, identity verification of an ECR person needs to be performed by only a&nbsp;LAR.  <p>This process is detailed in the following documents:</p>  <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2023-12-15_vlei-egf-v2.0-qualified-vlei-issuer-authorization-vlei-credential-framework_v1.2_final.pdf">Qualified vLEI Issuer Authorization vLEI Credential Framework</a>  <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2023-12-15_vlei-egf-v2.0-legal-entity-official-organizational-role-vlei-credential-framework_v1.2_final.pdf">Legal Entity Official Organizational Role vLEI Credential Framework</a>  <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2023-12-15_vlei-egf-v2.0-legal-entity-engagement-context-role-vlei-credential-framework_v1.2_final.pdf">Legal Entity Engagement Context Role vLEI Credential Framework</a>   Identity Verification Processes <p>The identity verification process of all representatives in the vLEI ecosystem includes two subprocesses namely:</p>  Identity Assurance Process, which verifies the veracity and existence of a legal identity, as well as binding the legal identity to a representative  Identity Authentication Process, which binds the representative to an autonomic identifier (AID)  <p>Once the identity verification process is completed, a vLEI credential may be subsequently issued to the AID that has been bound to the representative.</p>Illustration of the identity verification process Identity Assurance <p>The first stage of identity verification for the vLEI ecosystem is called identity assurance. This step involves an identity proofing process to verify the legal identities of all individuals prior to obtaining vLEI credentials. The vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework (EGF) requires that Identity Assurance is performed according to Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) as defined in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63a.html">NIST SP&nbsp;800–63A</a>.</p><p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardized the identity proofing process in their Special Publication (SP) 800–63A. Although originating in the United States, SP 800–63A is one of the most influential standards for identity proofing and is widely referenced by various industries and governments worldwide.</p> Identity Assurance Level <p>NIST SP 800–63A has categorized the degrees of assurance in one’s identity into 3&nbsp;levels:</p>  Identity Assurance Level 1 (IAL1): The service provider is not required to validate or link the applicant’s self-asserted attributes to their real-life identity.  Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2): Either remote or physical identity proofing is required at this level. The applicant’s submitted evidence supports the real-world their real-world identity and verifies that the applicant is accurately linked to this identity.  Identity Assurance Level 3 (IAL3): Physical presence is required for the identity proofing process at this level. Identifying attributes must be verified by an authorized and trained service provider representative.  <p>Only IAL2 is relevant in the context of the vLEI&nbsp;EGF.</p> Identity Resolution, Validation, and Verification <p>Identity proofing in NIST SP 800–63A consists of three main components, namely:</p>  Identity Resolution: a process for uniquely distinguishing an individual within a given&nbsp;context.  Identity Validation: a process for determining the authenticity, validity, and accuracy of the identity&nbsp;evidence  Identity Verification: a process for establishing a linkage between the claimed identity and the person presenting the identity evidence.  <p>For example, an applicant for a vLEI credential could present a verifier with a set of required identity evidence. The verifier must resolve the applicant’s legal identity and validate that the presented information on the collected evidence is legitimate. Validation may involve confirming the information with an authoritative source and determining that there is no alteration to the images and data of the presented evidence. Subsequently, the verifier may verify the applicant by comparing the applicant’s live image with the one displayed on the provided identity evidence.</p> Identity Evidence Collection <p>During identity resolution and validation, the collection of “identity evidence” is required to establish the uniqueness of the individual’s identity.</p><blockquote>Note: Identity evidence is defined as information or documentation provided by the applicant to support the claimed identity. Identity evidence may be physical (e.g. a driver’s license) or&nbsp;digital.</blockquote><p>To comply with IAL2, one of the following sets of identity evidence must be collected:</p>  a piece of STRONG or SUPERIOR evidence if the evidence’s issuing source confirmed the claimed identity by collecting at least two forms of SUPERIOR or STRONG evidence before and the service provider validates the evidence with the source directly; OR  two pieces of STRONG evidence; OR  one piece of STRONG evidence plus two pieces of FAIR&nbsp;evidence  <p>NIST SP 800–63A defines five tiers of identity evidence’s strength: UNACCEPTABLE, WEAK, FAIR, STRONG, and SUPERIOR. While the strength of specific identity evidence, e.g., a driver’s license, may vary across jurisdictions, NIST provides <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3-Implementation-Resources/63A/resolution/">examples of common evidence</a> and their estimated strength, based on their general quality characteristics, for instance:</p>  SUPERIOR: passports and permanent resident&nbsp;cards  STRONG: driver’s licenses and U.S. military ID&nbsp;cards  FAIR: school ID cards and credit/debit cards  <p>Further details on the ​​strengths of identity evidence can be found in Section 5.2.1 on the NIST SP&nbsp;800–63A.</p> Identity Authentication <p>After completing identity assurance, an organization representative who applies for a vLEI credential may proceed to identity authentication, which establishes a connection between the representative — whose legal identity has been assured to meet IAL2 — to an <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7344">autonomic identifier (AID)</a>.</p><p>Once such a connection has been established, a vLEI credential could be issued to the AID with confidence that the representative is the sole controller of the AID. Subsequently, the representative may cryptographically prove their control over the AID and the issued vLEI credential.</p><blockquote>Note: An autonomic identifier (AID) is a persistent self-certifying identifier (SCID) that is derived and managed by cryptographic means without reliance on any centralized entity or distributed ledger technology.</blockquote> Credential Wallet&nbsp;Setup <p>Before identity authentication can begin, a credential wallet must be set up for the organization representative. The primary role of a credential wallet includes:</p>  Creation, storage, and management of key&nbsp;pairs  Creation, storage, and management of&nbsp;AIDs.  Digital signature creation and verification  <p>The specification for a credential wallet is detailed in <a href="https://www.gleif.org/vlei/introducing-the-vlei-ecosystem-governance-framework/2023-12-15_vlei-egf-v2.0-technical-requirements-part-1-keri-infrastructure_v1.2_final.pdf">Technical Requirements Part 1: KERI Infrastructure</a>. The credential wallet must also be used during the live Out-of-band-Introduction (OOBI) session to complete the identity authentication process.</p><blockquote>Note: A credential wallet for vLEI credentials is essentially a KERI-compatible identity wallet. It must be compliant with three specifications currently being developed under the Trust Over IP (ToIP) Foundation, namely, <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/">KERI</a>, <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-acdc-specification/#go.draft-ssmith-acdc.html">ACDC</a>, and <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/">CESR</a> specifications.</blockquote> Out-of-band-Introduction (OOBI)&nbsp;Protocol <p>The identity authentication process is implemented using the Out-of-band-Introduction (OOBI) Protocol, which is a protocol defined in the <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-keri-specification/#out-of-band-introduction-oobi">ToIP Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) specification</a>. The OOBI protocol provides a discovery mechanism for verifiable information related to an AID — including its key event log (KEL) and its service endpoint — by associating the AID with a&nbsp;URL.</p><p>For example, an AID EaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM may provide a service endpoint at <a href="http://www.example.com">www.example.com</a> with an OOBI URL&nbsp;of</p> http://www.example.com/oobi/EaU6JR2nmwyZ-i0d8JZAoTNZH3ULvYAfSVPzhzS6b5CM <p>The OOBI protocol is “out-of-band” as it enables any internet and web search infrastructure to act as an “out-of-band” infrastructure to discover information that is verified using the “in-band” KERI protocol. The OOBI protocol leverages the existing IP and DNS infrastructure for discovery so that a dedicated discovery network is not&nbsp;needed.</p><blockquote>Note: The OOBI by itself is insecure, and the information discovered by the OOBI must be verified using the KERI protocol.</blockquote><p>This OOBI URL may be used to discover the AID’s KEL as well as send messages to the AID, including sending a challenge message in a challenge-response protocol and sending a vLEI credential.</p> Challenge-Response Protocol <p>To establish a connection between a representative and an AID, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge%E2%80%93response_authentication">challenge-response protocol</a> is implemented to ensure that the representative holds the private key that controls the&nbsp;AID.</p><p>With the OOBI protocol, the verifier uses the OOBI URL as a service endpoint to deliver the challenge message to the AID controller. The verifier of an AID then generates a random number as a challenge message and sends it to the AID controller. The AID controller then uses the private key associated with the AID to sign a digital signature on the challenge. The signature is the response to the challenge message and is returned to the verifier. Finally, the verifier verifies the response using the public key of the&nbsp;AID.</p>Illustration of a challenge-response session Man-In-the-Middle Attack <p>However, there is a risk that an attacker could intercept the communication between the representative and the verifier in a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. Here, the attacker obtains the authentic OOBI URL, which contains the representative’s AID, and sends a false OOBI URL, which instead contains the attacker’s AID, to the verifier.</p>Illustration of a challenge-response session that is intercepted by a man-in-the-middle (MITM)&nbsp;attack. Real-time OOBI&nbsp;Session <p>To mitigate the risk of an MITM attack, the vLEI EGF specifies an authentication process that is called a real-time OOBI session that a representative and their verifier must complete before issuance of a vLEI credential.</p>An illustration of an OOBI&nbsp;session<p>During a real-time OOBI session, the representative and the verifier must organize a real-time in-person or a virtual face-to-face meeting, e.g., using a Zoom call. For a virtual face-to-face meeting, there are extra requirements as&nbsp;follows:</p>  The meeting must be continuous and uninterrupted throughout the entire OOBI&nbsp;session.  Both audio and video feeds of all participants must be active throughout the entire OOBI&nbsp;session.  <p>The OOBI session consists of the following steps:</p><p>1) The identity verifier performs manual verification of the representative’s legal identity, which has been verified during the identity assurance process. For example, if the representative had provided a passport as their identity evidence during identity assurance, they may present the passport to the verifier once again during their live&nbsp;session.</p><p>2) After the verifier confirms that the evidence is accurately associated with the representative present in the meeting, they must exchange their AIDs through an out-of-band channel. For example, OOBI URLs can be shared in the live chat of a Zoom call or shared via QR codes via video&nbsp;feeds.</p><p>3) The verifier sends a unique challenge message to cryptographically authenticate the representative’s AID.</p><p>4) The representative uses their private key that is associated with the AID to sign and respond to the challenge.</p><p>5) The verifier verifies the response using the public key obtained from the AID’s key event log&nbsp;(KEL).</p><p>6) The challenge-response protocol is repeated where the representative is now the challenger and the verifier the responder.</p> Group Real-time OOBI Session for QARs and&nbsp;LARs <p>For issuance of QVI and LE vLEI credentials, all QARs and all LARs of the candidate QVI and LE, respectively, must be present in the real-time OOBI&nbsp;session.</p>  For the issuance of a QVI vLEI credential, 2 External GARs and at least 3 QARs must be present during the real-time OOBI&nbsp;session.  For the issuance of a LE vLEI credential, 1 QAR and at least 3 LARs must be present during the real-time OOBI&nbsp;session.  An example authentication process of LARs by&nbsp;QARs<p>Once the Authentication steps are completed, the identity verifier can now sign the vLEI credential to the representatives of the vLEI candidate organizations. However, the vLEI credential issuance process cannot be completed by a single representative. To meet the required weight threshold of the multi-signature scheme stated in the vLEI EGF, another representative in control of the issuer’s AID must combine the authority and approve the vLEI issuance. For instance, a QAR may perform the required verification processes on all LARs of an LE and initiate the issuance of an LE vLEI credential. At least one other QAR must review and approve the issuance.</p> Conclusion <p>While the verification processes that applicants seeking vLEI credentials have to complete before the issuance might appear rather involved, these thorough steps to verify the identity of individuals representing organizations are crucial to safeguarding against identity theft, impersonation, and other fraudulent activities across various industries. After the identity assurance process validates the legal identities of representatives, and the identity authentication process cryptographically associates the representatives to AIDs. After identity verification, vLEI credentials may be issued with confidence, maintaining the integrity and reliability of the vLEI ecosystem.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/vlei-demystified-part-2-identity-verification-519102614b8e">vLEI Demystified Part 2: Identity Verification</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/finema">Finema</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 How the pending $ASI token merge affects Passive DF, Volume DF, and&nbsp;veOCEAN <p>Big news: Ocean Protocol is joining with Fetch and SingularityNET to form the Superintelligence Alliance, with a unified token $ASI. This is pending a vote of “yes” from the Fetch and SingularityNET communities, a process that will take several weeks. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-is-joining-the-superintelligence-alliance-767c82693f24">This Mar 27, 2024 article</a> describes the key mechanisms. [Update Apr 16: <a href="https://twitter.com/ASI_Alliance/status/1780221024082047381">it was a “yes”</a> from&nbsp;both.]</p><p>There are important implications for veOCEAN and Data Farming. This post describes them.</p><p>(This content was originally in Appendix 2 of the article linked above. We have since moved the content here, because it is more practically useful.)</p><p><a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Data Farming</a> (DF) is Ocean Protocol’s incentive program. If you’ve locked OCEAN for veOCEAN, to participate in Passive DF or Active DF, we’ve got you&nbsp;covered.</p><p>The Fetch and SingularityNET communities have token governance requiring approval of the token-merger action. The voting process will take several&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>Data Farming plans must account for a “yes” (from both) or a “no” outcome (from&nbsp;either).</p><p>veOCEAN, Passive DF and Volume DF will be heavily affected if “yes”. To be ready for either outcome, we will pause giving rewards for Passive DF and Volume DF as soon as the DF82 payout of Thu Mar 28 has completed. Also in preparation, we have taken a snapshot of OCEAN locked &amp; veOCEAN balances as of 00:00 am UTC Wed Mar 27 (Ethereum block 19522003); we need this information in the event of a&nbsp;“yes”.</p><p>Predictoor DF will continue regardless of voting&nbsp;outcome.</p><p>Once the votes are complete, then the next actions depend on “yes” vs&nbsp;“no”.</p> Actions if&nbsp;“no” <p>If a “no” happens, then we will resume Passive DF &amp; Volume DF&nbsp;as-is.</p><p>The first Passive DF &amp; Volume payout will be within a week after we resume, and weekly after that as per usual DF schedule. The first payout will include the payouts that were missed during the&nbsp;pause.</p> Actions if&nbsp;“yes” <p>If a “yes” happens, the following will occur. [Update Apr 16: it’s a&nbsp;“yes”]</p><p>veOCEAN will be retired. This will make it easier to have a unified ASI staking program that aligns with Fetch and SingularityNET. Passive DF &amp; Volume DF will be&nbsp;retired.</p><p>People who have locked OCEAN for veOCEAN will be made whole, as follows. <br>Each address holding veOCEAN will be airdropped OCEAN in the amount&nbsp;of:</p><blockquote>(1.25^years_til_unlock-1) * num_OCEAN_locked</blockquote><p>In words: veOCEAN holders get a reward as if they had got payouts of 25% APY for their whole lock period (and kept re-upping their lock). But they get the payout soon, rather than over years of weekly DF rewards payouts. It’s otherwise the same commitment, expectations and payout as&nbsp;before.</p><p>This airdrop will happen within weeks after the “yes”&nbsp;vote.</p><p>That same address will have its OCEAN unlocked according to its normal veOCEAN mechanics and timeline (up to 4 years). After unlock, that account holder can convert the $OCEAN directly into $ASI with the published exchange&nbsp;rate.</p><p>Any actions taken by an account on locking / re-locking veOCEAN after the time of the snapshot will be&nbsp;ignored.</p><p>Example. Alice recently locked 100 OCEAN for a duration of four years, and had received 100 veOCEAN to her&nbsp;account.</p>  She will get airdropped (1.25^4–1)*100 = (2.44–1)*100 = 144 OCEAN soon after the “yes”&nbsp;vote  In four years, her initial 100 OCEAN will&nbsp;unlock.  In total, Alice will have received 244 OCEAN (144 soon, 100 in 4&nbsp;years).  Her return is approximately the same as if she’d used Passive DF &amp; Volume DF for 4 years and got 25% APY. That is: (1.25⁴-1) * 100 = 2.44 * 100. Yet this updated scheme benefits her more because her 144 of that 244 OCEAN is liquid&nbsp;soon.  <p>psdnOCEAN. psdnOCEAN holders will be able to swap back to the OCEAN with a fixed-rate contract. For each 1 psdnOCEAN swapped they will receive &gt;1 OCEAN at a respectable ROI. Details forthcoming.</p><p>Predictoor DF. In the event of a “yes”, Predictoor DF continues. Over time, we will migrate Predictoor and Predictoor DF to use the new ASI&nbsp;token.</p><p>Data Farming budget. Ocean Protocol Foundation will re-use the DF budget for its incentives programs. These can include: scaling up Predictoor DF, ASI incentives programs, and new projects that arise from synergy among Fetch, SingularityNET, and&nbsp;Ocean.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

				  Transcripts, diplomas, and manual processing will soon be digitized, thanks to Open Badges and verifiable credential technology. Here’s how your organization can be ready.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/what-are-verifiable-credentials-with-pictures/">Verifiable credentials</a> in education allow students to share their data with verifying parties — such as places of employment or universities — without the need to check in with the original source of that information, namely the school or college where they did their coursework or received their diploma.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means that administrators no longer need to go through the manual process of authenticating documents or contacting the school that an applicant is claiming to have graduated from, saving the administrator time, the university or business money, and the student or graduate both.</p>
<p>Immediate proof of degrees and accreditation&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJdJZftt17s">hosted a Meetup</a> with Jerry Henn, Assistant Executive Director of the United School Administrators of Kansas (USA Kansas). With 35 years of experience in education, Jerry is an expert in how schools run and the pain points administrators want to remove by turning to new technologies. Henn was excited about being able to actually prove skills and achievements; claiming to know something is one thing, but being able to instantly verify that someone is accredited by using cryptography is a huge time and money saver.</p>
<p>Prove specific skills with microcredentials</p>
<p>Henn was joined by Indicio’s VP of Business Development James Schulte to talk about what he learned from attending the recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiyPLdxCKsw">1EdTech Digital Credential Summit</a>. And the headline was microcredentials, short, accredited courses that provide specific knowledge and skills, such as competence in a specific programming language, which are particularly relevant to professional development. Open Badges — particularly the verifiable credential version — simplify issuing, collecting, and verifying microcredentials. This makes it easier for an employer to assess a candidate’s qualifications, but it also helps to drive a continuous learning infrastructure.</p>
<p>Eliminate redundant paperwork and manual processes</p>
<p>Currently, authenticating a diploma requires contacting the school where it was issued, and having them dig through their records. This is a process that can take days, and can easily be delayed due to school holidays or other interruptions. This costs businesses time as they do their due diligence, makes job applicants wait longer, and requires time and physical effort by the university. Verifiable credentials allow you to trust data as if it were being presented by the original source. No more need to contact the school at all, if you can verify the credential you can move forward.</p>
<p>To learn more about the paperwork involved in school administration and how decentralized identity can help, <a href="https://indicio.tech/why-use-decentralized-identity-and-open-badges-in-education/">read Why use decentralized identity and Open Badges in education</a>.</p>
<p>Don’t be left behind</p>
<p>Education administrators are already implementing this technology to save their students and faculty time and effort. Indicio recently <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-serves-verifiable-data-solutions-to-over-2000-school-administrators-with-new-partner-usa-kansas/">partnered with USA Kansas</a> to implement verifiable credentials to over 2,000 administrators; and you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4cVQa-4yQc&amp;t=1s">see a demonstration</a> of just a few of the things that this technology can do for your organization today on the Indicio YouTube channel.</p>
<p>If you would like to discuss a use case for your organization, or think you might be ready to get started, please <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">contact us</a> and we will be in touch promptly.</p>

<p>Is your company using a patchwork approach to employee onboarding and offboarding? Or is everything in one place?&nbsp; Are you relying on a combination of HR tools, IT tools, spreadsheets, checklists, and communication across email and Slack?</p>
<p>YeshID gives you a simple, clean way to manage centralized and distributed Identity and Access Management (IAM). It’s centralized (everything in one place) and decentralized (workload doesn’t land on one set of shoulders). YeshID integrates with your existing HR and IT processes, regardless of complexity.</p>
 YeshID Simplifies Onboarding 
<p>When your new hire shows up, bright-eyed and ready to rock, the last thing you want to do is drain that enthusiasm. OK, it’s not the last thing. But never mind. You don’t want it to happen. Good news. You can use YeshID to create a smooth onboarding experience for new hires.</p>
 Scenario 1: No HR or Limited IT Integration 
<p>YeshID acts as your one-stop shop for managing both HR and IT tasks during onboarding. YeshID lets you create playbooks that include manual steps like ordering a laptop, sending company swag, compliance training, along with automated tasks like user provisioning in Google Workspace, assigning them to groups and departments, and coordinating access to other applications.</p>
<p>By centralizing the orchestration process in YeshID, you ensure a streamlined and organized onboarding experience for your new hires. By decentralizing–assigning tasks to people other than your unexpected IT person–you can get the work done faster and better.</p>
 Scenario 2: Existing HR Tool with Partial IT Provisioning 
<p>Maybe you’ve got an HR or IT tool that handles some basic IT provisioning. You probably know that it falls short if you don’t have the fancy enterprise license for all of your applications. And so you are back to a spreadsheet or document to handle the rest of your IT process.</p>
<p>But don’t worry! YeshID will seamlessly integrate with your existing process and will handle provisioning coordination (with the application owners) of the lower license tier applications that don’t have SAML/SCIM support.<br>
</p>
<p>If an HR tool creates a new user in Google Workspace, YeshID will send an alert to ensure that the rest of the onboarding takes place. You can then assign a pre-built playbook to coordinate the remaining tasks on your checklist.&nbsp;</p>
 YeshID: The Advantages 
 
 Simple Setup: Get started with YeshID in minutes, not days or weeks. 
 Flexible Workflows: YeshID adapts to your existing processes, allowing you to handle manual and automated tasks regardless of license type. 
 Effortless Compliance: YeshID simplifies compliance by centralizing access requests and approvals, ensuring a clear audit trail.

 Dawn of the DID: Part&nbsp;3  Embracing the Digital Identity Revolution <p>In today’s digital age, our online identities are as integral to our lives as our physical identities. Yet, as we navigate the vast digital landscape, the security and sovereignty of these digital selves often feel just out of reach. Enter blockchain technology, a beacon of hope in the quest for a secure and autonomous digital identity, promising a future where we hold the reins of our online personas.</p><p>Blockchain is not just a technological innovation; it’s a paradigm shift in how we manage and protect our digital identities. By offering a decentralized and immutable ledger, blockchain technology introduces a new era of security, privacy, and user control. This marks the beginning of a revolution, one where our digital identities are both safeguarded and truly our&nbsp;own.</p> Understanding Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>Our digital identity is an amalgamation of all the digital footprints we leave behind — email addresses, social media profiles, and even our online shopping habits. These bits of data paint a picture of who we are online but are scattered across the vast expanse of the internet, often under the stewardship of various online platforms. The challenge here is twofold: ensuring the security of this scattered identity and reclaiming control over how it’s used and by&nbsp;whom.</p><p>In the traditional setup, our digital identities are not fully in our control. Instead, they’re often managed by central authorities or platforms, making them susceptible to breaches, misuse, and privacy invasions. This centralized approach not only poses significant security risks but also strips individuals of their privacy and control over their own identities. The need for a shift towards a more secure, user-controlled identity system is&nbsp;clear.</p> Blockchain to the&nbsp;Rescue <p>Blockchain technology emerges as the hero in the narrative of digital identity, offering a solution that is as secure as it is revolutionary. With its decentralized nature, blockchain acts as a digital ledger that is distributed across a network, rather than being stored in a single location. This not only makes it nearly impervious to hacking but also ensures that no single entity can claim undue control over the system. The implications for digital identity are profound, promising a future where our online selves are both protected and autonomous.</p><p>The decentralized approach of blockchain brings the power back to the user, offering a level of security and privacy that centralized systems simply cannot match. By storing identity data across a network, blockchain makes unauthorized access and identity fraud exponentially more difficult. Moreover, it gives individuals the ability to manage and control their own digital identities, marking a significant step towards a future where online privacy and user sovereignty are the norms, not the exceptions.</p> The Mechanisms of Blockchain in Digital&nbsp;Identity <p>Blockchain secures digital identities through cutting-edge technologies like public-private key encryption. Imagine sending a locked box through the mail, where the recipient has the only key; this is the essence of public-private key encryption. The public key is widely available, allowing anyone to encrypt information, but the private key is held only by the recipient, ensuring that only they can decrypt and access the information. This mechanism is at the heart of blockchain’s ability to secure digital identities, ensuring that only the rightful owner can access and control their identity.</p><p>Smart contracts further enhance the security and efficiency of digital identities on the blockchain. These are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. Smart contracts automate and secure transactions, eliminating the need for intermediaries and reducing the potential for fraud. This technology not only streamlines transactions but also fortifies the trust and integrity of digital interactions, making blockchain an indispensable tool in the management of digital identities.</p> Real-World Applications and&nbsp;Benefits <p>The practical applications of blockchain in managing digital identities are as diverse as they are transformative. From securing personal medical records to ensuring the integrity of online voting systems, blockchain technology is already reshaping how we interact with the digital world. These applications not only demonstrate blockchain’s versatility but also highlight its potential to enhance security, privacy, and trust in digital transactions. By providing a secure platform for managing digital identities, blockchain paves the way for more efficient, transparent, and user-centric online services.</p><p>Beyond its practical applications, blockchain offers profound benefits for individual users. It empowers users with greater control over their personal information, ensuring that they decide who has access to their data and how it is used. This shift towards user-centric identity management represents a significant move away from the vulnerability and lack of control that characterize traditional digital identity systems. With blockchain, users enjoy enhanced privacy, reduced risk of identity theft, and a newfound sense of agency over their digital&nbsp;selves.</p> Empowering Users Through Blockchain <p>Blockchain technology doesn’t just protect; it empowers. By enabling the concept of self-sovereign identities, blockchain allows individuals to own and directly control their digital identities without the need for intermediaries. This empowerment extends beyond mere control over personal data; it fosters a digital environment where trust is built into the system, and users can engage in transactions with confidence. The impact of such a shift is profound, offering a blueprint for a digital society where privacy, security, and individual autonomy are paramount.</p><p>The empowerment provided by blockchain is a catalyst for innovation, opening doors to new ways of interacting in the digital realm that were previously unimaginable. From streamlining financial services to revolutionizing how we verify credentials and qualifications, the potential for growth and development is limitless. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, so too does the landscape of digital identity, promising a future where our online lives are not only secure but also more seamlessly integrated with our physical realities.</p> The Future Is Decentralized <p>As we stand on the cusp of a new era in digital identity management, the role of blockchain technology cannot be overstated. It heralds a future where the security, privacy, and control of digital identities are not just improved but reimagined. The journey toward a decentralized digital world is filled with promise, offering a vision of the internet where trust is inherent, and user empowerment is the standard. The path forward is clear: a future where our digital identities are as secure, sovereign, and uniquely ours as our physical&nbsp;ones.</p> Join the Revolution <p>The blockchain revolution is here, and it’s redefining what it means to own your digital identity. We invite you to dive deeper into the world of blockchain, explore its potential, and become part of the movement towards secure, decentralized digital identities. Whether you’re a seasoned expert in the realm of Web3 or just starting to explore the possibilities, your voice and your actions can help shape this exciting future. Together, we can build a digital world that respects privacy, security, and individual autonomy. Join us in paving the way toward a more secure, decentralized digital&nbsp;future.</p> A Quote or Thought to&nbsp;Ponder <blockquote>“In the end, it’s not the technology that changes the world; it’s how we use&nbsp;it.”</blockquote><p>As we embrace the possibilities that blockchain technology brings to digital identity management, let’s remember that technology is a tool — one that, in the right hands, has the power to transform lives, societies, and the world at large. The future of digital identity is not just about securing data; it’s about empowering individuals, fostering trust, and building a digital world that values and protects the identity of every user. As we move forward, let’s use this powerful tool to create a legacy of empowerment, security, and trust — a legacy that future generations will thank us&nbsp;for.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/blockchains-role-in-digital-identity-40e8b646a2fc">Blockchain’s Role in Digital Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Written by Fission's <a href="https://github.com/bgins">Brian Ginsburg</a> and <a href="https://zee.town/">Zeeshan Lakhani</a> and published on March 27th, 2024.</p><p>The <a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Everywhere Computer</a> is a decentralized platform that aims to distribute computational tasks across a vast, open network. This network spans from your personal machine to other devices on your LAN, a cluster of cloud nodes, and even to PoPs (points of presence) located at the edge of the Internet. Processing happens as close to the data source as possible, scheduled on nodes with general capacity or those with specialized capabilities like high-powered GPUs.</p><p>At its core, the Everywhere Computer is built on the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">InterPlanetary Virtual Machine (IPVM)</a> protocol. It executes workflows containing tasks that are content-addressed—which means they're uniquely identified by their content rather than by their location. This system is powered by nodes running Fission's <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar/">Homestar runtime</a>, an engine that runs WebAssembly (Wasm) based workflows composed of <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/">Wasm components</a> with runnable functions that can be scheduled and executed by any Homestar peer throughout the network.</p><p>Beyond the sandboxing, portability, and predictable performance benefits of Wasm, we're excited about orchestrating workflows and state machines composed of modules compiled from different source languages and bringing them together into workflows where the output of one task feeds into the input of another. Composing components in a workflow lets users focus on component interfaces without considering interactions between multiple languages.</p>Tasks that wrap functions are published by content identifier (CID), and distributed and executed by nodes running Homestar<p>With the Everywhere Computer, we're all in on <a href="https://youtu.be/dhoVlVu2XAw?si=x1YIQk-9Jkg_FphP">"the return of write once, run anywhere"</a> as a motto, but with content-addressing and our focus on caching and replayability of previously computed tasks, we can go a step further and say:</p><blockquote>Write once, run once, and never run again (everywhere!)</blockquote><p>This post will introduce authoring Wasm components and functions for the Everywhere Computer. Wasm components can be written in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-guest-languages">several different programming languages</a>— including C/C++, Java (TeaVM Java), Go (TinyGo), and C#—but we'll focus on Rust, JavaScript, and Python for this post. We'll be writing functions in each of these languages, compiling and packaging them as Wasm components, and bringing them together into a workflow that executes on our compute platform. Along the way, we'll introduce Wasm component tooling, the Homestar runtime, and <a href="https://docs.everywhere.computer/everycli/">EveryCLI</a>, which provides a convenient interface for running Homestar with a gateway for preparing and executing workflows.</p><p>The Everywhere Computer is in beta. The <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer">GitHub repositories</a> and <a href="https://docs.everywhere.computer/">docs</a> are publicly available and open-source licensed. We have a closed beta group to provide high-quality support and to gather feedback. <a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Sign up</a> for the beta group. We would love to hear what you are working on and what ideas you have for using the Everywhere Computer!</p><p>This post is a high-level overview that can be used a companion to the code in the <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024">everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024</a> repository. We won't cover every detail in this overview, so clone this repository if you would like to follow along.</p> Background: Wasm components, WIT, &amp; WASI logging <p>Evolution within the Wasm ecosystem is happening at a wicked fast pace, particularly now that the <a href="https://youtu.be/phodPLY8zNE">path to Wasm components</a> has been streamlined and standardized, module-to-module interop is trivial.</p><p>In the Everywhere Computer, we decided to use the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/CanonicalABI.md">Canonical ABI</a> to convert between the values and functions exposed by components written using the Component Model and those provided by <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/">Core WebAssembly</a> modules instead of imposing a custom ABI upon our users. A component is just a wrapper around a core module that specifies its imports, internal definitions, and exports using interfaces defined with the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md">Wasm Interface Type (WIT)</a> IDL format.</p><p>Unlike core modules, components may not export Wasm memory, reinforcing Wasm sandboxing and enabling interoperation between languages with different memory assumptions. For example, a component that relies on Wasm-GC (garbage collected) memory compiled from a dynamic language can seamlessly interact with a component compiled from a static language using linear memory.</p><p>The Everywhere Computer strives for <a href="https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy/">simplicity</a>. By adopting the Component model and its tooling (for example, <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component">cargo-component</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen">wit-bindgen</a>), we can run workflows combining components from different languages without handling arbitrary Wasm modules or introducing custom tooling, bindgens, or SDKs for our ecosystem.</p><p>In addition, while our Homestar runtime utilizes alternate formats as internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_representation">intermediate representations</a>, by adopting WIT, we can <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar/tree/main/homestar-wasm#interpreting-between-ipld-and-wit">interpret</a> between WIT values and other data models at runtime without exposing these internal formats to function writers.</p> Embedding Wasmtime <p>The Homestar runtime embeds the <a href="https://docs.wasmtime.dev/">Wasmtime</a> runtime to execute Wasm components associated with tasks in a workflow. The Wasmtime runtime is built and maintained by the <a href="https://bytecodealliance.org/">Bytecode Alliance</a>. It provides multi-language support and fine-grained configuration for CPU and memory usage.</p><p>Wasmtime is at the forefront of the Wasm ecosystem, which includes their support of the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) stack that recently reached <a href="https://blog.sunfishcode.online/wasi-0-2/">WASI Preview 2</a>. WASI gives library developers and implementers like us lower-level primitives for working with files, sockets, and HTTP with a stable set of common interfaces to build on.</p><p>Some of the other platforms and frameworks that have adopted Wasmtime include <a href="https://wasmcloud.com/blog/wasmtime-a-standardized-runtime-for-wasmcloud">wasmCloud</a>, <a href="https://www.fermyon.com/spin">Spin</a>, and <a href="https://www.fastly.com/products/compute">Fastly Compute</a>.</p> WIT <p>In the following sections, we will use WIT interfaces to define the types of our functions and a <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html#worlds">world</a> to describe the imports and exports associated with each Wasm component. Then, we will implement the interfaces in Rust, JavaScript, and Python.</p><p>WIT provides built-in types, including primitives like signed/unsigned integer types, floats, strings, and more interesting and complex types like results, options, and lists. WIT also provides a way to define custom, user-defined types like records, variants, and enums. Homestar supports all of these WIT types internally (except <a href="https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html#resources">resources</a>, which we do not permit in guest code) when translating between other formats and data structures.</p> WASI Logging <p>EveryCLI reports logs executed by guest programs running on the Homestar host runtime. To emit log messages, Homestar implements the proposed <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-logging/tree/main">WASI logging WIT interface</a> which exposes the <code>log</code> method to function writers for integration into their programs. As we'll demonstrate later in this post, when you call <code>log</code> in your guest code, EveryCLI will display logs in a console at a specified level of verbosity and with contextual information.</p><p>In addition, EveryCLI provides detailed information that reports workflow events and runtime execution errors.</p> Writing Functions <p>In this post, we will write arithmetic operations in each source language to keep our example code simple. Our Rust program will perform addition and division, the JavaScript one will perform subtraction, and the Python program will perform multiplication. We will use division to show division by zero error reporting.</p><p>Our functions will be compiled into Wasm components using tools from or built upon the excellent work of the Bytecode Alliance. The Wasm component ecosystem is evolving quickly, so keep in mind that the techniques described in this blog post may be out of date. We'll provide links so you can check on the latest developments.</p><p>Clone the <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024">writing-functions-blogpost-2024</a> repository if you would like to follow along. The repository includes instructions for installing dependencies, tooling, and compiling components for each language. We will use <a href="https://docs.everywhere.computer/everycli/">EveryCLI</a> to run workflows that call the functions in these components.</p> Rust <p>For writing a function in Rust, we will use <code><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component">cargo component</a></code> to generate a Wasm component. If you're following along with the code examples, please run the <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024/tree/main/rust#setup">Rust setup</a> instructions.</p><p><code>cargo component</code> imagines what first-class support for WebAssembly components might look like for Rust.

world multiplication {
  import wasi:logging/logging;

  export multiply: func(a: float64, b: float64) -&gt; float64;
}
</code> wit/multiplication.wit<p><code>componentize-py</code> generates a set of bindings to import into our Python source code. Unlike Rust, the bindings do not need to be written to a file and can be generated on the fly.</p><p>Our <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024/blob/main/python/app.py">Python source code</a> multiplies two numbers and logs the operation:</p> <code>import multiplication

        return a * b
</code> python/app.py<p>We run <code>componentize-py</code> to generate our Wasm component:</p> <code>componentize-py -d ../wit -w multiplication componentize app -o output/multiply.wasm
</code> <p>The <code>-d</code> option tells <code>componentize-py</code> where to look for our WIT interfaces and <code>-w</code> tells it which WIT world to use. The <code>componentize</code> command takes the name of the Python module containing the app to wrap. In our case, we are targeting <code>app.py</code>.</p><p><code>componentize-py</code> bundles <code>CPython</code>, <code>libc</code>, and other dependencies into the Wasm component to interpret and provide a Python environment for our code. Like JavaScript, this comes at a size and performance cost but is necessary to run Python code.</p><p>We recommend reading the <a href="https://www.fermyon.com/blog/introducing-componentize-py">Introducing Componentize-Py</a> blog post for more information on writing Python-sourced components. Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkAO17lmqsI">Introducing Componentize-Py: A Tool for Packaging Python Apps as Components</a> is an excellent talk that explains how <code>componentize-py</code> works.</p> Workflows <p>We now have a set of Wasm components with arithmetic functions sourced from multiple languages. Let's run these functions together in some workflows!</p><p>Install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@everywhere-computer/every-cli">EveryCLI</a>, and then we'll write a workflow:</p> <code>npm i -g @everywhere-computer/every-cli
</code> <p>Homestar and the Everywhere Computer currently use <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/command-line-quick-start/">IPFS Kubo</a> as a content-addressed storage layer for Wasm components. In the near future, we'll support other forms of distributed storage.</p><p>EveryCLI starts a gateway that loads Wasm components onto IPFS, prepares workflows, and calls on the Homestar runtime to schedule and execute them.</p><p>EveryCLI provides a simplified workflow syntax that it uses to prepare the underlying workflow. Let's start by using <code>math.wasm</code> in <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024/blob/main/workflows/add.json">a workflow</a> to add two numbers:</p> <code>{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "run": {
        "name": "add",
        "input": {
          "args": [3.1, 5.2],
          "func": "add"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code> workflows/add.json<p>A workflow is an array of tasks that we would like to execute. Each task is given a <code>name</code>, which will be used to reference results in subsequent tasks. Our task <code>input</code> includes the name of the function to execute and its arguments.</p><p>Let's run this workflow! Start EveryCLI with <code>math.wasm</code> as an argument:</p> <code>every dev rust/target/wasm32-wasi/release/math.wasm
</code> <p>EveryCLI starts a gateway that we can query for a JSON Schema representing the WIT interfaces in <code>math.wasm</code> at <code>localhost:3000</code>.</p><p>Post the workflow to the gateway:</p> <code>curl localhost:3000/run --json @workflows/add.json
</code> <p>The response reports the result of adding <code>3.1</code> and <code>5.2</code> as <code>8.3</code>.</p><p>In addition, EveryCLI has passed along logs from the Homestar runtime:</p>Logs on running the add workflow<p>The logs report information about workflow execution and include our WASI logs. Our WASI log reports <code>"3.1 + 5.2 = 8.3"</code> with the category <code>guest:rust:add</code>. WASI logs always have the <code>wasm_execution</code> subject.</p><p>We can also see workflow settings, fetching resources (our Wasm components), initializing, starting, and completing the workflow. The "resolving receipts" log shows that Homestar is looking for cached results so it can avoid work where possible. The "computed receipt" log reports the <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/">CID</a>, a content identifier derived from the content's cryptographic hash, of the receipt from the add computation. EveryCLI returns the workflow result, but the computed receipts can be also used to pull results directly from IPFS by CID.</p><p>If we post the workflow to the gateway again, we see a different set of logs:</p>Logs on replaying the add workflow<p>This time we don't need to do any work. Homestar cached the receipts from our last run and reports that it is replaying the workflow and its receipts.</p><p>Notice also that our WASI log does not show up. WASI logging happens only on execution, not replay. We'll see in a moment how we can force re-execution to always see WASI logs.</p><p>Let's try <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024/blob/main/workflows/all.json">a workflow</a> that uses all four arithmetic operations from our Rust, JavaScript, and Python-sourced components:</p> <code>{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "run": {
        "name": "add",
        "input": {
          "args": [3.1, 5.2],
          "func": "add"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "run": {
        "name": "subtract",
        "input": {
          "args": ["{{needs.add.output}}", 4.4],
          "func": "subtract"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "run": {
        "name": "multiply",
        "input": {
          "args": ["{{needs.subtract.output}}", 2.3],
          "func": "multiply"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "run": {
        "name": "divide",
        "input": {
          "args": ["{{needs.multiply.output}}", 1.5],
          "func": "divide"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code> workflows/all.json<p>In this workflow, each task except the first receives input from the previous task. For example, <code>subtract</code> awaits the output of <code>add</code> by using <code>{{needs.add.output}}</code> as a placeholder that will be filled in when <code>add</code> has completed.</p><p>Restart EveryCLI, passing in all of our Wasm components:</p> <code>every dev rust/target/wasm32-wasi/release/math.wasm javascript/output/subtract-j54di3rspj2eewjro4.wasm python/output/multiply.wasm --debug
</code> <p>The hash of your subtract Wasm component may be different. Check <code>javascript/output</code> for the appropriate file name.</p><p>We use the <code>--debug</code> flag this time to force re-execution of the tasks in our workflow. The <code>--debug</code> flag lets us see our WASI logs on every run while we are developing our functions, but it should not be used in production because it eliminates the benefits of caching.</p><p>Post this workflow:</p> <code>curl localhost:3000/run --json @workflows/all.json
</code> <p>The response reports a result of <code>5.98</code> which looks close enough for computer math!</p><p>Our WASI logging reports each operation:</p>Logs on running all operations workflow<p>We can see WASI logs from each component, labeled by category as <code>guest:rust:add</code>, <code>guest:javascript:subtract</code>, <code>guest:python:multiply</code>, and <code>guest:rust:divide</code>.</p><p>Lastly, <a href="https://github.com/everywhere-computer/writing-functions-blogpost-2024/blob/main/workflows/division_by_zero.json">a workflow</a> that attempts division by zero to check our error reporting.</p> <code>{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "run": {
        "name": "divide",
        "input": {
          "args": [3.1, 0.0],
          "func": "divide"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
</code> workflows/division_by_zero.json<p>Post this workflow:</p> <code>curl localhost:3000/run --json @workflows/division_by_zero.json</code> <p>On running this workflow, we see two errors:</p>Logs on running division by zero workflow<p>The first error is our WASI log reporting a "Division by zero error". The second error is an execution error from the Wasm runtime. It's a bit inscrutable, but we can see "not able to run fn divide" which tells us which function failed.</p> Conclusion <p>In this post, we have introduced the Everywhere Computer and how you can get started writing functions and workflows for it.</p><p>So far, to execute workflows, we've used <code>curl</code> to POST manually constructed JSON workflows to the gateway. You may have noticed from the EveryCLI starts a Control Panel web interface:</p>The Control Panel running<p>For a demo of how the Control Panel works, including its graphical workflow builder and custom function schema forms, check out our <a href="https://youtu.be/M6n2dhjmYes?si=1WkIsiMQth_qJAsn&amp;t=943">February 2024 overview video</a>.</p><p>We have much more to share! We will write about the Control Panel, offloading compute to other nodes in a network based on their capability or a scheduling policy, and working with non-determinism like network requests and persistent state in a workflow in future posts.</p> Acknowledgments <p>We want to offer heartfelt thanks to those developing Wasmtime, ComponentizeJS, Componentize-Py, and the many tools available throughout the Wasm ecosystem.

<p>Mydex CIC is one of a group of organisations winning an international award for Technology Enabled Care. The project in Moray, Scotland has been named best Up and Coming TEC innovation at the ITEC (International Technology Care) Awards 2024 this&nbsp;month.</p><p>The project is part of a UK government-funded Rural Centre of Excellence and run under the auspices of the Scotland-based Digital Health &amp; Care Innovation Centre (DHI). It revolves around the generation and collation of holistic data of social determinants of health. Mydex personal data stores lie at the heart of it, enabling individuals to collect and share data about their lives and their health under their&nbsp;control.</p><p>Press reports quote Dr Malcolm Simmons, GP clinical lead for Moray, as&nbsp;saying:</p><blockquote>“The development of the personal data store has the potential to overcome several significant practical difficulties patients, families, GPs, carers, and other professionals face when trying to share information that is used to optimise the care provided to an individual. With the person controlling who has access to their information, the individual can choose to share their information with everyone who is important to them, thereby allowing health and care teams to communicate more effectively, improving care for the individual at the centre of this&nbsp;model.”</blockquote><blockquote>“In the future, everyone could have access to this technology, allowing phone or tablet real-time access to results, health information and advice with up-to-date information about local resources and services that might help deal with health problems or encourage a healthier lifestyle.”</blockquote><p>The collation and analysis of the data in the project is internationally unique and offers the potential for significant impact to both citizens and services through its ability to generate individual and population level insights. This enables enhanced self-management, early intervention and targeted resources, the idea being to relieve pressure on frontline services and deliver more targeted and efficient care.</p><p>This is one of many projects Mydex CIC is currently working on to use its personal data infrastructure to help people and services deliver and experience better health and care outcomes at lower cost, in terms of time, energy and hassle as well as&nbsp;money.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/dhi-mydex-project-wins-international-award-53ce93f5c7be">DHI/Mydex project wins international award</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Introduction: Towards Decentralized Artificial Superintelligence <p>Speed of AI. With the release of the latest LLMs, the pace of innovation in AI has noticeably accelerated from its already fast pace. It’s now a torrent of innovation that every single startup, decentralized project and large multinational must come to terms&nbsp;with.</p><p>Decentralized AI. As three of the longest serving OG teams of the decentralized AI world, committed to open and beneficial AI, committed to decentralization and striving to build exit ramps away from centralized monopolies; we aim to give AI researchers, companies and governments an alternative that doesn’t lock them into walled gardens and silos to tilt to a particular bias, or worse, allow the risk of user de-platforming and the loss of their intellectual property, social graph and followers.</p><p>The need for scale. The resources needed to win this competition are immense. We joked internally that we are the “Rebel Alliance” against the large platforms — but it’s actually no joke. The world needs a full, vertically integrated stack of decentralized tools to harness and leverage AI, and give users an alternative in case the monopolies no longer serve the needs of all&nbsp;users.</p> Why NOW? <p>AI is not only moving fast, it’s accelerating. AGI and ASI loom&nbsp;near.</p><p>Artificial General Superintelligence (AGI) — when an AI system can perform all human tasks at least a human level of competence — looms near. The acceleration will continue past AGI, straight to Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) when AI systems perform at far-beyond human levels of competence.</p><blockquote>It is imperative for humanity that artificial superintelligence is fundamentally decentralized.</blockquote><p>Not just “don’t be centralized” but can’t be centralized. Artificial superintelligence must be decentralized across the whole technology stack: from the network infrastructure, to AI infrastructure software (agents, data), to AI models &amp; prediction.</p><p>We at Fetch, Ocean Protocol and SingularityNET have been leading decentralized AI for the past seven years. In fact, the founders of each have been driving AI for decades before that. We’ve been building towards fundamentally decentralized network infrastructure, decentralized AI infrastructure software (agents, data), and decentralized AI models &amp; prediction. We have long been aligned philosophically, with mutual respect among the teams, and have had several specific project collaborations.</p><blockquote>We have been building and moving quickly. Yet, centralized AI has moved faster and accumulated enormous capital: All towards AGI then&nbsp;ASI.</blockquote><blockquote>If we want AI to be fundamentally decentralized, we must deliver decentralized AI, with scale, stronger and more robust: All towards AGI then&nbsp;ASI.</blockquote><p>Charlie Munger famously said “Show me the incentives, and I will show you the outcome.” Well, here are the incentives. In this singular move, we have aligned the economic incentives of these teams and their communities.</p> 2. Pillars of&nbsp;Focus <p>Our efforts — as group of three organizations — will follow three&nbsp;pillars:</p>  We’re building decentralized Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) — for humanity and for the&nbsp;future.  On the continuum from today to the future, we balance the ASI future with efforts on decentralized AI tools for present-day applications in business and retail users. These are the world-class tools that all three Foundations have built; we will continue to develop&nbsp;these.  AI, AGI and ASI want compute, specifically the silicon and the energy to power the compute. We intend to use the scale of $ASI to move even more aggressively in securing compute for AI, decentralized-style.   3. Complementary Strengths <p>The Superintelligence Alliance brings together the best of decentralized AI.</p><p>Each team Fetch, Ocean, SingularityNET have strengths that can be leveraged by the Alliance. We’ve all been building different parts of the decentralized stack, with little overlap. SingularityNET has been building a path to AGI &amp; ASI, and is strong in R&amp;D — with seven live projects launched, many with their own tokens. Fetch has an L1 network that we can all leverage, leading edge technology for AI Agents, and recently invested $100 million in GPUs. They also have a top-notch business development and commercialization team. With Ocean, we’ve assembled a lot of building blocks to allow decentralized data sharing, access control and payment. Our Predictoor product has seen over $800 million in volume, just six months since launch, and it has its own exponential path to&nbsp;ASI.</p><p>Teaming up allows us to leverage a deeper bench of AI &amp; crypto builder talent and evangelists, spanning the globe. The Alliance has some of the leading researchers, developers and commercialization know-how, under one umbrella to push adoption of decentralized technology.</p><p>Finally, the value-flow from deep research, to tools &amp; applications, and finally to large-scale commercialization of data and AI services is now possible — all while giving users full control and&nbsp;choice.</p> 4. How the Alliance Becomes Greater than the&nbsp;Parts <p>The Superintelligence Alliance exists to give people the freedom of choice to own and control their data and AI, to respect each person’s autonomy and sovereignty. This is more important than ever in a world with artificial general intelligence then artificial superintelligence.</p><p>We apply these principles to our own collaboration as well. Even though a common website for the Superintelligence Alliance will be put up, each Foundation — Fetch, Ocean Protocol, and SingularityNET — will remain as independent legal entities, with the existing leadership, teams, communities and token treasury. As a baseline, existing initiatives from each Foundation will continue as planned. Any changes with respect to a given Foundation’s offering will be announced via official channels. Specific for Ocean Protocol: everything will continue as-is for now with the exception of Passive Data Farming and Volume Data Farming; details are&nbsp;below.</p><p>To a large extent, each Foundation already exhibits varying levels of decentralization in the control of the token, governance, the diversity of the community and the number of independent spin-out projects.</p><p>Over time, as the Foundations collaborate and the teams get the chance to work more closely together, we will announce joint projects and collaborations — either internally to strengthen the overall product offering and improve the user experience, or externally to bring stronger go-to-market services for large and enterprise customers.</p><p>Each Foundation is free to do as they like, to bring forward the values and adoption of decentralized AI — without coercion or compulsion to pressure other Alliance members. When cross-team collaborations make compelling and pragmatic sense, we’ll do it. If it doesn’t, two teams could be working on a similar topic with different approaches. Community members are free to join, and free to leave at all&nbsp;times.</p>Figure 1 — Levels of Integration of the Superintelligence Alliance<p>Governing council. To manage this symphony of decentralization, a governing council will be formed with Humayun Sheikh as Chairman, Ben Goertzel as the CEO, and Trent and Bruce will represent Ocean Protocol and we’ll do our part to contribute to a shared Superintelligence Alliance&nbsp;vision.</p><p>The text above it is essential, as it forms the core principles of our Alliance, and will guide how we move forward. Enticingly, this flexible framework leaves open the opportunity for other decentralized teams who share our values to join the Alliance in the future, to add even more strengths and capabilities.</p> 4. The New $ASI&nbsp;Token <p>From Day 1, the $ASI token (the renamed $FET token) will have a market capitalization ranking it around #20 on CoinMarketCap. This placement gives the Alliance significantly more exposure to a broader, global audience and puts $ASI as a strong candidate to be included in any index-based AI and crypto-ETF.</p><p>There are 225,000 wallet holders of $FET, $OCEAN and $AGIX tokens, as well as several hundred thousand more holders who leave their tokens on exchanges.</p><p>With the rise in token ranking of $ASI, we can expect our community to grow rapidly, and with it, an increase in trading volumes and attention from sophisticated players.</p> What Happens&nbsp;Next <p>With the announcement live, each Foundation will speak to business partners, answer questions from the community and start to plan the next&nbsp;steps.</p><p>The first priority is to execute the token merge. The $FET token will be the reserve token of the Superintelligence Alliance. It will be renamed $ASI — ‘Artificial Superintelligence.’ Holders of $OCEAN and $AGIX need not do anything right now. You can continue to hold your tokens without worry as the exchange rate between $FET/$ASI and $OCEAN is fixed to 0.433226 $ASI per $OCEAN and the 0.433350 $ASI per $AGIX. Holders can choose to swap their tokens as soon as the token swap tool is available, or 10 years from now if they want to, at their leisure. The exchange rate will remain fixed. There is no&nbsp;rush.</p> Token Exchange Mechanism <p>Starting with $FET as the base token of the Alliance, the $FET token will be renamed $ASI, and an additional 1.48 Billion tokens will be minted, with 867 million $ASI allocated to $AGIX holders and 611 million $ASI allocated to $OCEAN token holders. The total supply of $ASI tokens will be 2.63 Billion&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>We took a snapshot on Monday, 25 March 2024. Here is the Max Supply (#) and Fully Diluted Value ($)&nbsp;summary:</p>Figure 2 — Fully Diluted Valuation ($) and Max Token Supply (#) of&nbsp;$ASI<p>Here is the calculation basis for the token minting to give a proportional share of new $ASI tokens to $OCEAN and $AGIX&nbsp;holders:</p>Figure 3 — Token Supply Calculation<p>Token holders will receive 0.433226 $ASI per $OCEAN and 0.433350 $ASI per $AGIX. This exchange rate is fixed and will not change. We expect that smart arbitrageurs will notice if a price differential between the tokens arises, and then arb it out to maintain a balance and equilibrium in the exchange&nbsp;rate.</p> 6. Actions for Token&nbsp;Holders <p>$FET Tokens on Exchanges</p><p>If you have $FET tokens on an exchange, they will be automatically relabeled as $ASI tokens. No action is needed from you. We’ll coordinate with the exchanges on your&nbsp;behalf.</p><p>$OCEAN and $AGIX tokens on Exchanges</p><p>If you have $OCEAN and $AGIX tokens on an exchange, no action is needed. We will work with each exchange to ensure a smooth conversion and your holdings will automatically be converted to $ASI tokens directly by the exchange.</p><p>One day, you’ll log in and you won’t see your $OCEAN or $AGIX — but don’t panic! The tokens are there — look for the $ASI symbol near the top of the&nbsp;list.</p><p>Don’t Deposit $OCEAN / $AGIX tokens into Exchanges after they’ve Executed a Conversion</p><p>When an exchange has converted all $OCEAN and $AGIX tokens, the tickers $OCEAN and $AGIX will be retired from the exchange. If anyone accidentally sends $OCEAN or $AGIX an exchange after the conversion event, we cannot guarantee that the tokens will be available or converted to $ASI. So please keep abreast of notices and announcements from your exchanges.</p><p>If you hold $OCEAN or $AGIX outside of an exchange and want to convert them to $ASI tokens, please see the next paragraph.</p><p>$OCEAN / $AGIX Tokens in Hard Wallets or&nbsp;Offline</p><p>For those of you holding your tokens in hard wallets or offline, a token swap mechanism will be available in the coming weeks to allow holders to exchange their $OCEAN and $AGIX for&nbsp;$ASI.</p><p>Once made available, this swap mechanism will be available indefinitely to allow long-term stakers to exchange their $OCEAN and $AGIX for $ASI tokens when their tokens unlock, without any FX or exchange&nbsp;risk.</p><p>Data Farming &amp;&nbsp;Staking</p><p>Some of you have locked your $OCEAN for up to 4 years in Data Farming. We’ve got you covered. Appendix 2 on Data Farming has&nbsp;details.</p><p>Timing for the Token Swap Mechanism</p><p>The token swap contracts have been tested and audited but given the complexity of the coordination with hundreds of business partners, we’ll complete a more detailed analysis, speak with partners &amp; exchanges, and come back to the community with a firm date to release the token swap tool. Stay&nbsp;tuned.</p><p>DEXes and Pool Liquidity</p><p>We encourage liquidity providers to remove any $OCEAN and $AGIX related liquidity from DEXs at your convenience. Users may experience higher slippage in pools with lower liquidity. We recommend that you size your swap according to the available liquidity to minimize slippage.</p><p>Once you have your removed liquidity and have OCEAN in your wallet, wait until token swap contracts are ready to use and exchange OCEAN to&nbsp;ASI.</p><p>Once a threshold of 95% of the $OCEAN and $AGIX token supply is converted to $ASI, Ocean Protocol and SingularityNET Foundations will remove any pool liquidity that we have provisioned.</p> 7. Conclusion <p>We’re excited. You’re&nbsp;excited.</p><p>This Alliance makes sense because the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. We can move faster, aggressively deliver more features and have the scale to compete globally and commercialize a decentralized stack of&nbsp;tools.</p><p>Our ambition is nothing less than to accelerate the path to artificial superintelligence, while carving out an essential role for humans and respecting the dignity and sovereignty of each one of&nbsp;us.</p><p>The covenant that we make to you, our community and the Superintelligence Alliance is the same — we will build the tools to help every human have a chance to thrive in a future where AI, AGI and ASI is a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Join us. Build with us. Be a part of the movement.</p> About Ocean <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data. Ocean tools enable businesses and individuals to trade tokenized data assets seamlessly to manage data all along the AI model life-cycle. Ocean-powered apps include enterprise-grade data exchanges, data science competitions, and data DAOs. Our Ocean Predictoor product has over $800 million in monthly volume, just six months after launch with a roadmap to scale foundation models globally.</p> Appendix 1: Beware of&nbsp;Scams <blockquote>Most Importantly, We Really Can’t Stress this Enough — BEWARE of SCAMS&nbsp;!!!</blockquote><p>Our number one priority is to protect the community.</p><p>Moments like these are a prime time for scammers to appear with tempting, time-sensitive, “click-now!” links. Don’t fall for it. It breaks our hearts every time someone is scammed because there’s little we can do other than maybe file a police&nbsp;report.</p><p>We cannot stress how important it is to maintain vigilance and remember — there is no time urgency to swap your $OCEAN / $AGIX for $ASI. Do it at your&nbsp;leisure.</p><p>Here are some ways to stay&nbsp;safe:</p>  Cross-verify any call to action to exchange your tokens. Visit Fetch, Ocean Protocol and/or SingularityNET Twitter/X handles and check if our Tweets point to the same url or destination.  Rely only on official sources that you independently type in the destination on your browser and avoid following any links. There are many impersonator websites designed to look authentic, to steal your tokens. For instance, on Twitter — if you see @FetchAI, check the number of followers — it should be 200,000. Most impersonators will have only 50 bot followers — that’s a clear sign of a&nbsp;scammer.  In Telegram, only click on links from the pinned notices posted by Admins. Admins have been explicitly instructed not to post links in the message threads. All official messages will be pinned, not in the deluge of scrolling messages.  For Telegram/Discord, always use public channels or threads and do not engage in private messages promising to&nbsp;help.  Our Admins are instructed NEVER to proactively reach out to users. Be extremely wary of any direct messages from an “Admin” with a call to action. We’ve designed the process so that users can swap their tokens at their leisure with no urgency. The exchange rate is fixed between $OCEAN / $AGIX and $ASI, so regardless of price action — you will get your allocated share of&nbsp;$ASI.  NEVER share your private key or seed (12, 15,18, 24 words) used to generate your wallet with anyone, nor enter them into a&nbsp;website.  If you have a problem, reach out via Twitter/X by writing a DM or posting a public Tweet. One of our admins should see it and respond using the official account from Fetch, Ocean or SingularityNET. Nonetheless be very wary and maintain vigilance for any links and rely only on official sources and websites.  If you do fall for a scammer and you post a plea for help on a forum or Telegram, more scammers will come out of the woodwork to offer you to recover your tokens for a fee. Don’t fall for this scam. Send a message via Twitter to either Fetch, Ocean or SingularityNET and one of the Admins will get back to&nbsp;you.  <p>Stay safe! People will try to scam you out of your hard-earned tokens. We’ve designed the process so that you can swap your tokens in a relaxed manner with no rush. If you are unsure, Ask and keep asking until you are 100% sure that it is safe to execute the&nbsp;actions.</p> Appendix 2: Data Farming &amp; OCEAN&nbsp;Locking <p><a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Data Farming</a> (DF) is Ocean Protocol’s incentive program.

 Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol and SingularityNET Unite to Create <br>Artificial Superintelligence Alliance  Artificial Intelligence Pioneers Combine to Create a Decentralized Alternative to Existing AI Projects Controlled by Big Tech<br> <br>Combined value of $FET, $OCEAN and $AGIX is USD$7.6 Billion as of March 26,&nbsp;2024 <p>Zug and Singapore — March 27, 2024 — SingularityNET (SNET), the world’s first decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) network, Fetch.ai, a Web3 platform for the new AI economy, and Ocean Protocol, a decentralized data exchange platform to protect data, have launched the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance. The creation of the largest open-sourced, decentralized network through a multi-billion token merger is a major step that accelerates the race to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).</p><p>The Alliance is the brainchild of three leading minds in decentralized AI. Dr. Ben Goertzel, renowned as the “Father of AGI”, founded SNET as a blockchain-based marketplace and framework for AI services. Deep Mind founding investor Humayun Sheikh built Fetch.ai as a decentralized multi-agent platform to deploy and commercialize AI applications. Trent McConaghy, the architect of the AI-based software that most chip designers use to drive Moore’s Law, formed Ocean Protocol to provide a platform for data exchange and the seamless trade of tokenized data&nbsp;assets.</p><p>As part of the formation of the Alliance, the $FET, $OCEAN and $AGIX tokens that fuel the three Alliance member networks will be merged into a single $ASI token that will function across the combined decentralized AI network, providing unprecedented scale and&nbsp;power.</p> Built for Super Intelligence <p>“As the AI revolution intensifies it is imperative that AGI and ASI are not owned and controlled by any particular party with their own biased interests,” comments Dr. Ben Goertzel, CEO and Founder of SNET. “They should be rolled out in an open, democratic and decentralized way. This has been the joint vision of SNET, Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol from their inception, and for this reason it makes total sense that our three projects come together to form a tokenomic network that has greater power to take on Big Tech and shift the center of gravity of the AI world into the decentralized ecosystem.”</p><p>“In a world of exponential AI innovation, the giants of Big Tech dominate the headlines and conversation,’” remarks Humayun Sheikh, Fetch.ai CEO &amp; Founder. “We are forging a different path. Our mission with this merger is to combine our platforms to ensure ethical and transparent AI that facilitates direct interactions between developers and users to bypass the traditional gatekeepers of centralized authorities. This enhances data privacy and paves the way for a more democratic and trustworthy AI ecosystem and encourages global participants to contribute.”</p> Compelling Strategic Rationale   Capitalizes on Rise of AI and Growth of Three AI Projects: The combination is born of a period of unprecedented growth for the AI projects. The deal provides an unparalleled opportunity for these three influential leaders to create a powerful compelling alternative to Big Tech’s control over AI development, use and monetization.  Creates a Decentralized AI Infrastructure at Scale: Decentralized AI leverages blockchain technology to turn AI systems, whose inner workings are hidden from the public, into open networks for coordinating machine intelligence towards shared objectives. The fusion of SNET, Fetch.ai and Ocean Protocol’s research, brands, technologies and products creates a foundation to build a scalable AI infrastructure which ensures ethical and trustworthy practices.  Accelerates Investment into AGI: Goertzel, Sheikh and McConaghy have long been acolytes and early-adopters of Artificial Intelligence — all focused on making AGI a reality. This Superintelligence Alliance facilitates the commercialization of each foundation’s technology, and enables wide scale access to cutting-edge AI platforms and large databases. This groundbreaking move advances the path to AGI on the blockchain.   Transaction Details <p>Bruce Pon, Ocean Protocol CEO &amp; Co-Founder, believes the combination can deliver on the promise of a vertically integrated stack of decentralized technologies with scale to compete globally. “The combination of our technologies creates a leader in R&amp;D, applications and commercialization of AGI,” Pon notes. “The unified $ASI token is the glue to orchestrate all actors with common incentives. $ASI tokens are used to secure the public network, as data access tokens and to unlock computation without needing traditional banking and payment rails. It is the native currency for the machine economy.”</p><p>When the proposal receives majority approval from the respective communities, the following will&nbsp;occur:</p>  $FET becomes $ASI with a total supply of 2.63055 billion&nbsp;tokens  $AGIX tokens migrate to $ASI, at a conversion rate of 0.433350:1  $OCEAN tokens migrate to $ASI, at a conversion rate of 0.433226:1  $ASI will have a total FDV of $7.6 billion USD (combined value as at March 26,&nbsp;2024).   Leadership and Governance <p>Upon closing of this token merger, a governing council for the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance will monitor and guide operations of the newly merged tokenomic network. The Alliance will be led by Ben Goertzel, Humayun Sheikh, Bruce Pon and Trent McConaghy. The organizations that guide development of the three merging networks, Fetch.ai, Ocean Protocol Foundation and SNET Foundation, will continue to operate as separate entities, but will collaborate closely in the shared $ASI tokenomic ecosystem and in the operation of the Alliance.</p><p>“Among our many commercial and research goals for this combined network to work is to launch a decentralized neural-symbolic AGI system with globally-superior capabilities in key areas like logical and scientific reasoning and artistic creativity,” Goertzel continues. “The impact of such a system may greatly exceed what we’ve seen from significant LLMs and lead the global economy into a new era of beneficial decentralized AGI and&nbsp;ASI.”</p><p>“This alliance is a fantastic step forward for those who are left out of the technologies produced by big tech, which mainly targets the affluent. Billions of people on our planet do not currently have access to advanced AI technologies and tools. The Superintelligence Alliance is here to tear down barriers towards a decentralized, democratic, and ethical AI future, reducing inequalities and making the world a better place for us, for our children and grandchildren and generations to come. Decentralised governance gives everyone a voice and a say in the ethics and oversight of the most powerful tools ever invented.”</p><p>About SingularityNET</p><p>SingularityNET was founded by Dr. Ben Goertzel with the mission of creating a decentralized, democratic, inclusive and beneficial Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). According to Dr. Goertzel, AGI should be independent of any central entity, open to anyone and not restricted to the narrow goals of a single corporation or even a single country. The SNET team includes seasoned engineers, scientists, researchers, entrepreneurs, and marketers. The core platform and AI teams are further complemented by specialized teams devoted to application areas such as finance, robotics, biomedical AI, media, arts and entertainment.</p><p>For additional information on SNET, visit: <a href="https://singularitynet.io/">https://singularitynet.io/</a></p><p>About Fetch.ai</p><p>Fetch.ai, a Cambridge-based AI company, is redefining the possibilities of an intelligent and connected world through its AI agent-based technology.

<p></p> 
<p>Many strictly regulated industries such as banking and finance rely heavily on identity and access management solutions to secure their systems and infrastructure. Unfortunately, as demonstrated by the Okta breach last year, these organizations are attractive targets for hackers due to the nature and quantity of the information they handle. While hackers use sophisticated ransomware once access is gained, they obtain that access through surprisingly low-tech means: for example, by calling the companies’ help desks and, using a simple voice phishing (vishing) tactic to induce IT employees to disable two-factor authentication.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Phishing awareness and resistance play a big role in protecting customer and corporate data, but organizations need a secure solution to safeguard their systems against phishing and credential theft, mitigating these attacks before they can occur. Many companies already manage physical access with ID badges, but integrating digital access control into these badges can offer one comprehensive solution that provides:</p> 
  
  Photo ID for visual verification  
  Access badge for door readers&nbsp;  
  Access token for passwordless digital authentication  
  
 The Value of Security Convergence — Combining Physical Security with Digital Security  
<p>Historically, physical security and digital security have been managed separately, working in parallel. Due to increasingly complex security threats, however, organizations require a more comprehensive approach to securing both physical and digital assets to reduce the risk of breaches.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Following the 2023 breach, Okta recommended customers take several steps to better defend themselves against potential attacks by adding:</p> 
  
  Multi-factor authentication (MFA) to secure administrator access  
  “Admin session binding,” requiring administrators to reauthenticate in certain instances  
  “Admin session timeout” defaulted to a 12-hour session duration and 15 minutes of idle time  
  
<p>These settings provide organizations with a more secure layer of roadblocks that limit how much hackers can do once they gain access to any systems. These settings require more frequent re-authentication by users, but a converged credential with FIDO2 authentication makes this a simple and more convenient process.</p> 
<p>The converged approach to identity management not only enables organizations to take a more holistic approach to threat management and have a more prepared security posture for preventing, mitigating, and responding to threats, but it provides users with a more convenient, passwordless solution for authentication.</p> 
 Example of a Converged Credential:  
<p></p> 
 Features of a Strong and Effective Converged Credential  
<p>Organizations in regulated industries need an identity solution that both complies with regulations and safeguards their operations against phishing and fraud. A converged credential streamlines security at both the physical and digital level, and includes the following features to eliminate the threat of phishing attacks:</p> 
  
  Secure, Phishing-Resistant Multi-Factor Authentication. Requiring more than two authentication factors increases security. Such factors may include something the user has (the card), something the user knows (a PIN), and something the user is (biometric data, like fingerprints) to provide a higher level of confidence in the authenticity of the user’s identity. This means it does not use a password, OTP or other shared secret as a factor.  
  Alignment with Current Security Trends. Using a converged credential that aligns with modern security trends and standards – including FIDO2, Mifare®, and DesFIRE® – enables organizations to be confident that they comply with security regulations.  
  Passwordless Experience. Replacing passwords with local authentication methods enhances the user experience while reducing vulnerabilities associated with password breaches.  
  
 Conclusion  
<p>While phishing is a relatively simple tactic, it has the potential to expose organizations to more complex and costly cyberattacks that could result in significant financial consequences, reputational harm, and customer dissatisfaction.</p> 
<p>By implementing a phishing-resistant solution, such as the converged physical and digital access credential solution offered by <a href="https://www.hypr.com/integrations/idemia">HYPR and IDEMIA</a>, organizations can be more confident in their ability to safeguard their operational and customer data from cyberattacks.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/banking/2024/consumers-look-at-security-first-costs-second-when-opening-a-bank-account/">PYMNYS study</a>, over 25% of consumers said safety (of money and personal information) is the most influential factor when opening a primary bank account. Previously, higher security was at odds with creating a member experience, but there is a new approach.</p>



<p>You can create a better member experience AND increase security simultaneously with <a href="http://chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://go.sudoplatform.com/rs/971-PEA-288/images/KYC%20eBook%202b.pdf?version=0">reusable credentials</a>&nbsp;.</p>



<p>What are reusable credentials? Using cutting-edge verification technology, your members only verify themselves once during onboarding. After that, they will have credentials that work across all interactions with your credit union. The credentials cut down wait times, eliminate repetitive verification hassles, and create a seamless member experience at every touch point.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why this matters: This revolutionary approach has the potential to reshape the member journey by creating seamless interactions, increasing efficiency, and providing unparalleled member satisfaction. In addition to these benefits, this method also significantly minimizes fraudulent activities within your identity verification process.</p>



<p>How reusable credentials create a better member experience:</p>







 
 Streamlined Interactions: Reusable credentials eliminate the need for repetitive identity verification, ensuring a smooth and efficient member journey. 
 







 
 Reduced Wait Times: Members no longer need to endure long queues or waiting periods, as the verification process now takes seconds. 
 







 
 Smooth Branch Visits: With credentials persisting across interactions, in-person visits to the branch are quicker and more personalized, enhancing the overall experience. 
 







 
 Effortless Call Center Interactions: Members experience faster and more efficient interactions with call centers, as there is no need for extensive identity verification. 
 







 
 Stress-Free Teller Transactions: Teller interactions become stress-free as the burden of repetitive verification is lifted, allowing staff to focus on delivering a superior member experience. 
 







 
 Enhanced Security: While providing convenience, reusable credentials maintain the highest level of security. With unbreakable encryption, reusable credentials are tamper-proof and make fraud almost impossible. 
 







 
 Consistent Experience: Whether online or through mobile apps, members enjoy a consistent, secure, and frictionless digital experience, fostering trust and loyalty.

 Dive Deeper 



 How do Reusable Credentials Work? 



<p>Reusable credentials are a shift in the way identity is managed. It is moving away from centralized systems controlled by organizations to a model where individuals have greater control over their own identity information.</p>



<p>In the end, members can show their encrypted and unique credentials on their phones as irrefutable proof of who they are without disclosing information that can be used maliciously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The process looks like this:</p>







 
 Initial verification: Once a member is verified using robust authentication methods, the system creates a reusable credential that can be used across various services and applications. 
 







 
 Decentralized identity: Decentralized identity (DI) technology powers reusable credentials. This technology (that utilizes encryption and other cutting-edge tech) ensures that the data is secure, tamper-proof, and resistant to single points of failure.&nbsp; 
 







 
 Secure communication: The DI system provides irrefutable and secure communication across all channels, with built-in, ultra-secure identity validation. 
 







 
 User control&nbsp;: Individuals own and control their identity information. Unlike traditional systems where large organizations store and manage user data, DI empowers individuals to own and manage their digital identities. Protecting both individuals and organizations. 
 



<p>🎧 <a href="https://privacyfiles.com/?p=447">Listen to the Privacy Files podcast episode where Dr. Paul Ashley explains Decentralized Identity to get the whole picture</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 How Reusable Credentials Make a Better Member Experience for Credit Unions 



<p>Transforming Branch Dynamics for a Better Member Experience</p>



<p>The traditional branch experience often involves members waiting in queues for identity verification, leading to frustration and dissatisfaction. Not to mention that traditional identity verification methods (IDs, security questions, etc.) can be maliciously reproduced.</p>



<p>Reusable credentials significantly reduce branch wait times. Members breeze through the verification process, allowing them to focus on their financial needs rather than waiting in line. This streamlined experience enhances efficiency and leaves a lasting positive impression on members, contributing to their overall satisfaction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consistent Seamless Interactions for a Better Member Experience</p>



<p>Reusable credentials create a credit union experience where every member interaction is smooth regardless of the channel. Whether a member interacts in-branch, over the phone, or through digital channels, the authentication experience remains seamless. Repetitive security questions and cumbersome verification processes that differ in every channel are replaced with a unified, efficient system, fostering a sense of trust and reliability.</p>



<p>Remember, in the <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/banking/2024/consumers-look-at-security-first-costs-second-when-opening-a-bank-account/">PYMNYS study</a>, over 25% of consumers said that safety (of money and personal information) is the most influential factor when opening a primary bank account. You can give members next-level security with reusable credentials.</p>



<p>Liberating Tellers for Member-Focused Excellence</p>



<p>Tellers are the face of the credit union, influencing member perceptions and experiences. However, the burden of identity verification often diverts their attention from delivering personalized service to preventing fraud.</p>



<p>“Tellers are the first line of defense. It’s our job to protect your account. But we aren’t perfect. Just like any sort of defense, we make mistakes or miss things. We are human and are subject to human error.” – A teller explaining <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromYourBank/comments/ag2aiv/bank_tellers_of_reddit_what_security_do_you_guys/">their experience on the job.</a></p>



<p>Reusable credentials liberate tellers from the time-consuming and stressful verification process, enabling them to concentrate on building meaningful connections with members. This shift in focus enhances the overall member experience, making each interaction more personalized, efficient, and satisfying.</p>

<p>Certificate lifespan is getting shorter</p>
<p>Over the years the cybersecurity industry has undergone notable transformations requiring organizations to implement new best-practice standards, often at a short notice.</p>
<p>In 2020, Apple unilaterally opted for shorter TLS certificate durations, reducing them from three years to 398 days, thereby increasing the burden on certificate management. Subsequently, Apple introduced shorter lifespans for S/MIME certificates at the start of 2022. In the past year, both code signing and S/MIME users faced additional alterations, while <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/04/googles-90-day-proposal-for-tls-certificates/">Google proposed transitioning to 90-day certificates</a>, a subject we have explored in our <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/17380/608200?utm_source=brighttalk-portal&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=player-page-feed&amp;utm_content=summit-page">latest webinar</a>. Anticipating further changes, particularly with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the looming risk of post-quantum (PQ) computing, organizations must enhance their agility.</p>
<p>Today, TLS/SSL certificates are typically valid for about a year, according to the Certification Authority Browser (CA/B) Forum requirements. This yearly renewal cycle is convenient for organizations to manage and schedule. However, transitioning to shorter-lived certificates, like the proposed 90-day validity period, will require more frequent renewal efforts. With 90-day validity, organizations will need to renew certificates four times every 12 months within that timeframe. In practice, due to the need for buffer time, certificates may need to be renewed every 60 days. Ultimately, this change could lead to replacing certificates more than six times every 12 months, depending on the renewal window chosen.</p>
<p>Enterprises will be required to handle both the management of digital certificates within their systems and the reverification of their domains every 90 days. According to Google’s <a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/moving-forward-together/">Moving Forward, Together</a> initiative “more timely domain validation will better protect domain owners while also reducing the potential for a CA to mistakenly rely on stale, outdated, or otherwise invalid information resulting in certificate mis-issuance and potential abuse.”</p>
<p>Shorter certificate lifecycles will drive automation</p>
<p>Shorter-lived certificates offer numerous advantages, with automation being the foremost benefit. Google and other root programs advocate for automation to streamline certificate lifecycle management. Additionally, shorter certificate validity aligns with the upcoming adoption of post-quantum cryptography (PQC). PQC algorithms lack a proven track record as they are still relatively new. Consequently, there’s a necessity to potentially switch algorithms more frequently, with an unpredictable timeframe, including the vulnerability window of existing algorithms to quantum computer attacks. Automation plays a crucial role in supporting this increased renewal frequency.</p>
<p>Industry calls for automation to reduce security risks</p>
<p>While the 90-day proposal from Google has not officially been discussed in the CA/Browser Forum, both certification authorities and certificate consumers agree that automation is a necessity for a smooth transition to certificates with a shorter validity period. We can see a similar recommendation in <a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/publication/1800-16/">NIST Special Publication 1800-16</a>:</p>
<p>“Automation should be used wherever possible for the enrollment, installation, monitoring, and replacement of certificates, or justification should be provided for continuing to use manual methods that may cause operational security risks.”</p>
<p>Challenges of a 90-day certificate validity period for organizations</p>
<p>The need for TLS certificate workflows to be done multiple times a year means an increased workload for certificate operations, server owners, infrastructure, and webmaster teams. The inability to renew the domain verification and replace certificates at a rapid pace may increase the risk of outages. Additionally, the automated solutions do not guarantee a one-size-fits-all approach, as each context and organization has unique requirements and constraints.</p>
<p>Next steps</p>
<p>We strongly recommend that you consider your next steps and plan your strategy with these key points in mind:</p>
 
 Spend the time to prepare for a 90-day or shorter maximum certificate lifetime future so that you can seamlessly handle the change 
 Start thinking about your security model(s) and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/post-quantum-cryptography">post-quantum</a> readiness 
 Consider how you pay for your certificates and evaluate how <a href="https://go.entrust.com/SSL-Flex2">subscriptions</a> can provide more deterministic costs 
 Invest in robust <a href="https://www.entrust.com/products/digital-certificates/tls-ssl/entrust-certificate-services">certificate management</a> capabilities 
 Focus on standards-based APIs and integrations 
 Plan a path to support 100% automation, even if it means applying a hybrid approach for different parts of your organization

 IDnow explores the UK’s attitudes toward fraud prevention technology and the steps they’re taking to protect themselves. 



 



<p>Our recently released UK Fraud Awareness Report revealed worrying behavioral trends, such as a third of the public sharing ID documents via unencrypted channels and almost half of respondents not knowing what deepfakes were.</p>



<p>For an overview of the UK’s education gap when it comes to fraud, read our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/attitudes-awareness-uk-fraud/">blog, ‘What does the UK really know about fraud?’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the second of a three-part series, we explore the nation’s attitudes toward fraud-prevention technology and the steps Brits are willing to take to protect themselves.</p>



 Fight fraud with biometrics. 



<p>Biometric identification, such as automated facial recognition, is an optimal way of identifying business partners and customers, achieving security goals and complying with regulatory requirements. Our survey discovered that almost two-thirds of Brits (63%) were already using biometric technology, like fingerprint scans or FaceID, to access their online bank accounts, or approve bank transfers, with another 10% planning on using it in the future.</p>



<p>Less than a quarter of the population (24%) do not use biometric technology and do not plan on using it in the future.</p>

 Customer journeys: Start as you mean to go on. 



<p>The odd adage ‘start as you mean to go on’ rings true in every walk of life, especially in business, and especially at the beginning of a customer journey. Onboarding, the point at which the identity of the user is established and verified, is one of the most vulnerable stages for fraud. This is why service providers, especially banks or insurance companies, often establish more secure, but lengthier onboarding processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While speedy, seamless customer journeys are incredibly important, especially in the digital world, 75%&nbsp;of the UK population said they would be willing to go through lengthier online onboarding processes for accounts connected to larger sums or investments, if it made it safer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the UK, over <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">£3 billion is lost to fraud every single year</a>. According to our survey, while over half of Brits (54%) would move banks, if they were to become a victim of banking fraud, almost a quarter (24%) would remain loyal and stay with their bank, while another 21% were unsure what they would do in the event of banking fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lovro Persen, Director Document Management &amp; Fraud at IDnow said that this should act as a wake-up call for traditional banks and fintechs that want to protect their customers, and in turn their business. ““Between deepfake videos and spoof texts that pretend to be from banks, it’s becoming harder for consumers to know what’s genuine and what is fraud. Meanwhile, huge amounts of data are stored online, making everyone ever-more vulnerable to data breaches.”</p>



<blockquote><p>While technology can be a curse when it comes to tackling fraud, it also has the potential to be a solution to the problem.</p>Lovro Persen, Director Document Management &amp; Fraud at IDnow.</blockquote>



 Preferred identity verification methods. 



<p>The digital identity verification market has never been healthier. Most industries are either required by regulation to implement identity verification checks or have chosen to do to optimize processes or fight fraud. Such checks are required for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">account opening in Banking</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">compliance checks in Crypto</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">age verification in Mobility</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">streamlined check-in processes in Travel</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">financial risk checks in Gambling,</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/telecommunication/">contract signing in Telecommunication</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indeed, there were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/identity-first-future-trends-2024/">61 billion digital identity verification check</a>s conducted in 2023, a number that is predicted to grow by 16% to 71 billion by the end of 2024. In a world of just 8 billion people, these numbers are simply staggering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Identity verification requires users to provide and have information associated with their identity verified. This may be a physical identity document, such as a driver’s license, passport, or a nationally issued identity document. Identity verification services can range from automated, expert-led to in-person. Each method fulfils different security, regulatory and convenience requirements. &nbsp;</p>



<p>There are numerous different methods of identity verification.</p>



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">Automated identity verification</a> provides seamless 24/7 online experiences, enabling businesses to grow and scale with confidence, without compromising on security or data privacy. We offer extensive data checks from diverse and trusted sources, including official databases and credible records to confirm the existence of a legitimate identity in an intuitive and frictionless way. We also can validate more than 3,000 identity documents from 195 countries and growing. Our automated identity verification solutions leverage the latest in facial recognition and liveness technologies for seamless biometric verification, utilizing liveness, selfies and video to confirm the existence of an identity and that the person is physically present during the verification process.<br>  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/expert-led-verification/">Expert-led video verification</a> ensures optimal KYC customization while maintaining a balance between security and accessibility. Our face-to-face video verification with expert assistance allows businesses to compare photo taken during account creation process with photo from identity document. And, with liveness detection, you can add an additional layer of assurance to detect and protect against a variety of presentation attacks. Our specially-trained experts ask specific questions to identify social engineering. Expert-led identity verification can also help organizations improve inclusivity, accessibility, safety and convenience. Protect your most vulnerable customers and ensure they don’t miss out on the services they deserve.<br>  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/in-person-verification/">In-person identity verification</a> enables your customers to have their identities verified at a public location, such as a gas station, near them. It also allows businesses to perform Point of Sale (POS) identification processes on-site. In-person verification ensures compliance with the German Money Laundering Act (GwG) and the Telecommunications Act (TKG) and a premium high-touch experience that doesn’t compromise on the speed and convenience of a digital solution.  



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC) processes</a> are an integral part of identity verification and are crucial for businesses to protect their customers – and themselves – from fraudsters. KYC can ensure the power of identity is put back in the hands of the people it belongs to and the businesses they are trying to interact with.</p>



 



    



 



<p>According to the UK’s Fraud Awareness Report, the most popular method of identity verification in the UK is a combination of data checks and document / facial recognition. Although not particularly commonplace in the UK, 9% of Brits said they would trust a human agent conducting a live video verification call. In Germany, this is considered the most secure and accurate method of identity check, as the fraud expert&nbsp;can pick up emotional signs of distress or suspicious behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, around a fifth (19%) of respondents do not know what method to trust the most, which reveals a deeper lack of understanding of the different verification methods, their benefits and their drawbacks. This is something that should be addressed as part of ongoing fraud education efforts.</p>

<p>Ever since <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/05/19/a-short-history-of-chatgpt-how-we-got-to-where-we-are-today/?sh=66fdb2ca674f">ChatGPT</a> debuted in November 2022, the hype and hysteria surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) has continued to accelerate. Indeed, rarely can you read an article or watch a news clip without AI being inserted into the conversation. With AI-enabled <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/the-law-is-not-keeping-up-with-ai-deepfake-fraud-and-it-will-only-get-worse">deepfakes</a>, AI-displaced workers, alleged AI theft of intellectual property, and AI-fueled cyberattacks, the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/as-gen-ai-advances-regulators-and-risk-functions-rush-to-keep-pace">raging debate</a> is not only if and how to regulate AI, but also when and by whom.</p>
 Global Legislative Developments and Directives 
<p>Early calls for AI governance and industry self-regulation seem to be giving way to more rigid and enforceable legislative efforts. Afterall, world leaders are loath to repeat the unregulated social media experiment of the past 20 years that led to such unforeseen consequences as the rampant dissemination of misinformation and disinformation, fueling political and social upheaval.</p>
<p>To wit, the European Union is on the verge of passing the first comprehensive piece of legislation with the <a href="https://hbr.org/2024/02/the-eus-ai-act-and-how-companies-can-achieve-compliance">AI Act</a>, which promises to set the global benchmark for AI, much like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) did for data privacy protection. The AI Act provides prescriptive risk-based rules as to when AI can and cannot be employed, with severe penalties for non-compliers that include up to 7 percent of an enterprise’s global annual revenue.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the White House issued the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/">Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence Executive Order</a> this past fall, which is more expansive than the EU AI Act, contemplating everything from consumer fraud to weapons of mass destruction. The order demands more transparency from AI companies on how their models work and provides labeling standards for AI-generated content. However, an executive order is not a legislative act and the U.S. has already started down a decentralized path with individual states proposing their own legislation, including California’s <a href="https://statescoop.com/california-bill-would-form-new-ai-regulation-division/">Safe and Secure Innovation for Frontier Artificial Intelligence Systems Act</a>, which aims to protect consumer privacy and promote ethical standards in the use of AI. Among provisions for transparency, accountability, and public engagement the <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/privacy-and-data-security/californias-draft-ai-privacy-rules-show-ambitious-approach">draft rules</a> would require companies to conduct regular assessments of their AI systems to ensure compliance.</p>
 Perspectives and Considerations on AI Regulation 
<p>Proponents of AI legislation cite the protection of health, safety, fundamental human rights, democracy, rule of law, and the environment as paramount. However, others are concerned that legislation will hobble their domestic industry, ceding profits and AI supremacy to others, especially bad actors. On this note, the UK has taken a decidedly contrarian position with a <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/artificial-intelligence/2024/united-kingdom-government-takes-pro-innovation-ai-approach-contrast-europe?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Main%20NL%2002/28&amp;utm_term=Main%20Newsletter">pro-innovation AI approach</a> that provides a policy of non-binding principles. Still others feel that <a href="https://medium.com/60-leaders/to-regulate-or-not-how-should-governments-react-to-the-ai-revolution-c254d176304f#:~:text=%2D%20AI%20is%20a%20powerful%20technology,reducing%20the%20risk%20of%20abuse">AI does not warrant new or different regulation than traditional software</a>, stating that the only difference between the two is the ratio of data-driven to rule-driven outcomes, which does make AI behavior less transparent but not less deterministic.</p>
<p>Then there is the conversation around AI ethics and empathy, or rather the lack thereof. Those favoring a more laissez-faire approach to AI regulation assert that regulating empathy and ethics is not really an AI problem per se but embedded in the historical data on which the <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3697649/what-are-large-language-models-and-how-are-they-used-in-generative-ai.html">large language models</a> (LLMs) are trained. And this will take time to resolve with or without AI, and with or without regulation.</p>
<p>It seems regulators are damned if they do and damned if they don’t. No one wants to be the hapless bureaucrat that inadvertently enabled Skynet in the Terminator movie series, or the overeager regulator that quashed domestic innovation on the eve of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, ceding AI global leadership and economic prosperity for generations to come.</p>
<p>The path forward will be a balancing act, but the guiding star should be one in which AI is beneficial to all of humanity, regardless of country, status, or any other factor. A popular framework in this regard is that of Harmless, Honest, and Helpful AI. Initially proposed by the team at <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/training-a-helpful-and-harmless-assistant-with-reinforcement-learning-from-human-feedback">Anthropic</a>, this approach focuses on reinforcement learning from human feedback and supervised fine-tuning to align a model that roots out inaccuracy, bias, and toxicity. This more curated approach can also help ensure that the AI is more secure as it can avoid eliciting a harmful and untrue output, and flag vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Discover the simplicity and security of magic link authentication in this article. We dive into how magic links work, providing a hassle-free and secure alternative to traditional passwords. By exploring its benefits, challenges, and comparison to other authentication methods, this post will equip you with valuable insights into this innovative authentication approach. Learn how magic links could revolutionize your online login experiences and enhance account security.</p>
 How does a magic link work? 
<p>Magic link authentication is a secure and user-friendly method of authenticating users during the login process. It sends a unique, time-sensitive URL to the user’s registered email address as a part of the authentication process.<br>
Instead of entering a password, users authenticate themselves by clicking on the received link. Once the magic link is clicked, the system validates the link, and if it’s correct and the private key hasn’t expired, the user gains access to the account.<br>
Magic links offer a passwordless approach to authentication, making it a compelling option in user verification methods and password breaches. It streamlines the password manager user experience, eliminating the need for password creation, memorization, and input. Moreover, a one-time password only helps reduce the risks associated with password-based attacks, such as brute force or password spraying attacks.</p>
 
The User Experience of Magic Links 
<p>From a user’s perspective, magic link authentication offers simplicity and ease. The user begins the verification procedures by providing their email address during the login process. Subsequently, a unique magic link URL is sent to the user who opens their email, which the user must click to complete the authentication process.<br>
This approach eradicates common pain points associated with passwords, such as the need to remember multiple passwords or frustration with password recovery processes. However, it requires users to access their email accounts. It ensures that their email account is secure, as the user’s email address becomes a single point of failure in this authentication model.</p>
 
Pros and Cons of Using Magic Links 
<p>Magic link authentication comes with many advantages, primarily focused on improving security and user experience. It mitigates risks associated with traditional passwords, such as the vulnerability to brute-force attacks. Moreover, it simplifies the user experience of passwordless authentication, reducing password fatigue and the inconvenience of password recovery processes.<br>
However, there are downsides to consider. The reliance on email as the user’s device and primary authentication method makes the user’s email provider or account a lucrative target for attackers. If an attacker gains access to a user’s email account, they can access any account that uses magic link authentication. Additionally, since emails can be intercepted or delayed, there’s a potential risk of identity fraud if the magic link falls into the wrong user friction hands or is not received by the user promptly.</p>
 
Technical Implementation of Magic Link Authentication 
 The Back-End Mechanism 
<p>The account creation and validation of magic links predominantly occur at the system’s back end. A unique token is generated when users open or request a magic link. This secret link token is usually bound to the user’s session and has a limited validity period to ensure security.<br>
The back-end system manages these tokens carefully, ensuring they are stored securely, usually in a hashed form, to prevent misuse in case of a data breach. Moreover, the tokens are matched and validated against the user’s user session and information when the magic link is accessed, ensuring the magic link endpoint hasn’t been tampered with or used beyond its expiration time.</p>
 
Front-End Handling and User Interaction 
<p>The user interacts with the system on their mobile device on the front end by requesting a magic link, usually by entering their email address login credentials. It’s essential to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience, guiding users through the process with clear instructions and feedback.<br>
The front end communicates with the back end to request the generation of the magic link and delivers it to the user’s inbox in just a few lines, typically via email. Additionally sign in screen and, it manages the redirection process once a user clicks on the magic link, ensuring that users are directed to the correct location and appropriate actions are taken based on the validity of the magic link.</p>
 
Security Considerations 
<p>Ensuring the security of magic links is paramount. The magic links work and should be generated using secure, random tokens that are hard to guess or predict. HTTPS should be the secure method used to transmit magic links to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.<br>
Furthermore, magic links should be time-bound, meaning they expire after a certain period or once used, preventing reuse or exploitation if intercepted after the validity period. Also, monitoring and alert mechanisms should be in place to detect and respond to suspicious activities, such as multiple failed attempts to access sensitive data breaches a magic link.</p>
 
Comparing Magic Link Authentication with Other Authentication Methods 
 
Magic Link vs. Traditional Username and Password 
<p>Magic link authentication simplifies the user login process, removing the need for password memorization and input. Unlike traditional username and password-based authentication methods, magic links offer enhanced security by mitigating common password-related attacks like brute-force or dictionary attacks. The absence of a password minimizes the risks associated with password reuse or weak passwords.<br>
However, traditional username and password methods have wide acceptance and familiarity among users and across platforms. While magic links streamline the authentication process for email providers, they also introduce a reliance on email provider access and security. In comparison, despite their vulnerabilities, passwords do not necessarily require users to gain access to another person’s identity or platform (email) as part of the authentication process.</p>
 
Magic Link and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) 
<p>Magic links can coexist and integrate with two-factor authentication (2FA) methods to authenticate access and bolster the mobile device’s security. While magic links replace the password, they can be used alongside a second, multi-factor authentication part, like a one-time passcode (OTP) or a biometric verification. This combination of authentication factors enhances the authentication process by requiring two separate verification steps, making unauthorized access more challenging.<br>
In contrast, using passwordless authentication with magic links alone simplifies the user experience but does not offer the same security assurance combined with a second authentication factor. Utilizing 2FA with magic links ensures a more robust security posture, providing additional protection beyond passwordless authentication.</p>
 
Magic Link vs. Biometric Authentication 
<p>Comparing magic links with biometric and authentication solutions highlights user experience and security level distinctions. Biometric personal identification methods, such as fingerprint or facial recognition, offer a seamless user experience, often requiring only a single action from the user. They also provide a higher level of security, as biometric data is unique to each individual.<br>
Magic links, while simplifying the authentication process, rely on the user’s email account security and the sent link’s integrity. The necessity to access an email to verify customers retrieved the magic link can be considered an added step in the sign in process when compared to the direct nature of biometric authentication. However, magic links do not require specialized hardware or sensors, making them more universally applicable and accessible.</p>
 
Future Prospects and Challenges of Magic Link Authentication 
 
Upcoming Trends in Magic Link Authentication 
<p>As technology evolves, magic link authentication is poised to benefit from emerging trends and innovations. Enhancements in email security and encryption technologies can make magic links work and link sharing and links more secure and resilient against attacks. Integrating the magic link emails and links with other authentication methods, like biometrics or hardware tokens, can also result in more secure and user-friendly authentication mechanisms.<br>
Furthermore, as organizations continue embracing user-centric designs with a strong security strategy, magic links offer a pathway to more straightforward and intuitive authentication experiences. This user-centric focus and technological advancements can drive the broader adoption of magic links in various sectors and applications.</p>
 Security issues with magic links 
<p>Despite its benefits, the magic link email as a secure authentication method faces criticisms and challenges that hinder its widespread adoption. The dependency on email as a single point of authentication raises security concerns, as unauthorized email access can lead to potential vulnerabilities. Moreover, users without consistent email access or facing email delivery speed and deliverability issues might find magic links less convenient.<br>
Another challenge lies in user education and awareness. Users must be informed about authentication protocols, the secure management of magic links and the associated security risks to utilize this authentication method effectively and safely.</p>
 Expanding Adoption Across Industries 
<p>The versatility of magic link authentication facilitates its applicability across various industries. The finance, healthcare, financial institutions, and e-commerce sectors can leverage the magic link flow and links to enhance user experience and security. However, each industry must consider its unique requirements and challenges, such as regulatory compliance and user demographics.<br>
While magic link authentication presents a promising alternative to traditional authentication methods, its adoption requires a thoughtful strategy that aligns with industry-specific needs, user behaviors, and emerging technological trends. Such a nuanced approach can ensure the successful and secure implementation of passwordless magic link links in diverse sectors.</p>

			 Hong Kong’s Competitive Leap: Fueling Tokenization Growth Across Asia 
<p>This month, we attended the Digital Assets Week Hong Kong conference and were struck by the rapidly growing ecosystem surrounding tokenization in the region. The gathering of regulator SFC and major institutions at the event sent a strong message:&nbsp;Hong Kong is positioning itself as a frontrunner jurisdiction for the tokenization of securities.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Hong Kong has witnessed the emergence of numerous live tokenized securities projects alongside the CBDC pilot program (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/news-and-media/press-releases/2023/02/20230216-3/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">HKSAR Government tokenized a green bond</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theasset.com/article/50768/hgi-launches-first-tokenized-fund-in-hong-kong?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">HGI tokenized a fund</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ubs.com/global/en/media/display-page-ndp/en-20240207-tokenized-warrant.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">UBS tokenized warrant</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3254551/hong-kong-launches-worlds-first-wholesale-cbdc-pilot-city-positions-itself-cutting-edge-blockchain?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">wholesale CBDC pilot</a>, …). The regulator provides clear guidelines, nurturing tangible use cases.&nbsp;This fosters regional competition for leadership in tokenization, driving the industry and the region forward.</p>
<p>Specifically, on 2 November 2023, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) announced two circulars related to tokenized financial instruments: “<a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/circular/doc?refNo=23EC52&amp;utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">Circular on intermediaries engaging in tokenized securities-related activities</a>” and “<a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/circular/doc?refNo=23EC53&amp;utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_xTXV0IF3iky4tWzu_yFdv-rUaTmO6tVEwN8nr9eLj4LcuI_j6fiUP59z0Vi0xsnSwGMZb">Circular on tokenization of SFC-authorized investment products</a>”.</p>
<p>The guideline is straightforward:&nbsp;same securities, same rules, but with digital controls.&nbsp;There are four points we want to highlight:</p>
 
 Open for retail investors:&nbsp;Evolved from March 2019 “Statement on Security Token Offerings” where security token offerings are restricted only to professional investors (PIs), the new circulars permit primary dealings of tokenized SFC-authorized investment products by retail investors. These offers have to be authorized under Part IV of the SFO or have complied with the prospectus regime and not fall under any other applicable exemption under the Public Offering Regimes. Otherwise, the offers can only be offered to PIs. 
 Same business, same risks, same rules:&nbsp;The new circulars define that tokenized securities are fundamentally traditional securities with a tokenization wrapper, the existing legal and regulatory requirements governing the traditional securities markets continue to apply to tokenized securities. 
 Blockchain agnostic: SFC recognized all types of blockchain networks, including private-permissioned, public-permissioned, and public-permissionless. However, issuers have to address risks by implementing adequate controls regardless of the blockchains they use. 
 New risks management: Issuers have to address risks related to ownership (e.g., how it is transferred and recorded) and technology (e.g., forking, network outages, and cybersecurity). Elizabeth Wong from SFC emphasized in a panel during the DAW conference that issuers have to demonstrate to the regulators they have controls over their tokenized securities (e.g., recover tokens). 
 
<p>Here is an illustrative example of tokenized funds by SFC:</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>The risks highlighted in the circulars can be addressed with open-source ERC-3643, the validated and audited permissioned token standard:</p>
 
 Enforce compliance&nbsp;to ensure adherence to existing laws, and only eligible investors can interact with tokens, regardless of blockchain type. 
 Track ownership through identity-based on-chain registries to maintain the integrity of ownership records. 
 Take full control&nbsp;over their tokenized security to freeze or recover tokens as needed. 
 Enable multichain capability&nbsp;to address forking and network outage issues. 
 Upgradable implementation of smart contracts&nbsp;to ensure flexibility to address any vulnerability of the smart contract or updates of regulation. 
 
<p>Moreover,&nbsp;the circular mandates due diligence for tokenization technology, highlighting the importance of partnering with established players. With over 6 years of proven experience and enterprise-grade certifications like SOC2, Tokeny is well-equipped to support the Hong Kong market.&nbsp;The regulatory framework is in place, the technology is primed, and the market is set for rapid evolution!</p>

<p>This is the transcript to my <a href="https://youtu.be/m8umHdZBbHM">YouTube explainer video</a> on the browser changes underway to replace the functionality of third-party cookies when it comes to authentication services. Likes and subscriptions are always welcome.</p>



<p>There are several web features out there that support critical, basic security features like logging in and logging out. Those same features enable tracking individuals as they surf the web. Unfortunately, fixing this is not as simple as turning those features off for trackers. From a purely technical perspective, whether these features are used for authentication-related purposes or tracking, they are indistinguishable from the web browser’s perspective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, of all the features described in a <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/03/16/understanding-browser-tracking-logins-the-invisible-trail/">previous post</a> that serve legitimate and clandestine purposes, third-party cookies are one of the more tractable problems to resolve. So, let’s look at where the work is happening, one of the new mechanisms being developed, and what the changes will look like.</p>



 The Role of the W3C in Browser Changes 



<p>The <a href="https://w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) is where most of the work happens between browser vendors and various other stakeholder groups to standardize functionality on the web. This global community effectively shapes the web, ensuring it’s secure, efficient, and open for everyone. Their work is crucial for the standards we rely on daily.</p>



<p>Diving into the details of how the W3C works is beyond the scope of this video, but feel free to reach out if you’d like to learn more!&nbsp;</p>



 Federated Credential Manager (FedCM) 



<p>Now, onto <a href="https://fedidcg.github.io/FedCM/">FedCM</a>. Developed by Google and incubated within the W3C, this API represents a significant shift in managing privacy and online authentication. As I mentioned earlier, a browser’s biggest challenge is distinguishing between acceptable use and hidden tracking. The purpose of the FedCM API is to help the browser determine whether a transaction is happening with the individual’s knowledge and consent. Let’s delve into how it works and why it matters.</p>



<p>Rather than acting like one of those annoying cookie banners, FedCM is designed to be called when an individual clicks on the login or sign-in button on a website. Before the website (the relying party, or RP) and the site responsible for authentication (the identity provider, or IdP) share any information, FedCM exists to mediate the transaction and make sure the individual is aware and ok with what’s happening.</p>



<p>Again, though, it’s not that easy. The FedCM developers must find a way to support some conflicting goals. For example:</p>



 
 Of course, the IdP needs to know what RP is asking for an authentication request! Our IdPs don’t talk to just anyone! 



 Of course, the IdP shouldn’t know anything about the RP! The IdP might track the sites the user visits! 
 



<p>Both statements reflect use cases that are 100% valid. There’s a reason this problem hasn’t been solved yet.</p>



 Other Initiatives 



<p>&nbsp;FedCM is just the tip of the iceberg. Google, Apple, Mozilla, and others are all innovating under the W3C’s umbrella, working together towards a more private web. These initiatives are reshaping our online experience. Some of their work focuses on enabling ethically targeted advertising (that’s happening in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/patcg/">Private Advertising Technology Community Group</a>. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/privacycg/">Privacy Community Group</a>, on the other hand, has more than a few efforts in incubation, including one that’s focused on link decoration, known there as navigation-based tracking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each browser vendor also has their own internal projects that influence (and are influenced by) what’s happening in the W3C. Google’s <a href="https://privacysandbox.com/">Privacy Sandbox</a> is the most public of these efforts and describes various tools they’re trying to build a more privacy-preserving web experience.</p>



 Google’s Cookie Countdown 



<p>Coming back to third-party cookies, a major milestone is approaching. In Q1 2024, Google begins turning off third-party cookies for <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/privacy-sandbox-tracking-protection/">1% of Chrome users</a>. This test run is critical for their long-term privacy strategy. They are years behind Apple, a company that turned off <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/features/">third-party cookies in 2017</a> for Safari users. <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/firefox-rolls-out-total-cookie-protection-by-default-to-all-users-worldwide/">Firefox</a> turned off third-party cookies by default in April 2023. Any changes Google makes, though, impact far more people. The Chrome browser has, by far and away, the largest market share of desktop browsers. They are also part of a much larger company, Alphabet, which still has several products that require third-party cookies to be available.&nbsp;</p>



 Real-world Impacts and Preparations&nbsp; 



<p>This shift on Google’s part to turn off third-party cookies by default for just a tiny fraction of their users might seem minor, but its implications are vast. Organizations must prepare for potential challenges and educate their people on these evolving technologies. Support desks already know to check to see a browser’s settings, but not everyone can or will call support. Companies should start turning third-party cookies off by default now to develop their plans, including testing out FedCM, to adapt to the changes.</p>



 Proactive Organizational Strategies 



<p>It’s time for businesses that aren’t browser vendors to be proactive in helping the web develop. Develop strategies, train your teams, and help define the solutions.&nbsp; It’s not just about reacting; it’s about being prepared for a new era of the web. I’ve had this conversation with individuals representing dozens of organizations in the last three years, and the biggest challenge is the executives who are entirely focused on their bottom line. And I get that. These executives want to know what to do and when to do it. Until they have answers to those questions, they are not inclined to assign resources to help other organizations figure out solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if these organizations want to make sure the web works the way they need it to, they need to invest in that bit of speculation. They need to assign people to test the proposed APIs and offer constructive feedback on how the code might be changed to suit their use cases.</p>



 Viewer Engagement and Further Learning&nbsp; 



<p>Eager to learn more about upcoming browser changes or get involved? There are links in the show notes to where the work is happening and how you can find out more. Your participation can influence the future of web privacy.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>We’ve covered a lot today, from the W3C’s vital role to the specifics of FedCM and beyond. Remember, these changes are shaping a safer, more private web for us all. Stay curious, stay informed.

  IT-Fachleute stehen vor der Herausforderung, komplexe Rollenstrukturen und Berechtigungskonzepte effizient zu verwalten. Die Vielzahl von Einzelrechten und Rollenobjekten erschwert nicht nur die Erstellung, sondern auch die kontinuierliche Anpassung an sich wandelnde Anforderungen im Identitäts- und Zugriffsmanagement (IAM). Zudem müssen Compliance-Anforderungen erfüllt und Änderungen nachvollziehbar dokumentiert werden. Mithilfe moderner Technologien wie zentralisierte Plattformen, Visual Analytics und Workflow-Engines, können die Herausforderungen des Rollenmanagements und der Berechtigungskonzeptverwaltung effektiv angegangen werden.

 As the 2024 Olympic Games approach, the city of Paris is preparing to welcome an unprecedented influx of visitors. Mobility operators must be ready to respond to a substantial number of new customers in a very short span of time. 



<p>Over the past decade, urban <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility</a> has experienced major alterations, driven by rapid technological change. While getting around has never been easier, experiences vary from one operator to another. The advent of mobile-first is leading mobility service providers to focus their mobility journey around mobile-usage, in favor of a resolutely simplified experience.</p>



<p>In a world where mobility is at the heart of our lives, the organization of large-scale events raises major challenges in terms of accessibility and security. From July 26 to August 11, 2024, France will host the Summer Olympic Games, and is preparing for an unprecedented influx of visitors. These foreign visitors, accustomed to other modes of mobility and transport, will have to familiarize themselves in a short span of time with sometimes unfamiliar travel and booking experiences. Paris is equipped with many different means of transport, combining micromobility, public transport, service providers, transport rental companies and car-sharing. For mobility operators, the question arises as to their ability to accommodate a substantial number of new customers in a very short amount of time.</p>



 Let the games begin: challenges facing mobility operators. 



<p>Transport and urban mobility operators face a number of challenges: rapid user authentication, age and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/driver-license-verification/">driver’s license verification</a>, and the collection of documentation and user information. To address these issues, identity verification service providers are positioning themselves as key players in meeting these needs, while ensuring a fluid and secure user experience.</p>



<p>In the context of a major event such as the Olympic Games, all mobility operators will be faced with many more demands during this period. Numerous people will be moving from various key points in a limited span of time. It therefore seems essential to simplify access to means of transport requiring a stronger means of identification, without compromising transaction security.</p>



 A seamless user journey, reflecting a smooth transport experience. 



<p>For mobility players, offering instant access to their services is crucial. When service users are confronted with a complex and unclear <a href="https://www.idnow.io/customers-experience/">onboarding process</a>, their frustration increases, as does the abandonment rate. A fast, accessible onboarding process, whatever the channel, becomes a major competitive advantage.</p>



<p>Operators are therefore seeking to offer their users a seamless experience, notably through a simplified, instantaneous and entirely mobile onboarding process. This means being able to quickly verify users’ age, the validity of their driver’s license or, in the case of some car rental companies, proof of address. One of the main challenges is therefore to minimize the time needed for these checks, while maintaining a high level of security.</p>



<p>At major events, such as the Paris Olympics in 2024, where mobility services will be particularly in demand, the ability to handle a high volume of requests becomes even more critical. Automated identity verification solutions can play a key role in this context. Not only do they considerably speed up the onboarding process by eliminating the need for manual account validation, they also ensure that the user meets the necessary conditions (age, valid license) to access the service.</p>



<p>In the case of rental contracts, the use of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/digital-signatures/">electronic signatures</a> to finalize transactions, and the automatic capture and extraction of information from identity documents, further accelerate the subscription process, without compromising the security of the transaction. Finally, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idcheck-io/identity-verification-service/">video biometrics</a> enhances the security of mobility operators by ensuring that the person creating the account is who they claim to be, thus reducing the risk of identity fraud.</p>



<p>For mobility operators, these tools are not only a means of improving the user experience, but also represent an opportunity to set themselves apart from the competition. In a context like that of the Olympic Games, it will also be important to respond efficiently to peaks in demand, while guaranteeing continuity and quality of service.</p>



 Mobility as a Service: the future of urban mobility? 



<p>For providers of transport services requiring advanced identity verification, such as car rental or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/francois-hoehlinger-the-future-of-micromobility/">micromobility services</a>, the implementation of appropriate solutions is crucial to effectively meet the influx of requests. Without automated systems, these operators risk being forced to invest in additional human resources, a costly and less efficient solution in the face of highly variable demand.</p>



<p>The solution could lie in the adoption of a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-as-service-digital-identity-partnership/">Mobility as a Service (MaaS)</a> service, offering a single account to access all a city’s transport and mobility facilities. Berlin’s <a href="https://www.jelbi.de/en/home/">JELBI </a>sets the standard. By downloading this application, users fill in their information just once and can then access all the mobility services available in the city. This centralized approach considerably simplifies the user experience, reducing the complexity of accessing the various transport services. France, meanwhile, has yet to find its own MaaS operating model.</p>



<p>At a time when mobility is reinventing itself, security and ease of access to services are becoming major issues. As mobility is constantly on the move, it’s vital to understand the issues involved in order to anticipate tomorrow’s needs. The Paris Olympics will be an opportunity to test operators’ ability to manage the diversity of means of transport, to absorb the influx of visitors and also to test the means of identity verification available.</p>



<p>In this context, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">automated identity verification</a> is an indispensable solution, eliminating several points of friction for mobility operators. The aim is to enable users to access desired services quicker and to make their experience as seamless as possible. Operators, for their part, can look forward to being able to process flows faster by automating time-consuming and complex processes.</p>

It describes the “why” of a DCV bound on Volume DF rewards, what OCEAN rewards it led to, and how those numbers improved under Predictoor DF. It describes the bug and the fix, and how the Volume DF rewards changed due to the fix. It describes the issue of violating community expectations somewhat. Finally, it describes the fix: 5x Predictoor Boost, which restores Volume DF Rewards to ≈37,500&nbsp;OCEAN.</p> DF Budgets <p>Overall DF budget. We are in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-main-2-is-here-3d46506a141e">Data Farming Main 2 phase</a>, as Mar 14, 2024. From DF Main 1 to DF Main 2, the overall DF budget increased 2x.</p><p>Now, weekly rewards budget is 300,000 OCEAN (plus ROSE for Predictoor DF).</p><p>DF Budgets per Stream. DF is divided into streams. The “Passive DF” stream rewards people for locking OCEAN. The “Active DF” stream rewards doing more work to add value to ecosystem; it has two sub-streams “Volume DF” and “Predictoor DF”.</p><p>Here is reward allocation &amp; some detail per each stream, as of DF Main&nbsp;2.</p>  <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/passive-df">Passive DF</a>. 150K OCEAN / week. Lock OCEAN for <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">veOCEAN</a>. The longer you lock for, the more veOCEAN (details below). Rewards are pro-rata to veOCEAN holdings.  Active DF. 150K OCEAN / week. It has these substreams:<br>i. <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/volume-df">Volume DF</a>: 112.5K OCEAN / week. Allocate veOCEAN towards data assets with high DCV, to earn more. Rewards are a function of DCV and veOCEAN stake.<br>ii. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf">Predictoor DF</a>: 37.5K OCEAN / week + 20K ROSE / week. Predict future price movement, continuously (as a predictoor).  <p>For further details on each stream, please consult the <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p> About Volume&nbsp;DF <p>Volume DF is a substream of Ocean Data Farming. In it, users allocate veOCEAN towards data assets with high DCV, to earn more. Rewards are a function of DCV and veOCEAN&nbsp;stake.</p><p>Volume DF is not Active DF per se; it’s a subset of Active DF. Volume DF is not DF: there are several streams / substreams and it is one of them. Each stream is meaningful on its&nbsp;own.</p> The Wash-Consume Problem, and&nbsp;Fix <p>Early versions of Volume DF encountered a problem: <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-reward-function-tuned-d74b5134b5d1">wash consume</a>. Let’s explain. Volume DF rewards on DCV. People found a way to game this: publish data assets, then buy &amp; consume those assets themselves. A circular loop that drove up DCV. Volumes ballooned to&nbsp;$Ms.</p><p>This was not real volume, of course. And it is wasteful to reward OCEAN for this behavior. The aim is to reward OCEAN for things that truly drive value ot the ecosystem.</p><p>Here’s how we fixed wash consume: we ensured that rewards paid never exceed $ from fees. This works because fees themselves do not go into the pockets of the wash-consumers. Therefore anyone wash-consuming would lose $. (In Ocean, fees are baseline 0.1%; and baseline 20.1% for Predictoor feeds.)</p><p>The specific implementation is:</p><blockquote>Volume DF rewards for asset and each veOCEAN holder, are bound by: asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) * DCV_multiplier.</blockquote><p>The value DCV_multiplier is 20.1% for Predictoor feeds, and 0.1% otherwise. Call this the “DCV bounds” on the Volume DF&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This also means that some of the OCEAN budgeted for Volume DF for a given week may not get deployed as rewards for that week. Any OCEAN not rewarded goes back into the DF pot for future DF&nbsp;rounds.</p> How much OCEAN is rewarded to Volume&nbsp;DF? <p>Before Predictoor was rolled out, DCV in Ocean was very small. And DCV_multiplier was 0.1%. So the DCV bounds (small DCV) * (small DCV_multiplier) = negligible number. Therefore OCEAN rewarded for Volume DF was negligible.</p><p>Then Predictoor &amp; Predictoor DF was rolled out, which caused both larger DCV and larger DCV_multiplier of&nbsp;20.1%.</p><p>Decent DCV. Predictoor came with Predictoor DF, where 37,500 OCEAN is spent as sales to buy Predictoor feeds. This is a “baseline” that incentivizes people to run Predictoor bots. In practice, it’s working extremely well, driving high activity and stake-to-predict volume. Predictoor feeds are the only meaningful contributor to DCV. So, DCV is basically the Predictoor DF rewards of 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>Decent DCV_multiplier. Where other feeds had 0.1%, Predictoor feeds&nbsp;20.1%.</p><p>Let’s combine those: DCV bounds (decent DCV) * (decent DCV_multiplier) = decent-ish number. So, OCEAN rewarded for Volume DF comes out decent-ish.</p><p>Let’s do exact numbers. We apply the formula above: 37,500 OCEAN volume, times DCV_multiplier=20.1% gives a bound of ≈7,500 OCEAN total. Therefore ≈7,500 OCEAN is practically available to Volume&nbsp;DFers.</p><p>The implementation described above was the intended behavior.</p> Discovery: a bug in DCV-bounds code <p>Thanks to decent DCV and decent DCV_multiplier in Predictoor DF, the Volume DF payout was supposed to be ≈7,500 OCEAN /&nbsp;week.</p><p>However the payout ended up between ≈20,000-25,000 OCEAN /&nbsp;week.</p><p>That is, 2.67x-3.33x more OCEAN was being paid out for Volume DF, compared to the intended design of Volume DF. (Remember, this is only a bounds based on DCV of 37,500 OCEAN/week. If DCV was high enough, the full budget of Volume DF would be paid out: 112,500 OCEAN/week.)</p><p>Something was up in Volume DF payout calculations. We dug deeper. As of Fri Mar 15, 2024, we discovered the specific bug in those calculations.</p><p>The bug had applied data consume volume (DCV) bounds too loosely, which over-rewarded each individual account during&nbsp;payout.</p><p>Recall that the DCV bound for each asset and each veOCEAN holder: asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) * DCV_multiplier. Where “% stake in asset” is the amount of veOCEAN that a user has allocated, compared to the all veOCEAN allocated, for a given&nbsp;asset.</p><p>The bound was supposed to be on a per-asset, per-staker level.</p><p>But, the DCV bound code was written was only on a per-asset level. That was the bug. It missed the per-staker part. That is, “% stake in asset” was&nbsp;missing.</p><p>It meant that a user could create 10 separate accounts with 1/10 of her veOCEAN in each account, and get 10x more rewards compared to a single account. Yes, a Sybil attack. Anyone exploiting this flaw would be rewarded unfairly&nbsp;highly.</p><p>(To be clear: it wasn’t a security issue per se; there were no funds at risk. But it enabled people to game the system and get unfair rewards&nbsp;.)</p> Fixing the bug in DCV-bounds code <p>The core fix was to apply the DCV bound on a per-asset per-staker level. That is, to add the “% stake in asset”&nbsp;term.</p><p>We fixed the bug within hours of finding it. The first payout on the fixed code was for DF81, on Thu Mar 21. The <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/df81-completes-and-df82-launches-6ccd09db2ac9">DF81–82 blog post</a> provides further information: in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/df81-completes-and-df82-launches-6ccd09db2ac9#a4c1">Section 5</a> (highly detailed); and with a complementary explainer in its <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/df81-completes-and-df82-launches-6ccd09db2ac9#2693">Appendix</a>.</p><p>The OCEAN budgeted for Volume DF never reduced. However, the amount paid out was reduced, because that payout is bounded by DCV, and DCV hasn’t been high enough to ignore this&nbsp;limit.</p> Bug Fix’s Effect on Volume DF&nbsp;Rewards <p>As expected, accounts doing Volume DF got reduced rewards in DF81&nbsp;payouts.</p><p>Smaller stakers (those with a small % stake on an asset) had larger APY drops than larger stakers. This is because the same DCV bound was (wrongly) only at the per-asset level. Each account saw the same bound. After the bug fix, the APYs should be identical.</p><p>Let us illustrate.</p>  If an asset has just one staker, where % stake = 100%, their Volume DF payout for that asset doesn’t change at all, because the new term “% stake in asset” = 1.0. So introducing it doesn’t change the&nbsp;numbers.  If a larger staker had 50% stake in an asset, their payout would be multiplied by 50%, ie a 1/0.5 = 2x reduction for the asset. Reduced APY for Volume DF&nbsp;follows.  If a smaller staker had 10% stake in an asset, their payout would be multiplied by 10%, ie a 1/0.1 = 10x reduction for the asset. Reduced APY for Volume DF&nbsp;follows.  <p>The above APY discussion is all for Volume DF. The APYs on Passive DF are independent; they’re at ≈20% these days. Passive DF APYs were not affected by this fix, since the fix is for Volume DF. Please don’t confuse Passive DF and Volume&nbsp;DF.</p> Bug fixed, but a second issue&nbsp;emerged <p>Like any professional software development team: we identified a bug; we fixed it asap; we deployed it; we communicated the&nbsp;changes.</p><p>However this caused a problem: people had locked OCEAN for years on the basis of seeing historical APYs in Passive DF and Volume DF. A long-term commitment which we appreciate.</p><blockquote>Those expectations got violated somewhat, due to the reduced rewards for Volume&nbsp;DF.</blockquote><p>Many were upset. We get&nbsp;it.</p><p>At the heart of the problem: Volume DF with the bug was ≈20,000–25,000 OCEAN / week. After the bug fix, payout was ≈7,500 OCEAN / week (ie payout of DF81). That is, a 2.67x-3.33x reduction. There were corresponding reductions in Volume DF APYs; those vary per-user as described above.</p> Towards addressing the second&nbsp;issue <p>How can we fix the problem of: expectations got violated somewhat, due to the reduced rewards for Volume&nbsp;DF?</p><p>To make a specific goal: can we get Volume DF rewards back to at least ≈20,000–25,000 OCEAN /&nbsp;week?</p><p>We have constraints:</p>  It doesn’t make sense to “undo” the bug fix, because then we’d still have the bug, with the issues it&nbsp;entails!  We want to ensure that DF code implementation reflects the intent of its designers (us).  As always, the design of DF and its sub-streams needs to remain flexible enough to keep evolving. All so that OCEAN rewards deployed most effectively drive traction in Ocean, and especially data consume volume&nbsp;(DCV).  Related to the last point, some alpha: we do have other Data Farming sub-streams in the works! Those need breathing space. And, Predictoor is growing so the Predictoor DF weekly budget may increase&nbsp;too.   Introducing 5x Predictoor Boost <p>We are proud to announce the 5x Predictoor Boost program. It is a solution to the problem&nbsp;above.</p><p>Recall:</p><blockquote>Volume DF rewards for asset and each veOCEAN holder, are bound by: asset’s DCV * (% stake in asset) * DCV_multiplier.</blockquote><p>Before, Predictoor feeds had DCV_multiplier = 20.1%. 5x Predictoor Boost gives a 5x to this multiplier.</p><p>With 5x Predictoor boost, Predictoor feeds get DCV_multiplier =&nbsp;100.5%.</p><p>Let’s do exact numbers. We haveDCV of 37,500 OCEAN from (due to Predictoor DF), times DCV_multiplier=100.5% gives a bound of 37,687.5 OCEAN total (≈37,500 OCEAN). Therefore 37,687.5 OCEAN is practically available to Volume&nbsp;DFers.</p><p>(And as DCV rises, up to the whole Volume DF budget of 112,500 OCEAN becomes available to Volume&nbsp;DFers.)</p><p>The 5x boost only applies to the first 37.5K rewards given out on Volume DF. After that, the usual dcv_multiplier=20.1% applies. This helps to ensure breathing space for new DF substreams or increased Predictoor DF&nbsp;budget.</p> Implementation of 5x Predictoor Boost <p>What happens&nbsp;today:</p>  Retroactively apply this new formula to DF81 payout (which was yesterday — Thu Mar 21, 2024). In practice, we have airdropped each account another 4x Volume DF rewards compared to what it got yesterday. <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x785ecb5dc208de89f4bab854e3b519223d7178b4446404ded3f022df9bb6194e">Here’s the&nbsp;tx.</a>  <p>What happens in before next DF&nbsp;payout:</p>  Update the DF payout code to apply the 5x Predictoor boost, for future weeks. (Applicable to first 37.5K&nbsp;rewards)  Update documentation, etc as&nbsp;needed.   Conclusion <p>Due to a bug fix, the Volume DF OCEAN payouts shrunk. Previously, under the bug, payouts were about 20,000–25,000 OCEAN. DF81 payout (Mar 21, 2024) was the first time the bug fix was applied. The Volume DF payout for DF81 was 7,500 OCEAN. That is, a 2.67x-3.33x reduction. (APYs for Passive DF and Predictoor DF were not affected.)</p><p>While this was a legitimate bug fix, the drop in reward caused community expectations to be violated somewhat.</p><p>Many were upset. We get&nbsp;it.</p><p>To address this issue, we are proud to announce the 5x Predictoor Boost program.

  <p>In a <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/how-tenant-restrictions-v2-can-be-used-to-prevent-data/ba-p/3915339">previous blog</a> in the Data Exfiltration series, we discussed different types of tenant restrictions policy. In this blog, we’ll discuss migrating from tenant restrictions v1 to authentication plane tenant restrictions v2. In future blogs, we’ll discuss migrating to Universal tenant restrictions v2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restrictions are a vital tool to help prevent data exfiltration from unauthorized access to external Microsoft Entra ID tenants and consumer Microsoft accounts. Tenant restrictions v1 lets you create an allow list of tenant IDs and Microsoft sign-in endpoints to ensure that users access external tenants that your organization authorizes. While tenant restrictions v1 served well for many years, tenant restrictions v2 offers more granularity and easier policy management with no additional licensing requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restrictions v2 has several benefits over tenant restrictions v1. For example, admins can:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  Update the policy from the Microsoft Entra portal rather than from each network proxy. There’s no need to update the header.&nbsp; 
  Increase the size limitations of your maximum proxy header length. There’s no limit to the number of partners you can add with tenant restrictions v2.&nbsp; 
  Selectively indicate which user groups access which apps in external tenants rather than allowing entire tenants for all identities.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog post, I’ll explain the differences between how the two tenant restriction types work independently from, and in tandem with, cross-tenant access settings (outbound) to highlight the benefits of upgrading to tenant restrictions v2.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Getting started with tenant restrictions&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restrictions require routing all user authentication traffic through a proxy. Typically, the proxy is the on-premises network egress, but it can also be a cloud-based proxy. The proxy injects a header indicating that an allow list of destinations is enforced on the traffic, regardless of the originating device or network location. In tenant restrictions v1, the destination allow list is in the header. In tenant restrictions v2, the header has a tenant ID and policy ID. Traffic arrives at Microsoft Entra ID, which reads the header and enforces the policy. If the traffic destination isn’t in the allow list, the user receives an error message.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Example of a user getting blocked by tenant restrictions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How tenant restrictions v1 works&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two types of identities: internal and external. Your organization creates and manages internal identities with your identity provider (IdP) but doesn’t manage external identities such as personal accounts or those created by an external organization. Tenant restrictions v1 applies to both account types.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the following diagrams, two types of identities (green is internal and black is external) are on the corporate network or connected with a virtual private network (VPN). Both identity types go through the corporate network egress proxy when attempting to access Microsoft 365 services. Typically, both receive the same header injection of allowed destinations. This enforcement has some limitations. If you maintain the allow list in the network proxies, administrators update the header at each proxy when you add or remove a tenant. It’s also important to note that the headers have size limitations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Tenant restrictions v1 applies to external tenant destinations equally with no user or app granularity</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can improve tenant restrictions v1 by adding cross-tenant access settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tenant restrictions v1 with outbound cross-tenant access settings&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Microsoft Entra ID, you can configure the cross-tenant access settings feature to control outbound access on a per-user, per-group, and per-application basis. This policy applies to your internal identities, regardless of device or network location.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the following diagram, the users go through the egress proxy. Cross-tenant access settings and tenant restrictions are applied. However, the tenant restrictions v1 allow list is the only policy that applies to external identities. This option improves internal user management, but the architecture has limitations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both tenant restriction v1 and cross-tenant access settings are evaluated, and the most restrictive policy is applied. However, cross-tenant access settings only apply to internal identities. If you allow access to an external tenant for your users, even with group or application restrictions, you enable all external identities to access any resource in those tenants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Cross-tenant access settings adds user and app granularity for internal identities</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tenant restriction v2 with cross-tenant access settings&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restriction v2 works in tandem with cross-tenant access settings. Tenant restriction v2 is a cloud-based policy that applies to external identities. Internal users’ access is controlled by cross-tenant access settings. This separation allows per-user and per-application granularity for internal and external identity scenarios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the following example, the organization puts group and application restrictions on their internal identities. However, they can block other external identities from accessing external tenants unless they create exceptions. In this case, an exception is made for Bob from Tenant C. He is allowed access to only Microsoft Exchange so he can check email while on the corporate network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Tenant restrictions v2 adds granular user and app awareness to external identities</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The previous diagram demonstrates the flexibility that tenant restrictions v2 offers. Because tenant restrictions v1 and v2 have the same licensing requirements, the one-time migration involves recreating policies and updating the header injection at your network proxies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further enhance tenant restrictions, learn about <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/how-to-universal-tenant-restrictions">Universal tenant restrictions</a>. This feature adds data layer protection and prevents token infiltration that can bypass your corporate network proxy’s tenant restrictions header injection. The feature injects the headers and has a low latency connection to Microsoft 365 resources without needing to hairpin traffic through your corpnet proxies.&nbsp;</p>

 Creating Value with Identifiers  Why identifiers are essential to secure cross border trade, and how we have applied best practices and design principles <p>Transmute enables global trade digitization. Essential to this mission is facilitating an optimal digital identifier strategy for our customers, in which our Verifiable Data Platform plays an important part. In this white paper we discuss some points of inspiration and the design choices and principles we have made to bring efficient, safe, intuitive — and beautiful — identifiers to the supply chain&nbsp;sector.</p> Inspiration <p>In designing our identifiers, we have looked to major internet players for inspiration: HBO, LinkedIn and&nbsp;GS1.</p> HBO <p>HBO is a great source of inspiration, consistently following identifier design practices. For example, here is the URL for accessing the movie Dune:<br>https://play.hbomax.com/player/urn:hbo:feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ</p><p>This URL consists&nbsp;of:</p>  Scheme (https), indicating that there is a resource resolvable over secure&nbsp;HTTP  Host (play.hbomax.com) with HBO’s domain&nbsp;name  Path of HBO’s video player (player), available to authenticated HBO&nbsp;users  Sub-path with a unique identifier of the movie Dune (urn:hbo:feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ)  <p>We will dissect the structure of the identifier in a moment, but first it’s important to note the same identifier of Dune is used elsewhere to resolve different resources. For example:<br>https://www.hbomax.com/dk/da/a/param-feature/urn:hbo:feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ</p><p>Which links to a publicly available “movie poster” page, in this case on a Danish microsite as per the&nbsp;path.</p><p>Looking closer at Dune’s identifier, urn:hbo:feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ, this is a URN consisting of:</p>  Scheme (urn)&nbsp;, indicating a unique but not necessarily resolvable identifier  Namespace, NID (hbo)&nbsp;, which arguably should be registered with IANA, <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces/urn-namespaces.xhtml">but&nbsp;isn’t</a>  Namespace-specific string, NSS (feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ), which notably consists of a categorization of what is identified (feature:) as well as a unique&nbsp;string   LinkedIn <p>LinkedIn follow a very similar pattern as HBO for linked in posts:<br>https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7062908400073887744</p><p>Again, the URL is comprised of:</p>  Scheme (https),  Host (www.linkedin.com)  Path (feed/update)  Sub-path with a URN identifier (urn:li:activity:7062908400073887744)  <p>And again, the identifier is a URN constructed as:</p>  Scheme (urn),  NID (unregistered) (li),  NSS (activity:7062908400073887744), consisting of a categorization of what is identified (activity:) and a unique&nbsp;string.  <p>LinkedIn also allows for natural identifiers for identifying people (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nis-jespersen/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/nis-jespersen/</a>) and companies (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/transmute-industries">https://www.linkedin.com/company/transmute-industries</a>). There are two interesting points to note&nbsp;here:</p>  The use of natural keys (nis-jespersen and transmute-industries). When this is possible, humanly recognizable keys derived from the business domain is a strong&nbsp;feature.  A more questionable part of this design is that LinkedIn is not sticking with URN identifiers. A better and more consistent design could have been for example: https://www.linkedin.com/company/urn:li:company:transmute-industries   GS1 <p>GS1 governs identifiers for elements used in trade such as product types (GTIN), organizations (GLN) and transport identifiers (SSCC). These can be extended, for example a GTIN with a lot number traditionally looks like this: (01)09520123456788(10)ABC123 where (01) and (10) are codes for GTIN and lot respectively, followed by their values, in combination forming a unique compound key for the&nbsp;lot.</p><p>GS1’s <a href="https://ref.gs1.org/standards/digital-link/uri-syntax/">Digital Link standard</a> defines how the GS1 identifier must be represented as URIs. The Digital Link of the above example could be <a href="https://id.gs1.org/01/09520123456788/10/ABC123">https://id.gs1.org/01/09520123456788/10/ABC123</a> (this is the so-called canonical form). Importantly, it could also be <a href="https://brand.example.com/01/09520123456788/10/ABC123">https://brand.example.com/01/09520123456788/10/ABC123</a>, allowing the brand owner to host resolvable information about the&nbsp;product.</p><p>Per the spec, identifying properties are on the path, whereas non-identifying properties are placed in query parameters. Weight, for example, is non-identifying, so the Digital Link for (01)09520123456788(3103)000195 where (01) codifies the GTIN followed by its value, and (3103) codifies Net Weight and 000195 is 195 grams, can be <a href="https://brand.example.com/01/09520123456788?3103=000195">https://brand.example.com/01/09520123456788?3103=000195</a>.</p><p>Peculiarly, GS1 has not opted to leverage the registered <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5134.html">“epc” URN namespace</a> in the Digital Link standard. The above GTIN could be represented like this:<br>https://brand.example.com/urn:epc:id:gtin:0952012.3456788.</p><p>Granted, the QR code for this would be bigger; an important argument. Apart from that this seems like a missed opportunity to spread a best practice identifier pattern broadly into GS1’s established user&nbsp;base.</p><p>In conclusion of this little tour of inspiration, we’ve found that HBO and LinkedIn have taken practically identical approaches to identifying and localizing their platform resources. GS1 seems to have been on a similar path before changing direction for Digital Link. Next, we will look into some of the drivers which have led HBO and LinkedIn to the same best practice&nbsp;design.</p> Design Principles <p>In this section we will focus on properties which make a good identifier. We will also consider some properties which make them bad, if not dangerous.</p><p>Why does HBO bother adding urn:hbo:feature: and not just a “naked” identifier such as <br>https://play.hbomax.com/player/GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ</p><p>And, similarly, why do we consider this to be well formed:<br>https://platform.transmute.industries/presentations/urn:transmute:presentation:bdb8a296-ed17-41a6-b5e6-46n157747bee</p><p>But not this:<br>https://platform.transmute.industries/presentations/bdb8a296-ed17-41a6-b5e6-46n157747bee</p> Unique Resource Identifier <p>First of all, bdb8a296-ed17–41a6-b5e6–46n157747bee is not a URI, whereas urn:transmute:presentation:bdb8a296-ed17–41a6-b5e6–46n157747bee is.</p><p>There is a caveat, formally the URN namespace should be registered with IANA such that they can guarantee uniqueness. Our stance is that our use of the unregistered namespace (transmute) is sufficiently unique; a stance which we share with the likes of HBO and LinkedIn.</p> Usability <p>During development and integration, engineers often juggle identifiers from various platforms at once. Hints about which platform and type of resource the identifier is associated with makes it much easier to work with. As you glance over a table of identifiers, being able to pick out the one you are looking for is a time saver. Platforms often prefix identifiers with such context, in our case for example transmute:presentation intuitively and clearly point towards the origin and type of resource.</p><p>A developer should also intuitively trust that an identifier is unique. While UUIDs are a little long, they are recognizable and a developer instinctively comprehends the identifier’s uniqueness.</p><p>Finally, these aspects should come naturally. In working with identifiers, the good experience is the one you don’t experience.</p> Casing Convention <p>The natural keys employed by LinkedIn were kebab-cased (nis-jespersen). This is preferred because most operating systems and <a href="http://searchengineland.com/google-bing-handle-underscores-dashes-differently-89672">search engines</a> treat dash-separation as separate words. In contrast, both camelCasing and snake_casing are generally considered one big word. Kebab-casing is also considered <a href="https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/41595/what-is-the-casing-convention-for-url-routes">more readable</a> than the alternatives.</p> Location Decoupling <p>The decoupling of the resource and its location(s) allow us for example to get Verifiable Credential data with<br><a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/credentials/urn:transmute:credential:9ni5070c-102f-46cf-9e40-82de4874fdb6">https://platform.transmute.industries/credentials/urn:transmute:credential:9ni5070c-102f-46cf-9e40-82de4874fdb6</a></p><p>And verify it with<br>https://platform.transmute.industries/credentials/urn:transmute:credential:9ni5070c-102f-46cf-9e40-82de4874fdb6/verify</p><p>This is similar to how urn:hbo:feature:GYUjdLgBiJp5otAEAAAAJ was used to retrieve both the Dune trailer microsite and the full movie&nbsp;player.</p> Security <p>Without this decoupling, there is just one identifying URL, for example:<br><a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/presentations/bdb8a296-ed17-41a6-b5e6-46n157747bee">https://platform.transmute.industries/presentations/bdb8a296-ed17-41a6-b5e6-46n157747bee</a> <br>which means the entire identifier string is now a WHATWG URL, not an IETF URI, in turn allowing for UNICODE encoded internationalized domain&nbsp;names.</p><p>It is Transmute’s position that UNICODE is great for display strings, but dangerous for identifier strings. We wholeheartedly support the ability to capture people’s name in their local representation. Indeed, the author’s full name includes an “ø”. But we are saddened by the careless adoption of UNICODE in international domain names, which has unnecessarily exposed an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDN_homograph_attack">internationalized domain name homoglyph attack</a> surface. For example an ASCII o is very difficult to tell apart from a cyrillic о (not the same character!), allowing for microsoft.com and mіcrоsoft.com (not the same domain!) to&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200102175251/http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~gabr/papers/homograph_full.pdf">coexist</a>.</p><p>We do not fancy ourselves that we can fix the internet. But we vigilantly seek to minimize exposures anytime we have the chance; in this case by adopting ASCII-based URN identifiers where we have the&nbsp;chance.</p> Key Origins <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_key">natural key</a> is derived from business or application data which are unique in their nature and are typically intuitively understood by humans. By contrast, a synthetic or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrogate_key">surrogate key</a> is technically generated solely for the purpose of uniqueness, without direct linkage to the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>We saw how LinkedIn in some cases uses the person or organization name as natural keys. This is possible for finite resources which carry such natural identifiers. In such cases it is preferable to adopt human recognizable and intuitive keys. Where possible we have similarly adopted natural keys where resources are finite and under Transmute’s control. Prevalently, though, v4 UUID synthetic keys are used, in particular for all customer controlled resources.</p> Transmute Identifier Design <p>This section attempts to formalize Transmute’s identifier design, pertaining to our Verifiable Data Platform&nbsp;(VDP).</p> Resource Identifiers <p>VDP resources are identified with&nbsp;URNs.</p><p>The general pattern for VDP URN identifiers are as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>urn:transmute:[resource-type]:[v4-uuid|natural-key]</p><p>Where:</p>  urn, the URN&nbsp;scheme,  transmute, the unregistered URN&nbsp;NID,  [resource-type]:, first part of the URN NSS, indicating the type of resource in singular&nbsp;form.  [v4-uuid|natural-key], second sub-delimited (unique) part of the URN NSS; a v4 UUID for user governed resources, kebab-cased natural key for Transmute governed resources.   API Resources <p>Resources are accessed on the VDP <a href="https://restfulapi.net/">REST</a> (REpresentational State Transfer) API following this general&nbsp;pattern:</p><p>https://platform.transmute.industries/[resource-type]/[resource-identifier]</p><p>Where:</p>  https, the HTTPS&nbsp;scheme,  platform.transmute.industries, the platform&nbsp;host  [resource-type], first part of the path, indicating the resource type in plural according to <a href="https://restfulapi.net/resource-naming/">REST naming best practices</a>.  [resource-identifier], identifying part of the path, URN as described above.   Versioning <p>Note that we are not including API versioning on the path. Of course, we may have to introduce breaking changes on the API at some point (it has not yet been necessary). When this day arrives, we will adopt a <a href="https://restfulapi.net/versioning/">header-carried</a> design for version management.</p> Combining REST and Well-Formed Identifiers <p>The combination of self-explaining URNs and collections style REST endpoint URLs entails a degree of redundancy, for example the inclusion of&nbsp;:credential and /credentials in the same&nbsp;request.</p><p>LinkedIn faces the same situation on their <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linkedin/dma/content/activities">LinkedIn REST API</a>, where for example “activity” is repeated on the path and in the identifier:</p> GET ‘https://api.linkedin.com/rest/dmaActivities?ids=List(urn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7074127827113058304)' <p>Like LinkedIn, Transmute finds this is an acceptable consequence considering the combined benefits gained from strong identifiers and&nbsp;REST.</p> Content Negotiation Three representations of the same Verifiable Credential resource, respectively: text/html, application/json, and application/pdf.<p>Following <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cooluris/">cooluri</a> best practices, different representations of the same resource are available, subject to content negotiation.

However, this identifier is entirely in our customer’s control, and can like any other property during issuance; or it could be issued on a different platform and only stored on VDP. Such untrusted user input is ill fitted as database primary keys, as we cannot guarantee uniqueness.</p><p>Moreover, the @id property is optional per the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/">VC Data Model</a> specification, which further underscores the point: a primary key cannot be optional.</p><p>Adopting the VC and VP’s @id as platform resource would have led to very unintuitive and intrusive platform behavior: rejecting storage requests, injecting identifiers into customers’ data objects, etc — clearly unacceptable from a business platform dealing with trade data. We believe this is a generic challenge faced by all but the most puristic Linked Data platforms, in which users expect, understand, and appreciate such behaviors and restrictions.</p><p>So, instead VDP maintains these classes in abstracted resources which wrap around the basic VC and VPs, separating the VC/VP itself from the platform’s representation of it. This has several benefits:</p>  There can be perfectly acceptable business reasons to have non-unique or anonymous nodes in a data graph, and this lets customers be in complete control of their verifiable data&nbsp;graph.  The wrapper can contain valuable metadata about the resource, for example the sender and receiver of a verifiable presentation.  The abstraction allows for storing multiple representations of the same credential, kept as different formats, controlled as media&nbsp;types.  Example of a presentation containing two credentials with colliding ids, urn:ex:x, stored comfortably in VDP within resources urn:transmute:credential:1 and urn:transmute:credential:2 (URNs simplified for clarity). Status List Credentials <p>Bitstring revocation credentials are an exception to this principle. Per <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-bitstring-status-list/">the spec</a>, revocation credentials must be resolvable, so their identifier (referenced by the revocable credential) must be a URL, not a URN. For&nbsp;example</p> ‘id’: ‘https://platform.transmute.industries/credentials/97abfc14-5n1s-45ff-bfde-de30eb772c20’ <p>As a consequence, revocation credentials are bound to VDP in that they cannot be moved neither to nor from other platforms. This is both acceptable and a logical consequence of the purpose they&nbsp;fulfill.</p> Execution Challenges <p>This section is based on interviewing our engineering team, reflecting upon the process of designing and implementing the above identifier design. The truth is developing this part of our platform has led to challenges and frustrations amongst the team. It is our hope that others can learn from our experience and plan for a smoother process towards implementing a great identifier design.</p> Leadership <p>Management has struggled to share the vision for Linked Data and combine it with pragmatic execution. Designing Linked Data relationships permeates the stack, and often got in the way of fast execution. When not communicated properly, there were tendencies towards disliking Linked Data before it was even properly understood.</p><p>This experience was mirrored in the engineering team as a sense of being too involved in the design process: “the vision gets muddy with too many people involved”.</p><p>Indeed, authoring this document is meant as an attempt to once and for all get team alignment on the company’s identifier strategy.</p> Value <p>Consistency in the API design has been a reoccurring challenge. When the vision and principles are not communicated well enough to the team, the normal self-correction mechanisms do not kick in, and so inconsistencies slip through. The deviations add up and become self-perpetuating, leading to bugs, miscommunication, and frustration.</p><p>When consistency is essential, it means the normal MVP feature approach fits poorly with identifiers. There is clearly an investment to be taken seriously. You should not do a half baked job of this; you are better off not starting at&nbsp;all.</p><p>The engineering team have had periods where this tweaking identifier semantics sugar has felt like “work, not value” which could be forever improved, but with diminishing impact.</p> Requirements <p>Something as fundamental as identifiers takes strong requirements up front. Sporadic bug tickets, for example that a collection should be plural, becomes a debate of the framework which it is held against, whether it is a bug at&nbsp;all.</p><p>In interviewing, one engineer requested a README document to avoid inconsistencies — essentially requesting this document. Once we had gone through it he immediately explained an API endpoint which he believed was inconsistent. The team self-correction worked! It is clear that a document like this one should have been produced much sooner in the&nbsp;process.</p> Commercialization <p>There is a duality in the team’s feelings about where we have gotten. We are proud of our identifiers! But we also recognize that they are long and may seem over-engineered and unapproachable, not least in our target supply chain sector market where it is common practice quoting for example “manufacturer numbers”. As much as we love the technical details, we realize they may be a hard selling&nbsp;point.</p><p>However, we insist that identifiers are essential to building systems with safety, privacy and value in focus, especially in today’s increasingly connected world. It has always been true that identifier collisions can be costly. The context and requirements for identifiers have changed dramatically since the analogue days. We take it upon ourselves to design for a safe and efficient future, even if — especially if — our customers do not fully appreciate everything which this&nbsp;takes.</p> Database Identifier Decoration <p>Rather than storing the full URNs at database level, we still only store the raw keys, adding the URN decoration around it. This means removal before it goes into the DB, and add it back on the outbound. There is a lot there you have to remember when making changes. And you have to think about future scenarios too, for example if Transmute got bought, that might affect the transmute namespace, and you would be adding more layers. As one engineer puts it “adding context adds complexity”.</p><p>Not storing the URNs is effectively a case of not making full use of our own investment. Partly due to history, partly due to the mid-process confusion described above. For example, there have been worries that the special code would have to deal with lower environments identifiers (subdomains used only internally), a result of conflating URLs with URNs. The database level is essentially the last, missing step of the process described in this section, and now that the principles are fully understood it will be a matter of time before we get&nbsp;there.</p> Conclusion <p>Transmute sells identifiers, and we aim to sell amazing products. So our identifiers need to be&nbsp;amazing.</p><p>We have studied examples of major internet players, HBO and LinkedIn, how they both construct URN identifiers, which are then used in URLs. We also studied the GS1 Digital Link, which has good reason to take a different approach, prioritizing backwards alignment.</p><p>We analyzed the drivers behind these design principles: URI benefits, separation of concerns, security, and key origins. Based on these, we were able to formalize VDP’s identification design.</p><p>Finally, we shared some honest reflections on the real-life transformation our team has been through. It is our hope that others who share our ambition will benefit from these learnings.</p><p>Consistency is an essential measure of quality. This document should make clear not just what quality identifiers look like, but also motivate&nbsp;why.</p><p>We encourage comments and discussion on this article, as well as signing up for free on <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries">https://platform.transmute.industries</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/creating-value-with-identifiers-ef9446b87835">Creating  Value with Identifiers</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 As the Brazilian igaming market prepares for lift off, we discuss regulatory surprises, the challenges of encouraging players to leave the black market, and the feasibility of Brazil becoming the largest gambling market in the world. 



 



<p>Although at first glance, there may not appear to be a huge amount in common between the Brazilian aviation industry and the Brazilian gambling industry, for lawyer Neil Montgomery, there are parallels that gambling operators would be well served to follow.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Late last year, the Brazilian online gambling industry took significant steps toward regulation, when Law No. 14,790/2023 was enacted further addressing fixed odds sports betting and igaming. While last month’s departure of <a href="https://www.telecomasia.net/news/other/mansurundefineds-resignation-could-impact-launch-of-bets-in-brazil/">government chief advisor, Jose Francisco Mansur</a>, is likely to result in considerable delays to the licensing process, it will not dampen the appetite for the official launch of a fully regulated gambling market in Brazil at federal level.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The excitement and anticipation for a regulated market at federal level (since some Brazilian states – like Paraná and Rio de Janeiro – have already made state licenses available) is borne largely from two things: the federal government realizing it is missing out on significant tax revenue, and Brazilian players being able to benefit from a safer and more secure player experience that only a regulated platform can offer. However, Neil does warn that unless gambling operators take the necessary steps to become ‘regulation-ready,’ including adherence to KYC, identity verification, and responsible gambling measure requirements, there is likely to be trouble ahead.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Consumer legislation is strict and strictly enforced in Brazil so foreign operators are going to have to confront the nightmare of doing business when it comes to consumer claims.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neil explains that Brazil is infamously ranked number one in the world in terms of airline passenger claims. The reason, he suggests, is that although Brazil complies with international conventions on the limitation of carrier liability, said conventions do not apply to so-called ‘moral damages,’ or the pain and suffering inflicted on the passenger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I believe a similar situation will repeat itself in the gaming industry because disgruntled consumers will now have a local door to knock on and use the Brazilian courts to obtain favourable awards. Brazilian courts will look at sports betting and igaming operators as wealthy companies and an expectation for companies to compensate damages cost to consumers.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this interview, Neil explains all about consumer legislation, tax, KYC, and why Brazilian gambling operators may have the upper hand on their stronger foreign counterparts.</p>



 Now that Brazilian regulations for sports betting and online casinos have passed, was there anything in the final draft that surprised you, positively or negatively? Is there anything you would like to see revised in future iterations? 



<p>Well, I think that in general terms, it was very positive. We had to wait until the very last minute in 2023 to see the law passed because there was a lot of discussion as to whether this was coming out this year or not. The federal government, of course, was focused on getting it passed since it has an objective of reaching zero tax deficit in 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any additional revenue is welcome and of course the sports, betting and gaming markets are seen as a very good source of additional revenues. For this revenue to be included in the 2024 budget, everything had to be passed in 2023. A positive surprise was the inclusion of igaming in the law because it was originally only supposed to govern fixed odd sports betting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under Brazilian law, we still need to wait and see what the Ministry of Finance will do with its many ordinances. There are 12 expected to be released, and we’ll see what the definition of igaming is. Another surprise was the fact that operators will need to have 20% Brazilian ownership. However, the way it is worded was a bit ambiguous because it doesn’t explicitly refer to a Brazilian individual and so adopting a two-tier corporate structure in Brazil (where the foreign operator would first incorporate a local holding company and have that company incorporate the local operator applying for the license – the latter thereby having a 100% Brazilian shareholder). The other positive was player tax being reduced from the initially proposed 30% to 15%. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>There were certain paragraphs vetoed by President Lula, such as the player having to calculate income tax on net winnings on an annual basis. All vetoes are still to be heard at Congress, and there’s a lot of uncertainty as to how the income tax is going to be calculated and collected.</p>



 Have you noticed a surge in interest or activity among Brazilian gaming operators since it passed? 



<p>Well, there are very few Brazilian operators because most of them are all foreign operators that will now have to set up shop in Brazil to obtain a federal licence. For many years, players have been used to playing on offshore platforms. Upcoming law changes will make the experience of using an unlicensed platform much harder. For example, there will be restrictions on advertising and on payment methods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Foreign operators will therefore have to obtain a licence from the Ministry of Finance and players will have to play only on licenced operators in Brazil. Right now, we’re in a<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/grey-market-online-gambling-brazil/"> grey market</a> until the full legal framework is laid out, but from the moment licences are made available at federal level, it will officially become a black market, and will be considered significantly riskier.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There will always be ways of circumventing the regulated market, but I think it’s going to be more cumbersome for them to be able to play in the black market. So, hopefully the ordinances will allow a balance between what operators need to do, what the players need to do, and what the government needs to do so that the new regulated market will be sufficiently attractive to encourage players to bet in a licenced environment.</p>

 With many Brazilian players already familiar with gambling on the grey market, how ready and willing do you think players will be to switch to regulated, domestic platforms, where they will be required to complete a KYC process and follow tax payments? 



<p>It all depends on how easy it is to operate in the regulated market. I think there’s still some uncertainties regarding how the tax will be calculated and collected. I think if they had published the methodology of how the player’s income tax will be calculated then that would have been very positive in terms of encouraging players to place their bets in the domestic market. We just need to wait and see what happens. However, if the legal framework is more time and cost consuming than continuing to place bets on the black market, then of course we’re going to have channelization issues, which of course the federal government would like to avoid. Also, will the regulations leave enough room to guarantee the return on investment, because the licence fee is going to be quite high: 30 million Brazilian Reals, which is about $6 million for a 5-year licence. That puts Brazil as one of the most expensive places in the world to obtain a licence.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Also, of course, let’s not forget the real reason for regulating the market, which is player protection and investment protection, so hopefully the balance will be found to avoid players continuing to place their bets on the black market.</p>



 Brazil is forecast to become the largest gambling market in the world. Do you see any obstacles in its way to achieving that? 



<p>Well, I’m an eternal optimist, so if a good balance can be found, which will require all stakeholders to make concessions, then I think so. In Brazil, professional football depends massively on sponsorship provided by operators, and there has been an increase in the value of sponsorship over the years and now that the law has passed, I have seen the amounts go up quite significantly. It’s likely to lower again at some point in the future, but right now sponsorship amounts are record-breaking, and every week we receive news that a football club is receiving twice, three times the amount of sponsorship of previous deals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there’s a lot of appetite for Brazil to become the largest gambling market in the world, and I think it will generate a lot of jobs, a lot of investment, but we need to find the balance. This is the key issue; we are in a newly regulated market and everything’s new for everyone. This is the big opportunity we have been waiting decades for, and now is the time to get it right.</p>



 As a lawyer, what is your opinion of the Brazil licensing requirements? Too arduous, too many loopholes, or to be expected? 



<p>Well, the law has been framed in a way that if an operator doesn’t obtain a licence, they’re going to be subject to many restrictions to access the Brazilian market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Brazilian federal government has always said that once licences are made available then they are going to enforce legislation. We have seen at state level many enforcement actions by certain states, especially Rio Janeiro and Paraná, because not only do we have the federal licence regime, but we also have state licences because federal legislation has taken so long to be enacted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2020, states have enacted their own legislation to grant state licences for traditional lottery and for fixed odd sports betting, as fixed odd sports betting was legalized in Brazil as a form of lottery, and we have seen many clients of ours receive notices and subpoenas as they have not obtained a state licence. One of the main problems we have is of the legal problems caused by the dichotomy between federal and state licences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re awaiting the official licencing requirements. We only have the main points in the law. So, we know it’s an open licencing model with no limit on the number of licences issued, which is good, that’s the model I have been advocating for many years. We know it’s going to cost 30 million Brazilian Reals for a five-year licence, and each operator can promote up to three brands, and not necessarily the operator’s own brand, so there could be licencing arrangements with other brand holders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plan is to have two windows per year during which the applications can be filled. 134 companies submitted applications last year, well, submitted an expression of interest and the federal government has promised priority in the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;Hopefully the Ministry of Finance will have sufficient human resources to process all these applications, because they are going to be flooded with a lot of paperwork. Everything is going to be done electronically, which should be more efficient, but there’s going to be a lot of documents that need to be provided. We still do not know whether documents coming from overseas will have to satisfy the formalities of notarization. It’s going to be the first experience in Brazil in terms of licencing at federal level, but hopefully we’ll get there!&nbsp;</p>



 In your legal opinion, how well-prepared are Brazilian operators, particularly start-ups, to navigate the complexities of the new regulatory landscape in the online gambling sector? 



<p>Well, there’s going to be a surge in igaming lawyers in all aspects of the law, because this is a very detailed, regulatory environment. So, there are many different aspects to it. So, I think Brazilian operators may have an advantage of knowing the law better, and how it could evolve with upcoming regulations, as they know the market so well. Maybe they don’t have the strength that foreign operators have, but at least they have the knowledge of the local market and knowledge of the local law, which should give them a certain competitive advantage. Foreign operators who set up shop in Brazil will gradually have to learn their way around the treacherous waters of the Brazilian legal system because, as we say, Brazil is not for amateurs.</p>



 With other countries in the Americas opening, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/peru-gambling-regulation/">such as Peru</a>, how important do you think the region will become in the global gambling market in the next 5 to 10 years? Is the future bright? 



<p>I think Latin America is the new frontier of the gaming industry. So, most of it is still uncharted territory, especially Brazil, but I think things will become clearer with time. But, yes, Latin America is the place to be at the moment and I think we’ll be in the spotlight for many years to come.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have seen other surprise advancements, even in the Muslim world, with land-based casinos being floated in the UAE for example, and even places like Saudi Arabia are now considering casinos. So, I think igaming is seen as something that needs to be focused on and Latin America, Mexico, all the way down to Argentina and Chile are going to be in the spotlight with Brazil likely to become the main player in that regional market.</p>

 Unveiling a New&nbsp;Era <p>In our digital age, the management of digital identities has become a critical concern. Traditional centralized systems, managed by entities like Google and Facebook, often fall short in safeguarding user privacy and security. This introduces Decentralized Identity (DID), a paradigm shift that promises not just a technological revolution but a cultural transformation, emphasizing digital independence and security.</p><p>The evolution of identity management from centralized to decentralized models, with DID at the helm, marks a significant departure from the status quo. Initially, online identification relied on methods like emails and passwords, with enhancements such as WebAuthn bolstering user authentication. However, these centralized systems presented considerable privacy and security vulnerabilities, leading to an urgent call for a new approach. DID, utilizing blockchain technology, represents this new frontier. By empowering users with control over their personal data, DID ensures privacy and enhances security, heralding a new era of digital interactions that prioritize user autonomy.</p><p>This shift to DID introduces numerous benefits:</p>  Streamlined Verification: Simplifies the authentication process, allowing for safe and efficient identity&nbsp;checks.  Enhanced Security: By distributing data across a decentralized network, DID minimizes the risks associated with centralized data&nbsp;storage.  Greater Privacy: Users control their personal information, sharing only what’s necessary and with whom they&nbsp;choose.  Reduced Data Breaches: The decentralized nature and encryption methods lower the potential for large-scale data breaches.  <p>Blockchain technology underpins DID’s advantages, providing a decentralized framework that transforms personal data management. This not only secures information through encryption but also assures data integrity, as altering recorded information requires network consensus. Blockchain’s role is pivotal in overcoming the limitations of centralized systems, offering a verification mechanism that bolsters trust without compromising privacy.</p><p>As we look towards a future shaped by these advancements, DID stands as a beacon for a user-centric digital ecosystem.

<p></p> 
<p>The National Security Agency (NSA), in conjunction with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), recently released its “<a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3699169/nsa-releases-top-ten-cloud-security-mitigation-strategies/">Top Ten Cloud Security Mitigation Strategies</a>” for organizations to make their cloud environments more secure. The report contains a Cybersecurity Information Sheet (CSI) for each strategy, which includes MITRE ATT&amp;CK and D3FEND mappings and cloud-specific mitigation guidance.</p>  
<p>The agency emphasizes that these measures are critical for every company that uses cloud services as these environments are increasingly targeted by malicious cyber actors (MCAs). Earlier this year, the NSA, CISA and a host of international cybersecurity agencies <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Press-Room/Press-Releases-Statements/Press-Release-View/Article/3686651/russian-cyber-actors-target-cloud-hosted-infrastructure/">issued a joint advisory</a> analyzing the way that advanced persistent threat (APT) groups are evolving their tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to focus on initial access and disruption of cloud services. The new guidance provides mitigation strategies to counter these threats.</p> 
<p>Full strategy list:</p> 
  
  Uphold the cloud shared responsibility model  
  Use secure cloud identity and access management practices  
  Use secure cloud key management practices  
  Implement network segmentation and encryption in cloud environments  
  Secure data in the cloud  
  Defending continuous integration/continuous delivery environments&nbsp;  
  Enforce secure automated deployment practices through infrastructure as code  
  Account for complexities introduced by hybrid cloud and multi-cloud environments  
  Mitigate risks from managed service providers in cloud environments&nbsp;  
  Manage cloud logs for effective threat hunting  
  
 NSA Cloud Security Guidance Takeaway #1: Cloud Security Starts With Identity Security&nbsp;  
<p>Much of the guidance centers on having a robust identity security program. Insufficiently secure identity systems leave organizations exposed to any number of threats including phishing, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle</a> attacks, identity fraud, MFA bombing attacks and more. Last year saw a 71% spike in cyberattacks that exploited stolen or compromised credentials, according to IBM’s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/threat-intelligence">2024 threat report</a>, accounting for 30% of attacks. The report also revealed that 90% of the cloud assets for sale on the dark web were cloud account credentials.</p> 
 Phishing-Resistant MFA Is No Longer Optional  
<p>Two of the top strategies directly relate to secure identity practices, and several others on the list call out the need to protect credentials and the threat posed by passwords and shared secrets. Specifically, the guidance recommends the use of phishing-resistant MFA as widely as possible. It defines phishing resistant methods as FIDO standards based public key cryptography or PKI-based CAC/PIV cards, pointing to the <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-the-cisa-multi-factor-authentication-guidance-means-for-enterprises">phishing-resistant MFA fact sheet</a> issued earlier by CISA.</p> 
<p>Example of phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication flow:</p> 
<p></p> 
 NSA Cloud Security Guidance Takeaway #2: Context Is King  
<p>Multiple measures in the guidance emphasize the need for detailed contextual information about the system’s activity and behavior. This data is critical to govern access and drive appropriate and timely responses to potential threats. For example, the report highlights the need for <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/context-based-authentication-to-improve-security">context-based authentication</a>, using conditions such as geo location</p> 
<p>The effectiveness of such context-based access controls depends on the fidelity of the information flow, which in turn depends on monitoring risk from a wide variety of sources. Ideally, an organization’s cloud identity control systems would leverage the same risk data being collected for threat hunting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 NSA Cloud Security Guidance Takeaway #3: Minimize Complexity  
<p>Before rolling out MFA and other cloud security solutions, it's crucial to fully understand the range of scenarios they'll be used in. The NSA guidance cautions against an uncoordinated approach, which can leave gaps in coverage and create complexity. Using multiple IAM systems and different authenticators can create confusion for users and hinder adoption. It also makes it harder to manage and monitor security effectively.</p> 
<p>This becomes especially critical in multi-cloud and hybrid environments. Attackers move back and forth between on-prem and cloud environments. The guidance recommends the organizations implement identity solutions that can unify disparate systems and support all of their use cases. Authentication protocols should follow the <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST SP 800-63 </a>Digital Identity Guidelines.</p> 
 NSA Cloud Security Guidance Takeaway #4: Embrace Zero Trust Principles  
<p>Whether you’re of the camp that Zero Trust is a marketing buzzword, or if it’s your guiding north star, the principles behind Zero Trust are solid security best practices. A Zero Trust approach makes data, systems, and networks harder for attackers to compromise in the first place, and slows them down if they do manage to get a foothold.&nbsp; Much of the NSA Cloud Security guidance is, in effect, Zero Trust tenets made actionable, starting with <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/zero-trust-authentication">Zero Trust authentication</a> and least-privilege access control, to strong cryptographic protocols and network segmentation. Implicit in all of the guidance is to bake in Zero Trust best practices as you migrate to the cloud. It’s harder to re-architect already established systems, especially if there is not adequate segregation of duties. For example, your authentication systems should be separate from your IdP.</p> 
 Tips for Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA  
<p>The NSA recommendation for phishing-resistant MFA stands out as one of the simplest yet most effective strategies. Until now, it's been the high-stakes sectors like financial services, insurance, and critical infrastructure leading the charge in adopting phishing-resistant controls. The NSA guidance makes clear that it’s time for security teams across the board to catch up. Here are some things to keep in mind:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
  
  Prioritize a consistent experience. Users want a simple login process that is the same across cloud systems and resources as well as other channels. Employ independent, phishing-resistant authentication controls that work with multiple identity sources to provide a uniform experience.  
  Take a phased approach. Start with critical systems and high-risk users to minimize disruption and maximize impact. As you troubleshoot and succeed, gradually extend the approach to wider systems and user groups.  
  Beware of FIDO imitators. There is a vast difference between "FIDO-like" or "FIDO-compliant" and "FIDO Certified." Verify vendors' certifications on the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/certification/fido-certified-products/">FIDO website</a>, ensuring all solution components, authenticators and servers, are certified.  
  
 How Organizations Can Meet NSA Cloud Security Provisions  
<p>The new guidance from NSA underscores the critical role identity plays in fortifying cloud security defenses. With malicious actors increasingly targeting cloud environments, and specifically identity systems, following recommended best practices becomes indispensable. The rapid <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/preventing-generative-ai-attacks">weaponization of generative AI</a> in attacks makes this even more critical.</p> 
<p>HYPR's Identity Assurance platform, which includes HYPR Authenticate, HYPR Adapt, and HYPR Affirm, ensures that identity security meets NSA standards. It combines advanced passkey-based authentication with adaptive identity risk management, automated identity verification, and a user-friendly experience.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">HYPR Authenticate</a> provides highly secure FIDO-based, phishing-resistant MFA. It ensures that biometric templates are linked to individual devices, addressing privacy and security concerns while following NSA guidelines.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>If you’re an IAM (Identity and Access Management) manager in a small or medium-sized business, you know the challenge of trying to secure a growing ecosystem of SaaS (Software as a Service) applications. Every day, there’s a new app that one of your employees must have, and it’s your job to ensure access is granted quickly, consistently, and securely. But with each new app, the risks of inconsistent access management grows. Is there a way to solve this challenge? Of course, there is. Why else would I be writing this and you reading it?</p>
<p>Read on.</p>
<p>Many apps can’t be easily integrated into your IAM system. The apps might support SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) for single sign-on (SSO), but that’s often locked behind an expensive “Enterprise” tier. And even if you can afford it, automated provisioning requires SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management), which is even less commonly supported.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SCIM is an open standard that defines a schema for exchanging user identity information between systems. It allows IAM systems to automate the provisioning, de-provisioning, and management of user accounts in SaaS apps, ensuring that access is always in sync with the user’s current role and employment status.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Without SCIM, IAM managers are forced to rely on manual processes and custom integrations to manage SaaS app access. As your team and SaaS portfolio grow, these manual processes become increasingly unsustainable and error-prone.</p>
 The Challenge: SaaS App Sprawl and Access Management Complexity 
<p>So what do you do? Many fall back on spreadsheets and a patchwork of playbooks to try to keep up. But this approach has serious risks – and the risks get worse as you add more apps and more people with varying access needs and roles. This perfect storm of complexity spirals out of control, leading to inconsistencies, security risks, and compliance issues.</p>
 The Risks of Inconsistent Access Management 
<p>When onboarding and offboarding processes vary from app to app, it’s easy for things to fall through the cracks.</p>
<p>Imagine a new sales rep who starts work excited to dive in and close some deals, only to find they can’t access the CRM because their account hasn’t been provisioned. Or consider the IT team that thinks they’ve completed an employee’s offboarding, only to discover weeks later that the ex-employee still has access to sensitive data in a cloud storage app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These inconsistencies not only frustrate employees and waste time they also create serious security risks that compound with each new app.</p>
 The Dangers of Access Creep 
<p>Then there’s the access creep. As employees move between roles, their permissions don’t always keep up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Ex-engineer Al Sutton revealed that despite quitting 18 months ago he still retained access to Twitter’s central file store on GitHub, a website used by software developers to store source code.” — <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2022/08/24/ex-twitter-staff-have-access-secret-software-code-whistleblower/#:~:text=Ex%2Dengineer%20Al%20Sutton%20revealed%20that%20despite%20quitting%2018%20months%20ago%20he%20still%20retained%20access%20to%20Twitter%27s%20central%20file%20store%20on%20GitHub%2C%20a%20website%20used%20by%20software%20developers%20to%20store%20source%20code.">The Telegraph</a></p>
<p>Consider a tech startup that uses GitHub Teams to manage their code repositories. When an engineer leaves the company, their GitHub account isn’t always immediately deprovisioned from the company’s GitHub organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the IT team is busy or forgets to follow up, the ex-employee could retain access to critical codebases, infrastructure-as-code templates, and other sensitive IP long after they’ve left. This lingering access is a major security risk even if the engineer has no malicious intent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>If the engineer’s personal GitHub account is ever compromised, hackers could then gain access to the company’s crucial assets. As your company grows and more employees cycle through, the risk of this happening increases.</p>
 The Danger of Poor Visibility 
<p>Perhaps most concerning is the lack of visibility into user permissions across SaaS apps. Even with an IAM system in place, the lack of automation makes it impossible to fully track and manage access across all SaaS apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consider an auditor who asks to see a report of everyone who has admin access to your financial systems. If those permissions are managed in a spreadsheet or worse, in someone’s head, you’re going to have a tough time pulling that report together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if you can’t confidently prove who has access to what, you risk failing the audit and losing out on big deals with security-conscious customers. Achieving SOC2 compliance with inconsistent access management is a daunting task that only gets harder as your SaaS ecosystem expands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And even if you’re not pursuing SOC2 compliance, put yourself in your customers’ shoes: would you buy a product from a company that can’t even track something as basic as what their employees have access to?</p>
<p>The longer you wait to address these issues, the more entrenched and intractable they become. That’s why it’s critical to implement a solution now, before your SaaS environment grows too complex to manage.</p>
 The Solution: Centralized IAM Playbooks 
<p>By bringing all your access management processes together in one place – including manual steps, automated workflows, and everything in between – you can ensure consistent, timely execution of access changes across all your apps, now and in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You gain a single pane of glass to monitor and manage permissions. And you can easily generate the reports you need to breeze through your next compliance audit, no matter how many SaaS apps you’ve added to your stack.</p>
 Why Legacy IAM Falls Short 
<p>But not all IAM solutions are up to this task. Legacy IAM systems often lack the flexibility and extensibility needed to implement truly centralized playbooks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They might handle the basics of single sign-on and provisioning, yet struggle to accommodate the custom workflows and manual steps that are a reality of life with SaaS apps, especially as your app portfolio diversifies.</p>

<p>With the turn of the 20th century and the rise of the internet, transactions and services became increasingly digital – and so did our identities. Unlike physical identities where a person is in complete control of their identification documents and knows when these documents are missing or stolen, digital identities are stored on servers and databases owned by third-party vendors that offer their services in a digital format. So, it’s highly unlikely a person would know when their digital identity is stolen or compromised. In effect, a cybercriminal could pose as a legitimate user and inflict financial and reputational damage over a long period of time before the breach is detected.</p>
<p>As cloud adoption and digital transformation has accelerated over the last few years, so has application sprawl, with the average company having over 254 SaaS apps, and less than half of those being used on a regular basis, according to a Productiv study. And an average mobile phone user has 80 apps installed, with 62% of those apps not used on a regular basis, according to a DataProt study. This SaaS sprawl has led to password fatigue and reuse as well as dormant accounts, increasing the attack surface for cybercriminals to launch successful identity-based attacks. It’s no wonder that phishing and credential compromise are the two most common initial attack vectors.</p>
<p>Taking a layered approach to identity-first security</p>
<p>With the advent of generative AI technologies and criminal SaaS offerings such as phishing as a service that enable cybercriminals to launch effective and targeted phishing campaigns, identity has quickly become the perimeter that organizations need to secure against cyberattacks.</p>
<p>In order to build an effective identity-first security strategy, organizations need to take a layered approach to a proactive defense – starting with an effective AI-based biometric solution to verify identities accurately while detecting fake IDs and deepfakes.</p>
<p>Then, enabling high assurance phishing-resistant <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/passwordless-login">passwordless authentication</a> (e.g., certificate-based authentication with passkeys) can help authenticate seamlessly while protecting against phishing and MFA-bypass attacks.</p>
<p>You can further eliminate the dangers that come with SaaS application sprawl and password fatigue&nbsp;by implementing a true passwordless experience with <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/single-sign-on">single sign-on (SSO)</a> and just-in-time user provisioning capabilities. This can streamline the authentication process and help eliminate dormant accounts, reducing license costs associated with granting user licenses for applications that users never log in to.</p>
<p>Finally, tying in a robust adaptive risk engine that can evaluate the risk score of a user based on contextual information (IP address, geolocation, travel velocity, behavioral biometrics, etc.) introduces friction in the process by requiring a second <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/identity-and-access-management/capabilities/multi-factor-authentication-mfa">MFA</a> or blocking access when risk levels are higher than a set threshold.</p>
<p>As we’ve seen in some recent breaches, bringing in an identity verification step with physical credentials and liveness detection during MFA/password resets – to secure a high-value transaction or out-of-compliance user –&nbsp;can build a robust, proactive identity-first security strategy.</p>

<p>Ensuring the safety of sensitive data and privacy shifts from just a priority to an absolute necessity. Authentication, the gatekeeper of these digital resources, is crucial in this fight against cybercrime.&nbsp; In this article, you will learn what it is, why it’s helpful, how it differs from other types of authentication, and how you could implement it in your organization.</p>
 What is Step-Up Authentication? 
<p>Step Up Authentication is a dynamic form of multi-factor authentication. It works by adjusting the level of security and user verification based on the associated risk of a specific action, transaction, or mobile account.</p>
<p>Different triggers can prompt Step Up Authentication’s activation, like irregular user behavior, access requests from unfamiliar locations or devices, or high-risk transactions accessing sensitive data. Users may initially authenticate via traditional methods (username/password), but Step Up Authentication comes into play as the perceived risk escalates, demanding additional login credentials.</p>
<p>Step Up Authentication uses a hierarchical model adaptive authentication scheme, scaling from simple to complex; it provides the flexibility to apply the optimal level of security based on the perceived threat or the user’s risk profile.</p>
 The Anatomy of Step-Up Authentication 
<p></p>
<p>The behind-the-scenes operation of Step Up Authentication is a balance between risk assessment and corresponding adjustments to the step up authentication work up level. Each transaction or request initiates a process where the system evaluates the risk level and prompts the user for a related step up authentication.</p>
<p>To make these decisions, the system utilizes various risk assessment metrics. These include factors such as the sensitivity of the requested data, the location of the user’s location request, the behavior of the user, and even the time of the request.</p>
<p>Policy management plays a big role here, as it sets the rules and parameters for when and how the system should step up the authentication process. These policies, dictated by the nature of the business and its unique security requirements, ensure that the system remains secure and user-friendly.</p>
 The Evolution of Authentication 
<p>The progression of authentication techniques paints an interesting picture of human ingenuity in the face of evolving threats. Beginning with the humble password, these techniques have developed in response to escalating risks and more sophisticated threat actors.</p>
<p>The initial stage was dominated by password-based authentication systems, a straightforward and user-friendly method, yet not without its weaknesses. Passwords, being susceptible to breaches via techniques like brute-force attacks and phishing, necessitated a more robust system.</p>
<p>Subsequently, security tokens emerged as a new layer of protection. Yet, their physical nature introduced inconvenience and added risk of loss or theft. Later, the advent of biometric authentication marked a significant stride forward against identity theft, tying access to unique human characteristics such as fingerprints or retinal patterns.</p>
<p>The most significant leap in this evolutionary process was the introduction of multi-factor authentication, combining multiple layers of security to create a formidable barrier to unauthorized access to sensitive information.</p>
<p>While both Step-Up Authentication,&nbsp; Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), and Adaptive Authentication serve the goal of improved security, they differ significantly in their approach.</p>
<p>MFA  involves presenting two or more independent credentials at every step up authentication vs. event. This could include something the user knows (password), something the user has (token), or something the user is (biometrics). MFA’s strength lies in its layered defense, using multiple authentication factors and making it challenging for unauthorized users to gain access even if they compromise one aspect.</p>
<p>Adaptive Authentication employs real-time risk assessments, considering many factors such as device reputation, IP reputation, geolocation, and behavior anomalies. Based on these assessments, Adaptive Authentication may permit, or deny authentication apps, or step up the authentication process.</p>
<p>Step-Up Authentication adjusts its various authentication factors and requirements based on the perceived risk level of a transaction or request. It might begin with a simple or two-factor authentication, such as a password, and add more layers as risk escalates. It offers the flexibility of user-friendly authentication for low-risk actions and robust security for higher-risk operations.</p>
 Viewing vs. Editing Data 
<p>One of the significant features of Step-Up Authentication is its ability to adapt to the nature of the user’s actions. For instance, when a user views data, the authentication process might require only the user’s password or a simple username and password in/password combination. This allows users to perform low-risk actions with minimal friction.</p>
<p>However, when the same user attempts to edit or export sensitive data, the system recognizes the higher risk and steps up the authentication process. This could involve using additional authentication credentials, such as a one-time password, biometric verification, or answering security questions. This dynamic response to requires users based on the action type underlines the adaptability and intelligence of Step-Up Authentication.</p>
 Step-Up Authentication in Practice 
<p>In practice, you’ll encounter Step Up Authentication in different scenarios, Financial institutions often apply it during high-value transactions. Cloud services employ it when users request access to susceptible information. It’s becoming increasingly ubiquitous across digital platforms, from email services to social media networks.</p>
<p>Sectors like healthcare, finance, education, and corporate entities, utilize Step Up Authentication as an essential tool in their security arsenal. It is increasingly recognized as a powerful means to secure sensitive data, protect user identities and stolen credentials, and maintain system integrity.</p>
 Step-Up Authentication Use Cases 
<p>Step-Up Authentication is not just a theory but a reality with practical applications across various digital platforms. For example, take a standard action like transferring funds from a banking app. Users might log in to the app using a username/password or biometric authentication. However, when the user initiates a high-value transfer, the system might request additional identity verification as a one-time password (OTP) sent to the user’s registered mobile number or email.</p>
<p>Another use case can be found within corporate systems; an employee may be able to access common, low-sensitivity resources using a simple password. Still, when attempting to access further sensitive resources, more sensitive information, or administrative controls, the system prompts them to undergo further authentication, such as answering security questions or presenting a physical token.</p>
 The Strengths of Step-Up Authentication 
<p></p>
<p>By assessing its impact, the merits of Step Up Authentication become abundantly clear. Its greatest strength lies in its ability to bolster security, creating a robust defense against a wide array of cyber threats.</p>
<p>But its benefits extend beyond security; it contributes significantly to improving user experience, as the need for rigorous additional authentication factors and measures only arises under elevated risk conditions. This reduces friction and potential frustration in day-to-day user interactions.</p>
<p>From a compliance perspective, Step Up Authentication also aids in meeting regulatory requirements for data breach protection. Moreover, it has become a potent tool in the risk management arsenal, offering an adaptive and responsive approach to data breaches and threat mitigation.</p>
 Pitfalls and Proactive Measures 
<p>Like any system, Step Up Authentication has its potential pitfalls. These include technical implementation challenges, user acceptance, and the ever-present struggle to balance security with ease of use. However, with a strategic approach, these obstacles can be navigated effectively.</p>
<p>Proactive problem-solving measures, such as comprehensive user education programs, policy optimization, and ongoing system monitoring and updating, are key to addressing these challenges.</p>
 Security Implications and Concerns in Step-Up Authentication 
<p>Though a significant security improvement, step-Up Authentication has potential risks and vulnerabilities. Understanding these security implications and how they can be mitigated is essential to ensure robust protection against cyber threats.</p>
<p>One potential concern is user acceptance and cooperation. Given its nature, users may need clarification on the changing requirements for authentication. This issue is not just a usability concern but also a security concern, as user non-compliance or bypass attempts can introduce vulnerabilities into the system.</p>
<p>Another concern revolves around the accuracy of risk assessment. The effectiveness of Step-Up Authentication depends primarily on correctly identifying and responding to potential risks. Inaccurate risk assessments can lead to security breaches if high-risk actions are not identified correctly and high-risk resources don’t trigger a step-up in authentication.</p>
<p>The additional security measures used in Step-Up Authentication, like biometrics or security questions, bring potential vulnerabilities. For instance, biometric data can be spoofed, and security questions can often be guessed or discovered through social engineering.</p>
 Mitigation Practices for Step-Up Authentication 
<p>Mitigating these concerns involves several strategies:</p>
 
 Clear communication about how the system works and its necessity can be beneficial to increase user acceptance. 
 User training can also help ensure that users understand the authentication requirements. 
 Refinement of the risk assessment algorithm and learning from past mistakes are critical for improving risk assessment accuracy. 
 Regular auditing and testing can help identify potential weaknesses in the risk assessment process. 
 
<p>As for the vulnerabilities related to additional security measures, it is key to ensure these are implemented with their own security best practices. For instance, biometric data should be stored securely, and liveness detection tools, like <a>BlockID,</a> should be used to prevent spoofing.</p>

We’ll get into it in the episode, but suffice it to say that it’s an effort to bring trust to content online.</p><p>Was the pope really photographed in that puffy jacket? Was the photo of a war zone really taken this week, or is that from several years ago? And we’ll get into how to identify the identity of the individual or business behind the content, in a privacy-preserving way.</p><p>We talk about adoption of the C2PA standard, how the content authenticity initiative recruited so many of the most influential tech and media platforms, and how Adobe built the conviction to ship the first versions into production despite a cold start problem.</p><p>We also talk about the user experience of content authenticity, both from the creator side and consumer side, and some thornier issues including potential for censorship and deceit.</p><p>This is a fascinating episode into an emerging standard that I believe will be an important part of all our lives over the coming years, and example of incredible innovation coming from a large technology company.</p><p>You can learn more about the Content Authenticity Alliance at <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/">https://contentauthenticity.org/</a> and you can find more about the C2PA standard at <a href="https://c2pa.org/">https://c2pa.org/</a></p><p>Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for more announcements related to the future of identity at <a href="http://trinsic.id/podcast">trinsic.id/podcast</a></p><p>Reach out to Riley (<a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">@rileyphughes</a>) and Trinsic (<a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id">@trinsic_id</a>) on Twitter.

<p>In today’s fast-paced world, time is a precious commodity. While machines perform tasks at remarkable speeds, the human workforce often encounters periods of non-machine idle time, hindering overall productivity. Enter digital machine intelligence, a solution poised to transform the way we capture and analyze production performance to alleviate this issue and propelling the payment card issuance and personalization industry into a new era of efficiency and innovation.</p>
<p>What Is Idle Time?</p>
<p>In manufacturing, the widely accepted definition is that idle time is the duration of time we wait while a machine or person, though fully functional, is not productive.</p>
<p>Idle time = scheduled production time – actual productive time.</p>
<p>The key here is the machine is fully functional (no errors, no broken parts, no system down, no communication issues, etc.), but it is not producing output for one reason or another.</p>
<p>Why Is It Important?</p>
<p>The most recent data I have gathered as a business analytics consultant in the card issuance and personalization space suggests that the average availability time for a company without any analytics solution or continuous improvement program ranges from 16% to 38%. This means that anywhere from 62%-84% of the time machines are not running when they could be. Closing that gap is where we see the largest impact when implementing continuous improvement and data-driven productivity gains on the production floor.</p>
<p>What Are Sources of Idle Time?</p>
<p>There are many common sources of idle time shared across all industries, but here we focus on those related to card issuance and personalization centers:</p>
 
 Machine or operator waiting for work or jobs – this issue stems from job planning or an issue with the preceding steps. 
 Machine or operator not authorized to perform work and waiting on approval – this could be due to quality checks, security checks, supervisor checks, missing job instructions, and so on. 
 Machine or operator is missing raw materials needed such as consumables and operator materials. 
 Machine or operator not present – this can happen for a variety of reasons including scheduled or unscheduled break, reassignment to another activity, or absenteeism with no backup resource available. 
 Machine or operator is on standby due to personal process limitations such as dual custody is required and only one operator is available, missing card needs to be found, a security incident related to the previous job run occurs and an investigation is underway, or machine calibration checks are needed. 
 The machine is undergoing setup for a variety of reasons including job loading or material loading, machine is getting cleaned or calibrated, or the workstation is getting set up for the job. 
 External dependencies are at play including a halt to production ordered by the customer, a quality or maintenance lead who initiates immediate work stoppage, a power or network outage, a supplies shortage, external software delays, an emergency evacuation, or any situation where wait times are instituted. 
 
<p>How to Reduce Idle Time</p>
<p>The first step to resolving any problem is to understand the root cause and magnitude. This is the basis of knowledge-based management or Lean Six Sigma manufacturing: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control.</p>
 
 Define: The definitions have been made clear on what idle time is; now the next step is to measure them. 
 Measure: To gauge machine productivity accurately, track scheduled work time and measure actual operational periods, focusing on the cumulative bursts of output like finished personalized products. If a software-hardware solution is not available, your best bet is manual monitoring with a stopwatch for the entirety of the day, ensuring unbiased and unhindered data collection. However, one caveat is that an on-site observer may not pinpoint process and employee-related issues with the utmost precision. 
 Analyze: After obtaining data for a single machine’s scheduled work versus actual work for a day, calculate the idle time. If the idle time exceeds 15% (idle time divided by scheduled work time), there is a problem requiring attention. Achieving the industry average of 15% idle time is possible with the implementation of software-hardware tracking systems along with fostering a continuous improvement culture. Thorough data collection enables the creation of a Pareto chart, identifying the easiest-to-solve issues, or “low-hanging fruits.” Targeting these areas strategically will maximize gains. In cases of insufficient data, a return to the measure phase is necessary to confidently identify root causes. Implementing tools like Ishikawa diagrams helps isolate overlapping causes, guiding resource allocation and energy to the right focus areas. 
 Improve: Identifying the problem is just the beginning; the real challenge is solving it. Now armed with insights into the issue’s source, you can brainstorm solutions – whether it involves process modifications, personnel retraining, or technological changes. Often, this is where an external consultant can offer valuable perspectives, leveraging industry experience and unbiased insights. Once a solution is pinpointed and evaluated, an implementation plan, coupled with a trial and measurement system, ensures fair assessment and feedback from all stakeholders. This initial trial is crucial for the success of the broader rollout. Lack of an experienced continuous improvement engineer often leads to challenges and failures at this stage, making external consultation advisable. 
 Control: After the successful trial and subsequent large-scale rollout, sustaining the solution becomes the most challenging phase. The absence of proper controls, feedback mechanisms, and the ability to steer the process, teams, and operation often leads to solutions unraveling after a few months. Management’s shift in focus and personnel reverting to familiar habits contribute to this breakdown. Control is about identifying any future pains that come up and developing and adapting the solution to overcome these bumps on the road so the gains of the solution can be earned for the long run. The key to process control is to know when it is going out of control, which requires continuous monitoring and data collection every minute of every hour to identify long-term trends. This is where having software running in the background collecting data analytics is key. Without control, processes fall apart. 
 
<p>The Power of Production Analytics</p>
<p>Idle time is by far the largest contributor to operational inefficiencies in card issuance and personalization environments. Many factories are using logbook-based manual measurements to understand what is happening, which can be marred by bias, human error, and lack of detail. Without a software-hardware based analytics solution, many key opportunities to improve go undiscovered. Once these problems have been clearly identified, there is a critical process to analyze the data to identify key root causes. After that, a rigorous and creative solution-generating process must take place with a carefully orchestrated trial preceding a large rollout of the solution. Additionally, any gains from these depend entirely on the factories’ abilities to control and sustain those gains in the long run, which requires continuous data monitoring and solution steering.</p>

				  Verifiable credentials are a way to package and share tamper-proof digital information so that you can always authenticate where it originally came from. What makes this technology powerful is that anyone can cryptographically verify the issuer of the credential, and that no changes to the data have occurred since the credential’s creation, enabling the information inside to be trusted and immediately acted on.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>To put it simply, verifiable credentials are packages of data created in a decentralized network by issuing organizations or parties and stored locally by the data owner in a digital wallet.</p>
<p>Once created, the party issuing these packages can be verified by anyone with the appropriate software. As a credential is created, the issuing party digitally signs the information inside, and once it is signed, any attempt to alter the data will be visible on the network and “break” the credential, so to speak.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>What can a verifiable credential represent?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use cases are almost endless, any information tied to identification or an identity can be turned into a verifiable credential: you can represent a person, a car, a building, an organization, or a connected device, and any information that can be associated with these entities.</p>
<p>For example, colleges and universities can issue documents such as diplomas or transcripts to students as verifiable credentials. These can be easily shared with anyone who needs to verify that information. Verification is instant and doesn’t require going back to the university for manual proof, providing a much more efficient experience for everyone.</p>
<p>To learn more about this read our recent article on <a href="https://indicio.tech/why-use-decentralized-identity-and-open-badges-in-education/">Open Badges 3.0</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The end of paper documents and manual processes</p>
<p>In today’s system, credentials are everywhere: you likely have a driver’s license, passport, maybe a badge to access your place of employment.</p>
<p>But paper documents have several drawbacks:</p>
<p>They can be stolen, copied, forged or misplaced.</p>
<p>Someone needs to be in the same physical location to acquire them</p>
<p>They need to be stored securely.</p>
<p>Using them can share more data than needed, or require you to copy down the information they contain manually.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials enable you to hold all the same information, digitally, in a way that you have more control over and can share how you like.</p>
<p>From an organization standpoint they provide a way to quickly share information across different systems without a need for complex direct integrations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Let’s walk through a quick example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, the DMV can issue you a driver’s license, which contains personal information such as your date of birth, eye color, height, weight, full name, license number, and address. When attempting to purchase an age-restricted item, the vendor will often check your license to confirm your age and that you can legally purchase the item. When you hand over your ID, you hand over all of the information, not just your date of birth — and that information can easily be misused.</p>
<p>In the same scenario, a verifiable credential is still issued by the DMV, and it still contains all that personal data, but, crucially, the data can be separated and shared in a much more selective way. And we can even go a step further and simply share eligibility: the shop doesn’t need to know your actual birthdate, they just need to know if you’re over a certain age, which can be shared in the form of simple yes or no.</p>
<p>To learn more about making purchases with verifiable credentials read our article on how they will change <a href="https://indicio.tech/verifiable-credentials-digitally-transform-banking-finance-and-payments/">finance and payments.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why does decentralization matter?</p>
<p>This is a huge topic that deserves its own blog but a quick few points are:</p>
<p>As other digital identification methods start to catch on, such as mobile driver’s licenses, it’s important to remember that simply digitizing a document does not make it secure. What is critical is how that document is stored and shared.</p>
<p>By storing verifiable credentials locally on the end user’s mobile device you can be sure they control that data and can share it only with whomever they choose to.</p>
<p>If the mobile driver’s license is not decentralized, it means that the system needs to be contacted to verify a person’s identity. This provides a slower verification process, can run into issues if the database is unreachable, and represents a huge target for bad actors.</p>

 Recently released compliance survey reveals operators’ most common concerns, why players abandon onboarding and the likely effect of UK’s upcoming financial risk checks. 



 



<p>The online gambling market shows no signs of slowing. In fact, by the end of 2024 the revenue generated from the sector is <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/worldwide">projected to exceed $107 billion</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As new markets like Peru and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">Brazil</a> open, and established markets like the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-gambling-white-paper/">UK </a>and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/becoming-compliant-ontario-igaming-market/">Canada </a>revise their regulatory frameworks, the challenges faced by betting and gambing operators’ compliance teams are becoming increasingly complicated. &nbsp;</p>



<p>With this in mind, IDnow commissioned SBC Media to investigate the compliance challenges most likely to affect operators in 2024 and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ‘Challenges in Compliance Survey’ features insights and opinions from 104 global compliance professionals from the gambling industry, and looked at four areas: compliance, fraud, onboarding and financial risk checks.</p>



<blockquote><p>In understanding the compliance challenges that betting and gaming operators face, we believe we can better address our clients’ pain points and empower them to provide the journey that their customers deserve.</p>Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President Global Gaming at IDnow. </blockquote>



 Biggest compliance pain points for gambling operators. 



<p>According to the survey, the most common compliance challenge was source of funds checks, which was cited as one of the most difficult issues by more than a fifth of global respondents, rising to nearly 30% of European-based compliance professionals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the other end of the spectrum, respondents found age verification the least difficult to deal with, followed by identity verification, reflecting the availability of robust third-party solutions to handle that crucial part of onboarding.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another question posed in the survey was related to speed of implementation, and how long it took operators to fulfil certain compliance requirements, such as obtaining a licence, undergoing an audit and complying with regulatory requirements in a new market. While being first to market is obviously an important factor, and can be a significant competitive advantage, results from the survey suggest that becoming compliant is not something that should be rushed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two-fifths of operators said they typically take 6-12 months to fulfil the compliance requirements ahead of entering a new territory, while around 30% suggested the process took 3-6 months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what is the most important thing to factor in when entering new markets. At around 60% each, respondents were split between the ability to utilize existing compliance software (identity verification and AML solutions) and speed of implementation as the most important factors.</p>



 Biggest fraud concerns in the gambling industry. 



<p>The second section of the survey was designed to identify the prevalence and trends of different types of fraud and the prevention of fraud attacks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It revealed that bonus abuse and attempts at document fraud remain most commonplace (65% and 57% respectively), despite improvements to identification and prevention tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking to the future, there is also concern about social engineering attacks (54%) and the growing threat of facial recognition spoofing attacks (33%).&nbsp;</p>



<p>[Read about the growing threat of social media fraud, which leverages social engineering, in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/social-media-fraud-investment-romance-scam/">‘The rise of social media fraud: How one man almost lost it all.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was also broad consensus on whether AI-powered anti-fraud tools were the way forward. More than 70% of respondents either already have such tools or plan to implement them in the next 12 months.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The results of this survey should act as a wake-up call for gambling operators in the UK and elsewhere to prepare themselves for the emerging fraud and compliance challenges. To address these challenges, operators will need a multi-dimensional approach to identity verification and fraud prevention, that enables seamless gambling experiences anytime, anywhere,” said Roger.</p>

 The importance and dangers of onboarding. 



<p>Onboarding is a pivotal stage in the customer journey and can make or break your business. In a regulated industry, like financial services or gambling, the balance between offering a seamless yet safe and secure onboarding experience has never been more important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The importance of speed and simplicity in the onboarding process was emphasised by the survey responses, with regulatory requirements seen as less of a barrier (31%) to completion than a complex and lengthy registration experience (55%).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Document submission proved to be the biggest challenge for global players (51%), with both ID document submission and personal financial information submission (51%) proving to be an obstacle to the completion of onboarding.</p>



 What do operators really think about financial risk checks? 



<p>No topic has been more polarizing to the UK’s gambling industry than the proposed financial risk checks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As no operator yet has experience of working within the scope of these checks, the survey posed two questions: what they expected the impact of such checks would be on the UK market and what effect they would have on the wider international industry. Most compliance professionals (66%) expressed concerns that the move would lead to lower sign-ups for licensed operators, but would, in turn, strengthen the black market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is worth noting that some of the answers were nuanced and several respondents were open to the idea that an affordability check could have some positives for the industry such as improving trust levels among players, reducing fraud and helping to create a level playing field for smaller operators.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>As part of our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/02/announcing-microsoft-secure-future-initiative-to-advance-security-engineering/">Secure Future Initiative, we announced </a><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies</a> in November 2023. These policies are designed to help you secure your organization's resources and data based on your usage patterns, risk factors, and existing policy configuration, all while minimizing your effort. Our top recommendation for improving your identity secure posture is enabling multifactor authentication (MFA), which <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/security-insider/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2023">reduces the risk of compromise by 99.2%</a>. This is why our first three policies are all related to MFA for different scenarios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since we announced Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies, we’ve rolled out these policies to more than 500,000 tenants in report-only mode. In this mode, the policies don’t impact access but log the results of policy evaluation. This allows administrators to assess the impact before enforcing these policies. Thanks to proactive actions taken by administrators to enable or customize these policies, over 900,000 users are now protected with MFA. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve been actively listening to your feedback. Customers shared that Microsoft-managed policies impact the number of Conditional Access policies that organizations can create. We’ve addressed this by making a significant change: Microsoft-managed policies will no longer count towards the Conditional Access policy limit. Another adjustment relates to existing Conditional Access policies. If you already have a policy in the “On” state that meets or exceeds the requirements set by the Microsoft-managed policy, the latter will not be automatically enforced in your tenant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initially, we communicated that these policies would be automatically enabled 90 days after creation. However, based on customer feedback, we recognize that some customers need additional time to prepare for these policies to be enforced. As a result, we have extended the time frame before enforcing the policies for this initial set of policies. For these three policies, you will have more than 90 days to review and customize (or disable) your Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies before they are automatically enforced. Rest assured, you’ll receive an email and a <a href="https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?#/MessageCenter">Message Center</a> notification providing a 28-day advance notification before the policies are enforced in your tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call to Action</p>
 
 Review these policies in the <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_ConditionalAccess/ConditionalAccessBlade/~/Policies/fromNav/Identity">Conditional Access policies blade</a>.  
 Add customizations such as excluding <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-policy-common?tabs=secure-foundation#user-exclusions">emergency accounts and service accounts</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>
<p> </p>
 
 Once ready, the policies can be moved to the ON state.<br>  
 
<p>For additional customization needs, you can duplicate these policies and make further adjustments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Earlier in February, SpruceID participated in Utah’s Outdoor Recreation Day on the Hill, a public event held in Salt Lake City at the Utah State Capitol. This yearly event celebrates Utah’s outdoor recreation opportunities and contributions to the state’s economy, health, and quality of life. SpruceID joined the Department of Natural Resources at a booth during the event to highlight our State of Utah pilot program for digital credentials, in partnership with the Division of Technology Services and the Department of Natural Resources.</p><p>The objective of the pilot program is to demonstrate the feasibility of verifiable digital credentials for state-issued credentials across various use cases, such as off-highway vehicle education course certificates. The pilot aims to pioneer a privacy-first digital credentialing program that empowers residents to take control of their online data and seamlessly integrate with the government’s existing infrastructure while ensuring a secure, efficient, and user-friendly experience.</p><p>The booth at the Outdoor Recreation Day on the Hill provided us with a platform to connect with policymakers, legislators, and the general public. We took the opportunity to demonstrate the digital credential experience for both holders and verifiers while educating attendees about the pilot program for digital credentials in Utah.&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s world, technology has transformed nearly every aspect of our lives, from paying bills and traveling to accessing healthcare and public benefits. This shift to digital services has highlighted the need for innovative government leadership in digital identity and credentialing solutions. Traditional paper or plastic credentials have increasingly shown limitations leading to privacy concerns, susceptibility to fraud, and poor user experiences.</p><p>As the pilot becomes publicly available, participants can download a digital credential for their OHV education course certificate to store on their mobile device and take it whenever they are on the trails. Whether in a highly trafficked area or remote location without cell service, the holder can access their permit and present it as a QR code for the verifier to scan in just a few taps. The verification checks the credential validity and that it has a digital signature by the Utah DNR without pinging back to the Utah servers. This means that verifications do not enable additional tracking or a new centralized database. Not only is this a more convenient and secure option for users, but it also saves significant time filling out and processing paperwork.</p> Looking Ahead <p>Our participation in Utah’s Outdoor Recreation Day on the Hill was an opportunity to showcase the pilot program for digital verifiable credentials and a pivotal moment to engage with the Utah community and gather invaluable feedback. </p><p>This event demonstrated the program's potential impact on improving the efficiency, security, and privacy of state-issued credentials. We are grateful for the chance to contribute to Utah’s outdoor recreation community and look forward to the journey ahead as we work towards a more connected, secure, and digitally empowered society.</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — March 5th to March&nbsp;18th <p>Welcome to the Veriscope Regulatory Recap! In our latest edition, we delve into sweeping crypto regulatory updates worldwide, from Europe’s fresh stablecoin standards to the UK’s latest crypto compliance proposals, from Indonesia’s tech-forward finance guidelines to Nigeria’s firm stance on crypto operations within its borders. Let’s unpack the latest moves shaping the digital asset&nbsp;world.</p> Global Crypto Regulatory Shifts <p>The global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is undergoing significant transformations, driven by a common goal among nations to align digital asset markets with investor protection, financial stability, and anti-money laundering standards.</p><p>In Europe, the European Banking Authority (EBA) is focusing on new rules for stablecoins, which are digital currencies designed to have a stable value. These rules are part of a larger set of regulations known as&nbsp;MiCA.</p><p>Additionally, the UK treasury has proposed changes that could require stricter observation of crypto businesses to prevent money laundering. This means crypto companies might soon need to follow the same rules as traditional financial companies.</p><p>Over in Asia, Indonesia’s Financial Services Authority (OJK) is setting guidelines for using new technology in finance, including crypto, starting in 2025. This is to ensure that innovations are safe for users and the&nbsp;market.</p><p>In Africa, Nigeria’s Securities Regulator is making it mandatory for crypto businesses to set up in the country if they want to operate there. They’re also raising the fees these companies need to pay. This move aims to give the Nigerian government more control over crypto activities.</p> EU Advances Crypto Regulation with New EBA Stablecoin Draft <p>The European Union is making significant progress in clarifying crypto regulations as the European Banking Authority (EBA) unveils draft requirements for stablecoins under the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework.</p><p>This move, aimed at asset reference tokens (ARTs) capable of referencing a variety of currencies and assets, signifies a crucial step towards comprehensive crypto market regulation.</p><p>The potential impact on the crypto ecosystem is twofold. Positively, clearer regulations could enhance market confidence, attract more institutional investment, and foster a safer trading environment. Conversely, the stringent requirements might impose significant compliance costs, particularly affecting smaller entities, and potentially stifling innovation within the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>As the EU navigates the complex balance between innovation and regulation, the global crypto community watches closely, anticipating the ripple effects of these regulatory advancements.</p> UK Treasury Proposes Regulatory Refinement for Crypto&nbsp;Assets <p>The UK treasury’s latest consultation paper seeks to refine money laundering regulations, which will impact the crypto asset sector’s regulatory framework. The proposed changes, which build on the review of 2017’s Money Laundering Regulations (MLRs), indicate a shift towards integrating crypto assets more comprehensively within the UK’s financial regulatory system.</p><p>One of the pivotal changes includes bringing crypto asset service providers under the broader umbrella of the Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) supervision, eliminating the need for separate MLRs authorization. This move is set to extend the FCA’s oversight to new crypto-related activities, aligning MLRs requirements more closely with the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSMA) standards.</p><p>The impact on the crypto ecosystem could be profound. Although, these revisions promise to streamline the regulatory process, potentially making the UK a more attractive hub for crypto businesses by clarifying compliance pathways, there is downside to it as well. After all, the increased FCA oversight could introduce more stringent control and operational challenges for crypto firms, especially smaller ones struggling with the nuances of expanded regulatory requirements.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://issuu.com/shyftnetwork/docs/global_crypto_regulatory_outlook_2024_-_shyft_netw#google_vignette">The Visual Guide on Global Crypto Regulatory Outlook&nbsp;2024</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-estonia">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in&nbsp;Estonia</a></p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p></p> 
<p>When it comes to cyberattacks, March has come in like a lion for Microsoft. Last week, Microsoft said in an SEC filing that that information stolen in a hack of senior leaders’ email accounts is now being used to “gain or attempt to gain access” to company source code repositories and other internal systems. The fallout remains unknown. Just a few days earlier, threat researchers at Proofpoint <a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/ta577s-unusual-attack-chain-leads-ntlm-data-theft">reported a phishing campaign</a> by the well-known threat group TA577 that targets Windows NT LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication information. Attackers sent thousands of tailored emails designed to steal employees' NTLM “hashes” (or challenge/response values) from hundreds of organizations around the globe. These “hashes” can be cracked with far-reaching consequences, depending on an organization’s security measures.</p>  
 Why Is NTLM Authentication Vulnerable  
<p>A still widely used protocol in Windows environments, NTLM provides a natively implemented and easy to use method for authenticating into applications on enterprise servers. At more than thirty years old, it’s also a perennial attack target.</p> 
<p>Weaker cryptographic algorithms, unsalted password hashes stored on the client and server / domain controller, and a lack of server authentication &nbsp;by default, leave the NTLM protocol susceptible to a variety of attacks, either in the first NTLMv1 or the newer NTLMv2 version. These include interception, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle</a>, relay and pass-the-hash attacks, as well as straightforward brute force and password cracking — eight-character NTLM password hashes can be brute-forced using <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-a-rainbow-table-attack">rainbow tables</a> and other techniques within three minutes. NTLM does not support modern authentication methods like biometrics, multi-factor authentication, or phishing-resistant FIDO keys.</p> 
 What’s Different About the TA577 NTLM Authentication Campaign?  
<p>The abuse of the NTLM protocol for gathering victim’s information and potentially stealing NTLM challenge/response material is not a new technique, and has been observed in the past in different ways. One notable example was the <a href="https://blog.lumen.com/newly-discovered-watering-hole-attack-targets-ukrainian-canadian-organizations/">compromise of the San Francisco airport website</a> and several other organizations across the world, where threat actors used the compromised sites to serve malicious code that triggered SMB connections to attacker-controlled servers.</p> 
<p>The newest campaign takes a new twist by using phishing thread-jacking techniques to deliver zipped HTML attachments customized for each individual target.</p> 
 How the Attack Works  
<p>The malicious emails appear to be replies to a legitimate message thread. Upon opening, the HTML file triggers a meta refresh attempt to connect to a text file set up by the attacker on a rogue Server Message Block (SMB) server. The attacker-controlled server can then steal the NTLM authentication values when the protocol performs its standard challenge/response exchange. Those values change according to the version of the protocol, and whether it is a NTLMv1 or NTLMv2 exchange, but consist of a nonce (a random value of a single use) that’s encrypted using the user’ passwords as the key.</p> 
<p>A very common technique used to make it easier to then crack the obtained challenge/response values, is to leverage a well known and fixed server challenge. The protocol requires the server to include a challenge, consisting of a 16-byte random number, on every connection. By making the server challenge a fixed one, it’s possible to use pre-calculated hash tables and reduce the time and processing required to crack the user’s passwords.</p> 
<p>The following diagram shows the steps of the attack:</p> 
 NTLM Phishing  
<p></p> 
 Consequences of a Successful NTLM Attack  
<p>Stolen NTLM challenge/response values can be used to obtain victim’s credentials and hijack accounts, access sensitive information and potentially elevate privileges. Attackers can then move laterally within the network and compromise additional systems in the case they’ve already obtained a foothold into the victim’s organization network.</p> 
 How HYPR Protects Against the TA577 NTLM Attacks  
<p>Microsoft has long provided mitigations and mechanisms to disable the use of the NTLM protocol, including migrating to more secure replacements like Kerberos. However, organizations have been slow to implement these recommendations due to the complexity and dependency of multiple products and legacy systems on these protocols.</p> 
<p>When the legacy NTLM authentication protocols cannot be disabled and are still part of the organization’s environment, the resistance to NTLM attacks comes from the strength of the user’s passwords.&nbsp;In these environments, leveraging HYPR’s passwordless approach with certificate-based authentication allows organizations to enforce smart-card usage for passwordless, and remove the dependency of users having to login with their passwords. This provides opportunities to implement mitigation strategies to some of the NTLM weaknesses, such as the use of IT or programmatically-managed strong passwords.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>HYPR reduces the risk to organizations from attacks on NTLM authentication by TA577 and other threat actors. HYPR’s phishing-resistant <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/enterprise-passkeys">Enterprise Passkeys</a> were built to protect Microsoft Entra ID environments from credential-based attacks while making login easier for users. <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/press-releases/hypr-leads-passwordless-revolution-with-launch-of-microsoft-approved-enterprise-passkeys">Microsoft approved and validated</a>, Enterprise Passkeys use highly secure FIDO2 authentication protocols instead of passwords or other types of shared secrets. With HYPR in place, there is no password for an attacker to steal.</p> 
 Conclusion  
<p>As the NTLM authentication protocol relies on passwords, those — indeed all passwords — are a prime target for bad actors. It’s much easier to login with valid credentials than to find a new vulnerability to exploit. Moreover, attackers constantly come up with inventive ways to breach security controls. Organizations need to eliminate the source of insecurity. As a Microsoft partner and member of MISA, HYPR integrates tightly with Microsoft environments and products. Working seamlessly with Microsoft Entra ID, the HYPR Identity Assurance platform combines passkey-based authentication with continuous risk monitoring and automated identity verification to provide the highest level of identity security.</p>

  <p>The introduction of cross-tenant access settings for Microsoft Entra External ID marked a pivotal shift in how organizations manage security and collaboration across different tenants. This blog post dives into the essence of these settings, focusing on their significance for secure B2B collaboration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three key areas of focus, include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 The critical aspect of trusting multifactor authentication (MFA) from business collaborators, including the exploration into the balance between maintaining high security standards and ensuring a seamless user experience for B2B guest users, plus highlighting a perspective to simplify authentication processes and reduce administrative burdens.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Offering a closer look at the cross-tenant access settings and how these settings enable more granular control over cross-tenant collaborations. Real-world use cases illustrate the application of these policies in managing and restricting access to ensure security without hindering productivity and cooperation.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Insights into leveraging Microsoft Entra cross-tenant access policies for improved security and collaboration and to ensure a smooth user experience.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Trust MFA from business collaborators (B2B collaboration) by default&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In today's interconnected digital landscape, organizations are increasingly embracing B2B collaboration to streamline workflows and facilitate cooperation with external partners. As part of this collaborative approach, many businesses routinely create guest user accounts within their Microsoft Entra tenants and grant trusted partners access to their resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enhance security, many have already extended the requirement for MFA to B2B guest users. This, however, requires external users in cross-tenant access scenarios to register an additional authentication method in the foreign tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The need for B2B guest users to register for an additional MFA method in the resource tenant basically increases the account security, but at the same time it adds layers of complexity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 User experience disruption in a B2B collaboration scenario&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B2B guest users who have already implemented MFA in their home tenant and have become accustomed to the convenience of advanced MFA methods like Windows Hello for Business, encounter disruptions when attempting to access the resource tenant. Even if users have already provided strong authentication in their home tenant, they will still be prompted for authentication again in the resource tenant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: MFA prompt for B2B guest user who access protected resource in foreign tenant</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Administrative overhead for IT and users&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both the guest user and the resource tenant's IT team face additional administrative tasks. For the guest user, navigating a new MFA setup and maintaining an additional MFA registration can be annoying. For the tenant administrator and the support team, managing these additional MFA registrations can increase overhead significantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In cases where a guest user loses access to their device or does not have a backup for a new device, regaining access to their account involves additional administrative tasks for both the guest user and the resource tenant's IT team. The guest user may need to perform a new MFA setup, while the tenant support team need to manage the additional MFA registrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you wondering why guest users must register an additional authentication method per resource tenant when they already have one in their home tenant? Well, let's talk about the trust settings in cross-tenant access settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Simplifying the authentication process&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A more efficient approach to managing MFA in cross-tenant B2B collaborations is to trust the MFA from a guest's home tenant. Doing so eliminates the need for additional MFA registration and maintenance in the resource tenant. This means that the user can continue to use his usual strong authentication method that he uses in his home tenant and does not have to register another method in the resource tenant. This is a considerable relief for the user and the support team of the resource tenant no longer has to deal with the MFA registrations of the guests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MFA default trust settings are configured in the Microsoft Entra admin center (<a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/">https://entra.microsoft.com</a>). In the default configuration, a Microsoft Entra ID tenant does not trust any incoming MFA from other tenants. To change the behavior, the inbound defaults must be edited. The following screenshots provide a walkthrough and show the desired configuration. The "Trust multifactor authentication from Microsoft Entra tenants" setting is disabled by default and must be enabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Cross-tenant access settings in Microsoft Entra admin center</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 3: Cross-tenant access settings - Default Trust settings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This simple configuration enables B2B guest users to use their existing MFA in their home tenant to satisfy existing MFA requirements in the resource tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once configured, B2B guest users can use additional authentication methods that have a higher authentication strength than MFA methods that are only available in a foreign resource tenant. This is a very important advantage because this configuration also enables the use of phishing-resistant authentication methods for B2B collaboration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 4: Comparison of the authentication methods available in the home tenant and a resource tenant</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information about available authentication methods, refer to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-strength-external-users">Microsoft Entra documentation about authentication strengths for external users.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this configuration is designed to enhance the user experience and ease the administrative efforts, it can inadvertently create security risks. For instance, guest users might opt for simpler, less secure authentication methods in their home tenant compared to the authentication methods typically used in the resource tenant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To avoid these risks, the cross-tenant access trust settings work seamlessly with Conditional Access and authentication strengths. Plus, with MFA trust, guest users can use the same phishing-resistant authentication methods used in their home tenant like Windows Hello for Business, FIDO2 keys, and certificate-based authentication to get access to the resource tenant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This key advantage can be used to increase the login security of guest users. When the default trust settings are adjusted, the Conditional Access policies and authentication strengths should be reviewed at the same time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We explored the benefits of using MFA trust to leverage the same strong authentication methods used by guest users in their home tenant to improve security, usability and efficiency. In the next chapter, we will look at how tenant administrators can control outbound collaboration settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Outbound access restrictions&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Microsoft Entra cross-tenant access settings, organizations can manage their collaboration with other Microsoft Entra organizations. These settings provide more granular control over access, allowing you to manage how you collaborate with external organizations. In this section, we will take a closer look at the outbound settings feature and its capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Tenant restrictions vs. inbound and outbound settings&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant restrictions and cross-tenant access settings are two powerful tools that can help you control access to your organization’s resources. While they are often configured together, it’s important to understand that they operate separately from one another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/tenant-restrictions-v2#tenant-restrictions-vs-inbound-and-outbound-settings">Microsoft Learn</a> article:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Although tenant restrictions are configured along with your cross-tenant access settings, they operate separately from inbound and outbound access settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cross-tenant access settings give you control when users sign in with an account from your organization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By contrast, tenant restrictions give you control when users are using an external account.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of cross-tenant access settings this way:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Inbound settings control external account access to your internal apps.&nbsp; 
 Outbound settings control internal account access to external apps.&nbsp; 
 Tenant restrictions control external account access to external apps.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To summarize, tenant restrictions allow you to create a policy to control access to external apps when users sign in with an external account from your networks or devices while the inbound and outbound access settings focus on guests accounts in your tenant or guest accounts in resource tenants (what your users is accessing and where).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this all cleared up let’s focus on using an outbound access setting and a real-world application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Real-world use case&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at a real-world use case to leverage the outbound settings control. The Contoso organization is used in the following use case:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contoso would like to implement more detailed controls with B2B business collaborators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Contoso would like to only collaborate with specific organizations. This includes the ability to securely add or remove partner organizations as the need arises.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Additionally, Contoso would need the ability to restrict applications that can be accessed in any partner resource tenant along with the ability to restrict and control user access to partner resource tenants.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Setup and configuration&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To set up the outbound restriction for the needed use case, we will need to configure the outbound defaults. This essentially will block all outbound collaboration. Note that this can be scoped to either include all users, selected users or all or selected external applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>From within the Microsoft Entra Admin center, navigate to the External Identities menu and select the cross-tenant access setting feature. From here select the default settings config followed by edit outbound defaults.&nbsp; Select Block access followed by the applies to option. We can either select a subset of users or apply this to all users. In this example all users are blocked and all external applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 5: Outbound defaults</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 &nbsp; 
<p>Figure 6: Outbound block access</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attempting any access in a resource tenant will result in the below notification. This is expected since the tenant wide outbound access default setting is in place explicitly blocking any resource tenant level access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 7: Resource tenant blocked</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By looking at the user sign-in logs, we can establish the same conclusion via the failure reasoned and the resource tenant accessed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 8: Sign-in logs</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enable collaboration when the outbound access default setting is applied, a tenant ID or domain name of a resource tenant or origin must be included in the cross-tenant access settings of Microsoft Entra. In the example below, the tenant of Contoso’s partner organization “Wingtip Toys” is added and the outbound access configuration setup to allow collaboration with selected Contoso users. In this case, the users with group membership to “External-TR-ContosoAccess” will be allowed access to selected application as per figure 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, a Privileged Access Group (PAG) can be used allowing no permeant standing access. Access must be requested via Privileged Identity Management (PIM). The PIM activation process can be set up to require an approver, MFA or additional authentication context via Conditional Access. E.g. step-up authentication or location-based policy restrictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 9: Outbound access settings users and groups</p>
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 10: Outbound access settings external applications</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon configuring the needed outbound access settings any user that is part of the selected user or group outbound configuration setting will be allowed access to the selected external applications. In the below example we can see the demo user accessed a selected external application as per previous configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 11: sign-in log successful</p>
 &nbsp; 
 &nbsp; 
<p></p>
<p>With cross-tenant access and outbound access settings, customers can granularly restrict and control collaboration with external resource tenants. This enables more control over what your internal accounts can access externally and where.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A word of caution: Before enabling, it’s important to understand this is a tenant wide configuration and you will need to understand and evaluate your organizations collaboration needs and scope the outbound access setting and allowed organizations accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Summary&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this blog post, we explored how to use cross-tenant access and outbound access settings in Microsoft Entra to manage and secure external collaboration. Cross-tenant access allows you to share your resources with users from other tenants, while outbound access settings and tenant restrictions let you control which external tenants your users can access. You can configure both features at the tenant level and specify the allowed or blocked organizations according to your business needs. Additionally, we have discussed how to use Default MFA Trust to use existing, strong authentication methods from foreign tenants in cross-tenant access scenarios and improve your security posture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next blog, we will look more closely at tenant restrictions and authentication strengths and contexts. Keep following this blog series, post your feedback, and we hope you join us again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This blog is the second in a series explaining how Mydex’s personal data infrastructure works. It explains how our platforms help deliver our mission of empowering individuals with their own data, enabling them to use this data to manage their lives better and assert their human rights in practical ways on a daily&nbsp;basis.</p><p>Personal data stores (PDSs) equip individuals with the means of collecting, holding and using their own data for their own purposes, under their own control, independently of the organisations that collect data about them. Our <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/what-is-a-personal-data-store-a583f7ef9be3">last blog</a> on PDSs themselves described how we have implemented this core functionality so that it can operate at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>But PDSs have limited functionality if operating just by themselves. Sure, they provide a secure digital ‘filing cabinet’ for your data, but this doesn’t include processes for putting data into this filing cabinet, taking data out of it, or sharing it with others when&nbsp;needed.</p><p>This is where the real day-to-day usefulness of the PDS kicks in. There are occasions when simply being able to look our own data up, or to use our own means of ‘crunching’ this data, helps us manage our lives better. But usually we need the help of domain experts — specialist service providers.</p><p>There are countless such service providers out there offering different ways of helping us manage our different ‘life departments’ (e.g. money, home, health, travel, work, leisure activities and so on). But they all need to access at least some personal data in order to configure what they do to our particular needs and circumstances. That’s where data sharing comes in. This is the job of our second platform: our Personal Data eXchange&nbsp;(PDX).</p> The workhorse at&nbsp;work <p>The PDX is the real workhorse of our infrastructure. It’s where stuff happens (as opposed to the PDS where our personal data is stored statically).</p><p>Most of this work is done via secure APIs or ‘Application Program Interfaces’. An API is a set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that software programmers can use for one software system to communicate or interact with another software system in a safe, automated way. APIs allow computers to ‘talk’ to each other following a set of pre-agreed rules.</p><p>Using our APIs, service providers can connect their systems to an individual’s PDS, enabling them (and the individual) to share and receive data, potentially in an ongoing, automated manner according to predefined rules. Each such request or communication is uniquely encrypted in such a manner that it can only be decrypted in the specific context of the relationship between the Mydex Member and the service provider in question.</p><p>Practically speaking, this involves lots of to-ing and fro-ing between the individual’s PDS and the service provider’s systems, <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/connection-api/overview.html">as shown by this page</a> on our developer documentation website. These handshakes between computer systems are built into how our infrastructure works and are designed to carry on working in an automated way, always according to the data sharing agreements terms defined by the service provider and approved by the individual. In other words, always under the control of the individual.</p><p>To ordinary mortals who are not software developers, the details can look daunting. Take a look at these <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/connection-api/connection-api-details.html">guidelines for developers</a> as an example. But for individuals using their PDS all this activity takes place under the hood. All that matters for the Mydex Member is that the right data can be moved in or out at the right times, safely, securely and easily. The result is a bit like a direct debit or automated payment mechanism like a salary payment: once it has been set up it keeps on running, automatically, until the person who set it up decides to change (or stop)&nbsp;it.</p><p>As part of what we do, we provide developers with all sorts of support systems and advice to help them deal with all the necessary technicalities. You can see an <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/data-schema/developer-helpers.html">example&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>The PDX is available 24hrs a day and 365 days a year. It is ‘always on’ and always available. It creates a safe, secure cloud of connectivity between people and their service providers which is fully GDPR compliant.</p> Data Sharing Agreements <p>At the heart of this process is our Data Sharing Agreements.</p><p>In today’s system, consent has become a stick to beat individuals with. Each organisation writes their own privacy policy and terms and conditions in their own, different way, and corporate lawyers sometimes craft the wordings of these documents to be as confusing and open-ended as possible. This can make it as hard for people to protect themselves from privacy invasions and data landgrabs. Many people give up even&nbsp;trying.</p><p>Our Data Sharing Agreements are designed to rectify this situation.</p><p>First off, as part of subscribing to the platform, service providers have to sign up to a Trust Framework. You can see its core principles of citizen data empowerment <a href="https://mydex.org/about-us/mydex-charter/">here</a>.</p><p>Data Sharing Agreements are written in a standard, easy-to-understand format. (You can see a <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/data-sharing-agreement.html">template of an agreement here</a>.) They focus on specifics: exactly what data is needed to do what, over what time period. The organisation creates the data sharing agreement, which is designed to be GDPR compliant, and makes their GDPR declarations as part of setting up their connection to the Mydex PDX API platform. As part of their terms for subscribers they acknowledge their legal commitment and liability if they fail to keep their side of the contract.</p><p>For organisations wanting to game current consent systems, our Data Sharing Agreements represent a horrifying prospect. But for bona fide service providers it’s actually a bonus. It cuts costs and complexity, creates added trust and assurance, and ensures they are GDPR compliant by default. It creates a value-releasing win-win.</p><p>The PDX uses these Data Sharing Agreements to operate. Once the individual approves the Data Sharing Agreement (DSA), the PDX notifies the subscriber that the DSA is active and they can commence delivery and collection. The PDX enforces the scope of the DSA — and only that scope. If an organisation seeks to access any data outside the terms of the DSA, the PDX blocks it. It will only allow transactions that are compliant with the DSA; that constitute a valid request. Thus, once the DSA has been set up, it operates continuously and automatically on behalf of the&nbsp;member.</p><p>Subscribers can create multiple connections and data sharing agreements to join the dots between their own systems. The system allows for fine tuning of the agreements to reflect service evolution and changing requirements safely, easily and in a fully auditable manner. Support services include as examples notifications of changes or additions to a Member’s PDS, or supporting batch data delivery for high volume data payloads (such as ‘smart’ meter electricity consumption data which can be generated every thirty seconds every day of the&nbsp;week).</p> Interoperability and data&nbsp;sharing <p>Working with the PDS, the PDX is an interoperability engine. Different organisations use different software systems using different standards and different formats. That’s not going to change any time&nbsp;soon.</p><p>This is one of our core challenges — and source of added value. Our infrastructure allows any service provider to interact with the member’s PDS using whatever software, standards and formats they currently use, and to access data shared by the individual that may have been originated elsewhere, using completely different software systems, standards and formats. We work as a translation service between these standards. This activity is built into how the infrastructure works.</p><p>Even so, one of the biggest potential benefits of our infrastructure is the way it enables data sharing between organisations via the individual who the data relates to. There are a very large number of scenarios across all industries where no one, single, service provider provides everything an individual needs to solve a problem or get a task done. That leaves individuals having to integrate the different inputs of different service providers to create an integrated whole.</p><p>Recognising this, often organisations try to set up direct ways of sharing data about the individual i.e. with each other. This quickly becomes nightmarishly complex, ethically and operationally risky, and costly. So much so that even where the need is great, often it still ends up not happening or happening slowly, badly and at great cost. Our Personal Data eXchange and PDSs are designed to eradicate this complexity, cost and&nbsp;risk.</p> Where the real value&nbsp;lies <p>One important point about this is that it’s all about data logistics. ‘Data logistics’. That’s not something that most people think about day to day. But it is immensely — pivotally — important for the provision of efficient, effective services. It is also the subject of many unhelpful misconceptions about where the value of personal data&nbsp;lies.</p><p>The way many people talk, you could be forgiven for thinking that data becomes valuable only when it is assembled in a massive database and when some clever algorithm or piece of AI gets to work on it, identifying patterns, correlations and trends within it, and so on. Data analytics in other&nbsp;words.</p><p>In lots of conversations this is treated as the be all and end all. But it isn’t. Not by a long shot. For real life services to work efficiently exactly the opposite is needed. Whatever the service is — planning and delivering a cancer intervention, say, or deciding on a mortgage or benefit application — what the service provider needs is access to exactly the right, reliable, relevant data at the right time. No more and no less. This is not about ‘the more data the better’. You don’t need a person’s inside leg measurement to decide on that mortgage application. It is all about the right data, and only the right data. It is highly focused and specific.</p><p>Our PDX infrastructure is modular and flexible, its potential data points infinitely configurable. It provides the data logistics infrastructure that every service provider (and every individual) needs to make sure that exactly the right data flows to and from the right people at the right times for every possible service relating to that individual.</p> Verified Attributes <p>A key part of all this is the ability to share what we call ‘verified attributes’.</p><p>For a service provider to be able to efficiently use data that has been shared by an individual, they have to be able to rely on it. To trust it. There’s no point in the person sharing the data only for the service provider to have to stop what they are doing to go and check to see if it is accurate or&nbsp;true.</p><p>What we all need is a system by which service providers can be confident in the reliability of the data they are receiving — for trust to be able to travel with the data. The PDX provides systems that enable this to happen. ‘Metadata’ — data about the data — lies at the heart of these&nbsp;systems.</p><p>When sharing any data, the PDX also shares additional data about the data, for example, the time and date of its origination, who originated it, when it was last updated, and so on. Thus, for example, if the data is about an educational qualification, it’s not just the individual claiming to have passed the exam. They could be lying. It includes data from the educational establishment concerned, verifying that the individual has passed their exam and when they did&nbsp;so.</p><p>Depending on the type of data concerned, these levels of verification can vary. If an individual is merely expressing a preference e.g. “I like it pink”, the only piece of relevant metadata is the time and date of them saying so. If it’s a person claiming to be a qualified doctor, or that they are entitled to a certain benefit or payment, much more metadata is required, <a href="https://dev.mydex.org/connection-api/verified-attributes.html">as explained here</a>. But the way our PDX infrastructure is designed, it doesn’t matter. It is designed to send all the appropriate, relevant metadata about the data routinely, as a matter of&nbsp;course.</p> Ongoing development <p>Providing a service like this is a bit like painting the Forth Bridge. There is always more we can do — and we have a roadmap for doing so. Some of the things included in this roadmap are Personal Data Adaptors that enable Members to invoke new connections themselves; extended interoperability and transformation of inbound and outbound payloads to accept and deliver payloads in the required format; dynamically configurable templates to enable subscribers to draw maps that correlate data held in the member’s Personal Data Store and their own internal systems; and support for ‘dynamic consent’ so that Data Sharing Agreements can be extended for one-time or defined-time periods to support specific transactions.</p><p>But behind these ongoing developments lie some very simple, general rules of thumb: make once, use many times and ‘FERC elimination’ — in whatever we do, the goal is to reduce or eliminate all possible Friction, Effort, Risk and Cost while always keeping individuals in control of their&nbsp;data.</p> Conclusion <p>We started this series on Mydex CIC’s personal data infrastructure by describing it as a sort of plumbing system. Personal Data Stores act as the ‘tank’ holding the data, with the Personal Data eXchange (PDX) acting as the pipes via which data flows in and out. Like a motor car’s engine, both those core infrastructure constituents work mainly under the hood. Largely invisible, and hardly ever directly experienced by individuals using their PDSs. The direct Member experience — the equivalent of the taps and valves via which data flows are managed — comes from what we call the experience layer. That is the subject of our next&nbsp;blog.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/personal-data-stores-and-data-sharing-1f59f5381c85">Personal Data Stores and Data Sharing</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>This is the transcript to my first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vMmZNwOsIs">YouTube explainer video</a> on how tracking and authentication use the same mechanisms to meet their goals, and how browsers can’t tell the difference. Likes and subscriptions are always welcome!</p>



 Introduction 



<p>Welcome to The Digital Cow Network! My name is Heather Flanagan, principal at Spherical Cow Consulting. Let’s talk about how individuals are tracked as they surf the web.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’ve all know we are tracked as we surf the web. Sometimes, it’s to show us target advertisements to get us to spend more money. More nefariously, it influences our political leanings or generally sows societal chaos. Why isn’t there more control to prevent this from happening? Shouldn’t there be something that protects all web users, from the least tech-savvy to the most informed individuals? Yes, but it’s not that simple. The underlying mechanisms that trackers use are the same tools used to support third-party logging into a website, also known as federated authentication.</p>



<p>And you know what? Browsers can’t tell the difference when mechanisms used for tracking or when they are used for logging in. They are technically indistinguishable. This makes changing or removing those features more complicated than you’d think.</p>



 The Dilemma of Browser Tracking  



<p>What are these mysterious mechanisms, and why are they used when people log in to a website if they are also part of an invasion of privacy? Time for a quick history lesson!</p>



<p>The Internet came out of a research project. Everyone knew everyone else, or at least they knew the people online had to be a part of a very small community in order to use this new thing. The web came much later, but it still had that research and exploratory mindset, that nearly green field drive that suggested building little widgets that people could turn into anything they could imagine was the path towards innovation. The Internet, and therefore the web, was built on something that didn’t have robust, automatable trust mechanisms built in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of these innovations was the concept of a piece of data that would allow developers to keep information local to a browser so each web page didn’t have to ask for the same information over and over again, something called saving state. It also encouraged the use of IP addresses, once upon a time the unique address for each computer on the network, as a way to indicate whether an individual (the only one probably using that computer) to access something remotely. It encouraged a lot of things and people through of all sorts of ways to use these building blocks of the web to do new things, from supporting third-party accounts when logging in to targeting advertisements to individuals.</p>



<p>That’s enough history. Let’s dive into the mechanics. From third-party cookies to IP addresses and browser fingerprinting, these tools are essential for a smooth online experience but can also be used for tracking. Understanding these mechanisms is key to navigating the digital landscape.</p>



 Segment 3: Third-Party Cookies and Privacy  



<p>HTTP cookies (also called web cookies, Internet cookies, browser cookies, or simply cookies) are small blocks of information created by a website and placed on an individual’s computer or other device by their web browser. The idea behind doing this was to make it so people didn’t have to share information every time they went to a new page. Imagine if you had to log in Every. Single. Time. you went to a new web page owned by the same company. It’s crazy talk! Being able to “maintain state” from one page to the next is great for the user experience (UX).</p>



<p>Here’s where it gets murky. There is more than one kind of cookie, and for the sake of this explainer, we’re going to talk about first-party and third-party cookies. First-party cookies are a way for a single domain to maintain state across all the web pages in its domain. It’s definitely a desirable thing for a clean UX. These cookies are ONLY accessible by the domain that created them. No other domain can read what’s in that cookie.</p>



<p>Then there are third-party cookies. These cookies are accessible to any website at any domain. And sometimes that’s fine. Let’s look at CNN. The company CNN owns cnn.com, headlinenews.com, cnnradionet.com, money.com, and probably several others. The parent company wants visitors to have a consistent experience, which means leaving bits of data for their various domains to read. They want all their services to look and act like you (probably) want them to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Third-party cookies are also used so that when you tell a website you want to log out, it knows what to log you out of. That’s a big security feature right there and something that needs to be adapted when browsers no longer support third-party cookies. Though, to be honest, implementing this properly is really hard and many sites have already given up on the idea of a secure, global logout.</p>



 Segment 4: The Complexities of Browser Fingerprints and IP Addresses  



 IP Addresses 



<p>Most people don’t have to think about a computer’s numeric address. That said, computers communicate via numbers, and both your devices (your phone, tablet, and desktop) and the computers hosting the websites you’re visiting all have these addresses. They are called IP addresses and are a fundamental necessity to ensuring Internet traffic knows where to go.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once upon a time, these addresses were tightly tied to specific computers that didn’t move around. There were also enough of these addresses for all the computers on the Internet. And with that in mind, it made sense to say, “I know who is at this IP address. That address can access my computer.” While the basic assumptions about IP addresses are no longer always accurate, there’s still something to them. Some websites still create access policies based on what IP addresses are allowed. It’s a very smooth UX; the individual doesn’t have to do a thing. It just works.</p>



<p>When you go to a website, one of the things that happens is that the visit is recorded in a log. Logs are necessary to troubleshoot problems. They are also a way to understand who and what is visiting a website. And if that data is shared behind the scenes, a single IP address can be followed like you can follow footprints in the snow.</p>



 Browser Fingerprints 



<p>When you install a web browser, you probably add plug-ins, add-ons, your favorite fonts, your preferred settings, and so on. Here’s a fun fact: if you have done those things, you might have an impressively unique “fingerprint” that distinguishes your browser from all others.</p>



<p>There are a few websites that will let you check this out. For example, <a href="https://amiunique.org/">https://amiunique.org/</a> and <a href="https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/">https://coveryourtracks.eff.org/</a> will let you see just how unique your browser setup is when compared to others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you visit a website, it often asks your browser about all its settings to offer you the best UX. It might have a slightly different way of presenting information if you’re using Chrome or Firefox. It might pop up a sadness window if you’ve blocked ads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Browser fingerprinting isn’t usually used to let you log into a website. However, some enterprise software may be looking for a specific plug-in or configuration as part of its requirements to allow you access.</p>



 Link Decoration and Bounces  



 Link Decoration 



<p>But wait, there’s more! One of the more subtle and ubiquitous features of trackers and authentication services is link decoration. Also referred to as “navigation-based tracking,” this feature adds extra information to the URL. That information can be part of an authentication token. It can be part of a query so the website knows what to display after you’ve done a product search. When you click on the link in an email, it will add the method you used to the address so the website owners know what advertising works for them.</p>



<p>Browser vendors are cautious when changing what they’ll support in links. Of course, they also have to worry about being able to identify when links are being used for tracking or something else. So many features that the web experience is built on requires link decoration. And so many trackers love it. It’s complicated.</p>



 Bounces or Redirects 



<p>The last one we’ll review in this post is bounces, also known as redirects. Bounces and redirects are as fundamental to the web experience as link decoration. These are used extensively to support critical login features for protocols like OAuth and SAML, used by websites everywhere. Authentication is complicated, and there is almost always more than one computer behind the scenes making it happen. These computers, possibly from different domains, need to talk to each other to get you logged in. They bounce data back and forth before returning a “go” or “no go” to your login experience.</p>



<p>Bounces are also, unfortunately, used by trackers to get around the third-party limitations on cookies described in the section above.</p>



<p>Remember that browsers are trying to prevent websites from reading cookies they didn’t write. Cookies are for the first party; third parties need to find another website to bother. But what if there is an advertising agreement between these two parties? They really want to share that data! The easiest thing to do is to make that third party become a first party.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When an individual visits a website directly, that makes it a first-party experience. You visit Website A; Website A is now a first party. But what if Website A has an agreement with an advertiser at Website B and adds a single pixel to their web page? Then the individual loads that pixel, thus “visiting” Website B. Website B can now set or edit a first-party cookie. They can do that every time you visit a website they have an agreement with, thus building up a record of what sites you’ve visited, where you’ve made purchases, etc.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>Browser vendors can’t just wave a magic keyboard and fix all tracking challenges. Turning off all the mechanisms that allow tracking will also break some of the most critical security features of the web. Work within the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is underway to find a way through this mess. Browser vendors have also been making their changes. Apple turned off third-party cookies years ago. Mozilla turned them off by default for all Firefox users in 2023. Google Chrome is still working on it, but they are much bigger than all other browser vendors combined and have much more business riding on these features.</p>



<p>In our next post, I’ll focus on the work around the deprecation of third-party cookies.&nbsp;</p>

This is an extremely complex issue that involves many business and technical aspects—including credential formats, credential exchange protocols, and many more. This blog limits the scope of the discussion to identifiers and key management, also known as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID&nbsp;methods</a>.</p><p>As of March 2024, there are a total of 189 DID methods registered in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-spec-registries/#did-methods">W3C DID Specification Registries</a>. This number has been increasing steadily since the registry was created in 2020, and there are likely a hundred more DID methods out there in the wild, which have not yet been registered.</p><p>Although a large proportion of these methods are experimental, some of which have no longer been maintained, this number has raised significant concern among many members of the digital identity ecosystems. In the past few years, this topic has also been the subject of heated debates. While some argue that the abundance of DID methods is a sign of a thriving ecosystem, many contend that the sheer diversity has spawned considerable interoperability challenges.</p><p>While this blog shall not take part in the debate, one cannot help but wonder “Could there possibly be a unifying DID method that covers the use cases of all others?” This is precisely what KERI attempts to&nbsp;be.</p> An elephant in the&nbsp;room <p>However, we have to address a big elephant in the room before we continue.</p>Ref: Xkcd comic, “<a href="https://xkcd.com/927/">How Standard Proliferate</a>”.<p>KERI is indeed a DID method that was designed to be the “one universal standard that covers everyone’s use case”. However, adding one more DID method to the ever-growing list does not necessarily mitigate the situation, and it remains uncertain if KERI will ever achieve widespread adoption.</p><p>Putting all that aside, KERI provides unique properties and benefits not found in other DID methods, as elaborated in <a href="https://medium.com/finema/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-keri-part-1-51371f655bba">Part 1</a> of this series. What makes KERI special is also the fact that it is not just another DID method. The KERI protocol has a grander vision of being the identity overlay for the internet.</p><blockquote>KERI is a decentralized identity protocol designed to be a secure identity overlay for the internet.</blockquote> An Identity Overlay for the&nbsp;Internet <p>The internet is arguably one of the most important inventions in human history, enabling instant connections between everyone across the globe. The success of the Internet is attributed to its hourglass model where the Internet Protocol (IP) is the one common protocol for all supporting protocols below it and all applying protocols above it, i.e., the IP protocol being the spanning layer of the Internet.</p>Ref: <a href="https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/uploads/Design-Principles-for-the-ToIP-Stack-V1.0-2022-11-17.pdf">Design Principles for the Trust over IP Stack</a>, Version 1.0, 17 November&nbsp;2021<p>Unfortunately, as the late Kim Cameron once wrote in <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/?p=352">The Laws of Identity</a> in 2005, “The Internet was built without an identity layer.” Given the immense complexity and widespread usage of the Internet, attempting to reconstruct its infrastructure to integrate such a layer is simply unfeasible. Hence, the development of an identity solution must be overlaid on the existing Internet framework. To achieve global interoperability, such an identity overlay must also embody an hourglass shape, serving as a trust-spanning protocol that seamlessly links all Web2 and Web3 applications.</p>Ref: The <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI Whitepaper</a><p>The <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Trust+Spanning+Protocol+Task+Force">Trust Spanning Protocol Task Force (TSPTF)</a> under the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP (ToIP)</a> Foundation is currently developing the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/blog/2023/08/31/mid-year-progress-report-on-the-toip-trust-spanning-protocol/">trust spanning protocol</a> where KERI is used as one of its candidate protocols for Verifiable Identifiers (VIDs).</p> Foundational Components of&nbsp;KERI <p>The previous section explains what KERI is at the conceptual level where it is designed to be the identity overlay for the internet and is also a variant of DPKI. To get deeper into the technical details,</p><blockquote>KERI is a decentralized management protocol for persistent self-certifying identifiers, called Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs), using novel key pre-rotation mechanisms. KERI utilizes hash-chain verifiable data structures, called Key Event Logs (KELs), without a total-ordered globally distributed consensus mechanism.</blockquote><p>There are four foundational components for the KERI protocol as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Autonomic Identifier (AID)  Pre-rotation  Key Event  Key Event&nbsp;Receipt   1. Autonomic Identifier (AID) <p>The KERI protocol is dedicated to the long-term management of a special class of identifiers that are both self-certifying and persistent. These identifiers are called autonomic identifiers (AIDs) in the KERI protocol.</p><blockquote>Note: The word “autonomic” is an adjective that means self-ruling, self-governing, or self-regulating.</blockquote> Self-Certifying Identifier (SCID) <p>A Self-Certifying Identifier (SCID) is an identifier that is uniquely and cryptographically derived from one or more key pairs. It is self-certifying—i.e., self-authenticating—since the controller of the SCID who holds the private could cryptographically verify their control by digitally signing a message, e.g., via a challenge-response protocol. The mapping between an identifier and its controlling key(s) is self-contained in the identifier itself. Hence, a SCID is considered a decentralized identifier as it does not rely on any trusted third party to generate or&nbsp;manage.</p><blockquote>Note: An entity that holds an authoritative set of private keys is called a controller of an&nbsp;AID.</blockquote> Basic SCID <p>A basic SCID is a variant of SCIDs that is cryptographically generated and bound to a single key pair. A basic SCID is ephemeral/non-transferable since it does not support the rotation of its key pair and therefore must be abandoned once the controlling private key becomes weakened or compromised from exposure. Hence, a basic is not persistent and is not suitable for long-term use.</p><p>The figure below demonstrates a process for creating a SCID, the controller captures sufficient entropy—e.g., using random noise from electronic equipment— to generate a key pair. A common basic SCID could be generated by using a hash digest of the public&nbsp;key.</p> AIDs are Persistent SCIDs <p>An AID is a variant of a SCID is that persistent as it may persist despite the evolution of its key state. In other words, the controller of an AID is capable of rotating their key pair while retaining the same AID. The mechanism for evolving the AID’s key state is called pre-rotation.</p>Difference between a basic SCID and an&nbsp;AID An AID is a primary root of trust in&nbsp;KERI <p>A root of trust is defined as a component or process of the system upon which other components rely. An AID is also a primary root of trust in the KERI protocol, which is purely cryptographic and decentralized, not relying on any centralized entity or even any blockchain network.</p><blockquote>An AID is used as a primary root of trust in the KERI protocol that is purely cryptographic. As a consequence, the security of KERI-based identity systems only relies on cryptography, requiring no trust in external entities or even any blockchain network.</blockquote> 2. Pre-rotation <p>In the KERI protocol, the mechanism used to evolve a key state of an AID is known as pre-rotation. Except for a few special cases, an AID is cryptographically bound to at least two sets of key pairs, each of which holds different control authorities over the&nbsp;AID:</p>  The first set is called the current key(s), which holds the signing authority. The current key(s) of an AID can be used to, for instance, sign arbitrary messages such as verifiable credentials, authenticate the AID’s controller, and anchor external data to KERI’s ledgers, called key event&nbsp;logs.  The second set is called the next key(s), which holds the rotation authority. The next key(s) of an AID can be used to change the key state of the AID, including changing the current keys, that is, transferring the signing authority to another set of&nbsp;key(s).  <blockquote>Here, the “s” refers to the case where a multi-signature scheme is employed, where multiple key pairs are required to establish signing and rotation authorities.</blockquote> Pre-commitment <p>When an AID is created (i.e., incepted), the controller of the AID makes a pre-commitment to the next key(s) that hold rotation authority over the AID. The next key(s) are hidden using a cryptographic hash function, and they are only revealed at the moment the key state of the AID is&nbsp;rotated.</p><p>The next key pair — both private and public keys — must be kept secure and hidden until a key rotation is required. The rotation event revokes the current key pairs that hold signing authority as well as replacing the next key pairs that hold rotation authority.</p><p>This process is called pre-rotation since the next key pair is pre-committed for rotation while the actual rotation event may occur at a later&nbsp;time.</p><blockquote>Formally, pre-rotation is a cryptographic pre-commitment of an AID to the next key pair(s) for key rotation.</blockquote> Recovery from Quantum&nbsp;Attack <p>As pre-rotated next key(s) are hidden by a cryptographic hash function, the next key(s) are thus resistant to quantum attack. This is because hash functions are not vulnerable to the Quantum <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm">Shor’s Algorithm</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, the current key of an AID could still be broken by a quantum attack, allowing a threat actor with access to a quantum computer to gain the signing authority over the AID. However, the legitimate controller of the AID could still regain control over the AID by using the next key(s) to rotate the AID’s key state, perhaps using a quantum-safe algorithm for the new set of current&nbsp;keys.</p><p>Hence, the use of pre-rotation in the KERI protocol makes it quantum-recoverable.</p> 3. Key&nbsp;Event <p>The key state of an AID is determined by a data structure called a key event that consists of the current key(s) and pre-rotated next key(s) as well as other configurations for the&nbsp;AID.</p><blockquote>Note: The key state of an AID is defined as a set of currently authoritative key pairs for the AID and any other information necessary to secure or establish control authority over an&nbsp;AID.</blockquote> Key Inception Event <p>The AID is itself cryptographically derived from its very first key event, called an inception event, thus giving the AID its self-certifying property. The inception event must also be cryptographically signed by the current&nbsp;keys.</p><p>The example below demonstrates a scenario where an AID has single key pairs for its current and next keys. An AID is derived and bound to the key inception event, which includes:</p>  the first public key, which is used as the current&nbsp;key,  the digest of the second public key, which is used as the pre-rotated next&nbsp;key.  <p>The first public key could be revealed to other entities while the pre-rotated second public key must be kept&nbsp;hidden.</p>An AID is derived from an inception event that consists of two sets of keys, namely the current key and (pre-rotated) next key. The current key is used to sign the key inception event. The AID is pre-committed to future rotation by the second&nbsp;key. Key Rotation&nbsp;Event <p>The pre-rotated next key(s) of an AID may be used to create a subsequent key event, called a rotation event, that changes the AID’s key state. The rotation event must be signed by the next key(s), revealing the next key(s). Hence, the next key(s) can be used for rotation only once, after which the next keys must be either discarded or repurposed as members of the new set of subsequent current key(s). The controller of the AID must also assign a new set of pre-rotated next key(s) in the rotation&nbsp;event.</p><p>Following the example above, the AID could be rotated to revoke the signing authority of the first key pair by using the private key of the pre-rotated second public key to sign a rotation event. In the rotation&nbsp;event,</p>  the second public key is now repurposed to be the new current&nbsp;key,  a new key pair, the third public key, is pre-committing to the future rotation of the&nbsp;AID.  The key state of the AID is evolved by revealing the second (pre-rotated) key and using it to sign a key rotation event. The rotation event includes a new next key that pre-commits the AID to future rotation. Key Event Log&nbsp;(KEL) <p>As the key state of an AID evolves, the key events are cryptographically linked in a hash chain that provides a key history for the AID. Such a data structure is called a Key Event Log&nbsp;(KEL).</p><p>Formally, a KEL is a hash-chain verifiable data structure used to verify the key state of an AID as it evolves through its lifecycle. A KEL could be compared to a transaction ledger in a traditional blockchain, where key events are transactions in the KERI protocol.</p><p>Following the example above, the KEL of the example AID starts with the inception event with the first public key and the hash digest of the second key. The inception event is chained to subsequent rotation events via the pre-rotation mechanism.</p>A key event log of the AID that contains a hash chain of its key&nbsp;events.<p>Hence, the control authorities — both signing and rotation — of the AID at any point in the KEL can be validated in a self-contained manner by verifying the signatures and recalculating the hashes that connect the key events in the KEL, all the way back to the inception event.</p><blockquote>Note: A KEL is technically a type of “blockchain” in the traditional sense of an ordered list of records that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.</blockquote> 4. Key Event&nbsp;Receipt <p>At its core, the KERI protocol establishes an infrastructure facilitating the exchange of key events as well as key event receipts. This highlights the protocol’s designation as the “Key Event Receipt Infrastructure.”</p><p>The exchange of key events and key event receipts could carried either directly between controllers of AIDs or indirectly through supporting infrastructures.</p> Key Event&nbsp;Receipt <p>In the KERI protocol, communications and transactions revolve around the exchange of key events among controllers of AIDs. When a controller receives a key event, they can sign it using the key associated with their AID. This signed key event is called a key event receipt, which provides a non-repudiable proof that the recipient has received—i.e., witnessed—the key&nbsp;event.</p> Key Event Receipt Log&nbsp;(KERL) <p>Key event receipts of an AID could be recorded in a verifiable data structure called a key event receipt log (KERL). A KERL contains the signed key event history of an AID. A verifier of an AID may verify the AID’s key state by using a&nbsp;KERL.</p> Direct mode <p>Key events and key event receipts can be exchanged directly between two controllers. This is known as the direct mode in the KERI protocol.</p><p>In the direct mode, a controller of an AID may send its KEL to another controller, called a validator of the AID. Upon reception of a key event, the validator signs the received key events to generate a key event receipt and subsequently returns it to the controller as an acknowledgment. The controller now has a signed receipt that attests that the validator received and verified the key event message. This provides a trust basis for transactions between the controller and the validator. The validator may not later repudiate its signed receipts nor refer to a different key event history in interactions with the controller without detection by the controller.</p><p>Each party would thereby in turn be the controller for their AID and the validator for the other’s AID. Each could maintain a KEL of their own AID as well as a KERL of the other’s AID. This allows each party to be trusted with respect to this pairwise interaction.</p> Indirect mode <p>Since a controller of an AID may not always be online. The controller may designate witnesses that store and forward key events to any requestor. This is known as the indirect mode in the KERI protocol.</p><p>The purpose of the indirect mode is to provide a highly available trustworthy service for discovering the KEL of an AID. The witnesses also sign the key events to create witnessed key event receipts.</p><p>An example of the indirect replay mode with a set of witnesses that are designated by the controller is shown&nbsp;below.</p> Additional Infrastructures <p>Since the witnesses are designated by the controller of the AID, they may not be entirely trusted by validators of the AID. For example, the AID and its witnesses could be compromised or behave maliciously such that the witnesses provide inconsistent key event histories, called duplicity.</p><p>Consequently, a validator of the AID could designate additional infrastructure to detect duplicity of the AID’s key event history. These additional infrastructures include watchers, jurors, and judges. The infrastructures may be designated a validator or a group of validators to “watch” the witnesses to detect any duplicity in the AID’s key event history as well as make decisions on the validity of the AID’s&nbsp;KEL.</p> Blockchain as KERI witnesses and&nbsp;watchers <p>As discussed in <a href="https://medium.com/finema/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-keri-part-1-51371f655bba">Part 1</a>, while the KERI protocol does not necessarily rely on a blockchain, KERI may leverage blockchain for the discovery and verification of KELs. In other words, blockchains could be utilized in a KERI-based identity system practically taking the roles of KERI witnesses and watchers. Hence, you could have the best of both worlds, obtaining the advantages that traditional blockchains offer. Since the root of trust in the KERI protocol is within the AIDs themselves, the AIDs could be migrated from one blockchain network to another, avoiding the ledger-locked problem that plagues most blockchain-based DID&nbsp;methods.</p> KERI in a&nbsp;Nutshell <p>Conceptually, the Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI) protocol is a decentralized identity protocol designed to be an identity overlay for the Internet. Each word in KERI has the following meanings:</p>  Key refers to asymmetric key cryptography that is used to control persistent self-certifying identifiers, called Autonomic Identifiers (AIDs).  Event refers to a series of Key Events in a hash-chain verifiable data structure called Key Event Logs (KELs) that record the key-state evolution of AIDs via the Pre-Rotation mechanism.  Receipt refers to signed receipts of key events, called Key Event Receipts that provide non-repudiable proof while exchanging key events between&nbsp;AIDs.  Infrastructure refers to the protocol for exchanging non-repudiable key event receipts, including the designation of Witnesses, Watchers, Jurors, and&nbsp;Judges.  <p>The next part of the series discusses “How do you use KERI?” which includes references to other introductory materials and a collection of open-source implementations, standards, and whitepapers.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-keri-part-2-what-exactly-is-keri-e46a649ac54c">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to KERI.

<p>With the acceleration of digital transformation and hybrid work, the number of devices and machines accessing critical data and resources has increased exponentially. The growing number of devices accessing sensitive data gives rise to an expanded attack surface that leaves organizations vulnerable to cyberattacks that can cause financial and reputational damage.</p>
<p>The traditional network perimeter is no more. Identities – whether human or machine – have become the new line of defense when it comes to protecting against cyberattacks. To effectively manage your devices, you need complete visibility over all devices and machines in your organization. While digital certificates are an effective way to create and manage machine identities and device authentication to secure data and communication between a device and an organization’s critical resources (whether in the cloud or on-premises), managing the lifecycle of these digital certificates across disparate environments and a multitude of different devices is proving to be a challenge for many enterprise IT teams.</p>
<p>Managing Digital Certificates Across Devices and Operating Systems</p>
<p>Having a complete certificate lifecycle management (CLM) solution that enables automation is key to having control and ensuring compliance across your digital certificate estate. In addition, an effective PKI solution should support multiple protocols to support certificate enrollment across a number of devices (mobile, laptops, IoT, etc.) and operating systems to provide end-to-end CLM across a global enterprise.</p>
<p>Much like the remote/hybrid work option allows people to be flexible, a PKI solution must integrate with mobile device management (MDM) solutions to allow organizations to do the same, in turn supporting advanced identification, authentication, and authorization schemes, enabling organizations to deploy and manage MDM solutions effectively with strong machine identities. Microsoft Windows devices that account for a large number of workforce devices use the WS-Trust X.509v3 Token Enrollment Extensions Protocol (WSTEP), which allows for secure certificate enrollment and revocation capabilities.</p>
<p>Automation is a key requirement for CLM to ensure seamless certificate enrollment and revocation processes. Having a cloud-based PKI as a service that integrates with MDM solutions eliminates the costly overhead with on-premises infrastructure and ensures your organization is being actively managed and secured.</p>
<p>As digital transformation continues to accelerate, it’s up to you and your organization to continue to grow and evolve with the trends and reduce complexity for enterprise IT departments worldwide.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Paul Fisher</a></p><p>Among these emerging technologies, identity wallets have sparked considerable debate and optimism—not to mention quite&nbsp; a number of working groups. While they promise a future of seamless and secure digital identity management, their proliferation may be premature, serving more as a distraction than a solution, until we achieve truly ironclad identity authentication.</p>
 The Allure of Identity Wallets 
<p>Identity wallets propose an enticing vision: a user-centric model where individuals have full control over their identity credentials, sharing them effortlessly and securely across services and organizations. This concept aligns with the broader trend towards empowering users and enhancing privacy. By consolidating identity verification in a single, secure location, identity wallets seem to offer a panacea for the fragmented, insecure, and cumbersome processes plaguing current online interactions.</p>
 The Core Issue: Authentication Integrity 
<p>However, the rush towards adopting identity wallets overlooks a fundamental flaw in our current cybersecurity infrastructure—the integrity of identity authentication itself and the endless number of protocols. The foundation of any IAM system is its ability to accurately and securely authenticate the identity of users. No matter how sophisticated or user-friendly an identity wallet may be, its effectiveness is inherently limited by the reliability of the initial authentication process.</p>
<p>Outside these working groups, &nbsp;reality we face is stark. Phishing attacks, identity theft, and account takeovers are rampant, exploiting weaknesses in password-based systems, biometrics, and even two-factor authentication methods. The security community has long acknowledged these vulnerabilities, yet a truly ironclad solution remains elusive.</p>
 Distraction from the Real Challenge 
<p>The fervor surrounding identity wallets risks diverting attention and resources from addressing the root problem—developing authentication mechanisms that are both impervious to existing threats and adaptable to future challenges. While identity wallets can streamline identity management once a user is authenticated, they do little to enhance the security of the authentication process itself.</p>
<p>This is not to dismiss the potential benefits of identity wallets outright. They represent a significant step forward in managing digital identities. The path forward requires a collective reevaluation of our priorities. The cybersecurity and identity communities must channel iefforts into research and development of authentication technologies that can withstand the sophisticated threats of today and tomorrow. Innovations such as cryptographic proofs, advanced biometrics, and behavioral analytics hold promise, but require significant investment to realize their potential.</p>
<p>Moreover, fostering an ecosystem that supports interoperability and open standards will be crucial. This approach will not only enhance the security and usability of authentication methods but also ensure that emerging solutions like identity wallets can integrate seamlessly into the broader IAM framework.</p>
<p>What do you think? Digital wallets and all aspects of IAM will be high on the agenda at KuppingerCole’s European Identity &amp; Cloud EIC2024 conference. There will be opportunities to learn about Safeguarding Digital Identities in Today's World, to get insights into How AI Can Help IAM Deliver Better and Stronger Authorization, to get answers the question: Can you trust AI in IAM? And much more!</p>

The modular, conversational design of this publication is intentional and has been created to respect the dynamic and collaborative nature of the initiative.</p>  Part 1: Life-Ennobling Economics: what is the idea and what are we hoping to stimulate by sharing it? (<a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/introducing-life-ennobling-economics-part-1-d950ae770ef2">Linked&nbsp;here</a>)  Part 2: the philosophical framework: exploring the foundational questions of the&nbsp;LEE.  <p>A downloadable interactive pdf of this full publication is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B3x9hYWM3n0zqyTnFzetGDSdlnspRzOr/view?usp=sharing">available here</a>.</p> Part 2 — the philosophical framework: exploring the foundational questions of the&nbsp;LEE  Using narratives, diagrams and images to open a generative dialogue <p>In our first publication we introduced two questions that we are using to navigate towards a foundational logic for Life-Ennobling Economics. In this next post we are using those overall queries to share some initial thoughts, together with the cascading questions that are continuing to arise. A strong reflection at this point is that it’s difficult to express many of the core sentiments of LEE using only words. The articulation of certain ideas feels premature and constrictive and this is something that we want to hold up to the light. On the one hand, it feels important to drive clarity and not to hide behind vague, even poetic phrasing. Yet on the other hand, a sense of humility, awe and deep curiosity makes us reluctant to distil and label these early ideas. How can we adequately express diverse interpretations, yearnings and fears for this future that we are daring to open ourselves towards? How might you as the reader? How might your children, parents or more-than-human relations?</p><blockquote>Q1: What would a future economy look and feel like if it was rooted in the recognition of the full web of life, grounded by a non-bounded theory of value and enabled by technological ecosystems of&nbsp;care?</blockquote><blockquote>Q2: If the journey to get there involved moving beyond theories of property, labour, extraction, private contracts, governance and monetary colonisation what would we be shifting from and&nbsp;towards?</blockquote><p>In the sections that follow we are outlining three core worldview philosophies that we think could underpin a desirable future economy. From there, we have identified six structural shifts that we are hypothesising would need to occur for that to become a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>3 WORLDVIEW PHILOSOPHIES</p> Philosophy 1 <p>Rooted in the recognition of the full web of life: From violence, scarcity and separation to a thriving planetary community of interbecoming.</p><p>What would it mean to fundamentally reimagine ourselves as permeable, dynamic interbecomings, deeply entwined in diverse right relationships and joyfully part of a full planetary consciousness. This concept challenges the traditional economic view of humans driven primarily by rational, objectified, self-interest. Instead, it suggests a new understanding of self where our individual interests are indistinct from what we can collectively become.</p><p>This shift in perspective would call for a re-evaluation of the infrastructures that shape our lives and identities. It would question how we think about everything; from education and learning, health care and human development to the roles and functions of prisons and the judicial system. For example, what does justice mean in a world where we see ourselves as interconnected becomings?</p><blockquote>What do we mean by when we use the term Interbecoming?</blockquote><blockquote>Interbecoming is an extension of the word Interbe which was invented by the Buddhist monk Thích Nhất Hạnh. The becoming element signifies the emergent potential of what it means to verb as a community into the future. In this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esyQnwz_yJ0">short video</a> he describes how you cannot be by yourself alone, to be you need to be with everything and everyone else and therefore to be means to inter-be.</blockquote> Philosophy 2 <p>Grounded in a non-bounded understanding of value: From extractive profit-driven goals to entangled, intergenerational and distributed value&nbsp;systems.</p><p>In our current economy our measures of success are calculated using a narrow set of accounting rules. This is a collectively accepted norm, but can a genuine measure of value be bounded by time or context? In an interconnected world, externalities seem to be a delusion yet they are currently excluded from our calculations of profit and GDP. Imagine an economy where value was understood to be attributed to relationships themselves rather than the things that are related? How would our economy behave if the collective goal and source of status was increasing regenerative potential or stocks of&nbsp;care?</p><blockquote>The illogical tyranny of&nbsp;metrics</blockquote><blockquote>“People becoming unhealthy can actually have a positive effect overall on GDP, as revenue from associated healthcare boosts growth. Similarly, the extraction of oil and gas pushes GDP up, while pushing us closer to the precipice of climate breakdown.” — Caroline Lucas, MP (<a href="https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2019-07-10/debates/FFE2C4E7-4ED0-4537-BA1F-0DE8B46CA084/EconomicGrowthAndEnvironmentalLimits">UK Parliamentary Debate,&nbsp;2019</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Hazel Henderson’s layer cake was the <a href="https://twitter.com/KateRaworth/status/1528866241683017728">original inspiration</a> behind Kate Raworth’s Doughnut Economics framework. It is a metaphor for how the current monetised economy (the top layers of cake) are entirely dependent on the non-valued, supportive lower&nbsp;layers.</blockquote>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@anniespratt?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Annie Spratt</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a> Philosophy 3 <p>Enabled by technological ecosystems of care: From the utilitarian ‘othering’ of technology to animistic interfaces of wisdom and&nbsp;care.</p><p>The accelerating technological complexity of our world can be seen as a threat. However, it could also offer new opportunities to nurture the capacity of society to understand itself more fully, rather than trying to mould and regulate it. Imagine a future where our governing institutions are empowered to advance and scaffold the continuous learning of a self-aware system. Where we can sense the unique, embodied value of every context, thus fostering care for the entangled impacts, both positive and negative. Ultimately we have a choice; will we use the stunning power of advanced technologies to embrace a new freedom to care, or will we use it to destroy everything we depend on and hold&nbsp;dear?</p><blockquote>Busy fools?</blockquote><blockquote>‘We are drowning in information, while starving for wisdom’- E.O.&nbsp;Wilson</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/176CNiZYM1v2xcEzDVO4SHuEfRQoosCVL/view?usp=sharing">The Cornerstone Indicators </a>work is an example of participatory dialogues being combined with smart data, to create intuitively understandable multi-contextual indicators of care. In another <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-0360c0709087">live initiative</a>, we are exploring ways of linking distributed currencies to participatory governance structures, as a pathway towards stewarding bioregional health.</blockquote>Cornerstone Indicator: the number of people with a dream, plan or goal more than one year into the future. Image: Vlad Afanasiev<p>6 STRUCTURAL SHIFTS</p> Shift 1 <p>Beyond Property: From exerting control over ‘objects’ to seeking reciprocal relationships with the full web of&nbsp;life.</p><p>Words like property and ownership are often associated with ideas of dominion and control, allowing us to treat elements of the living world (such as land and rare earth minerals) as objects. Deep down though, do we really believe that timber holds more value than a forest? Or that a whale’s life is interchangeable with a barrel of oil? What would it mean to explore a world beyond property, a world of self sovereign agents who we are respectfully in treaty&nbsp;with?</p><blockquote>The paradox of individual identity</blockquote><blockquote>The idea of self-sovereign agents is being used to express a conviction that life is not a sum of its constituent parts. Instead, both the whole and the parts co-arise with equal agency. The word identity is derived from the Latin idem, the same and identidem, again and again. We identify ourselves by our internal consistency, but this concept only exists in contrast to external self identifying elements (and vice versa). This idea has been expressed by diverse thinkers from <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-experience-of-meaning/jan-zwicky/9780773557437">Zan Zwicky</a> to <a href="https://www.systematics.org/journal/vol9-2/TheWhole_Bortoft.pdf">Henri Borthoft </a>and is carefully explored by Daniel Wahl in Designing Regenerative Cultures¹ and Iain McGilchrist in The Matter with&nbsp;Things².</blockquote><blockquote>‘To shut ourselves off from these other voices…is to rob our own senses of their integrity, and to rob our minds of their coherence. We are human only in contact, and conviviality, with what is not human’ — David&nbsp;Abram</blockquote> Shift 2 <p>Beyond Labour: From humans employed as resources to vocations of creativity, purpose and&nbsp;care.</p><p>In our industrialised economies humans are often framed as a functional resource. However, rapidly advancing technologies (such as machine automation and alternative distributed currencies) have the potential to weaken the requirement for labour to service financial capital. What would it mean to emancipate the idea of work from its current focus on hierarchy and external incentives? Could we build a future economy that harnesses our inherent, embodied intelligences and unleashes our intrinsic motivations and ability to discover? Perhaps this would be a future of virtuous flow where human satisfaction is rooted in low impact, transcendent goals.</p><blockquote>Can a state of flow be virtuous?</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://timjackson.org.uk/finding-flow-lancet/">Professor Tim Jackson</a> has proposed the concept of flow as a pathway towards sustainable fulfilment.</blockquote> Shift 3 <p>Beyond Extraction: From extractive resource claims to the infinite guardianship of the global&nbsp;commons.</p><p>Even the word resource is innately extractive and predicated on violence. When we see a sentient animal or element of an ecosystem and name it as a natural resource, we are using language to justify collective violence in pursuit of private comfort. We have become highly proficient at accessing diverse fodder for the global economic supertanker; from the deep sea beds to the depths of the Amazon rainforest nowhere is considered too difficult to access if the price is right. What would happen if we erased ‘resource’ from our active vocabulary, and redirected our ingenuity toward stewarding the global&nbsp;commons?</p><blockquote>Do words&nbsp;matter?</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.ifad.org/documents/38714174/46011659/INAYAN_LANDSCAPE+%281%29.gif/36b31524-6d41-6ed3-8cda-bf444bde3fe0?t=1659621341143">Inayan — “Unethical deeds”</a>: Inayan is a word that doesn’t exist in the English language. For the Kankanaey people in the Philippines it expresses a community value of refraining from harmful behaviour towards living and inanimate relations. For example, it is inayan to pollute the&nbsp;rivers.</blockquote> Shift 4 <p>Beyond Private Contracts: From linear agreements that optimise for the few to multi-party, dynamic, digital treaties of&nbsp;respect.</p><p>Many of our existing contracts are structured as bilateral agreements. By design, these agreements ignore the complex interplay of values and the mutual need for care that is integral to most transactions. With the emergence of capabilities such as many-to-many and smart, self-executing contracting, we see an opportunity to revolutionise this root structure of the economy. For example, how would our interactions change if we could easily assemble contracts that recognise relational value? Could we collectively drive a bureaucratic revolution that would create new ways to acknowledge and manage the intricate, entangled flows of&nbsp;value?</p><blockquote>Are these new contracts too technical or theoretical to engage&nbsp;with?</blockquote><blockquote>From a conceptual provocation (<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">Smart Commons provocation</a>) to a live multi-partner collaboration (<a href="https://darkmatterlabs.notion.site/Beyond-the-Rules-19e692bf98f54b44971ca34700e246fd">Beyond The Rules Portal</a>), we are working out loud to test the theory and practical applications of these new forms of contracting.</blockquote>Credit: Terri&nbsp;Po Shift 5 <p>Beyond Governance: From centralised enforcement to nurturing institutions of stewardship.</p><p>Historically our dominant governance structures have sought to control and instruct. However, with the increasing complexity of both our societal systems and escalating risk pathways, this theory of governance no longer appears viable. From their top-down view, many governments are struggling to intelligently regulate the increasingly complex systems of property that they guarantee.</p><p>The most probable directions of future societal travel do not seem appealing. On the one hand we might fail to resolve our global coordination challenges and continue to experience ever intensifying crises (for example, individual countries reopening coal mines to reduce energy costs in the short-term ). Alternatively, we might find ways to overcome perverse incentives but the means to do so will potentially lead us towards authoritarian dystopias. With this in mind, how can we transition away from a centralised model of control, and embrace a governance style that fosters collective learning and empowers the entire&nbsp;system³.</p><blockquote>Is there an adjacent, third&nbsp;option?</blockquote><blockquote>Consilience: the idea that evidence from independent, unrelated sources can “converge” on strong conclusions.</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/global-neighbourhoods-digital-democracy">In Taiwan</a>, the combination of open data and civic participation has created a transparent governance model that drastically reduced the impact of the Covid-19&nbsp;virus.</blockquote> Shift 6 <p>Beyond Monetary Capital: From the accumulation of financial wealth to a social contract that regeneratively stewards the diverse capitals of&nbsp;life.</p><p>What would it mean if we understood capital wealth as an expression of crystallised suffering? Recognising that financial capital is intertwined and enabled by living and social systems could be an important pivot point towards a future rooted in mutually assured thriving. Perhaps then we would feel empowered to reject a monetary system that continues to colonise, exploit and exclude by design. Imagine how our relationship to financial capital might change if we understood the act of investing to be a commitment to our collective futures? What would a system look like where the ways of creating and stewarding money are decentralised and respectful of incommensurate value&nbsp;flows?</p><blockquote>Is the plurality of existing alternative currencies a blessing or a distraction?</blockquote><blockquote><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ya3IuJx8O9o">Bernard Lietaer</a> who co-designed the Euro has proposed three core design principles that fundamentally shape the interaction between money and society: a) who issues a currency, b) the qualities it is given, and c) what it can be used&nbsp;for.</blockquote><blockquote>In <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/towards-multivalent-currencies-bioregional-monetary-stewardship-and-a-distributed-global-reserve-38ed3849395f">this provocation</a> we explore 10 design principles that could underpin a cohesive yet diverse regenerative monetary&nbsp;system.</blockquote> What’s next and how can people become involved? <p>We have created these first two sections as a landing point for the LEE movement. The idea will be to leave this initial piece in its original form and update the links to new materials as they emerge. What happens next depends on who engages and in what capacity. When we initially proposed the idea, we had imagined that LEE might manifest as a collaborative book and we are still open to that possibility. However, we feel strongly that whilst a tangible artefact would be a powerful tool, it should not be the end goal. Instead, we are aspiring to create a container that can scaffold a distributed exploration and implementation of LEE principles.</p><p>Publications in the&nbsp;pipeline</p><p>We are working on the following pieces and will publish them&nbsp;soon:</p>  Exploratory conversations with critical friends who have read the early versions of the LEE&nbsp;concept.  An outline of how Dark Matter Labs is organising itself to work on the questions raised by the&nbsp;LEE.  Internal conversations: what would it mean for the different strands of our work if we embraced Life-Ennobling Economics as our overarching mission?  <p>Potential pathways for engagement</p><p>We are interested to hear diverse perspectives and will adjust our approach depending on the feedback we receive. As an initial prompt perhaps one of these descriptions is relevant to&nbsp;you:</p><blockquote>Funding support: we are hoping to convene a partnership of funders who can support, elevate and actively contribute to this vision. The scope of ambition is wide but we will curate the process as a series of modular steps. If you are interested in supporting us, either as a general contribution or as a standalone module, then we would be very happy to discuss your ideas. Email: jayne@darkmatterlabs.org</blockquote><blockquote>Collaborative support: We expect to organise a series of diverse gatherings and working groups. As a first step we will create a live database of potential collaborators and propose a series of online and in-person events following initial conversations. If this is something you would like to hear more about, we would be grateful if you could send us a short email to let us know your area of interest. Email: emily@darkmatterlabs.org</blockquote><blockquote>Staying updated: our hope is that the ongoing LEE work will provide a convening point for a wider body of thinking on alternative economies. Please feel free to send us your email contact and we will keep you updated on progress and new publications.

<p>In this 2-part series we are excited to introduce a new area of our work. We have divided this first introductory publication into two short reflections to invite flexible engagement. As we continue to explore the concept and produce new multimedia materials we will update the links and images to reflect this emerging content. The modular, conversational design of this publication is intentional and has been created to respect the dynamic and collaborative nature of the initiative.</p>  Part 1: Life-Ennobling Economics: what is the idea and what are we hoping to stimulate by sharing&nbsp;it?  Part 2: the philosophical framework: exploring the foundational questions of the LEE (<a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/introducing-life-ennobling-economics-part-2-da43434545c8">linked&nbsp;here</a>).  <p>A downloadable interactive pdf of this full publication is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B3x9hYWM3n0zqyTnFzetGDSdlnspRzOr/view?usp=sharing">available here</a>.</p> Part 1 — Life-Ennobling Economics: what is the idea and what are we hoping to stimulate by sharing&nbsp;it? <blockquote>The term life-ennobling is in itself an adjacent extension of <a href="https://www.yesmagazine.org/social-justice/2023/02/07/ruthie-wilson-gilmore-abolition-geography%EF%BF%BC">Ruth Wilson Gilmore’s work</a> on life-affirming institutions.</blockquote><p>Our economic systems are failing to serve the interests of our living planet and the great majority of those who inhabit it. It is not our intention to restate the multiple crises that this mismatch has fuelled and continues to perpetuate. Instead, we are sharing our emerging thinking as we strive to build pathways towards alternative ways of organising society. Reading this opening paragraph you may already be holding many questions. For&nbsp;example:</p>  ‘Surely we don’t need yet another type of economics?’.  ‘We already have Doughnut Economics, Wellbeing Economics, Solidarity Economics, Ecological Economics — the list goes on — wouldn’t it make more sense to focus on implementing their principles rather than proposing a new version?’  ‘What gives Dark Matter Labs the authority to suggest a new form of economics? This seems like an audacious and perhaps even arrogant proposal to&nbsp;make.’  <p>We are holding many of these questions ourselves and fully acknowledge that we are standing on the shoulders of giants. LEE draws on the work of intersectional scholars, feminist and ecological economists and fuses their insights with indigenous wisdom, the life-affirming passion of the abolitionists and the dynamism of radical technologists.</p><p>As we move deeper into the work we are planning to weave the questions and wisdom of our ecosystem into the things that we are learning. We will embrace the friction that comes with an organic conversation and share this unfolding journey using different mediums. If you have comments on the content, or ideas to shape the format of the conversation, then we would welcome feedback.</p>Credit: Martin&nbsp;Lorenz The concept <p>We are proposing Life-Ennobling Economics as an invitational vision and as a call to action. It is an ennobling invitation to break free from ideological constraints, to embrace the radical potential of new technologies, and to challenge the structural codes of our current socio-economic systems. Implicit in this opening position is an understanding that the structure and values of the economy must be in service to all forms of life (present, future, human, non-human and machine) providing a scaffold of care and&nbsp;respect.</p><p>One way of understanding LEE is as a series of linked questions:</p>  What would a desirable future economy actually look&nbsp;like?  What would need to shift for that to become a&nbsp;reality?  What does that mean in the context of our current socioeconomic and political reality?  What can we build or seed to test those assumptions?  <p>We have started to explore these questions as part of our own organisational strategy. We have visualised our response as a 3D matrix and we will publish more about this&nbsp;soon.</p><p>To open the dialogue with a wider audience we are testing three core worldview philosophies that we think could underpin a desirable future economy. From there, we have identified six structural shifts that we are hypothesising would need to occur for that to become a reality. The aspiration is to begin building and testing elements of these proposed shifts on the ground, in diverse contexts and communities.</p> What are the core elements of the hypothesis? <p>We are presenting the opening hypothesis as three short sections: (1) an overall framing (2) a philosophical framework (3) an action orientated scaffold. In some places we have included links to more in-depth content and we will expand on the concept in our upcoming publications, including a series of conversations with critical&nbsp;friends.</p><blockquote>1. Overall&nbsp;framing</blockquote><blockquote>The master’s tools will never dismantle the master’s&nbsp;house</blockquote><blockquote>— Audre&nbsp;Lorde</blockquote><p>The central augment being put forward by the LEE is that whilst we indisputably need to shift to a new economy, we will not get there using the mental models, tools or value systems of the current one. If we allow ourselves to sit with this statement for a moment, how do we feel? Possibly a sense of deflation, frustration or hopelessness. This is not our intention. Rather, we are proposing that we allow ourselves to lean into the idea of a beyond paradigm movement of unusual allies. Donella Meadows retrospectively adjusted her <a href="https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/">thesis ↗</a> to include an additional level that she named the power to transcend paradigms. Building on this insight, LEE is inviting us to explore what could happen if we allow ourselves to sense into the edges of everything that we are capable of becoming. From nature rights activists and abolitionists to the advocates of self sovereign technologies and universal basic income, many diverse voices are advocating for a common shift. What might be unlocked if we could collaborate across a broad spectrum of unusual&nbsp;allies?</p><blockquote>2. A philosophical framework</blockquote><p>Iain McGilchrist has commented that in modern society we are living under a philosophical error that is far from abstract and instead runs deep to the way that we experience the world¹. Collaboratively building a coherent philosophical base for a more generative future feels critical, because it is this foundational logic that shapes the more tangible layers of our societies. For example, if we start from a value system that promotes individualism and competition then we are likely to design narrow indicators of progress such as GDP, that further entrench these values. In contrast, in a system centred on regenerative vitality we would probably lean towards more embodied measures of success, thus reinforcing the interconnected basis of societal wellbeing².</p><p>To begin exploring and crafting a shared philosophical baseline we are using the following questions to frame our opening thoughts:</p><blockquote>Q1: What would a future economy look and feel like if it was rooted in the recognition of the full web of life, grounded by a non-bounded theory of value and enabled by technological ecosystems of&nbsp;care?</blockquote><blockquote>Q2: If the journey to get there involved moving beyond theories of property, labour, extraction, private contracts, governance and monetary colonisation, what would we be shifting from and&nbsp;towards?</blockquote><p>We are deliberately using a beyond x,y,z rather than a steps towards framing to explore the proposed structural shifts. We hope that this will encourage a less prescriptive and declarative mindset as we consider what we might collectively work towards. For&nbsp;example:</p>  What could be unlocked if we looked beyond our current understanding of terms such as natural resources, money, institutions and governance?  How can we ensure that voices from the ideological left or right, those who are privileged or oppressed, indigenous or geographically separated can are respectfully represented within the LEE framework?  What might we imagine (or perhaps glimpse existing fragments of) if we let go of a solution oriented&nbsp;mindset?  Are there already existing pockets of these alternative worldviews spread across diverse communities?  <blockquote>3. An action oriented&nbsp;scaffold</blockquote><blockquote>“We’ve been told repeatedly that the current political economy can provide the answers, ignoring systematic faults and invested interests in the way of change. Isn’t the real question here then, how we go about redesigning this political economy in a way that includes other voices, values, and&nbsp;ideas.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Gail Bradbrook</blockquote><p>Establishing a strong theoretical baseline is a priority for this initiative, but it also feels important to begin testing and elevating alternative pathways. There is already a stunning global constellation of organisations, movements and thinkers who are actively embodying regenerative crafts and values (for example we recently mapped actors <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14C7-2GVpMM1dZu5o8Q7hgHAOnBMMfCJ3/view?usp=sharing">working on a just transition for housing</a> in Europe). We hope that by broadening the conversation, welcoming unforeseen allies and recognising diverse interests, the LEE can contribute to strengthening this distributed network.</p><p>An initial suggestion for this scaffold is to think of it as two connected threads:</p>  Case studies: we cannot be sure of how the future will play out. However, we can draw on historical events and foresight methods to explore the more likely scenarios. What might we discover if we collate an evidence base of existing signals of change from around the world (for example UBI trials and distributed currencies)? Or perhaps we can gain new insights from building out exploratory case studies, over varied time horizons, for specific sectors such as finance and food systems. How could our understanding shift if we embrace practices such as vision-questing, somatic and dream work? Perhaps you have practices or ideas that you think might be powerful for this collective visioning? We would be grateful for any suggestions and references.  Systemic capabilities: building on the case studies, we hope to identify a speculative portfolio of systemic capabilities that can be developed, tested and iterated in parallel to the existing system. Potential pathways might include designing large scale participatory dialogues, launching transitional financial instruments or developing the policies and tools for distributed decision making structures.   Living the questions <p>In Part 2 of this post we have illustrated our current understanding of some of the questions raised above. We are also working on a series of conversations where we will present some initial reactions to this proposal and explore the points of resonance and friction.</p><p>This blog was designed and written by Martin Lorenz, Emily Harris and Indy Johar as part of Dark Matter’s Next Economics LAB.</p><p>The list can never be complete but to the following, thank you for your wisdom, foresight and work — your voices have given shape and clarity to the LEE concept: Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Ilya Prigogine, Stuart Kauffman, Hermon Daly, James Lovelock, Donella Meadows, Kate Raworth, Daniel Schmachtenberger, Fritjof Capra, Daniel Wahl, Katherina Pistor, Aime Cesaire, Iain McGilchrist, Tim Jackson, Nora Bateson, Elinor Ostrom, Sheila Watt-Cloutier, E.
