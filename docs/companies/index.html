 Sovereign Wallet (MetaMUI) main contributor to BIS Innovation Hub Nordic Project Polaris and offline&nbsp;CBDC Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/it/@jeffreyblum?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Jeffrey Blum</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a><p>In May 2023, the BIS Innovation Hub Nordic Centre published a handbook, discussing the key aspects for CBDC offline payments. Current research and surveys conducted through Project Polaris, the BIS showed a large majority of central banks require offline payments with retail CBDC as a necessity to adopt digital currencies as national legal tender. A survey conducted by the BIS Innovation Hub Nordic Centre shows that 49% of central banks consider offline payments with retail CBDC to be vital, while another 49% deemed it to be advantageous.</p><p>Providing offline payments with CBDC is an important requirement for many central banks for reasons such as resilience, inclusion, privacy and cash resemblance. However, its implementation is complex and involves a number of technology, security and operational considerations that need to be planned and designed for at the earliest possible&nbsp;stages.</p><p>The handbook provides a comprehensive overview of the key aspects of offline payments with CBDC and is intended to serve as a guide for central banks considering implementing offline payments capabilities.</p><p>Among the handbook contributors, private sector technology providers were invited to discuss their solutions covering offline-payment and CBDC related technologies. Sovereign Wallet was the very first responder to meet with BISIH Nordic last year, and presented MetaMUI offline-payment solution.</p><p>Sovereign Wallet’s CEO Phantom Seokgu Yun and CSO Cizar Bachir Brahim gave professional insights on the requirements to a successful implementation of CBDC were acknowledged in the BISIH Handbook. Recognized as the only Korean company to participate in the global project represents that company’s commitment in shaping the future of secure, digital identity platforms.</p><p>This year, more that 95 % of Central Banks around the world have been conducting a series of CBDC pilot tests in order to expand the scope of how digital currency can reshape their economies. Countries partnered with many well known organizations have showcased their successes and difficulties with implementing their CBDC initiatives for the&nbsp;public.</p><p>The BIS handbook is intended to guide central banks in understanding:</p>  the latest available technologies and security&nbsp;measures  the risk and risk management measures available  the privacy issues, inclusion needs, and resilience options  the design and architecture principles involved  the potential operational and change management issues  <p>Sovereign Wallet’s unique solution for Offline CBDC requires the sender to have a registered public key, signed by a known public DID user such as a Bank Node or Network Agent. Verifying users public key establishes trust between participants and allows them to conduct offline transactions until connectivity is reestablish. The proposed solution utilizes the trusted identity of the sender to help mitigate risk while adhering to privacy policies set by regulatory organizations.</p><p>Sovereign Wallet’s involvement in the BIS Handbook for Offline Payments with CBDC, alongside leading global participants, positions the company as a key contributor to the advancement of secure, inclusive, and accessible CBDC solutions. By offering expert insights and sharing its practical expertise, Sovereign Wallet plays an integral role in shaping the industry’s best practices of the potential CBDC brings in both online and offline usage. The collaboration will contribute to the global efforts in creating a trusted digital infrastructure that supports financial inclusion, reduces fraud, and fosters digital innovation.</p><p>Sovereign Wallet Co., Ltd. is a state-of-the-art blockchain company with a focus on digital identity solutions, verification, and finance.

<p>Passkey support, our third passwordless developer option, has arrived for ODD SDK.</p> What are Passkeys? <p><a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/">WebAuthn API</a>, or Passkeys, is a user authentication system that replaces passwords using cryptography. We'll dive more into passkeys, how they work, and how they differ from other passwordless options in this blog post, but first, let's review why developers should consider building passwordless apps.</p> The Benefits of Going Passwordless <p>There are several benefits to going passwordless for both users and developers.</p><p>1) Improved Security - This is a biggy! Machine learning is getting better at cracking passwords, and phishing attempts have gotten more sophisticated. Even the savviest users can fall prey to professional hackers. Data leaks jeopardize the exposed passwords and any accounts where users have re-used that password. App creators must have tight security when creating databases to store user passwords - the GDPR risks are enough to keep anyone up at night.</p><p>Passkeys cannot be guessed, and they are end-to-end encrypted. Phishing apps or websites created to steal users' keys won't work (unlike blockchain wallet keys) because these keys are inextricably linked to the user's device and verified by a special token (which we'll expand on in this post shortly).</p><p>2) Better User Experience - Unless a user has a subscription to a password manager (and even those can get <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/news/lastpass-breaches-cast-doubt-on-password-manager-safety/">compromised</a>), they have to either write down or memorize all their passwords. When they inevitably forget their password, they must go through an account recovery process that can be frustrating when the user is short on time.</p> Fission's Passwordless Options <p>App developers using <a href="https://odd.dev/templates/">ODD SDK</a> currently have two passwordless options - WebCrypto API and WalletAuth. </p><p>WebCrypto API gives the browser fairly low-level cryptographic building blocks, which include encryption and signatures. A user's private key is stored in their browser, and no one, not even the user, can extricate it. If they created their account on their laptop and want to access it on their mobile phone, they have to link their devices to do so (this is a simple process using the <a href="https://github.com/fission-codes/whitepaper/blob/5c1fba894a9fe51811e47865ed62d26e989a0807/accounts/login/awake.md#L4">AWAKE protocol</a>, also part of ODD SDK). </p><p>The upsides of WebCrypto API - it's highly secure and user-friendly. There are many tools built into it for developers to use. The downside - developers need to know what they want to build ahead of time. It's like getting a box of LEGO but no directions.</p><p>WalletAuth allows developers to integrate the Metamask browser extension wallet for user sign-in. When users connect to an ODD SDK app, they can access on-chain data as usual, as well as encrypted off-chain data storage features.</p><p>The upside - it's great for Web3 dapps and Web3 users who are comfortable with blockchain wallets and want to seamlessly work with both on and off-chain data. The downside - users who are not Web3 savvy will be very intimidated by this type of login option.</p> Under the Hood <p>At the beginning of this article, we learned that WebAuthn is a user authentication system that replaces passwords using cryptography. Instead of using a username and password, the user authenticates with a key stored on their device and signs some unique data with that key. </p><p>The unique data is divided into two parts: Client Data and Authenticator Data. <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#dictdef-collectedclientdata">Client Data</a> includes contextual information about the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#webauthn-relying-party">WebAuthn Relying Party</a> and the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#client">WebAuthn Client</a>. <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#sctn-authenticator-data">Authenticator Data</a> includes contextual information that derives its trustworthiness from the WebAuthn Relying Party's assessment of the security of the authenticator. </p><p>In other words, the unique data seeks to understand the relationship between the app (or specifically, the WebAuthn Relying Party who created the app) and the user (specifically, the user agent - i.e. the browser or mobile app they are using) and determines whether the app can securely verify the user. On both sides, there is a layer of abstraction to ensure privacy and trustworthiness.</p><p>After the user signs the unique data, they embed that signature and unique data into a Public Key Credential. It uses the <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/how-fido-works/">FIDO standard</a> and is a container just like JWT that formats the public key, signature, and unique data in a specific way according to the spec. </p> Passkeys in Action <p>Fission engineer Hugo Dias has spent months diving deep into the passkeys spec, learning what works across browsers and operating systems. As a result, he's put together a <a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/passkeys">passkeys library</a> that developers can use to add passkeys support to their ODD apps. </p><p>Hugo has created two demos to demonstrate passkey syncing and sharing.</p><p>This first video shows passkeys syncing across devices with Google Password Manager. Using the Android emulator, we visit <a href="https://passkeys.fission.app/">https://passkeys.fission.app</a> (the version on Hugo's personal domain <code>hugodias.me</code>) and create a new user with a passkey-based login.</p><p>The user is now logged in on Android and can upload and access files.</p><p>Switching to Google Password Manager, we see that the passkey for <code>hugodias.me</code> has been saved and synced.</p><p>We can now switch to a desktop browser, visit the same app, and get a prompt to use a saved passkey. A pin is used to unlock.</p><p>Once logged in, we can see that the picture uploaded on mobile is accessible on a desktop web browser, synced through user WNFS files.</p><p>This second video demonstrates navigating to <a href="https://passkeys.fission.app/">https://passkeys.fission.app</a> using the Android Mobile emulator. <code>hugo-sharing</code> is logged in.</p><p>The website is a progressive web app that is installable on Android, so “Install app” is chosen from the Android Chrome browser menu.</p><p>Once installed, the ODD logo appears on the home screen. After launching, we see that <code>hugo-sharing</code> is still logged in, as it uses the same context as the website version.</p><p>Switching to the Google Photos app, the Android share function is used. Selecting the installed ODD app uploads the photo into the user’s WNFS.</p><p>The share button again uses Android native share functionality, and we can share from the installed ODD PWA app over to WhatsApp (or any other Android app). </p><p>View the <a href="https://github.com/oddsdk/passkeys/tree/main/examples/odd-passkeys-preact">GitHub source notes</a> for more information on these features.</p><p>You can start developing with passkeys in ODD SDK today.

<p>All in all, the metaverse may change the way we, as society, interact and educate ourselves. With all of this in mind, SelfKey strives to develop digital identity solutions that may enhance security and privacy as individuals begin to explore cyberspace.</p>
 Metaverse in a nutshell 
<p>The metaverse is a concept that came to be at the intersection of enhanced physical reality and persistent virtual space. It is centered around shared virtual spaces, consisting of various digital worlds, augmented reality, and the internet.</p>
<p>In simple terms, the metaverse represents a digital universe created and sustained by software, which is accessible through the internet. Within this virtual domain, individuals can interact with each other, as well as their virtual surroundings, in real-time.</p>
<p>For many years, the metaverse existed only as a theoretical concept, residing in the realm of people's imaginations. However, with the continuous advancements in technology, particularly in virtual and augmented reality, cyberspace is gradually capturing widespread attention. Although it is currently limited in scope, it has the potential to encompass endless possibilities in the future.</p>
<p>Depending on the context, cyberspace can serve as a parallel existence alongside the physical world, or it can strive to provide a fully immersive virtual environment. This leaves room for many opportunities for individuals to explore and share knowledge in the metaverse.</p>
 The Benefits of Metaverse 
<p>At its core, the metaverse has tremendous potential to revolutionize various aspects of society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to its capacity to serve as a versatile platform for a wide range of applications, it may completely revolutionize the way we work, study, and socialize. It could facilitate many activities, such as virtual reality gaming, education, business meetings, social networking, and even virtual tourism.</p>
<p>Another notable feature of the metaverse is the possibility for users to create and design avatars. This aligns with SelfKey’s idea of <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_future_of_nfts_selfkeys_customizable_collectibles/">customizable avatars</a>, which may enable individuals to design avatars in any ways they please.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These avatars may enable interaction with other individuals or virtual objects in the metaverse. Furthermore, they may facilitate the creation of digital spaces that can be used for various purposes, such as virtual stores, events, and even entire cities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The development and adoption of the metaverse may offer many potential benefits, such as:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Improved Connectivity&nbsp; 
 Digital Tourism&nbsp; 
 Increased Accessibility 
 Virtual Education 
 New Experiences and Entertainment&nbsp; 
 Streamlined Efficiency 
 
<p>Below, we will further elaborate on these advantages.</p>
 Improved Connectivity 
<p>Cyberspace allows for real-time communication and collaboration between individuals from anywhere around the world. Because physical distance is no longer an issue, individuals are able to build connections and easily collaborate on projects.&nbsp;</p>
 Digital Tourism&nbsp; 
<p>The metaverse may offer amazing opportunities for people to engage in virtual tourism. This means that individuals may delve into virtual recreations of amazing locations from the real, physical world. Additionally, they may be able to experience completely new, fascinating fictional realms which they’ve always dreamt of.&nbsp;</p>
 Increased Accessibility 
<p>Through the power of digital tools and endless creativity, the metaverse may become accessible from anywhere around the world. As long as there are stable internet connections, and with the proper devices, anyone could be part of this immersive experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This feature is particularly important, as it may facilitate participation for individuals with disabilities or mobility constraints.&nbsp;</p>
 Virtual Education 
<p>The internet has provided access to information which surely must’ve made learning much more accessible than ever before. However, cyberspace can bring education to the next level by allowing the creation of immersive, virtual classrooms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, individuals may be able to build realistic, interactive learning environments. This could prove to be incredibly helpful in terms of accessibility and education for young people all around the world.</p>
 New Experiences and Entertainment&nbsp; 
<p>By utilizing the potential of cyberspace, individuals may be able to experience unique scenarios and activities which may not be practical or possible in the physical world. For instance, they could participate in fantasy-based virtual reality games and simulations.&nbsp;</p>
 Streamlined Efficiency 
<p>The metaverse holds potential to streamline and enhance various business and organizational processes. This includes anything from meetings, training, and customer service, and it could facilitate debugging and solving particular technical issues much faster.</p>
<p>All in all, cyberspace represents a transformative landscape with far-reaching implications. It could potentially reshape the way we interact, learn, and engage with the world around us, and beyond. In spite of all these wonderful benefits, though, there are downsides to the metaverse which are worth mentioning.</p>
 The Dark Side of Metaverse 
<p>As stated above, cyberspace holds immense potential and possibilities. However, alongside these exciting prospects, it is crucial to acknowledge the challenges which come with this cutting-edge technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the metaverse indeed raises concerns about health and social isolation, among other crucial factors, we will narrow our discussion to two primary aspects:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Privacy Issues 
 Identity Theft and Hacking 
 
 Privacy Issues 
<p>The metaverse relies on the utilization of Virtual Reality (VR) technology, which, like any cutting-edge innovation, presents its own set of challenges. As an extension of the internet, cyberspace confronts similar digital privacy and security issues, but perhaps at a more concerning level.</p>
<p>VR systems may collect user data, encompassing personal information and behavioral data, with the intention of enhancing the user experience. However, the collection and handling of such data carry inherent risks, including the potential for privacy breaches or unauthorized access.</p>
<p>Moreover, when engaging with VR applications and services developed by third parties, users should be aware that these entities may gather personal data for their own purposes, raising further privacy considerations.</p>
<p>Safeguarding this data is of utmost importance, as mishandling could expose individuals to privacy breaches, compromising their personal information and leaving them susceptible to <a href="https://selfkey.org/data-breaches-risks-and-consequences/">identity theft</a> or misuse.</p>
 Identity Theft and Hacking 
<p>The utilization of VR within the metaverse presents a vulnerable target for identity theft. With the aid of various machine learning algorithms, it may be relatively easy to manipulate sounds and visuals to a degree where they appear genuine.</p>
<p>Furthermore, attackers can exploit virtual reality platforms by introducing deceptive features aimed at extracting personal information from users. This susceptibility, similar to augmented reality, opens the door to ransomware attacks, where hackers compromise platforms and then demand a ransom.</p>
<p>Machine learning technologies also facilitate the manipulation of voices and videos while preserving their realism. If a hacker manages to access motion detection data from a VR headset, they could potentially employ it to generate a digital replica, commonly known as a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/deepfake">deepfake</a>.</p>
<p>A deepfake could then be used by malicious players to impersonate a user, or to try and access private accounts and systems in their name. While that is indeed a terrifying scenario, there are several decentralized solutions which may prevent such disasters.</p>
 How SelfKey May Improve your Metaverse Experience 
<p>Given the multitude of benefits cyberspace offers, it comes as no surprise that malicious actors seek to exploit vulnerabilities within it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With these facts in mind, SelfKey proposes several decentralized solutions which may enhance security and prevent identity theft and other privacy concerns. These methods put a strong emphasis on privacy and security. The end goal is to empower individuals to confidently navigate the digital world.</p>
 SelfKey iD 
<p>An innovative online identity verification method, <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> was designed with the aim to safeguard user privacy and security. By utilizing ZK filters and AI-Powered Proof of Individuality, it strives to prevent unauthorized access to personal online accounts and systems by bots or identity thieves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The purpose of <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">ZK filters</a> is to limit the amount of personal information shared when individuals interact with and engage with other individuals in digital spaces. If the shared data is limited, it may be insufficient for bad players to compromise. And this may enhance overall security and privacy.</p>
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> is utilized with the aim to deter identity thieves from accessing a user’s online accounts with the latter’s stolen digital information. Thanks to AI’s ability to detect duplicates or fake, AI-generated images, SelfKey iD may be able to combat and prevent these attempts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This way, individuals may be able to enjoy the wonders of metaverse with confidence. Even more, they may ensure the privacy and security of their online persona.</p>
 SelfKey's Customizable NFTs 
<p>In the pursuit of a safer and decentralized future, SelfKey recognizes the importance of individuality. To this end, SelfKey may offer the means for individuals to embrace their uniqueness and make a mark in the metaverse through customization.</p>
<p>Through SelfKey's Customizable NFTs, also known as <a href="https://selfkey.org/the_future_of_nfts_selfkeys_customizable_collectibles/">Normies</a>, users can attach these digital assets to their SelfKey iD. And this may allow them to express their originality and gain access to exclusive features.</p>
<p>Normies are composed of Base NFTs and Wearables, offering users countless combinations and possibilities for customization. This provides users with an ideal opportunity to create digital representations that truly reflect their own identities.</p>
 SelfKey's ENS subdomains 
<p>Last, but not least, <a href="https://selfkey.org/selfkey-ens-mass-adoption-of-self-sovereignty-on-blockchain/">SelfKey's ENS subdomains</a> strive to offer equal opportunities for individuals to own and personalize their domains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cost-effectiveness of these subdomains aims to make them affordable for everyone. And to possibly ensure that each person has the opportunity to be the owner of their own digital presence.</p>
<p>By implementing these online identity security solutions, and aiming to create a secure digital environment, SelfKey is striving to contribute to a much safer digital future. The potential of cyberspace and modern technology is immense, and it’s worth being used for the good of the people.&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>Every day, technology reaches new heights, unlocking doors to unimaginable opportunities. However, like any innovation, there are those who will exploit it for their own gain, regardless of the harm caused.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, with the right tools and knowledge, we may be able to prevent such occurrences.</p>
<p>The metaverse holds the power to revolutionize society and provide virtual access to knowledge like never before. But, it is essential to be aware of the accompanying risks. This way, we may navigate these remarkable digital realms safely.</p>
<p>SelfKey’s primary focus revolves around security and privacy. And every individual deserves these fundamental rights. People shouldn't have to risk their privacy and security in the pursuit of convenience or the use of modern-day technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By prioritizing security and privacy, SelfKey strives to empower individuals to embrace technology without sacrificing the safety of their digital identity.</p>

<p>As we navigate an unstable economy, organizations across industries want to be “future-ready,” and that requires systems and processes that can continuously evolve in response to the marketplace demands. For customers who run their operations on SAP, this means modernizing to a cloud ERP platform that supports greater flexibility and agility. However, this is a complex transformation and organizations need guidance on accelerating time to value.</p>



 SAP + IBM 



<p>With our 50-year partnership with SAP, IBM offers the combination of SAP-enabled transformation expertise via <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting">IBM Consulting</a> and enterprise-grade cloud platform capabilities that help accelerate our client’s ERP modernization journey no matter where they’re currently deployed. Only <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/sap">IBM Cloud</a> offers SAP-certified instances on Power and Intel x86 environments for SAP HANA deployments1. This flexibility to continue to run in Power or x86 environments can help accelerate cloud migration of your SAP workloads.</p>



<p>An IDC InfoBrief sponsored by IBM, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/VQWBPDMX">Avoiding Cloud Migration Pitfalls for SAP</a>2, found that clients who deployed SAP ERP on IBM Cloud were able to go live 20% faster as compared to other clouds:</p>







 Purpose-built SAP infrastructure 



<p>IBM Cloud provides a purpose-built SAP infrastructure. It has been leading&nbsp;the benchmarks of SAP ERP throughput performance since 2020 on IBM Power Virtual Server3 and SAP BWH analytics performance since 2021 on Intel Xeon environments4. This helps us meet clients where they are across Power and Intel deployments and modernize without infrastructure re-platforming, thus addressing security risk, cost and downtime.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-52099">Forrester Consulting interviewed</a> clients who deployed SAP solutions globally on IBM Cloud as part of the IBM-commissioned 2023 Total Economic Impact study. They determined an ROI of 212% over 3 years for a composite organization based on interviewed customers who are running their SAP environments in IBM Cloud.</p>



<p>This is what one of the clients, an IT director in manufacturing, had to say about their move to IBM Cloud: “We need to grow [and] need [a solution that will] not have any bottleneck or constraint or surprise. This is why we put in place [IBM Cloud for SAP].”</p>

<p>Private clouds, public clouds, SaaS, on-premises and edge—as organizations leverage a more distributed, robust cloud-based strategy, they can also face more significant management and compliance challenges. This shift to the cloud may have, in many ways, left the traditional enterprise network stranded—no longer transporting the bulk of the enterprise network traffic, which now floats between the clouds and over the public internet.</p>



<p>The probable result of this widely dispersed, distributed world? Application performance is no longer guaranteed, security could be affected and the skills needed for one cloud are not always easily transferable or available in another.</p>



<p>At the same time, for many companies, their applications are their business. Regardless of the cloud provider or where users sit, these applications require dependable, secured connectivity. That’s why it’s time for a new approach, driven by the applications themselves.</p>



 The new network paradigm: Application-centric connectivity 



<p>Yesterday, we launched <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/hybrid-cloud-mesh">IBM Hybrid Cloud Mesh</a>, a multicloud networking solution. When it is generally available later this year, this new SaaS product is designed to allow organizations to establish simple and secured application-centric connectivity. This is engineered for network managers to seamlessly manage and scale network applications across a wide variety of public and private clouds, edge and on-premises.</p>



<p>This application-first approach is the next important networking paradigm. It’s also an evolution from the current “fat pipes” method (which doesn’t differentiate between applications) to one that aligns the network to the needs of the business, its users, and its developers, their <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ci-cd-pipeline">CI/CD pipeline</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops">DevOps cycles</a>. When it’s time to configure new cloud networks and connect applications, our approach is designed to turn weeks into hours and move from manual to automated processes, with robust visibility into performance and minimized risk of IAM misconfigurations.</p>



 What this means for your networks 



<p>Given the complexity of today’s networking environments, we purposely designed Hybrid Cloud Mesh around four basic attributes:</p>



 
 Simple: You’ll find a streamlined deployment process that enables automated workflows and simple network configuration that can be managed via CLI or an intuitive UI. 



 Secured: Critical for today’s business, you’ll find <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/zero-trust">zero-trust architecture</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/end-to-end-encryption">end-to-end encryption</a>, along with segmentation and micro-segmentation. 



 Scalable: Scalable to large enterprise environments, you also have the ability to scale resources based on demand. 



 Seamless: Designed to reduce the barriers between clouds and teams, you can manage services across clouds, with on-demand, intent-driven application-centric connectivity. 
 



 Components of Hybrid Cloud Mesh 



<p>Two main architecture components are key to how the product is designed to work.</p>



 
 Gateways, which act as virtual routers and connectors. These are centrally managed through Mesh Manager and deployed both in the cloud and on customer premises. 



 The Mesh Manager provides the centralized management and control plane for Hybrid Cloud Mesh through a SaaS portal. 
 



<p>Both Gateways and the Mesh Manager are designed to communicate through a set of open, secured APIs and interfaces.</p>



<p>Hybrid Cloud Mesh is engineered to complement existing SD-WANs, service mesh and multicloud networking solutions. You’ll also find crucial benefits that can include the following:</p>



 
 Auto-discovery of cloud infrastructure and applications using the Gateways described above, deployed next to applications both in the cloud and on customer premises. 



 A single centralized management and control plane for your multicloud deployments and sites through Mesh Manager. 



 Addressing silos between CloudOps and DevOps through automated workflows and a shared overlay, enabling rapid application deployment and optimization. 



 A “network follows the application” paradigm that establishes application-level connectivity to streamline application migration to the cloud and moves the network wherever the application is placed. 



 Zero-trust architecture that seamlessly enables end-to-end encryption across the network from application component to application component. 



 Application network optimization with granular visibility and control of application-level connectivity. This is done by streamlining telemetry, root cause analysis and reconfiguration. It provides an intuitive overlay to help address performance issues and generate traffic engineering recommendations.

<p>The global decentralized identity market was valued at $285 million in 2022 and is projected to grow to $6.82 billion by 2027, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 88.7% during the forecast period, according to a new report by <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/10/27/2543009/0/en/Global-Decentralized-Identity-Market-Size-Projected-to-Reach-US-6-822-million-by-2027-Report-by-MarketsandMarkets.html">MarketsandMarkets™.</a> This exponential growth is due to increased security breaches, identity-related fraud incidents, the inefficiency of existing identity management practices, and the lack of end-user control over identity usage.</p>
<p>In today’s highly connected and digital world, secure customer interactions have become a top concern for individuals, organizations, and governments. With the increasing use of digital services, the need for secure and reliable identity verification processes has become more pressing. This is where decentralized identity and Know Your Customer (KYC) processes come into play.</p>
<p>What does decentralized identity mean?</p>
<p>Decentralized identity is a system of identity management based on decentralized and distributed technologies, such as blockchain and peer-to-peer networks. This system, in theory, will provide a digital identity that is not controlled by any central authority, such as a government or corporation. Instead, it is managed by the individual who owns it. This allows the individual to then share only the necessary aspects of their identity to validate themselves in order to interact with different organizations and services online; once the transaction is completed, they can retract their personal identity information if they wish to. Decentralized identity is not yet globally viable, but there are many organizations and governments working to make it real.</p>
<p>What does Know Your Customer (KYC) mean?</p>
<p>KYC is a process used by financial institutions and other organizations to verify the identity of their clients. This is done to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) regulations, as well as to protect against fraud and other financial crimes.</p>
<p>The traditional KYC process involves collecting and storing large amounts of personal information about clients, including their name, date of birth, address, and government-issued ID. This information is often stored in centralized databases that can be attacked by bad actors, making it vulnerable to data breaches and other security threats.</p>
<p>Decentralized KYC processes have the potential to revolutionize the way personal information is managed and verified. By using decentralized identity, individuals can store their identity information in a secure digital wallet that is owned and controlled by them, sharing only parts of their identity as and when needed.</p>
<p>How does decentralized identity benefit organizations?</p>
<p>By adopting decentralized identity, organizations can achieve:</p>
 
 Enhanced security<br>
One of the most significant benefits is enhanced security. Identity systems store identity data on a blockchain, which is a tamper-proof and secure distributed ledger. The decentralized nature of the blockchain means that identity data is not stored in a central location, which reduces the risk of data breaches and identity theft. This is a significant benefit for organizations that store sensitive personal information, such as financial institutions, healthcare providers, and government agencies. 
 
 
 Streamlined identity verification processes<br>
In traditional identity verification systems, individuals often have to repeat the same verification process with multiple organizations. This is time-consuming and can be frustrating. With the adoption of decentralized identity, individuals can share verified identity information with multiple organizations without having to repeat the verification process. This not only saves time, but also reduces the risk of errors and inconsistencies in identity information. 
 
 
 Reduced costs<br>
With decentralized identity, organizations no longer need to store, manage, and verify identity data themselves. From a cost perspective, this can be particularly beneficial for smaller organizations that do not have the resources to build and maintain their own identity verification systems and also reduce the costs associated with fraud prevention and compliance, as it provides a secure way to authenticate identities. 
 
 
 Improved user experience: seamless onboarding<br>
Instead of having to fill out long and complicated forms, users can quickly and easily share their decentralized identity with a business, which speeds up account opening. This can improve the overall customer experience and reduce the likelihood of users abandoning the onboarding process. 
 
<p>To summarize, decentralized identity and KYC are two important concepts that are changing the way we think about online identity and security. By allowing individuals to control and manage their own digital identities, and by decentralizing the KYC process, we can create a more secure, transparent, and efficient online ecosystem. While these technologies are still in the early stages of development, they hold great promise for the future of digital identity and security.</p>

<p>Are you wondering what it’s like to facilitate a remote design sprint? Are you searching for ways to make your sprint work? If yes, then this post is for you! If not, no problem; you can still enjoy the tales of a designer going through his first remote design sprint&nbsp;😀</p><p>I’m a Senior Product Designer at Onfido, an identity verification provider. We used a design sprint format to validate an idea that wasn’t part of our quarterly objectives. Going through the sprint process aligned stakeholders on the overall goal and made everyone part of the solution.</p><p>As you might know already, the design sprint process <a href="https://www.thesprintbook.com/the-design-sprint">is well documented</a>, and you can find plenty of resources across the World Wide Web. So I decided that I would add up to the pile myself! I listed the most useful resources at the end. Suppose you’re searching for good material to prepare for your sprint. Hopefully, you find the following bits of advice and learnings useful for yourself.</p>Screenshot of the completed Miro board&nbsp;:D Preparation is&nbsp;key   Make it easy for yourself to facilitate. Prep in advance for every voting activity, timer, board, etc. You should be able to arrive at the activity and know the steps to follow just by seeing the board. I used this template made by Jake Knapp and Stéph Cruchon 👉 <a href="https://miro.com/miroverse/design-sprint-jake-knapp/">https://miro.com/miroverse/design-sprint-jake-knapp/</a>. I did modify it to include process information like timing and number of votes per&nbsp;person.  Remote means you’ll be on Zoom (video call) all day. PLAN LOTS OF BREAKS! I think it goes without saying, but a 10–15min break can save so much mental space and keep focus and attention from your sprint team. It can also give people space to answer some Slack messages, emails, you know&nbsp;… manage their “real work”. One every hour, give or take, is what we implemented and felt&nbsp;nice.  Keep the book near you! Or any activity reference on your computer. You don’t need to know everything because you will forget them anyway. Before each session, I would skim through the reference to refresh my memory. That helped me be more knowledgeable of the task and be able to give directives easily.  When the facilitator forgets the only material&nbsp;needed…<p>Quick fun fact: I only asked one thing for the team to prepare. Have A4 white paper and a black pen for the Sketching day. 15min before the sketching exercise, I realise… I don’t have A4 paper myself 🤦 So I ran to buy a block of 360 A4 paper… (sorry for the “ill”, I was “race walking” and typing on my phone). Told you you’re going to forget&nbsp;things!</p> Being adaptable is priceless   Problems will surely arise, and you need to be ok dealing with them. A debate that goes for too long, an unplanned drop-out, an unavailable expert/user,&nbsp;… the list goes on. Whatever you plan will be put to the test. Knowing things will change allows you to remove the pressure of perfection. Keep in mind that the sprint must go&nbsp;on!  It is fine to have a break in the middle of an activity to check things (I learned that from trying to be a dungeon master 😉). If you don’t know something, take a 5min break and check your reference or find a solution to the problem. No shame in saying, “Sorry, I don’t know how to proceed right now; let’s have a small break so that I can review the process.” Another solution is to ask your group! How would they prefer to solve the issue? How would they change the activity? What information do they need?&nbsp;…  <p>Not so-quick fact: On Wednesday, you decide many things, from the solution to the flow of the prototype itself. And be sure that your team members will try to modify the decision you made 30 minutes, 1 hour ago. During the storyboarding activity, our group was stuck on “what ifs” and “why not change that”, deep inside conversations about very specific and technical subjects. I was boiling inside as the decisions weren’t happening! Seeing that we were not going anywhere, I put a hard stop on conversations and gave a 10min break for everyone. It allowed me to take a breather, think and regain the lead of the conversation. Sometimes cutting short helps you move&nbsp;forward.</p><p>Time pressure is a stress you will experience. The best advice I can give is: “If you are in a hurry, then slow down.” (unsure where this quote comes from, either from a German or Chinese proverb if you ask&nbsp;Google)</p> The importance of the team you&nbsp;choose   As important as picking an impactful challenge, you need the right people in your team. A person who cares about the issue will show engagement and motivation. These are powerful drivers to have a successful sprint. Team members will stay focused, engage in conversations, and overall put energy into doing things&nbsp;well.  Perspective diversity should come with relevant team members. I’m glad that everyone in the sprint shared and learned something! Humans are curious by nature, so having different points of view will generate engagement through learning and rewards through&nbsp;sharing.  Having people with specific skills can help you design a feasible solution. Luckily we had 2–3 engineers in our team that helped us create a close-to-reality prototype! An interactive, half-coded prototype through Framer suited our use case. You shouldn’t base your choice on this,&nbsp;though.   Engage the team when you&nbsp;can   Within exercises, give them roles or ask them to do some tasks. <a href="https://www.thesprintbook.com/articles/remote-design-sprint-guide">The bible for remote design sprint</a> referenced below advises it. That was also the first feedback I received on the first day: “When you organise post-its or move things from one board to another, you can ask the group to help. You don’t have to do it by yourself! It’ll save time.” And they were right! I decided to involve them more in the day-to-day logistics. Involving them lowered my stress level and slightly improved their attention and engagement in the activity.  Make each person in the team shine during the week. Everyone has a skill or personality trait that can make the week easier or the work better! An engineer solving a problem? Give them a shout-out at the end of the day. Does a Product Manager have the best voice and temper for testing? Allow them to interview. A very knowledgeable team member? Give them 30min to expose their knowledge.  Let them shine even outside of activities! I used Chat GPT to create “inspirational sentences” for every day of the week. One in the morning within an automated Slack message and one at the end of the day in the meeting. This person in our group started to ask for a sentence written in a specific style (like pirate or medieval), which resulted in some excellent impressions and stylistic reading of these quotes. I started to ask them what style did they want each day as well as leaving this person have a little show. That was a great moment between the team and perfect to end each day on a positive&nbsp;note!  <p>Thursday’s end-of-the-day 🤖 chat GPT quote in an evangelist priest&nbsp;style:</p>ChatGPT conversation to create an inspirational sentence for my design sprint team on Thursday after finishing a prototype in one afternoon. TIPS: don’t use the word “quote” if you want something like this. Otherwise, it will get you a quote from someone, not “create&nbsp;one”.<blockquote>Hallelujah, my brothers and sisters! Let us gather ‘round and bear witness to the miracle that is about to unfold before us. For in this very afternoon, through our unwavering faith and tireless labor, we shall bring forth a prototype that shall reign supreme and conquer all doubters! So let us join our hearts and minds together, and let the power of our convictions guide our hands as we march towards glory!&nbsp;Amen!”</blockquote><p>Was our solution the perfect one? No. Did the week help us validate our idea? Mostly. Did we all learn something? Absolutely! This is a reminder that a design sprint is not a process in which you will end up with a fully ready-to-build product. Insights and learnings are the primary output. These will inform a product decision; iterating or building. In our case, we learned that our direction was good, but we needed to refine the solution&nbsp;itself.</p><p>Overall facilitating a design sprint is an excellent exercise for designers. The one we did was a one-off “bubble week” for me. By that, I meant facilitating a design sprint for a team I didn’t work in. This allowed a focus on the process and facilitation aspect of product&nbsp;design.</p><p>Ultimately you practice leading exercises, people and projects using lots of communication skills. Product design is about working with different people, so these skills are useful! I encourage everyone to try a design sprint; it’s a great experience! And obviously, have fun with&nbsp;it.</p><p>Thanks for reading&nbsp;🙂</p><p>Sharing is caring!

In this role, my main duties include: developing social media and marketing strategies to drive engagement and increase followers; creating content and campaigns; analyzing social listening and monitoring data; and conducting internal and external communications, including but not limited to media, KOLs, partners, exchanges, and event organizers.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>What makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains is the fact that it has remained focused on Decentralized Identities (DID) and building the infrastructure and tools for Web3 for the past five years. We employ an exceptional tech team and a devoted marketing and business development team, who are dedicated to our overall&nbsp;vision.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>Ontology offers individuals new opportunities, bringing awareness to DID and giving users back control in order to manage their own personal data and online identities.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>While I have reached many notable milestones throughout my time at Ontology, the most prominent is building our global community from 3 languages to over 30+ languages worldwide. Additionally, the creation of the Harbinger program is an important moment in my career to date. Essentially, it is a network of passionate blockchain and Web3 lovers and contributors. Launched in 2020, it has played a major part in helping us build a strong global community presence.</p> What are you most excited for in your future at Ontology? <p>I’m most excited for more applications for DID and users owning and having complete control over their own data and identities.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>In the future, I anticipate that Ontology will be leading Web3 when it comes to DID. For Web3 more generally, I expect to see mass adoption of Web3 technologies. Just like we witnessed with Web2 and the rapid growth of smartphones and social media, individuals will realize that it’s essential to adopt this technology and understand what it can&nbsp;offer.</p> Contact us <p>- Ontology official website: <a href="https://ont.io/">https://ont.io/</a></p><p>- Email contact: contact@ont.io</p><p>- GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/ontio/">https://github.com/ontio/</a></p><p>- Telegram group: <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetworkCN">https://t.me/OntologyNetwork</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-head-of-social-media-christina-lu-7db02fe1cad0">Meet the Team: Head of Social Media, Christina Lu</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

It also wanted to test the feasibility of offering crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the geography. Indicating considerable buzz for the framework to come into place, the SFC received over 150 responses from the&nbsp;public.</p><p>The new regulations are also considered a milestone as they would let investors trade in major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum from June 1st this&nbsp;year.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/hong-kongs-proposed-asset-regulation-sparks-industry-optimism">Hong Kong’s Proposed Asset Regulation Sparks Industry&nbsp;Optimism</a></p> Current crypto situation <p>The new regulations will considerably impact the crypto climate in Hong Kong, presenting a significant market opportunity for the crypto industry.

And to obtain a license, they would have to furnish a detailed plan for combating money laundering risks and protecting their investors from such breaches and intrusions.</p><a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1656109508668653570?s=20">Image Source</a><p>In a broader sense, the new regulations would help set standards and benchmarks for crypto regulations in Hong Kong, a region actively pursuing the goal of becoming a crypto hub — not only in Asia but at a global scale — for some time&nbsp;now.</p><p>Numbers suggest that over<a href="https://forkast.news/headlines/over-80-web3-firms-set-up-shop-in-hk-ahead-crypto-regulations-take-effect-june/"> 80</a> foreign and Mainland China companies have already expressed interest in setting up their Web3 company through this licensing mechanism. The interest indicates positivity towards norms that advocate system regularization and protection of investor rights and interests.</p> Comparison With Previous Regulatory Frameworks <p>Many new regulations often come at the cost of destabilizing the traditional system, but that is not the case with the Hong Kong crypto licensing rules, as it would subject providers to the same AML and counter-terrorist financing legislation that traditional financial institutions follow. Hence, one can expect a seamless or at least considerably less friction in the transformative process when it becomes effective from June 1st&nbsp;onwards.</p> Implications for Cryptocurrency Exchanges <p>Although the new regime is set to come into effect from June 2023, at least <a href="https://forkast.news/headlines/over-80-web3-firms-set-up-shop-in-hk-ahead-crypto-regulations-take-effect-june/">23 businesses</a>, out of the 80 that expressed interest, according to Hong Kong’s Secretary for Financial Services and Treasury Christopher Hui, are already setting up their presence in Hong Kong. And these 23 not only include crypto exchanges but Web3 security companies, blockchain payment providers, blockchain infrastructure builders, and&nbsp;more.</p> Adaptation strategies of local exchanges <p>Adapting to the imminent regulatory shifts and challenges could be easy for local exchanges by fulfilling the core demand: exhibiting the capability to perform due diligence on their customers and meet Hong Kong’s AML and anti-terrorist financing standards. Only then would it become easier to receive a&nbsp;license!</p> Potential challenges and opportunities <p>The potential challenge may arise from something common to most of the transformative processes worldwide: arranging provisions for compliance and setting up a robust mechanism for conducting adequate due diligence. It involves upskilling the existing compliance team. The team needs to become aware and set up the system following what has been asked&nbsp;for.</p><p>What awaits providers at the end of the compliance and diligence tunnel are enhanced trust from consumers, increased transparency in the system, and the scope of a pumped-up audience&nbsp;base.</p><p>The Hong Kong authorities are also coming out with increased support for virtual asset service providers willing to pass through this regime. For instance, Hong Kong has allocated <a href="https://www.budget.gov.hk/2023/eng/budget10.html">HK$50 million</a> in its annual budget spending to the growth of the Web3 ecosystem.</p> Comparative analysis with other jurisdictions <p>Similar to Hong Kong, a lot of adjacent and global jurisdictions are also proactively taking up the job of regulating virtual assets and the Web3 economy. And crypto entrepreneurs believe that when compared to Singapore and South Korea, Hong Kong’s new crypto regulations would be much similar to Singapore’s approach. Both are focused on protecting investors, institutional and retail&nbsp;alike.</p> Global and Asian Crypto&nbsp;Climate <p>Like Singapore and South Korea, being part of the Asia continent helps Hong Kong become a participant in the most thriving crypto market globally. Out of more than 420 million estimated crypto owners worldwide, more than 260 million are from the Asian market&nbsp;itself.</p> Key trends in global cryptocurrency adoption <p>It has to be kept in mind that Asia is also the most populous geographic region among continents in the world. However, other continents are also picking up speed in terms of gaining adoption and traction.</p><p>The number of owners in North America is more than 54 million, followed by Africa (38 million+), South America (33 million+), Europe (31 million+), and Oceania (15 million+).</p><p>In Asia, while regions like Singapore and Hong Kong are keen to encourage growth in the Web3 ecosystem, some countries like South Korea want to tread cautiously. Hong Kong, on the other hand, is moving forward in a structured way. The current exchange licensing system will be followed by stablecoin regulations in&nbsp;2024.</p> Influence of international regulations <p>Along with its Asian counterparts, there are many countries or regions which are considering introducing similar regulatory systems.</p><p>For instance, the European Parliament has already approved the first set of comprehensive rules to regulate cryptocurrency markets, known as MiCA or Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation.</p><p>Dubai has also set up the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority as a unique body regulating Virtual assets across&nbsp;Dubai.</p><p>All these international regulatory institutions are expected to duly influence the crypto market in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/eu-parliament-greenflags-mica-potential-impact-on-the-crypto-landscape">EU Parliament Greenflags MiCA — Potential Impact on the Crypto Landscape</a></p> History of Cryptocurrency in Hong&nbsp;Kong <p>Hong Kong, for some time now, has been looked at as one of the most preferred crypto destinations in the world. In fact, the <a href="https://forexsuggest.com/worldwide-crypto-readiness-report/">Worldwide Crypto Readiness Report</a> termed Hong Kong as the most crypto-ready location in&nbsp;2022.</p><p>In 2022, Hong Kong topped the charts in all categories, including the number of blockchain startups per 100,000 people and the number of crypto ATMs proportional to the population. The region was ahead of some of the most thriving global economies, including the US and Switzerland.</p><p>Over the years, multiple local crypto companies have emerged in the region, such as Kikitrade, Saxo Crypto Products, MYETHSHOP, CoinUnited.io, and other cryptocurrency trading and educational platforms, hubs, and&nbsp;more.</p> Regulatory Framework and Government Initiatives <p>We have already discussed the form and potential use cases of the upcoming crypto licensing mechanism in Hong Kong. It is also to be noted that the region’s AMLO aligns with the global recommendations of FATF. It requires VASPs across countries to adhere to an anti-money laundering benchmark in countering fraud, breaches, and financing terrorism regulations.</p><p>The Securities and Futures Commission is the primary body looking after the execution of the imminent licensing regime in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p> Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) <p>Founded in 1989, the Commission’s job is to work as an independent statutory body to regulate Hong Kong’s securities and futures markets. Its principal responsibilities are to maintain and promote fairness, efficiency, competitiveness, transparency, and orderliness in the securities and futures industry.</p> Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (AMLO) <p>One of the most crucial legislations that the SFC is bothered with in regulating the crypto industry is the <a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/ord/2022ord015-e.pdf">AMLO</a>. In the Hong Kong special administrative region, the legislation comes with an ordinance. The ordinance amends the laws to apply customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements to virtual asset service providers.</p> Government support and initiatives <p>While regulations are set in place, the Hong Kong government is also keen to keep its support window open for the holistic growth of the Web3 ecosystem.</p><p>Cyberport came up with Web3@Cyberport in the early half of the 2023–24 financial year. According to the <a href="https://www.budget.gov.hk/2023/eng/budget10.html">official budget document</a>, HK$50 million was allocated to expedite the Web3 ecosystem development by “organizing major international seminars” and promoting “cross-sectoral business cooperation.”</p> Collaboration with Mainland&nbsp;China <p>When it comes to calibrating the region’s crypto strategies with that of Mainland China, Xiao Feng, the Chairman of the Hong Kong Crypto exchange HashKey, believes that the Hong Kong government’s emphasis is on practicing different laws from mainland China under the “One Country, Two Systems” framework.</p> Market Opportunities and Key&nbsp;Players <p>The<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/en/Welcome-to-the-Fintech-Contact-Point/List-of-licensed-virtual-asset-trading-platforms"> SFC list</a> of licensed virtual asset trading platforms in Hong Kong includes OSL Digital Securities Limited and Hash Blockchain Limited. Invariably the list of such exchanges is set to grow in the coming days, with local exchanges coming up in accordance with the regime and increasing their market share and accelerating growth.</p><p>Brands like Hex Trust, fully licensed, insured digital asset custodians, are also active in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p><p>NUTS Finance is a blockchain development lab active in Hong Kong that focuses on building secure, composable, open-source technology to enable decentralized finance services. DTTD, another Hong Kong-based service, makes managing NFTs across multiple crypto wallets easy. Xversem, a Hong Kong-located service, aims at building effective Bitcoin wallets for Web3. Hong Kong-based Pictta is a mobile-first, gasless, and social-enabled NFT marketplace.</p><p>Such examples are many, and the bouquet of such service &amp; product companies is bound to grow in the coming&nbsp;days.</p> Challenges and&nbsp;Risks <p>It is evident that implementing the licensing mechanism will come with its share of challenges and&nbsp;risks.</p><p>Any new regulation introduced in an existing market is bound to create friction in the system. Companies will have to exhibit to the regulators and their consumers that they can do due diligence and protect the investor from potential hacks, attacks, breaches, laundering, and other possible mismanagement of funds. At the same time, they will have to comply with global benchmarks for protecting user&nbsp;data.</p><p>Necessarily, it would have to be a consistent effort, demanding a fixed cost to be incurred by businesses every quarter. There are chances that occasional volatility in an emergent market like crypto will take a toll on the company’s bottom line. It is essential to have efficient fund management practices in place so that companies do not lack in their compliance and diligence efforts.</p><p>The People’s Republic of China’s <a href="https://www.adb.org/publications/the-peoples-republic-of-chinas-digital-yuan-its-environment-design-and-implications">Digital Yuan</a> promised to achieve a “relatively high degree of financial inclusion” and aid in developing “various large-scale financial platforms” that reduce the cost of providing financial services. Its presence could also play a decisive role in shaping the future of crypto services in Hong&nbsp;Kong.</p> Future Outlook and&nbsp;Trends <p>Despite all these potential challenges, Hong Kong is looking toward a brighter future in crypto services. Blockchain and DeFi are high-potential areas with a lot to offer to people who still lack access to traditional finance&nbsp;avenues.</p><p>Merging of blockchain and crypto services to the traditional finance functions of lending and borrowing, underwriting, etc., have already started. One only needs to be careful of promises made to promote the new economic order that Web3 has the power to introduce through the decentralization route.</p> Final Note <p>The imminent regulations and licensing regimes in Hong Kong present both risks and opportunities to the crypto investor and user communities.</p><p>While regulatory compliance may lower the speed of innovation and pump up costs, the investors stand to gain from a more protective atmosphere in general. There is also the scope for businesses to enjoy long-term premiums by offering enhanced trust and transparency.</p><p>Every stakeholder must stay updated on the shifts and changes happening in the regime. It always helps steer ahead in an evolving market with less friction and optimal cost-efficiency.</p> Mickey and the Hong Kong Crypto&nbsp;Quest  Additional Resources <p><a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/counmtg/papers/cm20221207cb3-876-1-e.pdf">https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/counmtg/papers/cm20221207cb3-876-1-e.pdf</a></p><p><a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/bills/b202206241.pdf">https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/bills/b202206241.pdf</a></p><p><a href="https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/ord/2022ord015-e.pdf">https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2022/english/ord/2022ord015-e.pdf</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network/the-shyft-perspective-hong-kongs-new-crypto-climate-d47fcbd59076">The Shyft Perspective: Hong Kong’s New Crypto Climate</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network">Shyft Network</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Summary:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Together with IBM, Deltares is working to enhance and expand the reach of its Aquality app, formerly called the Nitrate app. The tool can help farmers improve water quality, protect biodiversity, save on fertilizer costs and make farming practices more sustainable. 



 The Aquality app leverages technologies such as machine learning to help communities detect nitrate pollution and other quality characteristics in water and is experimenting with artificial intelligence to provide feedback and recommendations to farmers. 



 IBM is accepting proposals for the third cohort of the IBM Sustainability Accelerator — focused on water management solutions — until May 31st, 2023. 
 


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/initiatives/ibm-sustainability-accelerator/water">Apply to the 3rd Cohort by 5/31</a>



<p>Maintaining good water quality is crucial for the overall well-being of people and the environment. Yet, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/water-access">reports have said</a> that one in four people do not have access to safe drinking water. The world is making progress on clean water and sanitation, but is still far behind its target to meet Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6: ensuring access to water and sanitation for all.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Agriculture is one of the main sources of contamination in the water we use to drink, fish, participate in recreational activities and more. According to <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/environmental-impacts-of-food">reports</a>, 78% of global ocean and freshwater pollution with excess nutrients is caused by agriculture.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nutrients, pesticides and other harmful chemicals commonly used by farmers enter the water through various channels, including runoff from fields and irrigation systems. This results in eutrophication: the over-enrichment of water by nutrients such as nitrogen, which can create severe ecological and human health consequences. For example, too much nitrate in water will stimulate algae growth, which can then deprive the water of oxygen needed by fish and other organisms that live in the water.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Farmers also want to optimize their fertilizer use for economic reasons. In an ideal situation, they would be able to track the amount of fertilizer they need in order to make the best use of their resources, helping them to save money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortunately, there is a solution in development, all thanks to the power of data and human-centered design.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p></p> 



 A solution to improve farming’s impact on water quality&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Monitoring nitrate levels is critical to managing and improving water quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why Deltares, a non-profit research organization based in the Netherlands, teamed up with IBM to enhance and expand the reach of its Aquality app: to find a tech solution that helps farmers monitor nitrate levels and give insights into nutrient losses and local water quality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This app, originally created by Deltares, is free for users and can help farmers improve water quality, protect biodiversity, save on fertilizer costs and make farming practices more sustainable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deltares joined <a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/initiatives/ibm-sustainability-accelerator">the IBM Sustainability Accelerator</a> to implement a new user interface designed to make the app more accessible for farmers, add more value to the user, and increase adoption. After completing the first phase with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/garage">the IBM Garage</a>, a new version of the app will become available in the next few months with enhanced user experience, measurement recording and information sharing capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This solution is being developed to support farmers with the intention of using IBM technology, such as artificial intelligence, to provide an easy and accessible platform to engage with other farmers and to share water quality knowledge with communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;“The main goal is to provide farmers — even those who aren’t the most technologically savvy — with a tool that helps them to optimize their resources, which is advantageous to both the farmer and the planet,” said Joachim Rozemeijer, a water quality researcher at Deltares. “IBM’s technology and expertise has been instrumental in helping us achieve this mission.”&nbsp;</p>



 Improving water quality with human-centered design&nbsp; 



<p>Another key component of the project is the use of <a href="https://medium.com/ibm-ix-northern-europe/accelerating-sustainable-agriculture-by-leveraging-the-power-of-human-centered-design-and-2215cb5a007f">IBM’s Enterprise Design Thinking framework</a> to create value for the business, people and the planet. The framework was applied to assess the app from a user perspective to bring more value to communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ve been doing a lot of research, talking to farmers, but also agricultural advisors, people from water authorities, and even researchers who use the app currently,” said Michelle ten Pas, a UX Design Consultant at IBM helping with the redesign of the app. “We translated those needs that we identified through the user research, and we implemented them by redesigning the app in a way that meets their needs.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many enhancements have already been made to the usability, accessibility and functionality of the Aquality app. For example, to make it easier to understand how the app works, the team added instructions in the app that explain how to take measurements, which is particularly helpful for first-time users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other new functionalities that the team hopes to add based on farmer feedback include the ability to measure nitrate in soil, adding measurements of phosphate and ammonium in water, setting location labels that can be reused by farmers, enabling users to share measurements within groups to ease collaboration and even adding a page within the app for farmers to order the equipment they need. The new version of the app is expected to go live in the coming months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The global Aquality app user community currently consists of over 600 active users and thousands of direct beneficiaries, in particular in the Netherlands. For example, measurements from the App inform environmental monitoring and management efforts in the provinces of Limburg and Zeeland. Further, the App is now being piloted by users in Denmark, France, South Africa and the United States, which provides an opportunity to continue testing the app with more farmers to increase awareness and address a greater variety of needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Solutions for real-world impact&nbsp; 



<p>To help protect our environment and aid farmers around the world, utilizing sustainable agriculture systems is critical. This project is a great example of how technology and partnerships can help solve some of the most urgent environmental challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“What makes me proud about this project is that I can really contribute to something that matters,” said ten Pas. “I think you see a lot that people from my generation are looking for meaning in their work, and something where they can make an impact. And I think this project is exactly that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But progress can’t end here. IBM announced in March that it is currently accepting proposals for its third cohort focused on water management solutions, providing more opportunities to support solutions like the Aquality app. Nonprofit and governmental organizations <a href="https://www.ibm.com/impact/initiatives/ibm-sustainability-accelerator/water">are encouraged to apply by May 31, 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>

			  Lautaro Giambroni is Product Owner&nbsp;at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>Hi there! I’m Lautaro Giambroni, a Product Owner at Tokeny. I’m 27 years old and was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I earned my engineering degree there and later pursued a master’s degree in financial markets in Spain.<br>
<br>
From a young age, I’ve been interested in how technology and digital products shape the world and improve people’s lives. It’s a passion that has driven me to continue my career in this field, and in recent years, I’ve been closely following the exciting developments in the blockchain space.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Before joining Tokeny, I worked in various companies related to the financial and banking sector. As a UX designer, product manager, and innovation consultant, I gained experience and insights into the industry. However, I couldn’t help but notice the outdated structures and practices that seemed to hinder innovation in the sector.<br>
<br>
Seeking to make a real impact, I came across Tokeny. What really stood out to me was the innovative approach to leveraging blockchain technology to transform financial operations in companies, as well as their commitment to bringing the benefits of blockchain to society.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Working here is an awesome experience. The best part is the team I get to work with, who are not only highly skilled but also share the same passion to make finance easy-to-access and efficient for everyone via our leading tokenization platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The work we do is demanding, but it’s also highly rewarding. Our product is growing at a fast pace, and keeping up with the disruptive innovations in the DeFi industry can be a challenge. However, seeing the team’s hard work come to fruition after a release makes it all worth it.</p>
<p>Being part of a company that is driving real change in the industry is something I’m grateful for every day. The tech industry is an exciting place to be, and being part of a team that is leading the way is truly amazing.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>There are two things that really ignite my passion: meeting new cultures and learning new skills. I’ve had the opportunity to live in different countries, and that experience has fueled my desire to explore new places, try new foods, and meet people from all walks of life. In addition to that, I’m always looking to learn new skills. Whether it’s taking up a new hobby or improving my professional background, I’m eager to expand my knowledge and challenge myself. Lately, I’ve been getting into surfing, and I started practicing analogic photography.</p>
<p>Overall, I think it’s important to stay curious and keep pushing yourself beyond your comfort zone. Life is all about growth and learning, and I’m passionate about embracing that journey and seeing where it takes me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>Over the past decade, my home country has faced one of the worst financial crises in its recent history, marked by high unemployment rates, inflation, and a lack of economic stability. This has caused many young people, including myself, to leave in search of a better future. It’s a difficult reality that I would love to see change.<br>
<br>
I strongly believe that decentralized finance could have an impact. Especially in a country where the monetary policy has been mismanaged, and lack of transparency has led to a loss of trust in local currency. Ultimately, my dream is to contribute to creating better conditions for the people in my home country.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>As a future Tokeny employee, you will have the opportunity to learn and grow as a professional in a dynamic and innovative environment. We work hard to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the world of tokenization, and we’re constantly looking for new ways to innovate and make a difference.<br>
<br>
So, my advice to any prospective employee is simple: join the team and be prepared to work hard, learn a lot, and make a real difference in the world of tokenization. We will be excited to have you on board!<br>
</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>What excites me the most about Tokeny’s future is the tremendous potential for growth in the tokenization market. Over the past few years, we’ve seen significant growth in this space, and it’s estimated that the market will continue to grow at an unprecedented rate.</p>
<p>Being part of a company at the forefront of this market is truly amazing. Our platform is designed to empower firms seeking to digitize their operations and benefit from the latest advancements in technology.</p>
<p>I am proud to be part of a company that is driving real change in the industry, and I’m excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Decentralized Identities in all their facets have been a hot topic at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2023">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2023 (EIC)</a>, which ran in Berlin last week. Just a few days before, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/04/12/linkedin-and-microsoft-entra-introduce-a-new-way-to-verify-your-workplace/">announced</a> their support for Verified Workplace in LinkedIn using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-verified-id">Microsoft Entra Verified ID</a>.</p>
<p>Verifying the workplace</p>
<p>What Microsoft announced is focused on a particular use case, the verification of workplaces of LinkedIn members. It builds on multi-step verification.</p>
<p>The entry level is workplace email verification. There is little friction in that. Organizations can verify the work mail of their employees based on a lightweight WebApp adding to the Microsoft Entra Verified ID service, which again requires a Microsoft Entra Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant. Factually, this allows issuing verified credentials/IDs based on Azure AD or any other OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Microsoft also will provide, together with its partner Clear, a government identity verification and binding to this. This adds another level of proof.</p>
<p>The third step then is a wallet for professionals that, in the first phase, can accept verified credentials. Enterprises can issue credentials to their employees that can be shared with LinkedIn or to Microsoft Authenticator for verification beyond LinkedIn. This thus integrates both the Microsoft Authenticator and LinkedIn – relying parties that are talking to the Authenticator also can talk to LinkedIn and the Authenticator can be used for extended verification scenarios.</p>
<p>Microsoft is basing this on the (still emerging set of) standards around decentralized identity, making it interoperable.</p>
<p>The first step into practice and towards critical mass</p>
<p>While the announcement is focused on a specific use case, it is an important step forward towards the ubiquitous use of decentralized identities:</p>
 
 It demonstrates a concrete, practical application of decentralized identities. 
 It builds on standards for interoperability. 
 It is supported by a growing partner ecosystem. 
 It neatly integrates with Microsoft Entra (including Azure Active Directory), LinkedIn, etc., and can be integrated with further solutions. 
 It provides concrete value to the users. 
 It helps in creating a critical mass of users. 
 
<p>At the EIC, I’ve illustrated my talk about decentralized identity in the enterprise with the employee and partner onboarding use case, where a verified government ID is used for initial onboarding and proofs of employment and job title/role are used for partner onboarding. In the public preview, Microsoft is demonstrating such a use case in combination with Entitlement Management, a feature within Microsoft Entra.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to seeing broader adoption of the Decentralized Identity model across the globe. Approaches such as the one announced by Microsoft can help it happen earlier.</p>

 A Step-by-Step Guide! <p>Embarking on your DeFi journey with Ontology just got easier! With the power of iZUMi Finance, you can now swap your ONG for ONT in a few simple steps. This guide will walk you through the process, helping you navigate the decentralized exchange (DEX) like a pro. So, whether you’re a seasoned DeFi enthusiast or a newcomer to the space, let’s get started and master the art of swapping!</p> Three steps on how to turn ONG into ONT via the&nbsp;DEX:  Step 1: Transfer ONG (Ontology) to ONG (ORC20) with Ontology&nbsp;Bridge   Go to: <a href="https://bridge.ont.io/transfer">https://bridge.ont.io</a>, connect non-EVM wallet and EVM wallet. You should see your wallet address displayed once&nbsp;done.    Click the ONG Transfer button as shown in the figure&nbsp;below.  Choose Non-EVM from the Wallet column (Your native address will be recognized automatically then) and fill in the EVM address (To which ORC-20 ONG will be&nbsp;sent)  Click “Transfer” when everything is good, make sure you have enough ONG for the gas fee (0.05 ONG each transaction).   Step 2: Use iziSwap to swap ONG (ORC-20) to WONT&nbsp;(ORC-20)   Go to: <a href="https://izumi.finance/trade/swap">https://izumi.finance/trade/swap</a>, locate in the top right corner and click the “Connect Wallet” button to connect metamask wallet. Also, switch to “Ontology” in your wallet’s network settings.  Time to swap “ONG” into “WONT”. The top token or “from” placeholder depicts the token you own (ONG in this scenario), while the second token or “to” placeholder represents the token you receive (WONT in this scenario) after the successful swap.  Double check the amount you want to swap and make sure you prepare enough ORC-20 ONG for the gas fee (Around 0.5 ONG for each transaction).  Click swap and confirm the transaction. If the transaction is successful, a message will appear in the bottom right corner of the&nbsp;page.   Step 3: Bridge WONT (ORC20) to ONT (Ontology) with Ontology&nbsp;Bridge   Go to: <a href="https://bridge.ont.io/transfer">https://bridge.ont.io</a> again.This time we should use Token&nbsp;Bridge.  Let’s choose “WONT” in the assets list and ensure the asset will be bridged from ORC-20 into Ontology&nbsp;native.  Double check the amount and make sure you have enough ORC-20 ONG for the gas fee (Around 0.15 ONG normally).  Click Swap and confirm the transaction. You ONT will be available in a short&nbsp;time.   About iZUMi&nbsp;Finance <p><a href="https://izumi.finance/home">iZUMi Finance</a> is a DeFi protocol providing one-stop Liquidity as a Service (LaaS), dedicated to building a top DEX and providing liquidity service on ZK-rollups and multi-chains. iZUMi Finance has two products, iZiSwap and LiquidBox. iZiSwap is the first and top on-chain Order Book DEX driven by iZUMi’s innovative DL-AMM and peer-to-pool Order Book design, providing CEX experience to DEX users on Layer 2.

<p><a href="http://www.entrust.com/vmc">Entrust Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs)</a> are digital certificates that enable organizations to create a more immersive and personalized email experience by displaying their registered trademark logo in the avatar slot alongside emails. This helps them elevate their brand and stand out in their prospects’ crowded inbox. Because VMCs are linked with DMARC technology, they also potentially reduce email spoofing.</p>
<p>Entrust started working on VMCs in June 2017. Entrust is proud to have issued the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/newsroom/press-releases/2019/verified-mark-certificates#:~:text=Entrust%20is%20the%20first%20certification,for%20organizations%20that%20support%20VMCs.">world’s first VMC</a> (in Sept 2019), <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2020/07/why-googles-verified-mark-certificates-pilot-matters/">performed a pilot with Gmail (in July 2020)</a>, and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/government-organizations-can-now-get-verified-mark-certificates-for-their-outgoing-emails/#:~:text=Entrust%20is%20proud%20to%20announce,national%20IT%20agency%2C%20Statens%20IT.">issued the world’s first Government Mark Certificate (in March 2023)</a>. Entrust has also partnered with Red Sift to offer organizations an integrated BIMI solution to enhance their email security and boost their brand recognition in the inbox.</p>
<p>Now, Gmail has included an additional benefit to email senders and users in the Gmail desktop web browser UI – a new checkmark icon that proactively indicates the sender of the email has verified that it owns the domain and the logo displayed in the avatar slot. This new checkmark is only available when DMARC and VMC are both implemented.</p>
<p>This first image shows how the new checkmark icon will appear in the Gmail application “detail message” view.&nbsp; The checkmark is shown in white against a blue badge, to the right of the VMC logo and the sender’s display name:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additionally, there’s a new tool tip that displays the following confirmation text when a user hovers over the checkmark.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As you see, the tool tip message confirms that the email sender has verified that it owns its email domain and logo as specified in the VMC.</p>
<p><a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/05/expanding-gmail-security-BIMI.html?m=0">Gmail is actively rolling out this VMC checkmark icon now</a>, so all desktop web browser Gmail users should see these new icons soon. Gmail has not yet announced how this might appear in mobile environments but Entrust expects there will be coordination of Gmail UIs across their other environments.</p>
<p>This checkmark icon is a good visual cue for recipients to identify verified email senders. Entrust strongly supports this new VMC enhancement and believes it will be embraced by email senders and users.</p>

<p>Business leaders know that their organization’s success relies on its ability to keep essential processes running smoothly and efficiently. Communication technology like email and Slack have become so essential that business grinds to a halt if there are gaps in service. Furthermore, businesses are increasingly reliant on applications like Jira and ServiceNow to manage workflows and IT service management. Any issues with these applications can lead to decreased productivity, wasted time and potential security risks.</p>



<p>IT Operations managers monitor and track many KPIs, like service-level agreement (SLA) adherence, mean resolution time and many more. Two of the most difficult performance indicators for IT operations managers to keep under control are ticket reassignments and ticket reopens. For example, if a user’s email is down, they submit a ticket to IT. If that ticket is reassigned to second agent or team for resolution after that initial assignment, it signals inefficiencies in the process. Similarly with ticket reopens: if a ticket is reopened after being resolved, it indicates the need to address an issue with training or IT resources.</p>



<p>Because IT processes like ticket management are manual, they invite discrepancies and human error which can easily impact important KPIs and other downstream activities. Ticket management KPIs are critical for understanding how effective your IT support team is and the quality of service being provided to your customers. However, managing ticket reassignments and ticket reopens is a time-consuming and complex process that requires a deep understanding of IT operations and customer support best practices.</p>



 Let automation work for you 



<p>Adding an automation layer to IT service management improves cross-department communication by giving IT leaders the ability to send out detailed reports and information on a predefined schedule, streamlines workflows by giving easy access to data insights, and increases customer satisfaction by ensuring everything is working as they expect it to.</p>



<p>Although AI and machine learning are often touted as the solution to all problems, it’s important to understand that automating a flawed process can make things worse. Not only can it lead to more inefficiencies, but it can also add to expenses by requiring additional resources to correct mistakes and deal with delays.</p>



<p>To stay ahead of potential service disruptions, processes must be optimized before they can be automated. The first step towards optimization requires giving IT service managers tools to see the flow of tasks and tickets within their system. Auto-discovery tools like process mining — a tool gaining popularity with organizations — does just that. Process Applications for process mining helps IT service managers analyze event logs from various IT systems and applications so they can stay one step ahead of inefficiencies, improve processes and get the insight they need to keep the business running like a well-oiled machine.</p>



 Leaders recognize the importance of process optimization 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/signup?formid=urx-52126">According to a 2023 commissioned process optimization study conducted by Forrester Consulting</a>, 78% of decision-makers polled look at continuous process optimization as a high or critical priority; however, approximately 50% of the surveyed decision-makers confess that their companies lack the expertise to implement process optimization plans.&nbsp;As the demand for process optimization grows, the supply of professionals is not keeping pace. Proper IT service management requires a deep understanding of business processes, the ability to find solutions to inefficiencies and successfully implement improvements.</p>



<p>The same decision-makers are particularly critical of their company’s ability to analyze, reengineer and automate processes. Despite being confident in their ability to review processes with the goal of continuous improvement, only 55% of decision-makers come from firms that can consistently implement this step. This gap could be the result of several factors: lack of resources and expertise being top among them.</p>



<p>36% of respondents polled primarily use automated discovery tools like process mining, which improve their ability to analyze processes objectively and at scale. Continuous process optimization and technological breakthroughs in process mining are now competitive differentiators.&nbsp;</p>



 Process mining helps determine if a process is suitable for automation 



<p>The technology behind process mining provides a digital twin of the processes so that users can pinpoint hot spots for automation and other improvement opportunities. Process mining can be applied to a wide range of use cases to help IT teams test changes within the solution itself before using it in the organization or making investments in new technology and prevent inefficiencies by triggering actions like prompt notifications. IT operations managers have a real challenge in gathering and analyzing data from different systems or users, and Process Applications can help overcome these challenges by providing prebuilt assets that allow users to quickly dive into their analysis and start improvement initiatives immediately.</p>



<p>Process mining is an ideal solution to start planning for automation. Front-end communication, back-end workflow, and the thousands of processes that govern the supply chain, customer operations, IT operations, finance and administration, quality, and sustainability can benefit from process mining as they involve multiple stakeholders and can be complex and challenging to manage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A tool like process mining can help IT operations teams save time and money and improve customer satisfaction. It gives IT operations managers the ability to track KPIs like SLA adherence and mean resolution time across the organization. For example, let’s say an employee needs access to their email or Webex. Their manager raises a request on a tool like ServiceNow, JIRA, or Remedy.</p>



<p>The process mining application helps IT operations managers manage that ticket through the entire life cycle of the request, ensuring service level agreements (SLAs) are met without incurring penalties, and that critical services are managed efficiently until the ticket is closed. The application ensures IT service managers don’t need to manually track tickets and employees are more satisfied with IT support knowing their requests are being handled quickly and efficiently.</p>



<p>Identifying the right processes to improve, getting the necessary resources and support, and changing how people work can be difficult. A process mining tool helps service managers see the flow of tasks and tickets within their system. It provides an overview of the different paths’ tickets take, as they move from open to resolved to closed. The tool helps to identify areas of improvement in ticket management, such as multiple tickets being assigned to one person only to get reassigned to another, or tickets being constantly reopened. Process Applications also assist IT operations managers in setting KPIs, such as time required to resolve a ticket based on severity or priority, which improves the overall efficiency of ticket management and helps to meet SLAs in a timely fashion.</p>



 IBM Process Application delivers the process mining tools your organization needs 



<p>Innovative tools like process mining allow your experts to accomplish faster and more successful process optimization projects. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/process-mining/integrations/it-service-management-servicenow">The IT Service Management for ServiceNow Process Application</a> from IBM Consulting is a prebuilt Process Application offered inside IBM Process Mining. The application includes modules like a direct connector for ServiceNow which speeds up the process of importing data and getting started with process analyses.</p>

<p>This is the story of how we built an open source company that specializes in developing the identity, data, and compute protocols for the future of the Internet.</p>Poutine Meetup in Berlin<p>Fission’s co-founder and CEO, <a href="https://plnetwork.xyz/@boris">Boris Mann</a>, has been on the Internet for a long time. As one of the first 1,000 bloggers in the world, Boris loved being able to publish content online but recognized the challenges to making self-publishing possible for everyone. Running a server under your desk at home, installing software on the command line, and generally having the necessary technical know-how is neither realistic nor equitable.</p><p>Discovering the Drupal open source content management system and its worldwide network of contributors was an eye-opener: here was software and more importantly community working on making it possible for anyone to publish online. Boris became an active contributor, including helping to organize events that grow from 40 people to 1000s of Drupalcon attendees, and helping to form the Drupal Association.</p><p>At the same time, large proprietary software companies, like Microsoft, were working hard to retain their market position. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_documents">They viewed open source software as a dangerous competitor</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend,_and_extinguish">adopted internal policies</a> to thwart the advancement of FOSS. </p><p>Boris continues to advocate for and share open source code, data, and community principles. Building better together, so that people can have more control and agency of technology for better communication and collaboration online and off. </p> <p>Fission's co-founder and CTO, Brooklyn Zelenka, started studying music composition at the University of Calgary and doing graphic design projects on the side. She picked up Photoshop and Illustrator and eventually dropped out of music school and moved to Vancouver. About five years later, while doing graphic design professionally at a friend's startup, she was given a book on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and asked if she could learn a bit of web development. By the end of the year, Brooklyn had taught herself over 20 programming languages.</p><p>Brooklyn became deeply involved in the local meetup scene, running multiple communities across many topics. She became involved in international functional programming and distributed systems conferences after she ported the Haskell standard library to Elixir. (It later tuned out that functional data structures are a great fit for IPLD).</p><p>Eventually, Brooklyn decided she wanted to return to startups, and was hired by a company based out of San Francisco. She and her Vancouver co-worker rented a desk from Boris's <a href="https://fullstack.ca/">co-working space</a>, which is how they met!</p><p>Brooklyn went on to do consulting work for Facebook, Uber, Kickstarter, and many others. After writing the same boilerplate for the nth time and fighting with k8s, she started to feel that there must be a better way. She began early designs of things that would eventually find their way into Fission.</p><p>After a couple of years away travelling as a digital nomad, she she returned to Vancouver in 2017. She joined Boris as principal engineer at a company working on Ethereum-based, legally compliant infrastructure. Brooklyn then focused on writing a formally verifiable smart contract language that was also human-readable (so that a lawyer could review the code).</p>April 2019, RUN EVM event in Berlin<p>Excited by the potential of a backend as a service, aka the "world computer" of Ethereum, Boris and Brooklyn together founded a company called SPADE ("Special Projects and Decentralized Engineering") and received an important grant from the ConsenSys Tachyon program to work on Ethereum Status Codes, which were later renamed FISSION Codes. They were one of only two companies to receive an open-source grant (the other being WalletConnect).</p><p>While building FISSION Codes, both Boris and Brooklyn started to recognize that the real challenge for both Web2 and Web3 was the increasing complexity of putting together full stack applications – plus the devops needs of running such apps. Except now, these problems were compounded by complex security needs and a more fervent demand for user control and agency. Users had been burned by Web2 exploitation and were becoming more discerning and knowledgeable about how their privacy was being compromised.</p><p>While the Web3 of blockchain, decentralized web, and p2p components were new and everyone was learning, all of the same challenges of needing to gain all of the increasingly complex skills of full stack app development and deployment were there.</p><p>After spending time on core Ethereum development &amp; community building, our cofounders asked themselves:</p><p>What if some of the emerging concepts of &nbsp;Web3 – advances in distributed systems, cryptography, and self verifiable data structures – could make it dramatically easier for front end developers to build apps, without having to become full stack developers and devops experts.</p><p>And so Fission the company was born: building an edge stack with identity, data, and compute components that enables front-end developers to build local-first apps while respecting user privacy and agency. </p>The 2019 Diffusion Hackathon grand winners, Marco and Eugene, were gifted a 4L jug of maple syrup for using the first version of the Fission service in their winning entry<p>In a Web2 stack, to put an app online, you need to run a server to hold user data. All of this data is visible to the people that run the service, and the incentives are typically to lock the users' data into the service. Never mind scaling and devops server management.</p><p>In prototyping, front end developers use dummy data in the browser without having to worry about setting up a server.</p><p>What if they could make that much simpler prototype development capable of running the production data? It would make development much easier for developers, and data wouldn't have to leave the device! By default, it would have to respect user agency. </p><p>Fission (as it is now known) became a member of the <a href="https://protocol.ai/">Protocol Labs Network</a> and started to build on top of the IPFS protocol. This direction would lead to the inventions of UCAN (decentralized user auth) and WNFS (user file system on top of IPFS with encrypted private data).</p><p>Today <a href="https://odd.dev/">our front end developer SDK</a> has evolved its storage solution into an overall data solution. We are working on a far-edge database called <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/on-building-a-decentralized-database/">Rhizome</a> to be added to the mix. We continue to iterate and collaborate with others on UCAN and other decentralized identity tools and have done an initial release of the final piece of our edge stack: content-addressed computation on IPFS with the <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/ipvm-computation-ipfs/">InterPlanetary Virtual Machine (IPVM</a>) specification.</p><p>Our commitment to community building and open-source development is unwavering, and we look forward to continuing to grow and collaborate within this robust and exciting ecosystem.</p>

<p>This is a guest blog by <a href="https://medium.com/u/49286d46d497">Abu Majid</a>, Storyteller at Story x&nbsp;Design</p><p>As a multimedia producer at Nairobi-based Story x Design, I’ve had the pleasure of collaborating on four Caribou Digital research projects since October 2020. When Caribou Digital reached out in February 2022 asking to expand our participatory video storytelling methodology to meet the needs of digital platform workers living with disabilities, we had the opportunity to rethink our processes, from training, to filming, to the accessibility of our final&nbsp;edits.</p><p>An <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/a-platform-of-their-own-our-experience-running-a-participatory-video-storytelling-project-e90075e3f69d">earlier blog</a> by Story x Design Director Miranda Grant outlines our original participatory storytelling methods and offers tips for those interested in this filmmaking process. This blog reflects on our experience of collaborating with persons living with disabilities to create short documentaries about their lives and how we adapted our methods to fit their needs. We recount our design process, learnings, successes, and contingencies to barriers encountered.</p><p>This research, co-led by <a href="https://inable.org/">InAble</a> and Caribou Digital and in partnership with Mastercard Foundation, aims to understand the experiences and challenges of young people living with disabilities and engaging on platforms for work. With the support of InAble and Caribou Digital, we designed open-ended questionnaires to elicit authentic reflections on the challenges faced and strategies employed by platform workers living with disabilities. Our agile approach allowed us to stay nimble, learn from participants, and adjust as required throughout the&nbsp;process.</p> Three key adjustments to our&nbsp;process   Adapting the project design to ensure access for all. In order to make our collaboration with persons living with disabilities beneficial to them, we tweaked some of our supporting tools (i.e., film practice manuals, questionnaires, film prompts) for ease of use to all participants.  Working with interpreters and aides to accommodate multiple abilities. With the great support of a sign language interpreter and individual aides, we were able to help each participant identify and express the stories most important to them through a mix of in-person and one-on-one narrative and technical skills training. This hybrid mentoring approach helped participants gain confidence in their abilities to self-direct their own&nbsp;stories.  Diversifying post-production. Our versatile post-production, leveraging WhatsApp video / voice calls / voice notes and regular carrier calls, but also importantly in-person training, enabled us to stay in close touch with the participants who faced different types of challenges creating their&nbsp;content.   Adapting the project&nbsp;design  1. Adapting resources <p>Our participatory self-shot video diaries approach was developed in 2020 as a countermeasure to the COVID-19 lockdown. The framework requires the deployment of equipment and intensive multimedia skills training to all participants, where success depends on participants’ comprehension and willingness to contribute on their own time. So this process can be time and resource intensive. However, even after the COVID-19 lockdown was lifted, we decided to carry on with the self-shot video approach as participants expressed their eagerness to tell their own stories and willingness to take up the role of self-directing.</p><p>As per our usual process, we distributed a small smartphone production kit to each participant. But made a few adjustments to accommodate those who took&nbsp;part.</p><p>The phones were preloaded with:</p>  Six instructional videos on the downloadable VLC phone application. These instructional videos were embedded with a voiceover (VO) feature that defined and detailed basic film terms and techniques. The VO not only navigated participants with visual impairment through the content but also offered relatable examples for all to try. See a sample Story x Design instructional video&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qd3m6aJBzAs">here</a>.  A readable softcopy instructional manual for the native <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.marvin.talkback&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1">TalkBack</a> assistive application for both the visually and hearing impaired.  An audio instructional manual for the visually impaired participants and their&nbsp;aides.  Hardcopy instructional manuals for&nbsp;all.  A softcopy questionnaire and prompt document readable with TalkBack apps for all participants.   2. Working with aides during skills training and&nbsp;filming <p>We gathered with five of the six participants and their aides in a conference room in Thika Town, 44 kilometers from Nairobi City, a central location for all in attendance.</p><p>Together with participants and aides, we explored the self-shot video diaries format, examining proper camera orientation, sound capture, lighting, framing, and many more good film practices. Ongoing virtual mentorship provided participants with the support necessary to overcome technical and creative challenges over the course of production.</p><p>The close collaboration with interpreters and aides was key to enabling transparent communication with participants, in particular about the use of participants’ images and published videos. With clearly drafted agreement and image release forms, participants with their aides as witnesses, read, understood and after being satisfied, signed onto contributing to the&nbsp;project.</p><p>Participants and aides were compensated for their work on this project. Participants received ongoing payments to purchase internet bundles for uploading large media files throughout production, as well as a one-time payment on project completion. Aides were provided with per diems for their efforts in supporting filming.</p> 3. Diversifying post-production <p>A key addition to this project was Monica Onyango, a sign language interpreter who helped translate footage submitted by the participants with hearing impairment. This enabled the post-production team to transcribe and edit subtitles to build a story that honored the contributors.</p><p>In one case where one of the visually impaired participants could not manage to find help in filming and sending more footage, we successfully sought her consent to use her voice notes as voice overs to missing segments in her story. This was in line with our desire to create a safe, accommodating space that offered an equal platform for expression.</p> Challenges and contingencies <p>We recognized that there would be challenges that we had not faced before. Although the six participants all come from one country and one time zone, and had experience navigating digital platforms, none had experience self-directing for video or taking part in a collaborative multimedia project of this&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Beyond the usual challenges in supporting the production of self-directed videos, here are some specific challenges people with disabilities faced.</p>  The need for in-person support. In addition to an initial in-person training, participants required one-on-one mentorship and refresher sessions throughout the duration of the project. When internet connections failed, team members needed to visit participants with visual impairment in person for troubleshooting and automatic upload restoration. Similarly, when capturing B-roll proved too challenging for participants, we traveled to support, while taking great care to follow participants’ self-direction and maintain the participatory project&nbsp;design.  The availability of aides. Even with per diems on offer, most aides were unavailable on occasion, particularly because most aides selected by participants were fellow students, and others had full-time jobs. Consequently, production was often halted as the visually impaired participants waited for&nbsp;help.  The authenticity of participants’ stories. We wanted to highlight participants’ authentic techniques of navigating the digital world to find work and understand their challenges. However, we refrained from asking questions beyond what participants revealed, allowing them to authentically share their successes and obstacles, instead of only emphasizing their disabilities.   Self-determination <p>The most gratifying measure of achievement for all of us is the fact that the expressions of all participants were not dictated, directed, or curtailed. At each stage of the project, participants had full control of their stories and authority on what to feature in their final&nbsp;videos.</p><p>All contributors stated that they felt liberated and supported throughout the projects, which made even the most difficult moments feel like blips in the project’s timeline.</p><p>To those looking to produce user-generated content in collaboration with people from all walks of life, we hope these learnings serve you well. There are many measures to evaluate a film, documentary, or piece of text, but no number can ever be placed on the impact of people feeling seen, listened to, and&nbsp;moved.</p><p><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSJyLOKwzy5_ghJMy-gG50twQMN6TYKC3">Watch The Youth With Disabilities Digital Platform Experience videos&nbsp;here.</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/persons-living-with-disabilities-self-directing-their-own-stories-93e2f5d4e8c">Persons Living With Disabilities Self-Directing Their Own Stories</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>To help companies better deliver on their marketing vision and scale their marketing business processes, managed marketing services (MMS) offshore has become a fast growing trend. According to an Everest Group® <a href="http://everestgrp.com/webinars/marketing-services-five-things-you-need-to-know-to-capture-value-in-the-current-environment-webinar.html">study</a>, offshore MMS centers increased over 50% from 2019 to 2022. What’s more, the number of offshore full-time equivalent employees (FTE) jumped 115%.</p>



 What are managed marketing services (MMS)? 



<p>Managed marketing services are the outsourcing of marketing business processes, such as campaign planning and execution, content management and enhancement, marketing analytics and other marketing support (SEO, social listening and loyalty).</p>



<p>Traditionally, business processes tied to marketing are manual tasks completed in-house and onshore. These processes are becoming more complex as AI and automation eliminate the tasks that can be executed through technology, leaving only the most challenging work behind.</p>



<p>This complexity translates into higher costs and makes it difficult for marketing teams to keep up. In a recent <a href="https://w3.ibm.com/services/lighthouse/documents/198396">IBM Institute for Business Value report</a>, 55% of respondents reported challenges coordinating effectively with different teams within marketing.</p>



<p>For big brands across all industries, today’s marketing campaigns are customized for specific audiences. These campaigns often need to be tailored to meet requirements in specific regions, which means navigating various regulations and standards.</p>



<p>While core creative and strategy campaigns are kept primarily in-house, marketing leaders are turning to MMS and tapping into their business and technology expertise to accelerate digital marketing operations, bridge talent shortages and fill technology skill gaps.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/marketing">IBM Consulting</a> offers managed marketing services that help clients improve their customer journeys by bringing together strategy, experience, technology and operations. IBM’s cross-functional team of experts helps companies transform their marketing organizations by taking on marketing functions.</p>



<p>Benefits include improved market performance and reduced costs, revenue growth through deep customer understanding and actionable insights, and exceptional experiences for customers and marketers.</p>



 Leveraging MMS for personalization at scale 



<p>Personalization builds brand loyalty by creating customer experiences (CXs) specifically designed for each audience. This leads to stronger customer relationships, which leads to higher customer value. Today, a service or retail organization might have 20 to 30 campaigns delivered to different audiences across numerous modalities (spanning paid social, email, push notification, texts and more).</p>



<p>The act of delivering such personalized messaging is a complex challenge. Marketing teams struggle to deliver relevant content and communications at scale.</p>



<p>The main areas of opportunity for businesses who leverage MMS for personalization at scale include campaign support, content management, customer experience, and marketing and media support. These components come together to create end-to-end operations efficiency, experience optimization and data optimization.</p>



 1. Campaign Support 



<p>Managed marketing services for campaign support transform marketing organizations by removing complexity across people, processes and platforms to create intelligent workflows and drive more value. MMS for campaign support includes:</p>



 
 Design and planning 



 Execution 



 Optimization 



 Performance evaluation 
 



 2. Content management 



<p>Content&nbsp;management with MMS involves collecting and managing content so it can be personalized and deployed at scale. When effectively managed across an organization, content can be used to engage customers, automate business processes and enhance collaboration. MMS for content management includes:</p>



 
 Content localization and optimization 



 Content migration 



 Content personalization 



 Digital asset management 
 



 3. Customer experience 



<p>Great customer experiences are built on data-driven insights. Managed marketing services provide the hyper-personalization needed to build customer loyalty and reduce churn. MMS for customer experience includes:</p>



 
 User experience strategy 



 Journey mapping 



 Segmentation 



 Predictive modeling 



 Social listening 



 Customer data management 
 



 4. Marketing and media support 



<p>Leveraging state-of-the-art AI solutions ensures optimization of targets, channels, messages and actions.MMS support around data and analytics answers questions such as: Who clicked on an online ad? Did that action turn into a lead? Did the customer make a purchase? What time did this occur? All this data can be fed back into the campaign’s execution to continually improve its effectiveness. MMS for marketing and media support includes:</p>



 
 Commerce cataloging and curation 



 Social/mobile command center 



 Channel optimization 
 



 Transforming the customer experience in financial services 



<p>Recently, a national financial services company was challenged with scaling its marketing operations to address sudden growth in campaign volume and complexity while maintaining superior member experience with no increase in budget. To carry out this transformation, the organization worked with IBM to redesign its operating model.</p>



<p>The IBM team provided consulting services to support operational and organizational alignment around journey-based marketing that dramatically changed engagement with customers, prospects and suspects. The overall transformation simplified processes and infused automation in creative and campaign execution.</p>



 Accelerating marketing performance 



<p>By executing MMS to achieve personalization at scale, businesses have seen great success. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/7ZBYW9LN">One retailer saw</a> a 176% increase in online revenue from target segments, a 25% increase in online conversion rates and a 10% average increase in order size after personalizing their digital presence across touchpoints with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/ibmix">IBM iX®</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/marketing">IBM’s managed marketing services</a> provide a flexible framework that allows our clients to accelerate a shift to digital marketing and achieve personalization at scale. We do this by supplementing marketing operations to transform, automate or change workflows so businesses can innovate, keep up with evolving customer needs and stay ahead of the competition.</p>

<p>As part of my hosting duties on the Entrust Engage podcast, I’ve had the pleasure of speaking to some outstanding guests on a variety of topics from the science behind quantum computers themselves, to impacts post-quantum will have on digital security. In the latest episode, I was pleased to get a perspective I hadn’t yet – that of an analyst – when I was joined by guest speaker, Forrester Principal Analyst Sandy Carielli. As we set up the discussion for the episode, here are some of the insights she provided on the state of post-quantum preparedness:</p>
<p>Samantha Mabey: Where do you currently feel like organizations are with looking at PQ and kicking off preparations to prepare against and mitigate the threat?</p>
<p>Sandy Carielli: Organizations are in the early stages of PQ preparation. The financial services and public sectors are the farthest ahead in this area, not surprising given the sensitivity of the data that traverses their systems. The Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Practices Act signed by President Biden at the end of last year speaks to the attention that government is placing on PQ, and the recently unveiled National Cybersecurity Strategy also stresses the importance of planning for the transition to post-quantum cryptography. However, even those industries paying close attention to PQ are at the early stages – aside from a few pilots and proofs of concept, organizations are primarily at the planning stage, with some kicking off cryptographic inventories.</p>
<p>SM: What do you foresee being some of the greatest challenges that organizations will face in preparing for the migration to post-quantum cyrptography?</p>
<p>SC: Cryptographic migration is never easy – previous migrations, such as from SHA-1 to SHA-256, have taken years. Even increasing the key size, such as moving from 1024 to 2048-bit RSA, doesn’t happen overnight. The migration from RSA or ECC to a post-quantum algorithm will be even more complicated – given how deeply embedded cryptographic functions are in code and devices, rip and replace is rarely simple. For software and systems that organizations develop themselves, development teams will need to replace existing cryptographic code with new libraries, but standard implementations of the NIST selected algorithms aren’t widespread. Then there’s the supply chain issue – organizations will rely on their partners and vendors to update cryptographic implementations in their own products before the organization can fully migrate to PQ.</p>
<p>SM: While there is a consensus that the threat (of a quantum computer being able to break traditional public key cryptography in use today) is possibly a decade away, there is a more immediate threat known as “harvest now, decrypt later”. Do you feel like there is a lack of awareness of this threat and that it further justifies that the need to prepare for PQ now?</p>
<p>SC: The “harvest now, decrypt later” threat is understood in pockets, such as government and financial services, and these are the areas where that threat is critical – customers’ bank account numbers and citizens’ government identification numbers are not likely to change in ten or twenty years. This is why these sectors have started to prepare and must continue to do so – they realize that they will need to have migrated to PQ long before a quantum computer is able to break traditional public key cryptography, and that attackers won’t be able to decrypt any PQ-encrypted data that they harvest. Outside of that, security leaders are not as aware of the “harvest now, decrypt later” threat – leaders must realize that any harvested data protected with RSA or ECC could be vulnerable later, including account information, intellectual property, and personal information (which an attacker could use as blackmail material). Broader awareness of the “harvest now, decrypt later” threat would help organizations support PQ preparation strategies.</p>

<p>Today, utilities and many other industries use drones extensively to conduct surveys, map assets and monitor business operations. They use drones for tasks as simple as aerial photography or as complex as sophisticated data collection and processing. <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/commercial-drone-market-102171">The global commercial drone market is projected to grow from USD 8.15 billion in 2022 to USD 47.38 billion by 2029, at a CAGR of 28.58% in the forecast period</a>.</p>



<p>Different drone requirements require different investments such as commercial drone pilots with specialized continuous training, cutting-edge software and equipment that supports technical payloads (such as LiDAR, thermal cameras and more). The complexity of the task determines the cost and availability of functions, as well as how data is processed and integrated.</p>



 Capgemini and IBM collaborate to drive the future of drone potential 



<p>Capgemini’s Energy and Utilities Industry Platform, in collaboration with IBM Ecosystem Engineering GSI Lab, has developed Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS).</p>



<p>Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS), is a Software as a Service (SaaS)-based offering that is hardware independent and fully scalable. It promises end-to-end solutions to manage and monitor a fleet of drones, runs inspection missions to capture high-quality data, accesses inspection reports and derives actionable information through AI-driven analytics—all through a single platform.</p>



<p>DaaS is an intelligent, cloud-based, multi-tenant offering for data processing, data storage and data analysis. It can offer data on demand to different business units within an organization, with the help of various sensors and payloads. The services are activated through access management for data collection, analysis and event monitoring in existing drones which are managed by clients and businesses.</p>



<p>Additionally, DaaS has the potential to leverage smart technologies such as IoT, sensors, 5G, edge analytics and machine learning to improve the monitoring and visualization of assets operations. The flexibility of DaaS in offering a multiplicity of data collection services for different industry use cases makes it unique. For example, for switchyard inspection, a drone would carry thermal imaging cameras, while for an overhead asset survey and inspection, appropriate LiDAR sensors would be used to capture data.</p>



<p>Capgemini reinforces our partnership with IBM Ecosystem with the introduction of a&nbsp;futuristic and sustainable offering that is poised to revolutionize asset management. With our innovative drone-based predictive maintenance solution, we are transforming asset management to the next level.</p>


<a href="https://www.capgemini.com/about-us/technology-partners/ibm/">Contact our Partner Capgemini</a>



 Building with IBM 



<p>The DaaS offering uses IBM’s Maximo Application Suite (MAS) and Cloud Pak for Data (CP4D) using Industry 4.0 standards. IBM functions as a catalyst in Capgemini’s mission to chart a technologically sound and futuristic course for its global clients.</p>



<p>DaaS uses MAS and CP4D, which have the capability to store, organize and analyze data in the following ways:</p>



 Maximo Application Suite (MAS) 



<p>Maximo Application Suite is an asset management solution that manages the entire lifecycle of assets. EAM solutions are gaining adoption as enterprises look for technology-driven solutions that can reduce downtime and maintenance cost, increase asset durability and enhance overall efficiency. The data captured by the sensors and housed in the cloud flow into real-time monitoring for 24/7 visibility into your assets, enabling the Predictive Failure Model. DaaS leverages IBM® Maximo® Visual Inspection and puts the power of AI computer vision into the hands of subject matter experts. DaaS uses built-in deep learning models that learn by analyzing images and video streams for classification. Using object anomaly detection, the system dramatically improves production quality and speed. Visual analytics models can also predict a product’s final quality based on current levels of quality.</p>



<p>Industry use case: A fully functional digital twin is the result of MAS in action. It is a digital representation of your entire system and processes. Digital twins allow you to effectively model operations, monitor every aspect of your operation and optimize the output of your system. Digital twins also enable better information sharing between parties—minimizing downtime and creating effective communication between asset OEMs, owners, operators and maintainers.</p>



 Data Fabric 



<p>DaaS is built on CP4D that, together with Data Fabric, allows Data Virtualization which procures data from surround systems (such as data warehouses) and generates insights on the fly. Intelligent chatbots powered by Watson® Assistant can dynamically and positively alter the business experience. Knowledge catalogues can help organize data effectively, and the data refinery provides out-of-box models for data cleansing. Watson® Discovery in CP4D can help ingest unstructured data (such as inspection reports, progress reports and OEM documentation) and prescribe appropriate SOPs to improve overall asset handling. MVI and CP4D together empower DaaS by providing an edge in visual inspection and foreseeing challenges.</p>



<p>Industry use case: DaaS integrates with IBM’s Health Safety and Environment (HSE) Teams that can build and deploy ML models to analyze and digitize work images and verify compliance by ensuring adherence to the work permits issued (cold or hot work). These ML models can also identify the adherence of the workforce deployed (number of workers approved versus actual deployed) and the overall work hygiene at the site. Additionally, they can monitor vehicle movement and parking in specific zones and generate alerts of vehicles trespassing in no-go areas.</p>



<p>This joint offering testifies to the strength of Capgemini’s partnership with IBM. DaaS has a multi-fold potential to increase efficiencies across industries which are futuristically dependent on drones. In a nutshell, DaaS provides simplified asset and value optimization.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo">Learn more about the MAS platform</a>



 DaaS and beyond 



<p>DaaS can be considered for deployment under different scenarios to improve asset surveillance, operational efficiency, industrial safety, environment and compliance. A single multitenant SaaS solution can be used by the renewable industry for multiple jobs such as initial site selection, potential solar and wind energy assessments, topographical and strategic surveys of solar and wind farms, and aerial monitoring of solar and wind assets. In the mining industry, different activities related to health, safety and environment (along with hazards in mines) can be captured and analyzed by different models using the DaaS application. In the oil and gas industry, various activities such as monitoring stack emissions, checking the spread of air-borne pollutants, maintaining assets (to detect leakage, damage or risks) and ensuring safety can be performed using a single DaaS solution.</p>



<p>The advantage of using DaaS is that industry professionals can focus on their core operations, and the service can be customized (while data collection and monitoring can be outsourced based on specific data capture requirements).</p>



<p>Most importantly, DaaS aims to remove the need for the industry to invest its own money in multiple drone hardware and application developments, pilot training and clearances.</p>



<p>DaaS is easy to scale and substantially cuts development costs and time. There is no specific installation or configuration needed based on the activity being performed. The access rights to the DaaS application can be managed as per set policies (which ensures security and enables smart data processing and seamless integration with on-prem/cloud enterprise applications without the need of customization).</p>

 The world of finance is rapidly evolving and at the heart of this transformation is the emergence of digital currencies. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), in particular, have been a topic of increasing interest among global central banks. Coinfirm, as a leader in blockchain analytics and anti-money laundering (AML) solutions, closely follows these developments. Today, we delve into the latest updates from the European Central Bank (ECB) on their ongoing project – the digital euro. 



 The Digital Euro: Prioritizing the Euro Area 



<p>According to a recent presentation from the ECB, the primary focus of the digital euro project is to serve the needs of the euro area. The ECB plans to gradually introduce different use cases for the digital euro, aiming to make it accessible to everyone within the euro area before expanding to users outside this zone. This phased approach is designed to prevent the project from becoming overly complex while ensuring it meets the needs of its primary users.</p>



 Exploring International Opportunities 



<p>The ECB recognizes the significant potential of an international dimension for the digital euro. It aims to enable access to and use of the digital euro outside the euro area without requiring currency conversion. Furthermore, the bank acknowledges the need for interoperability to facilitate cross-currency payments. The ECB’s foresight in considering these broader opportunities is a promising indicator of the digital euro’s future utility.</p>



 A Rising Tide of CBDC Projects 



<p>The ECB isn’t alone in this digital currency exploration. In fact, a recent report by the<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/bank-for-international-settlements/"> Bank for International Settlements </a>(BIS) shows a substantial rise in CBDC projects around the world. The ECB is actively supporting international CBDC initiatives, collaborating with the BIS,<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/g7/"> G7,</a> and<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/international-monetary-fund-imf/"> International Monetary Fund (IMF) </a>among others. This collective effort by central banks worldwide underscores the significance of CBDCs in the future of finance.</p>



 The International Use Cases of the Digital Euro 



<p>When it comes to the use of the digital euro outside the euro area, the ECB is considering several scenarios. These include cross-border payments in digital euro, payments in digital euro outside the euro area, and use by visitors. The rules for geographical access will be determined by legislation, and if permitted, access could be extended to consumers and merchants in the European Economic Area and selected non-EU countries.</p>



 Interoperability of Digital Euro with Other CBDCs 



<p>One of the key factors in the success of the digital euro will be its interoperability with other CBDCs. The ECB has proposed two models to facilitate this: the interlinking model, which allows transactions without participation in each system, and the single system model, which involves a single system across multiple currencies.</p>



 Wholesale Central Bank Money Settlement: A New Initiative 



<p>The ECB is looking to contribute to digital innovation while ensuring that central bank money remains a monetary anchor. To this end, it has announced a new initiative on wholesale central bank money settlement. A new Eurosystem task force has been established to explore new technologies that could facilitate interaction between TARGET services and distributed ledger technology (DLT) platforms.</p>



 Final Thoughts 



<p>As an organization deeply entrenched in the<a href="https://www.coinfirm.com/encyclopedia/blockchain/"> blockchain </a>and digital currency space, Coinfirm recognizes the potential of CBDCs to revolutionize financial systems globally. We are excited to see how the ECB’s exploration of the digital euro progresses and will continue to provide our expertise and solutions in AML and blockchain analytics to support this evolution.</p>

<p>During this development cycle we have focused our lens on Sweden in particular, specifically with the continued support for Swedish BankID. Additionally, we have performed expected security and life-cycle management development. For full details, please head over to review the <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20231/pages/9008381963/Identity+Server+2023.1+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>.</p>
 Features 
 Swedish BankID 
<p>Throughout the Nordics, the ability to strongly identify oneself is considered to be second nature. The countries have invested substantial time over the last twenty years ensuring that each citizen and resident can perform many of their day-to-day tasks online. To carry this out, one needs to have a strongly authenticated digital identification method.</p>
<p>Within Sweden, this is predominantly <a href="https://www.bankid.com/en/privat/skaffa-bankid">BankID.</a> Since our original support of BankID via CIBA (Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication) back in the summer of 2018, things have changed. We have reviewed the BankID Relying Party Guidelines (v3.7) and developed an authentication adaptor to enable you to directly configure BankID within the Identity Platform. This means both two device flow, and the more commonly used single device flow, are supported. Now your users can strongly authenticate your web page or mobile app directly on their mobile device.</p>
 Focus Sweden 
<p>Full support for BankID coupled with our existing support for <a href="https://frejaeid.com/en/home/">Freja eID</a> and <a href="https://www.svipe.com/">Svipe</a> means that you can empower your users to authenticate with the most common services in Sweden. It’s well known that Ubisecure has a long history of supporting the Finnish population with a full suite of authentication options, from banking (TUPAS, which is now the FTN), through social logins (O365, Google and Apple), as well as specialised authenticators. &nbsp;Our latest release demonstrates our commitment towards Sweden, and we continue to develop the Identity Platform with a pan-European focus. We will be carrying out additional work over the next year to develop animated QR codes, required in 2024 by BankID. If there is an authenticator you need, that we are not yet offering, please contact Support or your account team and let us know. We work alongside our customers to ensure our Identity Platform evolves in line with your needs and expectations.</p>
 Improved Security 
<p>Ongoing security maintenance is, of course, paramount. As we maintain the Identity Platform, we continue to improve both its functionality and security. During this release cycle, we have focused on updating Wildfly (to Wildfly 26). We have also updated OpenLDAP to 2.5.14, and Redis support to 6.2.8. Support of Linux Redhat 8 has also been tested. We always encourage you to upgrade to the latest possible release of our software as it provides the most secure and feature-rich Identity Platform possible. As always, you can find highlights of the changes on the <a href="https://ubisecuredev.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IDS20231/pages/9008381963/Identity+Server+2023.1+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a> along with a link to the detailed example of the logging changes found on our Developer Portal.</p>
 Looking Forward 
<p>In the short term, we are continuing work towards ongoing improvements that will be available in the next month, when we release updates for both SSO (SSO 9.2.1) and CustomerID (CID 6.2.1). Over the summer, we are continuing the maintenance cycle as usual.

 It’s estimated that by 2024, 74% of fraudulent card transactions worldwide will involve card-not-present (CNP) transactions. The PSD2 regulatory framework is designed to protect customers and financial institutions operating in the digital payment ecosystem from fraud, especially CNP fraud.

<p>It’s estimated that by 2024, 74% of fraudulent card transactions worldwide will involve <a href="https://moneyzine.com/personal-finance-resources/credit-card-fraud-statistics/">card-not-present (CNP) transactions</a>. The PSD2 regulatory framework is designed to protect customers and financial institutions operating in the digital payment ecosystem from fraud, especially CNP fraud.</p>  
 What is PSD2 SCA?  
<p>The revised Payment Services Directive, more generally known as&nbsp; PSD2, is a regulation that has been implemented in Europe, covering countries in the EEA, Monaco and the UK. Its main goals are to improve customer choice among payment providers, protect customer safety, and combat payment fraud. One key aspect of PSD2 is its obligation for all companies that provide payment services, including banks, financial institutions or other payment service providers (PSPs), to use Strong Customer Authentication (SCA).&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The PSD2 SCA requirements oblige relevant companies to enhance customer security around payments by deploying <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-multi-factor-authentication">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> for relevant transactions. MFA means that the customer must verify their identity by providing two or more factors of authentication. The guidelines on PSD2 SCA also note that authentication must be performed in a manner that protects customer data.&nbsp;</p> 
 Who Needs to Comply with PSD2 SCA?&nbsp;  
<p>Who falls under the umbrella of PSD2 SCA compliance? Well, it's not just the traditional players in the banking industry. Thanks to PSD2, new players like Payment Initiation Service Providers (PISPs) and Account Information Service Providers (AISPs) have entered the scene. PISPs act as intermediaries between customers' banks (or where their money is) and sellers of goods or services. AISPs, upon user permission, consolidate all user financial information (such as deposits, loans, and direct debits) in one place.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>If your company falls into these categories, you need to adhere to the PSD2 SCA requirements when <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/intro/mip-online/2018/html/1803_revisedpsd.en.html">providing the following services</a>:</p> 
  
  Payment initiation services (these inform a seller that the customer has proceeded through an online purchase)  
  Account access (when a user, or a third-party service provider, asks their bank to inform them of their financial situation)  
  Card-based instructions (when a customer asks their bank or PSP to pay someone from their account)  
  
<p>If the payment or information instruction is initiated and processed in the regulation’s area, it must follow PSD2 SCA guidelines. For US companies, this could apply, for example, if they have a European-based entity or are looking to provide the specific services mentioned to EU citizens.</p> 
<p>Organizations are required to decline transactions that do not meet SCA requirements. There are exemptions for small transactions (less than €30), where the financial institution can prove it is a low-risk transaction or where the customer has whitelisted the service provider, such as for a direct debit of a phone or electricity bill.</p> 
 How to Implement PSD2 SCA  
<p>To comply with the PSD2 SCA requirements, organizations must ensure that their customer authentication meets the <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/documents/files/documents/10180/1761863/314bd4d5-ccad-47f8-bb11-84933e863944/Final%20draft%20RTS%20on%20SCA%20and%20CSC%20under%20PSD2%20%28EBA-RTS-2017-02%29.pdf">regulatory technical standards</a> (RTS) set out for PSD2 SCA. This involves implementing MFA for relevant transactions and adhering to&nbsp; other specifications detailed in the RTS. These include:</p> 
  
  Dynamic linking of remote payments (creating a unique code specifying payee and amount to reduce fraud) should be based on technologies such as digital signatures or cryptographically underpinned validity assertions using keys.&nbsp;  
  Special advice should be given about the length or complexity of knowledge factors and the algorithms underpinning possession and inherence factors.&nbsp;  
  The application of PSD2 SCA should strike a balance between enhanced security for relevant payments and user-friendliness and accessibility.&nbsp;  
  Payments and PSD2 SCA elements must have separation. For example, if a smart device is used to make a payment and also counts as a factor of authentication, there must be a clear process to differentiate them.&nbsp;  
  
 Benefits of PSD2 SCA  
<p>Beyond regulatory compliance, PSD2 SCA brings other significant benefits to financial institutions and their customers, including improved customer security, fraud reduction, and a better user experience.&nbsp;</p> 
 Improved Customer Security  
<p>First and foremost, PSD2 SCA enhances customer security by raising the bar for authentication. With MFA in place, it becomes much harder for attackers to impersonate users and carry out fraudulent activities. While there are still issues around <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/passwordless-vs-mfa">allowing knowledge factors (namely passwords) in MFA</a> as they can be easily phished or brute forced, mandating MFA is a major step towards a more secure online world for consumers.</p> 
 Reduced Fraud  
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-account-takeover">Fraud committed through account takeover</a>, which uses a victim’s card or bank details to purchase items, can create significant distrust between the customer and the firm involved, even if neither party was at fault. Reducing payment fraud fosters greater trust in online transactions, making customers more comfortable with making purchases and boosting revenue opportunities for service providers.</p> 
 Better User Experience  
<p>The PSD2 SCA regulation recognizes the importance of maintaining a user-friendly process. Nobody wants frustrated customers <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/customer-authentication-tips-for-safer-shopping">abandoning their shopping carts</a> due to cumbersome authentication requirements or forgotten passwords. The specification for being accessible and user-friendly means companies complying with PSD2 SCA should consider how their authentication stream impacts the user and <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/tips-for-low-friction-authentication">how it can be as frictionless as possible.</a></p> 
 What’s Next?  
<p>Earlier this year, the European Commission presented a study on the <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/f6f80336-a3aa-11ed-b508-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-280122910">application and impact of PSD2</a>. The study follows a period of <a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/regulation-and-supervision/consultations/finance-2022-psd2-review_en">open consultations into revisions of PSD2</a> legislation. It is widely expected that a PSD3 framework will be announced, but its timing and the extent of the revisions have not yet been made public.</p> 
 Comply With PSD2 SCA and Improve Customer Experience With HYPR  
<p>The PSD2 regulates financial transactions in the EU and other countries such as the UK and Norway. Its strong customer authentication (SCA) requirement obliges financial institutions, banks and payment service providers to maintain strict MFA authentication procedures for operations such as payments over €30 or requests for account information. The PSD2 SCA requirements aim to improve online consumer trust by reducing fraud and account takeover attacks, yet without a significant trade-off of user experience.</p> 
<p>HYPR’s True Passwordless solution for <a href="https://www.hypr.com/passwordless-customer-authentication">customer authentication</a> allows firms to fully comply with the PSD2 SCA and transaction signing directives, including cryptographic signing of every transaction and unique dynamic linking. With HYPR, you can ensure SCA regulatory compliance while removing friction from your customer authentication process.

<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-assistant">IBM Watson Assistant</a> is a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ibm-again-recognized-as-a-leader-in-the-2023-gartner-magic-quadranttm-for-enterprise-conversational-ai-platforms/">market-leading conversational AI platform</a> that transforms fragmented and inconsistent experiences into fast, friendly and personalized customer and employee care. Powered by AI you can trust, and an intuitive user interface, Watson Assistant empowers users with the tools to build intelligent virtual agents and deliver automated self-service support across all channels and touch-points. We are now taking a major step to unlock new levels of productivity by introducing advanced <a href="https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-generative-AI">generative AI</a> capabilities to a variety of new use cases.</p>



 Put AI to work with IBM Watson Assistant 



<p>Last week during Think 2023, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/introducing-watsonx-the-future-of-ai-for-business/">IBM introduced watsonx</a>, a new platform that enables businesses to build AI models at scale and unveiled that Digital Labor offerings <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-assistant">Watson Assistant</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-orchestrate">Watson Orchestrate</a> will be infused with large language models (LLMs) trained and tuned on watsonx to enable enhanced employee productivity and customer service experiences.</p>



<p>With that, we are introducing the new accelerated authoring and conversational search capabilities for Watson Assistant. Watson Assistant uses these new LLMs to drive user outcomes including:</p>



 
 Better understanding of your customers and their needs 



 Automating self-service actions and answers 



 Accelerating the development of exceptional experiences 
 



 Accelerated authoring 



<p>Accelerated authoring fast-tracks the delivery of new conversational&nbsp;flows. With this&nbsp;generative&nbsp;functionality, Watson Assistant makes it easy&nbsp;for your organization&nbsp;to accelerate build-time and deliver&nbsp;outcome-oriented&nbsp;conversational&nbsp;flows. The new “generate” feature for building actions now offers users the option to automate the build process for creating new actions by identifying multiple intents within context and automatically generating the steps to accomplish these tasks at once,&nbsp;whether it’s helping the customer of a telecommunications company add family members to their account, or assisting a bank branch manager as they hire a new customer service representative.</p>



<p></p> 



 Conversational search 



<p>Conversational search generates accurate, contextual conversational&nbsp;answers&nbsp;grounded in enterprise-specific content. Not only does conversational search&nbsp;provide&nbsp;the&nbsp;customer with a response to their question, but that customer can trace the response back to&nbsp;its&nbsp;source content and understand from where the answer is coming. The new generative AI capabilities and custom extension easily blend this experience with “Actions”, our conversation flow builder, to&nbsp;both&nbsp;answer the customer’s question&nbsp;and&nbsp;progress them towards reaching their actual goal.</p>



<p></p> 



<p>IBM Watson Assistant offers an intuitive build experience and powerful AI capabilities that can empower anyone in your organization to build and scale intelligent virtual agents faster and without writing a line of code. Powered by watsonx LLMs and generative AI, organizations will be able to accelerate build-time, automate operational tasks, boost productivity, and deliver exceptional customer and employee experiences. The new Watson Assistant capabilities are planned to be released this year. Stay tuned for more announcements.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>In today's modern work environment, effective management of user identities and access is crucial for securing enterprise applications, systems, and data. As organizations increasingly deploy cloud-based services and resources, managing access has become complex and necessary. As a helpdesk engineer, it’s my responsibility to manage and track access requests from end users. To streamline this process and ensure secure access, I recently deployed an approval-as-code tool, which automates the approval process for access requests and integrates with our existing tools. This will enhance our ability to manage access and mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized access to critical systems and data.</p> 
 Access Management Challenges  
<p>Traditionally, I provide users with predefined default access based on their roles and responsibilities. Some admin users are provided with full access to core resources on an ongoing basis. Unfortunately, these accounts are potential targets for security breaches.&nbsp; Experian, Uber and <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-improve-okta-security">Okta</a>, and many others, were all breached due to hackers, such as the Lapsus$ group, exploiting admin access.</p> 
<p>In some emergency situations, users are provided with elevated access to be able to resolve a critical issue or incident. These requests are largely handled in either tickets or Slack threads. In other words done “by hand”.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some of the challenges I face:</p> 
  
  Inefficiency: Manually managing access can be an inefficient process and mistakes can be made if access is not removed.  
  Compliance challenges: It can be difficult to demonstrate that access controls are being enforced when some users have perpetual admin access.  
  Scaling: As the organization grows and the number of users and resources increases, it becomes more difficult to manage access for a large number of users across many systems. Creating access policies can get complex.  
  
 What Is Approval-As-Code?  
<p>At HYPR, Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) is an already adopted practice to automate and standardize the process of deploying and managing our IT resources. We recently came across a tool that advertises “approval-as-code,” which extends the same principles as Infrastructure as code. With approval-as-code, we can automate and codify approval workflows for elevated access.</p> 
<p>The tool in question is called SYM by a company called <a href="https://symops.com/">SYMOps</a>. Sym allows you to build approval workflows that can be initiated and approved within Slack to dedicated resources defined within the tool.&nbsp; This provides just-in-time access in a manner which is audited and tracked. The current approval flow we have in place:</p> 
  
  End users request access within Slack and are asked  
   
   Which resource they need access to  
   Justification (ticket, incident or reason)  
   Duration of access  
   
  Request is routed to a dedicated Slack channel  
  Designated approvers can either approve or deny the request  
  If approved, the user is provided access to the resource for the duration selected  
  Once the time for the duration expires, access is removed and the user is notified within Slack.&nbsp;  
  
<p>Being that SYM is approval-as-code, we use our current code review process and I can collaborate with my team when building the workflows. The tool itself is managed with Terraform code so you can deploy resources and update the workflows. The approval logic is all defined in Python code so I am able to create custom policies that meet our needs but also help us scale.</p> 
 Deployment&nbsp;  
<p>Now I am not a strong or even an average coder, but the examples and support provided by the SYM team has been invaluable in helping my team and I get this tool off the ground running. No question was too basic or complex for their team as they helped me craft this tool which is now critical for our daily operations.</p> 
<p>SYMops offers multiple out-of-the-box integrations with their Python libraries. With the custom logic, we are taking advantage of the PagerDuty integration. This integration on request checks if the user is on-call in PagerDuty, to assist with&nbsp; “break-glass” access after hours in response to an incident or a page. Here is an example of the code that defines this logic which is also in the examples SYMOps provides:</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>https://github.com/symopsio/examples/tree/main/basic/pagerduty_on_call</p> 
 Greater Security, Greater Convenience&nbsp;  
<p>By implementing a tool like SYM on top of our HYPR Passwordless stack, we can improve the speed, tracking and security of our applications, systems and data. Being that the tool is built within Slack allows our organization to easily adopt this process and not impede any critical work or velocity of our teams. Having the elevated access being gated by the approval workflows helps us ensure that there are sufficient guardrails for access controls in place and they are enforced.</p>

 Recap of recent IDnow ‘The State of Micromobility Regulations 2023’ webinar. 



 



<p>Our April webinar, which explored <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/state-of-micromobility-regulations-in-2023/">the current state of micromobility regulations</a>, could not have happened at a more interesting time for the industry, following the recent Paris escooter ban.</p>



<p>Moderated by Oliver Bruce, Co-Host of The Micromobility Conference &amp; Podcast, the hour-long session welcomed industry insiders and experts Usman Abid, Senior Product Manager at Tier, Martin Lefrancq, New Mobility Policy Advisor at Brussels Mobility, Felix Aumair, Head of Customer Success at GoUrban, along with our very own Michael Holland-Nell, Senior Sales Manager Mobility at IDnow.</p>



 What happens in Paris, stays in Paris? 



<p>With the escooter ban fresh in people’s minds, it was natural for the group to start by sharing their opinions on how it would likely impact the wider micromobility landscape in the rest of Europe.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, it was a mixed bag of opinions, with some participants pointing out that it would likely heap additional pressure on mobility operators, who would be forced to play the waiting game while other cities decide whether to follow suit with a ban or not.</p>



<p>Despite the recent happenings in Paris, Michael said that there was no time to waste, and operators should seize the opportunity to enter the growing micromobility industry, “Now is a good chance to invest more and have a bigger focus on these kinds of topics to improve and develop micromobility services in the future.’’</p>



 The relationship between technology and regulations. 



<p>Later in the webinar, Felix and Michael discussed what measures and technology micromobility providers could implement to improve user compliance with regulations and ensure responsible use of their services.</p>



<blockquote><p>This is where IDnow supports many companies – not only in mobility – to give more responsibility to the user because there needs to be rules in place, certain behaviors, certain qualifications to make use of certain services, especially in the mobility sector. But since regulations develop and change, it’s important that providers have flexible solutions.</p>Michael Holland-Nell, Senior Sales Manager Mobility at IDnow</blockquote>



 Shaping the future of a safer, more sustainable mobility future. 



<p>Later in the webinar, discussions shifted from regulations to the role that micromobility could play in addressing urban congestion, and how this can be better communicated to policymakers and the public.</p>



<p>Martin mentioned how there have been huge changes over the years regarding sustainable urban mobility in Brussels.</p>



<p>“Micromobility is forecasted to help reduce carbon emissions in our cities by 30-50% by 2030,’’ said Usman.</p>



<p>Before the webinar ended with a Q+A session with the audience, the panel covered the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fueling-demand-convenient-mobility/">key trends and developments</a> that will shape the regulatory landscape in the coming years.</p>



<p>Predictions ranged from the importance of free-floating, dedicated parking zones to why micromobility needs to have a consistent regulatory framework that is only part of a broader ecosystem. Michael said that the very future of cities was dependant on the success of micromobility, citing the need for collaboration between key stakeholders (users, city governance, operators and regulators) to ensure regulations offer a safer and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">balanced mobility experience</a> for everyone.</p>

<p></p><p>The concept of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) was first proposed in 2015 by Drummond Reed and then became an official W3C standard in July of 2022.</p><p>Adoption has grown quite a bit in the last few years. Here are a few ways they are being used today.</p> Employment Verification<a title="Direct link to Employment Verification">​</a> <p>LinkedIn recently announced a new free <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/12/23679998/linkedin-verification-badge-system-clear-microsoft-entra">verified badge feature</a> that will be used to prove the validity of your employment, education, and other achievements. “The system is backed by decentralized identity and a trust model that involves an issuer, a holder, and a verifier. Organizations can issue cryptographically signed digital IDs, which employees can then use to prove they work at a company…” </p><p>LinkedIn is  using the Self-Sovereign Identity trust model connecting an employee's DID (subject) with their employer's DID (issuer), and LinkedIn as the verifier of the transaction.</p><p></p><p>As for education verification, LinkedIn users can request that their educational institution issue a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credential</a> (VC) for their degree or certification. The user can then choose to share the credential with employers or other third parties via LinkedIn, who then verifies the authenticity of the credential using cryptographic proofs.</p>  info  <p>DIDs vs VCs: DIDs provide a way to create and manage decentralized identities, whereas VCs provide a way to prove information about those identities in a secure and portable way.</p>   Digital Driver's Licenses<a title="Direct link to Digital Driver's Licenses">​</a> <p>The DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) in the United States and in Queensland Australia are piloting a program that involves issuing <a href="https://www.govtech.com/fs/california-moves-to-test-new-digital-drivers-licenses">digital driver's licenses</a> and vehicle registration documents that can be accessed and verified using a mobile app. Digital driver's licenses are cryptographically secured, and the apps can be used to verify the authenticity of the license without the need for physical documents.</p><p>They are doing this with the use of VCs, which are stored on-chain, tamper-proof, and cannot be altered or forged, which ensures the integrity and authenticity of their credentials.</p><p>The main component of VCs are DIDs, see here for example:</p>   <code>curl -X PUT -d '{<br>  "data": {<br>    "givenName": "Alice",<br>      "employedAt": "2022-08-20T13:20:10.000+0000"<br>  },<br>  "issuer": "did:key:z6MkpEQY4FCCtJEVpZ6gGK541fYWynH2ya7D1RikTGfdydCF",<br>  "subject": "did:key:z6MkqcFHFXqzsYyDYrEUA2pVCfQGJz2rYoCZy5WWszzSW3o6",<br>  "@context": "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",<br>  "expiry": "2051-10-05T14:48:00.000Z",<br>  "schema": "b28feb61-e0b8-454a-86ed-d487a46e8584"<br>}' http://localhost:8080/v1/credentials<br></code>     <p>As you can see there are two DIDs used, one for an Issuer (DMV) and one for a subject (Drivers License recipient, Alice). </p><p>This program will lead to faster and more efficient services for customers, as well as improved security and fraud prevention.</p> COVID Digital Health Apps<a title="Direct link to COVID Digital Health Apps">​</a> <p>IBM used VCs as a key component in its <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/health/resources/digital-health-pass-blockchain-explained/">Digital Health Pass</a> solution to enable individuals to securely and privately present their COVID vaccination status to third parties - such as concert venues and stadium events.</p><p>When an individual needs to prove if they are vaccinated, they can simply present their VC to a verifier (e.g., baseball stadium), who then verifies the authenticity of the credential and the accuracy of the information it contains using cryptographic proofs. </p><p>There are several benefits to DIDs and VCs in this use case including privacy protection, security, and efficiency. This simple interaction now allows individuals to maintain control over their personal health information. For example, all they need to disclose is true/false (vaccinated or not) versus a more detailed health record. </p><p>Overall, the use of VCs and DIDs in the IBM Digital Health Pass provides a secure and privacy-preserving way for individuals to prove their health status, which was essential for enabling safe travel and activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p> Social Media<a title="Direct link to Social Media">​</a> <p>Even social media applications are embracing the use of decentralized identifiers. Bluesky is a new social platform that serves as a reference implementation of the <a href="https://atproto.com/guides/overview">AT Protocol</a>, a federated protocol for large-scale social applications. Instead of usernames that are specific to and owned by the application, BlueSky instead uses domain names for identity (e.g. alice.bsky.social). Unbeknownst to most users, these domain names are associated with a DID for the user.</p><p></p><p>These persistent DIDs enable users to migrate their account data to any other applications that utilize the AT Protocol - therefore giving users more control and ownership over their content.</p> Future of Decentralized Identity<a title="Direct link to Future of Decentralized Identity">​</a> <p>These companies are embracing the use of decentralized technology for identity management and verification at a massive scale. As this technology continues to mature, we can expect to see more widespread adoption of DIDs in various industries.</p><p>Want to learn more about DIDs and VCs?

<p>Secure remote access is a method that lets authorized users access a private network as if they were on-premises with that network.</p>
<p>This includes accessing systems, resources, and data the user could access where they logged in on the private system.</p>
<p>While remote access was relatively common in business sectors for the past decade, the onset of COVID and work-from-home situations expanded this kind of technology even further. Now, remote access is used for everyday work, managing remote systems, or performing IT support for end users.</p>
<p>Key components of secure remote access include:</p>
 
 Authentication: Users must provide valid credentials through various methods, including usernames and passwords, biometrics, or <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/multi-factor-authentication-best-practices/">Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</a>. 
 Access Control: Administrators can implement access control policies to restrict user access to specific resources, applications, or systems based on their roles and responsibilities. 
 Encryption: Data transmitted between the remote user and the target system is encrypted to ensure confidentiality and prevent unauthorized access. This is often done through protocols like Secure Shell/Transport Security Layer (SSH/TLS) that support strong encryption and tunneling. 
 System Security: Servers, network devices, and endpoint devices must remain secure. Otherwise, they will compromise the integrity of the overall access solution. 
 
 What Are the Benefits of Using a Secure Remote Access Solution? 
<p>Secure remote access offers several benefits for businesses, organizations, and individuals, including:</p>
 
 Security: First and foremost, secure remote access allows users to connect to sensitive systems and data wherever they are. The value of this kind of remote access in a modern, decentralized world cannot be understated. 
 Compliance: Secure remote access can play a major role in compliance efforts. Most frameworks and regulations have some requirements on how users access systems–requirements that include authentication, authorization, and encryption. Secure remote access checks these boxes. 
 Flexibility: Secure remote access allows employees to work more flexibly, accommodating various schedules and time zones. This means more productivity, more variation in where your company can hire, simplified collaboration between remote teams, and reduced office space and equipment costs. 
 Scalability: Secure remote access can quickly scale to accommodate the growth of an organization, particularly its workforce, allowing new users and resources to be added with minimal effort. 
 Centralized Security and Operations: IT administrators can manage remote devices, install updates, and troubleshoot issues remotely and en masse, ensuring that all systems get the same level of attention. 
 
<p>By providing secure access to resources and systems from remote locations, secure remote access offers numerous advantages in terms of productivity, cost savings, flexibility, and security.</p>
 What Are the Different Types of Remote Secure Access? 
<p>There are several types of remote secure access solutions available to accommodate the varying needs of organizations and individuals. Some popular solutions include:</p>
 
 Virtual Private Network (VPN): VPNs are secured and persistent connections (private networks) that can extend to users such that they have full access to secure system resources. These networks work through a combination of technologies, including all those listed previously. 
 Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP): RDP is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft that functions like a VPN but allows the user to access a single system rather than an entire network. 
 Secure Shell/Transport Layer Security (SSH/TLS): SSH is a cryptographic network protocol that enables secure remote access through “tunneling.” TLS is the protocol that supersedes SSH. 
 Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI): VDI is a technology that provides remote access to virtual desktops hosted on a centralized server. Users can access their virtual desktops from any device with an internet connection. 
 Remote Support Software: There exist additional tools that IT support services can use by requiring end users to install a client app that can facilitate secure system sharing between the two. These solutions have also become somewhat popular in instances of digital fraud. 
 Cloud-Based Solutions: Cloud-based remote access solutions leverage cloud infrastructure to provide secure remote access. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS) WorkSpaces and Google Cloud’s Compute Engine. 
 
<p>Each remote secure access solution has its unique features and uses cases. Organizations should carefully assess their needs and requirements before selecting the appropriate solution to ensure security, scalability, and ease of use.</p>
 Are Their Problems Using Secure Remote Access? 
<p>Although secure remote access solutions provide numerous benefits, they also introduce some risks and challenges that organizations must address to ensure the security of their networks and data.</p>
<p>Some of the risks associated with secure remote access include:</p>
 
 Unauthorized Access: If an attacker gains access to a remote user’s credentials or devices, they may be able to access sensitive resources and systems. Since the solution assumes the user is legitimate, they will have full access to any system the user would have access to. 
 Endpoint Security: Security is only as strong as its weakest link, and in the case of remote access, this is typically user security. An unsecured laptop or mobile device can open up a vulnerability in the network that admins cannot plan for. 
 Insider Threats: Much like endpoint security, insider threats are hard to fight since they are, for all intents and purposes, legitimate users. An insider with remote access can gain control of sensitive resources. 
 Data Leakage: Data transmitted over insecure networks or stored on remote devices can be intercepted, stolen, or manipulated by malicious actors. This can lead to data breaches, loss of intellectual property, and damage to the organization’s reputation. 
 Compliance: Organizations must ensure that their remote access solutions comply with relevant regulations and industry standards, such as GDPR or HIPAA. 
 
<p>Organizations should implement robust security measures to mitigate these risks. One such approach is a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/zero-trust-best-practices/">zero-trust architecture</a> that can address typical attacks as well as user-based vulnerabilities.</p>
 1Kosmos Is Transforming Secure Remote Access 
<p>Many organizations will use some combination of MFA and access control to handle secure remote access. 1Kosmos is changing this approach by providing identity-based <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/identity-management/what-is-iam/">authentication and access management</a> tied to biometrics and compliant identity verification.</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos, you can secure your remote access system with the following features:</p>
 
 Identity-Based Authentication: We push biometrics and authentication into a new “who you are” paradigm. BlockID uses biometrics to identify individuals, not devices, through credential triangulation and identity verification.

<p>Businesses rely every day on various systems and pieces of equipment to keep their operations running smoothly. But all systems inevitably require upkeep. It could be intangible software, like an IT service network that has accumulated enough bugs to break an important feature, sending developers scrambling for a fix. Or it could be a piece of physical equipment, like an ice cream machine in a fast food restaurant with a broken o-ring.</p>



<p>Eventually, everything breaks down, from multi-site IT systems down to individual light bulbs. Unplanned downtime can have catastrophic consequences, and it’s up to facility maintenance engineers and technicians to plan ahead so that swift measures are taken to rectify a failure. The goal is to minimize downtime, reducing the costs associated with lost productivity, revenue or customer dissatisfaction.</p>



<p>Downtime can be minimized in many ways. For example, businesses can aim to reduce the amount of time it takes to repair a piece of equipment by having sufficient replacement parts accessible to technicians on-site. Or, they can observe repair processes to find faster ways to perform repairs or quicker ways to notify technicians. Even further, they can make investments in better-performing tools with longer lifespans to reduce the number of repairs needed.</p>



<p>But in order to understand how to improve the reliability of systems and components, we first must be able to measure their reliability. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/mttr">Mean time to repair (MTTR)</a>—also known as mean time to recovery—and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/mtbf">mean time between failures (MTBF)</a> are two failure metrics commonly used to measure the reliability of systems or products within the field of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/facilities-maintenance">facilities maintenance</a>. While these acronyms are related, they have different meanings and are used to answer different questions.</p>



<p>First, let’s review MTBF.&nbsp;</p>



 What is mean time between failures (MTBF)? 



<p>MTBF is a key performance indicator (KPI) that represents the average time between two consecutive failures of a system or product. MTBF is a measure of reliability, and it is commonly used in the context of warranties, maintenance planning and product development. Note that MTBF, which refers to repairable items, is not to be confused with the closely related term, mean time to failure, (MTTF), which refers to assets that are non-repairable and need to be replaced rather than repaired.</p>



<p>The MTBF calculation uses the following formula:</p>



<p>MTBF = Total operating time / Number of failures over a given period</p>



<p>So, for example, if a product is used for 1,000 hours and it fails 3 times during that period, the MTBF would be: 1000 hours / 3 failures = 333.3 hours</p>



<p>This means that on average, the product can be expected to fail after 333.3 hours of use.</p>



<p>MTBF is useful in determining the expected lifetime of a product and can help manufacturers plan for maintenance or replacement. However, it does not take into account how much time it takes to repair a product after it fails, which can be an important consideration in some applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s where MTTR comes in.&nbsp;</p>



 What is mean time to repair (MTTR)?&nbsp; 



<p>MTTR is the average time it takes to repair a system or product after it has failed. MTTR is used to measure the reliability of a system or product from a repair standpoint. MTTR typically includes the time it takes to notify maintenance teams, allow equipment to cool down for repair, fix the issue, reassemble any relevant equipment or systems and test before restarting production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal of MTTR is to minimize the downtime caused by failures and reduce the costs associated with repairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s how to calculate MTBF:</p>



<p>MTTR = Total downtime / Total number of failures over a specific time</p>



<p>For example, if over the last year, a system failed 5 times, resulting in 10 total hours of downtime (including repair time), the MTTR would be: 10 hours / 5 repairs = 2 hours</p>



<p>This means that on average, it takes two hours to repair the system after a failure occurs.</p>



<p>MTTR is useful in determining the efficiency of maintenance operations and can help identify areas where improvements can be made.&nbsp;</p>



 Differences between MTBF and MTTR 



<p>Mean time between failures (MTBF) and mean time to repair (MTTR) answer different questions and have different applications. MTBF and MTTR exist in a family of KPIs that include mean time to respond, mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to acknowledge (MTTA), among others.</p>



<p>MTBF is a measure of how long a system or product is expected to operate before it fails, and it is used to plan for maintenance or replacement. MTTR is a measure of how long it takes to repair a system or product after it fails, and it is used to minimize downtime and reduce repair costs.</p>



<p>MTBF does not take into account the period of time it takes to repair a product after it fails, while MTTR does not take into account the total time between failures.&nbsp;</p>



 How MTBF and MTTR work together 



<p>Across many use cases, both metrics may be used in tandem to get a more complete picture of the overall maintainability of a system or product. For example, in a manufacturing plant, MTBF might be used to determine the expected lifetime of a machine and plan for replacement, while MTTR might be used to optimize maintenance schedules for that machine and maximize total uptime. In the context of software development, MTBF might be used to measure the stability of a system and plan for updates or bug fixes, while MTTR might be used to optimize the development process and reduce the time it takes to fix issues.</p>



 Manage assets to improve MTBF and MTTR 



<p>Improving MTBF and MTTR to reduce downtime can be a complex process that involves identifying and addressing the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/root-cause-analysis">root causes</a> of system failures, optimizing maintenance operations and implementing improvements in design and manufacturing processes.</p>



<p>Today, large organizations use Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMSs) to help them manage their maintenance processes. A CMMS typically offers features like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/work-order">work order</a> management, preventative maintenance scheduling, inventory management, asset management and reporting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IBM Maximo is enterprise asset management software that includes comprehensive CMMS capabilities. Maximo is a single, integrated cloud-based platform that uses <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>, IoT and analytics to optimize performance, extend the lifecycle of assets and reduce the costs of outages. A related tool, IBM Instana Observability, offers full-stack observability, with the goal of helping users optimize and democratize incident prevention.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both of these products will give you the visibility into your assets and operations that you’ll need to make smarter, data-driven decisions, ultimately resulting in fewer breakdowns and less downtime.</p>

 Summary 
<p>The concept of digital identity has been adopted worldwide as a means for people to present themselves and operate in the online space.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether it’s for work, studying, or simply communicating, individuals are able to engage with one another from any corner of the world. But, because of the elusive nature of the internet, it’s difficult to tell whether an individual is who they claim to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This could make engaging with others in the online space rather challenging, even if they are verified. Users may unintentionally share their private information with bad players who could use them for personal gain. Malicious individuals may get access to services or carry out illegal activities in the victim’s name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even more, identity fraud or fake, AI-generated digital identities could influence polls and the decision-making process of a system. All of this could lead to devastating consequences for those whose digital identity has been compromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To prevent this, SelfKey proposes the following online identity verification solutions: SelfKey iD and POI (proof of individuality), or proof of humanity staking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD is an innovative online identity verification method which may provide several benefits compared to traditional KYC checks. The process may be less costly, safer and more secure, so that every individual can benefit from its advantages.</p>
<p>This article will be focusing on how SelfKey iD and POI staking may provide a more accessible means for individuals to authenticate themselves online from all over the world. Through this method, and with privacy and security in mind, SelfKey is aiming to contribute to the development of a safer, decentralized future.&nbsp;</p>

 The Benefits of SelfKey iD and POI Staking 
 Conclusions&nbsp; 
 
 The Importance of Digital Identity Security 
 Why the safety of digital identity is crucial 
<p>Similar to our physical identities, our digital identities encompass all the information that describe us as individuals, such as: name, birth dates, full addresses, social security numbers, personally identifiable information (PII), or personal health information (PHI).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nowadays, digital identities have become an integral part of our lives. From social media accounts to online banking, we rely on digital identities to conduct our daily activities. Thanks to the speed and efficiency of the internet, we are able to do these activities at a much faster pace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, with the convenience of digital identities comes the risk of identity theft, which can have severe consequences for individuals and organizations alike. Digital identities can be compromised at any moment, either by:&nbsp;</p>
 
 cyberattacks which lead to data breaches 
 accidentally clicking on a link messaged by a friend or family. 
 
<p>Browsing the internet from the comfort of our own homes may give us the illusion of safety. However, the theft of our digital identities is as alarming as having our physical wallets, with all of our personal documents inside, stolen.</p>
<p>Let us explore some of the negative impacts identity theft can leave us with.</p>
 The consequences of identity theft 
<p>Identity theft occurs when someone steals another person's personal information, such as their name, address, social security number, or financial details, with the intention of using it for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The consequences of identity theft can be devastating for the victim, including financial losses, damaged credit scores, and reputational harm.</p>
<p>Moreover, bad players can use stolen digital identities for a wide range of criminal activities. For instance: accessing sensitive information, opening fraudulent bank accounts, and committing tax fraud. These activities can have severe outcomes for the victim and even lead to legal consequences for the perpetrator.</p>
 The dangers of sharing private information online 
<p>Sharing private information with unknown individuals is also a significant danger when it comes to digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cybercriminals often use social engineering tactics to trick individuals into sharing their personal information. Some methods include phishing emails or fake websites. Once they obtain this information, they can use it to commit identity theft or other fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>This leads us to a serious concern that individuals all around the world are facing nowadays: a lack of proper security measures.&nbsp;</p>
 What can be done, then? 
<p>Identity theft and fraud are becoming more common in the digital world, and many individuals struggle to confidently operate online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite privacy and security being fundamental human rights, most centralized systems still lack adequate security measures. Ideally, a decentralized environment where individuals can exercise their <a href="https://selfkey.org/self-sovereign-identity-ssid/">Self Sovereign Identity</a> rights would help prevent data theft. By giving individuals ownership of their private information, cyberattacks would be less likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey recognizes the importance of developing decentralized solutions that may allow individuals to operate safely in the digital world. Below, we will thoroughly touch upon SelfKey’s proposed solutions.</p>
 SelfKey’s Proposed Online Identity Verification Solutions 
<p><a href="https://selfkey.org/the_benefits_of_selfkey_id/">SelfKey iD</a> is an innovative and cost-effective online identity verification method designed to be more accessible than traditional KYC checks. The lack of recurring fees makes it accessible to every individual who wishes to authenticate themselves online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey iD uses the power of <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) in its online verification process, providing an extra layer of security. In addition to AI-powered verification, SelfKey iD offers POI staking as a possible solution that may prevent identity fraud and access by fake, AI-generated digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, with its focus on security, accessibility, and innovation, SelfKey iD may become a leading solution for online identity verification.</p>
 SelfKey iD and POI Staking: How it works 
<p>SelfKey aims to develop a simple and quick online identity verification method. That is why SelfKey ID is meant to be not only cost-effective, but also user-friendly. This way, individuals may find it more accessible and easy to use.</p>
<p>POI (Proof of Individuality), or proof of humanity, is a digital identity verification method used to establish that an individual is unique and real. It is used as part of the online identity verification process to confirm that an individual is not a bot, a fake account, or an identity thief.</p>
 The process 
<p>In the context of SelfKey iD, POI staking may be used as an additional security measure for online identity verification. The following steps may be required:</p>
 
 Users must provide a selfie during the initial KYC process.&nbsp; 
 To access SelfKey services, users are required to go through additional selfie checks. Their selfies will be compared to the original one taken during the KYC process.&nbsp; 
 If the selfies match, users will be granted a POI credential that can be staked on with KEY. This verification process ensures that users' identities are authenticated and that they have a secure digital identity.&nbsp; 
 
<p>By staking KEY on their POI credential, users contribute to the security of the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
 How will this provide security on the web? 
<p>SelfKey's POI staking method may not only provide a secure identity verification process but it may also offer several additional benefits to users. For instance:</p>
 
 By staking their POI credentials, users may access exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem. This means that users who have staked their credentials may have a higher level of trust and reputation within the network. This may allow them to benefit from additional functionalities that are not available to all users. 
 Moreover, staking POI credentials may also allow users to accrue SELF tokens, as a sign of their reputation within the SelfKey ecosystem. Users can mint SELF tokens only if they can prove their identity by providing a matching selfie during the verification process. This will maintain the security of users’ digital identity and ensure that the SelfKey ecosystem remains robust and secure. 
 Furthermore, users can only withdraw their original KEY tokens if they can provide a matching selfie during the withdrawal process. This may provide an additional layer of security and ensure that unauthorized users cannot access a user's tokens.&nbsp; 
 
 Why provide selfies? 
<p>The purpose of providing selfies for the actions stated above is to ensure the users’ digital safety by verifying that they truly are who they claim to be. KEY and SELF tokens can thus be withdrawn or minted only after the user will have been able to successfully verify their identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The goal is to create a system in which users won’t have to worry about identity thieves or fake, AI-generated images being used to compromise their digital assets. By providing selfies, users may ensure that their accounts are secure and their privacy is not violated. SelfKey’s AI-powered proof of individuality method may be the ideal solution in achieving this goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The POI staking method, therefore, may provide a secure and reliable system for identity verification, which benefits both users and the SelfKey ecosystem as a whole. By staking on their POI credentials, users may:</p>
 
 protect their digital identity. 
 access exclusive features. 
 contribute to the security of the SelfKey network. 
 
 The part AI plays 
<p>To enhance security in its online identity verification solutions, SelfKey uses <a href="https://selfkey.org/ai-powered-proof-of-individuality/">AI-Powered Proof of Individuality</a> to facilitate the selfie matching process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI may prove to be particularly advantageous in this context, as its precision allows for the detection of several crucial factors:</p>
 
 an individual's liveness. 
 identity forgery. 
 fake, AI-generated images. 
 
<p>This ensures that the identity verification process is secure and reliable. And that's because AI technology is capable of detecting any fraudulent attempts to game the system. Additionally, it can make sure that the selfies provided during the verification process are authentic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By using AI-Powered Proof of Individuality, SelfKey may be able to provide a trustworthy and robust system for digital identity verification, which is critical in today's digital world.</p>
 The Benefits of SelfKey iD POI Staking 
<p>As stated above, digital identities have become a target for malicious players that seek to exploit others for personal gain. And, with the weak security in some centralized systems, it’s crucial that we look for alternatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given this, SelfKey's POI staking method may provide a robust, reliable, and decentralized method for identity verification. It may offer the level of security and privacy that is critical in today’s digital world. Individuals may benefit from peace of mind and ensure that their digital identities are protected from fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Even more, unlawful access to one’s personal accounts may become very challenging due to the extra layer of protection added by AI. Simply providing a true, authentic selfie can achieve all of this.</p>
 Conclusions 
<p>The rise of data breaches and identity theft has highlighted the need for a trustless and secure environment for online interactions. Individuals need to have confidence in the systems they use to protect their personal information. To ensure the privacy and security of their digital identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, centralized systems may fail to provide proper security measures, which often lead to data breaches involving identity theft.</p>
<p>With the use of SelfKey iD POI staking, a much safer network may be available in the future. By staking on their POI credentials, users may prevent identity theft and fraud. Not only that, but they may gain access to exclusive features and services within the SelfKey ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SelfKey's goal is to develop a secure and trustless environment for online interactions. And that is highly important nowadays, as we become more and more accustomed to operating in the digital world.</p>

 Open banking is een vrijwel onuitputtelijk onderwerp van speculaties en voorspellingen gebleken. Nu PSD2 de weg heeft vrijgemaakt voor Europa om deel te nemen aan de open-banking-revolutie, zullen we in 2023 mogelijk het eerste concrete bewijs zien van een disruptie op de markt. Daarom belooft 2023 een spannend jaar te worden voor zowel voorstanders als sceptici.

<p>Open banking is een vrijwel onuitputtelijk onderwerp van speculaties en voorspellingen gebleken. Nu PSD2 de weg heeft vrijgemaakt voor Europa om deel te nemen aan de open-banking-revolutie, zullen we in 2023 mogelijk het eerste concrete bewijs zien van een disruptie op de markt. Daarom belooft 2023 een spannend jaar te worden voor zowel voorstanders als sceptici.</p>

 Recap of IDnow’s recent ‘Meeting KYC and AML requirements in the DACH region’ webinar. 



 



<p>To coincide with crypto’s busy few days in April, when the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/mica/">Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation</a> was finally <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">given the green light</a> by the European Parliament, we hosted a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/identity-verification-kyc-aml-requirements/">‘Meeting KYC and AML requirements in the DACH region’ webinar</a>, exploring the likely ramifications of the regulatory framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moderated by Jennifer Hanley Giersch at ALL AML GmbH, the hour-long session welcomed industry insiders and experts Nico Di Gabriele, the Director General Horizontal Supervision at European Central Bank, and Peter Müller, Financial Crime Officer at UBS, along with our very own Rayissa Armata, Senior Head of Regulatory Affairs and Jason Tucker-Feltham, Head of Crypto Sales at IDnow.</p>



<p>Watch highlights below:</p>



 



 

 



 MiCA: KYC and AML’s most important development for 2023? 



<p>The session strarted with predictions from the group as to what is likely to be the main driving force for developments in the KYC and AML space. Unsurprisingly, considering it was finally ratified by the EU in April, Rayissa touched upon the potential of MiCA.</p>



<p>“To harmonize regulations across an ecosystem is an ambitious project. The unification and transparency that is supposed to come out of MiCA is really important. One of those crucial steps is to enable KYC to do its job and foster trust in this ecosystem,” said Rayissa Armata, Senior Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow.</p>



<p>Jason agreed, explaining how MiCA would provide important guidelines that crypto exchanges and crypto entities would need to follow to ensure they do not run afoul of money laundering risks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is a great development for the industry because with clarity brings the ability for obliged entities to do the right thing, and implement the right technologies, controls, and internal processes to meet MiCA’s requirements,” said Jason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much was discussed during the session, including the larger upcoming European Commission’s legislative proposal known as the AML/CFT package.</p>



 When together is not always better.  



<p>While there was a general consensus that the combined EU approach to regulatory requirements and policy was a positive thing, Nico did warn that this is not always the case.&nbsp;He said that while a common financial market policy in the banking sector exists in the European Union, there is no common policy that translates into a common implementation of AML/ CFT rules.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>This means that practices are divergent across countries, and this is to the benefit of those that don’t want to comply with the legislation, because the system from a European perspective is only as strong as the weakest link.</p>Nico Di Gabriele, the Director General Horizontal Supervision at European Central Bank</blockquote>



<p>Nico went on to use the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/#:~:text=KYC%20is%20a%20process%20that,element%20throughout%20the%20customer%20relationship.">Know Your Customer (KYC) process</a> as an example, and said that although there are common rules for the onboarding of clients, when it comes to effective controls, each member state does it differently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much was discussed in the lively session, from the impact of regulations on unhosted wallets and decentralized ecosystems, to ways of changing the perception of crypto as an increasing risk for sources of wealth, the topic of KYC and MiCA was never far away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If we are going to have a successful crypto hub – wherever that is, then we need to instil certain rules and regulations that enable a functioning and healthy ecosystem, and KYC will be integral part in facilitating this,” added Rayissa.</p>

  <p>Most enterprises nowadays need to grant access to multiple business partners daily as they heavily rely on online interactions (online relationships) with one another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, an ever-expanding, interconnected digital ecosystem emerges, the complexities of which frequently result in operational inefficiencies, security risks, increased administrative costs, and unintuitive user experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These challenges&nbsp;are long lived in the B2B identity management space. Yet still today, many&nbsp;organisations continue to struggle using outdated, homegrown and oftentimes error prone centralised IAM&nbsp;systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This session will unwrap modern, decentralised solution trends&nbsp;in the fast-growing segment of IAM using real-life use cases. It will also explore best practices for&nbsp;digital access and delegation management for business partners - seamlessly and securely at scale.&nbsp;</p>

In his keynote, Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will take a broader perspective and look at why the future of IAM and cybersecurity must and will be policy-based. This involves policies in IGA, policies in cybersecurity, hierarchies of policies, policies for application developers and IaaS administrators, policies in Zero Trust, overcoming static entitlements, policies in the context of DID (decentralized identities), and other topics. He also will discuss what needs to be done where, such as Policy Governance, Data Governance, and Policy Lifecycle Management, and why the shift to policy-based approaches requires a multi-speed approach, with policies in new digital services coming faster than policies for modernizing legacy IAM.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/future-of-iam-cybersecurity-is-policy-based-eic2023"></a>

From the decline in directories to the power of personal identity, the IAM field is certainly not boring!<br> <br> In this session, we’ll take a look at the trends over the last several years as seen from the IAM practitioners’ perspectives on the state of the industry, their professional goals, and their alignment with their employers. We’ll also consider what has changed – and what hasn’t – when it comes to our demographics and the diversity of the field. We will also offer some teasers of the results of the most recent IDPro Skills, Programs, &amp; Diversity Survey, which closed in March 2023.<br> <br> Attendees will leave the session with a better understanding not only of the state of the industry but what skills they might want to consider adding to their repertoire for the coming year.</p>

  <p>The European Union’s regulation on Digital Identity, eIDAS, is currently being overhauled to adopt decentralized identity principles. The goal is to provide all citizens and residents across the EU with highly secure and privacy preserving digital wallets that can be used to manage various digital credentials, from eIDs to diplomas to payment instruments. Decentralized identity principles aim at giving freedom of choice and control to the end-user. Ensuring security and interoperability, however, will be challenging — especially in the enormous scale in terms of users and use cases the EU is aiming at. The choices made in eIDAS will have a huge impact on digital identity in the EU and beyond.</p>
<p>The so-called “Architecture and Reference Framework” (ARF) defines the technical underpinnings of eIDAS v2. Many experts from the member states and the Commission have been working on this framework over the last year, trying to select the best combination of technologies and standards out of the enormous number available in the market today. This talk will introduce the ARF and explain what architectural patterns and technical standards are adopted and how the challenges mentioned above are addressed in order to leverage on the vision of the eIDAS v2 regulation.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eu-goes-decentralized-eic2023"></a>

  <p>In the last 10 years machine learning has become ubiquitous and touches all lives in ways that was unimaginable before. The machines can make decisions that required considerable human effort at a much faster speed and reduced cost with a little human oversight. As a result, machines don’t just have a higher than before influence in shaping our lives but are also under increased scrutiny by both regulators as well as user rights advocates.<br> The adage “with great power comes great responsibility” has long been used – from French revolution to superhero comics. It has never been truer as the great power that machine learning wields is now in the hands of almost anyone making a software product. It ranges from giving people access to the funds that can alter their lifepath, medical diagnosis that can increase their life expectancy or reduce it dramatically to their social media feed that cannot just provide them the content that keeps them engaged, but also polarise their beliefs by feeding them information that reinforces their existing notions.<br> With the growing influence of AI technologies and the corresponding scrutiny, the way AI development happens is beginning to change. The full data science lifecycle needs to incorporate the elements of responsible AI and the professionals who know how to design and implement these will be the ones that employers will look for.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/responsable-and-ethical-ai-eic2023"></a>

Every organization faces the risk to be the target of a cybercrime, but the transition to business digitalization leaves a greater room to present vulnerabilities in the system, and if attackers happen to identify them, the attack will occur. The world is changing rapidly, and companies must change with it, and so insurers see their possibility to break into the market. Is it worth to have a cyber-insurance policy? Does it cover all the damages? What is the extent of insurers responsibilities and the company one? Could these cases go to court and under what conditions?&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Vertical risk management and complete identity governance can only be achieved through integration of critical platforms with other systems and applications in use and by either integrating existing point-solutions or reducing their number altogether. Integration of the identity-platform with SAP is one of those major challenges for many organizations today.</p>
<p>One Identity’s approach to this challenge is through a unifying, standard integration into SAP as well as other systems and applications to establish a common GRC framework and security concept. Which includes preventing isolated environments. To establish SAP-internal governance and minimize risk within the platforms privilege landscape most organizations use specialized embedded tools like ECS (Easy Content Solution) from IBS-Schreiber Solution. Integrating the identity management platform with the SAP rule-set administration allows SAP Rule sets to be applied directly, run SoD-analysis fast and efficiently and extend them to other systems and applications, such as MS AD, AAD. The potential value of this approach is significant as it allows a preventive risk-assessment throughout the whole SAP-stack.</p>
<p>This integrative approach also extends to the SAP Firefighter concept for it to be applied to the rulesets and extend these into other systems. The objective is clear: Simplify risk assessment and management, establish a unified identity administration framework and as baseline - reduce cost.</p>
<p>In short – it lays the foundation and framework for solid Governance.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/sap-governance-enterprise-environment-integration-eic2023"></a>

  <p>For many years public concern about technological risk has focused on the misuse of personal data, with GDPR, most hated and loved at the same time as one of the results. With the huge success of LLMs and generative AIs such as ChatGPT,&nbsp; artificial intelligence soon will be omnipresent&nbsp; in products and processes, which will shift regulator´s attention to the potential for bad or biased decisions by algorithms. Just imagine the consequences of a false medical diagnose, or of a correct diagnose created by an AI and then not accepted by the doctor. Not to mention all the other fields where bad AI can be harmful, such as autonomous cars or algorithms deciding on your future credibility. Inevitably, many governments will feel regulation is essential to protect consumers from that risk.</p>
<p>In this panel discussion we will try to jointly create a list of those risks that we need to regulate the sooner the better and try to create an idea on how this future regulation will impact the way we use AI in our bsuiness and private lives.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ai-governance-regulation-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Companies are facing increasingly complex security threats. Many are struggling to assess their own security risks due to an inability to address potential issues as they arise, due to the breakneck pace at which issues are disclosed, and teams' ability to address said issues as they accumulate and because the huge number of security tools in use create diagnostic&nbsp;fatigue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vulnerability management programs rarely ever match the overall scale of the organization, boosting the number of potential points of exposure. What's more, besides vulnerabilities, attackers are increasingly&nbsp;leveraging&nbsp;exposures such as misconfigurations and stolen credentials to gain access to companies' core business. Because of this, attack paths to critical assets are often overlooked or identified too late.</p>
<p>Instead of looking at vast numbers of isolated issues, XM Cyber aggregates them into an attack graph to proactively identify hidden attack paths and weaknesses in both the cloud and on-premises. XM Cyber helps organizations efficiently address the issues that can have the greatest impact on organizational&nbsp;risk. Then teams can eliminate attack paths at critical junctures, i.e., choke points, in order to achieve ultra-efficient risk remediation.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/continuous-exposure-management-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Like many businesses, you started the MFA journey and might even consider it at a level of maturity. Yet, when questioned to rate compliance coverage or cyber insurance requirements for strong authentication business-wide, do you have a moment?</p>
<p>Workforce identity workflows are complicated, with an extensive portfolio of assets and legacy applications that create gaps in strong authentication coverage. However, organizations need to trust nothing and no one - and have to prove strong authentication is in place to regulators and cyber insurance underwriters.</p>
<p>In this session we will explore ways to strengthen your authentication system and fill coverage gaps:</p>
 
 Understand how MFA program can overcome strong authentication challenges from legacy applications and privileged users

<p>With heightened reliance on remotely delivered services and transactions, the need for safer and sounder digital identification and verification is required and will become the norm in the future. This especially is true looking forward to mandates for the adoption of zero trust frameworks in which digital credentials will be issued and then used for identification and operational purposes. GLEIF is committed to making concrete and lasting improvements to the process of identity verification by leveraging the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) in digital tools. GLEIF has made the LEI verifiable by creating the vLEI (verifiable LEI) with digital credentials that deliver decentralized identification and verification for organizations as well as the persons who represent their organizations either in official or functional roles. GLEIF has made much progress on developing the governance, credentials and infrastructure since introducing the vLEI in 2020 and will share an updated at this progress in this session.</p>

In this session, we will explore the insights that can be gained through the analysis of global DID data. At Danube Tech GmbH, we have developed version trackers that monitor various DID methods, such as did:indy, did:ebsi, did:ion and others, collecting and storing data on DID transactions in our database for analysis. During this session, we will present the results of our latest analyses, including trends in DID transactions over time, distributions across different verification methods, and errors found in DIDs and DID documents. This information can be valuable for businesses looking to understand and utilize DIDs in their operations, as well as for individuals seeking to use DIDs for their own digital identity management.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/global-decentralized-identifier-data-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Decentralized identity has made its waves in the EU with European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) and in the US with various funded projects. A vast market in south-east Asia stays untapped. We have enabled our partner organization ZADA to build a decentralized identity ecosystem that connects various southeast Asian countries with numerous cases like 'Decentralized Vaccination TravelPass', 'Employment IDs', and 'Government issued Educational Credentials'. The journey of a decentralized identity platform from ideation to MVP and to a scalable production system can bring tremendous insights. We were able to successfully enable the public sector in Myanmar to engage with self-sovereign identity and bring value to its citizens by issuing over more than a quarter million digital credentials. Monetization of these credentials was an essential factor for us. These self-sovereign identity credentials varied in use cases and were verified by Singapore immigration, Public sector hospitals, the Education Ministry of Myanmar, the Health Ministry of Myanmar, and various other private sector vendors. Our journey covers various use cases in EdTech, HealthTech, IAM, and KYC. Explored right, these cases can help us dive into how enterprises can engage with the southeast Asian identity market.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/decentralized-identity-ecosystem-southeast-asia-eic2023"></a>

It has inspired multiple working groups and continues to unite six non-profits - even (and especially) as the technical and policy landscape evolves to include emerging standards (e.g. MDLs, DIDs, VCs) and regulation (e.g. eIDAS 2.0).<br> <br> This talk reflects on GAIN's relevance in today’s landscape and shares progress. It includes a deep dive into the technical community group at the OpenID Foundation, which has built a prototype that demonstrates cross-network trust and high-assurance identity data exchange. It now turns its attention to digital wallets, verifiable credentials, legal entity identifiers, and government-issued IDs.<br> <br> It also reviews forward-thinking policy work by the Open Identity Exchange, which paves the way for Smart Digital IDs. Their Global Policy Metadata Framework proposes the standard publication of policy characteristics. In this world, policy metadata is shared between each trust framework through trusted wallets.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/gain-2023-and-beyond-eic2023"></a>

  <p>How changing requirements for a seamless yet secure customer experience affect your Customer Identity solution</p>
<p>Today's consumers live parallel lives, with one foot in the physical world and the other foot leaving many digital footprints across the internet.&nbsp;In the physical world, trust is easier to build and identity is easier to validate. In the digital world&nbsp;the consumer is The Invisible Man - more difficult to interact and connect with but wanting a simple, effortless digital experience with impeccable security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this session, we will explore how identity is the link between both worlds and is the centre of every great customer experience. From providing delightful experiences to ensuring security and privacy, we will show how the right Identity Solution resolves the Invisible Man paradox, building connection and trust in the digital world.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/invisible-man-paradox-eic2023"></a>

<p>At IPFS Thing 2023, Engineer Blaine Cook presented his work on the Name Name System, a tool that could improve the discoverability of IPFS-hosted content.</p> What's in a Name? <p>Let's start with the basics. First, let's define what a name is and isn't. A name is public, globally unique, and verifiable. </p>  Public - viewable by everyone  Globally unique - cannot be duplicated  Verifiable - possible to prove control of the name using a DID. Examples of verifiable names include DNS hosts and domains, email addresses, social media handles, public keys, HTTP URLs, SSNs, and more.  <blockquote>"A DID is not a name, but all NNS names have at least one valid DID."</blockquote> What is NNS? <p>It is a way to map names to data securely.</p> How Does it Work? <p>Step 1: Select a did:method</p><p>This could be did:ens, did:DNS did:twitter, etc.</p><p>Step 2: Fetch the TXT record for your did:method and find the public key</p><p>Step 3: Input the name and DID data in the NNS form</p>  Name (the name you are assigning to the content)  Issuer (the DID)  Fact Type (DNS link, Mastodon server, etc.)  Fact Value (the pointer to that fact type)  <p>Step 4: Generate a UCAN out of that data</p>  DID for Private Key  UCAN  Signature  <p>Step 5: Store in NNS DHT (shown in Blaine's demo in the recording)</p><p>Step 6: Fetch the record(s) for the name from the DHT and use the data in the UCAN</p><p>Since a name is tied to a specific DID, and the DID is self-validating, there is no way to manipulate a name you don't have control over. We enable authentication (DID) and authorization (UCAN) in a distributed P2P system and create a DHT by storing the UCAN in NNS, thus opening up many exciting possibilities. &nbsp;</p> What Problems Does NNS Help Solve? <p>Discoverability - NNS helps users find other users' public keys without knowing the DID method they used to generate them. It also allows the user to find where another user shares content tied to that DID. </p><p>Encrypted Chat - NNS can be a mechanism for enabling encrypted communication</p><p>IPFS Search - If you want to know where someone's IPFS-hosted blog exists, finding it can be very difficult if you don't know the CID. NNS helps locate specific content by its name, which is much more human-readable and easier to remember.</p><p>Package Naming - Similar to IPFS Search, NNS makes locating specific Wasm code easier through package naming.</p> What is NNS Not? <p>It's not a petname system. Petnames don't cross connectivity or trust barriers. In a local-first future, we need names to help us continue working offline and ensure we interact with the person/data we intend.</p><p>It's not a way to prove ownership of a name (that's what the DIDs are for!). It helps you discover those proofs.</p><p>It's not a new namespace. </p><p>It's not guaranteed to be globally consistent.</p><p>It's not a blockchain.</p> Possibilities <p>It can bring together all existing standards in one place instead of trying to create a new standard.</p>XKCD <a href="https://xkcd.com/927">https://xkcd.com/927/</a><p>It could replace IPNS and DNSLink by improving latency and security. Yes, a decentralized DNS!</p><p>Currently, there are several ways to link DNS names to the decentralized web, but virtually no options link email, social handles, HTTP, etc.</p><p>We could enable permissionless usage of names that we don't own using NNS by signing a proof that we own an email address (for example) even if that email is from a centralized service that hasn't enabled interactions with some new decentralized service. </p> Next Steps <p>This work is in the beginning/experimental stages, and many questions still need to be answered. We also need to solve for latency and locality and ensure a degree of consistency. </p><p>Here's the recording of Blaine's presentation at IPFS Thing 2023.</p><p>If you'd like to learn more about NNS, you can review the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/nns-the-name-name-system/3684">spec</a> and join our monthly <a href="https://lu.ma/ucan?tk=I52b5p">UCAN community calls</a>. </p><p> </p>

  The G7 is pushing for increased oversight of P2P cryptocurrency transactions through the&nbsp;FATF.  Authorities insist that the proposed regulatory changes could lead to a safer and more transparent cryptocurrency market, fostering wider adoption.  These stricter regulations raise concerns about privacy rights and could increase costs for crypto service providers.  <p>Cryptocurrencies have surged onto the global stage, carving out a significant niche in an increasingly digital world. However, the rapid expansion of this relatively nascent market has also been accompanied by notable challenges.</p><p>The Group of Seven (G7), recognizing these challenges, is now pushing for improved oversight of peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions. And although this call to action has its share of potential benefits, it also underscores the complex realities of&nbsp;change.</p> A Significant Shift <p>The G7’s call for the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to intensify its scrutiny signals a significant shift in global regulatory focus.</p><p>The FATF, an intergovernmental body known for setting global standards against illicit financial activities, currently only supervises transactions that go through crypto service providers. By extending this oversight to include peer-to-peer transactions, the G7 aims to cast a broader safety net over the global crypto landscape.</p><p>This proposition comes at a pivotal moment as digital currencies continue to gain traction worldwide, with regulators insisting that a robust regulatory framework is not just essential anymore — it’s imperative.</p><p>Authorities believe enhanced oversight could curb illicit activities, strengthen overall market confidence and security, spur trust among users and potential investors, and set the stage for broader adoption of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>More on the topic: G7’s <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/g7s-double-play-stricter-crypto-regulation-and-cbdc-adoption">Double Play: Stricter Crypto Regulation and CBDC&nbsp;Adoption</a></p> The Flip&nbsp;Side <p>This regulatory coin involves striking a delicate balance between increased oversight and the sanctity of user privacy — a valued feature that has been central to the appeal of cryptocurrencies.</p><p>While necessary for mitigating risks, regulations may impinge on the freedom and privacy that crypto users have come to appreciate.</p><p>Also, the increased costs for crypto service providers to adhere to new regulations could indirectly affect the users. While some view these potential costs as necessary for the sector’s evolution, others fear it could hamper innovation and growth in the&nbsp;space.</p><p>Balancing these aspects — privacy, security, and cost — will be a crucial part of the regulatory evolution.</p><p>More on the topic: <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/the-fatf-travel-rule-implications-for-privacy-and-data-protection">The FATF Travel Rule — Implications for Privacy and Data Protection</a></p> Final Note <p>While the G7 calls for enhanced oversight of individual cryptocurrency transactions is a significant step towards a safer and more transparent crypto ecosystem, it is essential to tread carefully.</p><p>The crypto landscape is a complex and rapidly evolving one, and ensuring its sustainable growth requires a regulatory approach that considers all sides of the equation.</p><p>The crypto world is on the brink of significant changes, but with careful consideration and balance, these changes could pave the way for a brighter crypto&nbsp;future.</p><p>______________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

  <p>This week Simon and David review the recent RSA Conference that occurred at the end of April over in San Francisco. From the generic meta-patterns at the conference covering themes such as collaboration, standards, multi-cloud and technology integration, through to more IAM focused conversations covering MFA, passkeys and authentication attacks. Are passkeys now here to stay? What will help adoption? Will attacks on passkeys start to increase along with usage rates? Will attacks against existing MFA forms including SIM swap, MFA fatigue and social engineering be a compelling event to improve adoption?</p>

<p>Certificate lifecycle management (CLM) is a critical requirement for organizations. In the past we’ve talked about the need for CLM <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/05/the-speed-of-business-is-fast-is-your-pki-keeping-up/">due to CA sprawl and concerns around legacy PKI</a>, and it being a means to rein that in and centralize certificates across environments. We also know that the number of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/12/the-trend-continues-organizations-are-managing-and-issuing-more-certificates-than-ever/">machine identities are on the rise</a> and in addition to the sheer number of machine identities that need to be managed, they also bring complexities – such as short-life certificates – that make manual processes unsustainable.</p>
<p>While those are excellent reasons to invest in a proper CLM tool, let’s talk a bit more about the role of CLM in relation to overall IT strategy – like implementing <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/zero-trust">Zero Trust</a> and preparing for post-quantum.</p>
<p>Zero Trust</p>
<p>Digital certificates provide identity to people and machines, such as mobile devices, virtual machines, and IoT devices. Those certificates need to be issued by a PKI/certificate authority, which will then be able to verify that thing and give it access, whether that’s allowing someone access to your network, or servers talking to one another.</p>
<p>The part where CLM comes in as an important component of your overall Zero Trust strategy is in making sure you have strong issuance protection for your certificates. Essentially making sure no rogue certificates get issued giving too much access or privilege. This same reasoning applies to the need for control at any stage in the lifecycle of a certificate, like revocation.</p>
<p>Going one step further, here’s how CLM helps enforce the principles of Zero Trust:</p>
 
 Verify Explicitly – Making sure the right certificate is provisioned to the correct endpoint/target 
 Least Privilege – Providing the right assurance and access/privilege, by picking the correct certificate and lifecycle controls to be able to issue and manage it 
 Assume Breach – The ability to contain an attack and limit the loss and damage by revoking certificates (incident response) 
 
<p>Post-Quantum </p>
<p>When it comes to post-quantum preparedness, there is a looming <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/10/the-end-of-the-golden-age-of-crypto/">threat to existing cryptography</a>, which means organizations need to take steps today to prepare for the migration to quantum-safe cryptography. One of the first steps in that preparation is to have visibility into your cryptographic assets – from hardware and software to keys, certificates, and secrets.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways CLM can help:</p>
 
 Inventory. With robust discovery capabilities, CLM tools can help centralize the visibility of certificates across environments, from different certification authorities, so you know what credentials you have and where. 
 Identify Weak Cryptography. Is your cryptography up to date? Do you have hard-coded algorithms?<a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/03/do-you-have-cryptographic-agility/"> Are you crypto-agile</a>? The right tools can identity any risks you might have with your cryptography so you can remediate in advance of preparing for the migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). 
 Consolidation. Going back to a core use of CLM – reining in the CA sprawl – it can be a tool to help migrate and consolidate your PKI footprint, making the transition to PQC much easier. 
 Automation. With the growth in the number of certificates organizations are managing, and the complexities of IT landscapes, organizations are looking for automation. There’s too much to manage and it’s too great of a risk to not have, making it a necessity. Pairing that with the migration challenge of PQC, automation will be a key ingredient to successful implementations. 
 
<p>Whether for the practical reasons of ensuring you have visibility and control over your environments, or for the more strategic reasons of implementing Zero Trust and preparing for post-quantum, make sure you’re using the right CLM tool alongside your PKI to ensure a secure future.</p>

 What’s your name and where are you&nbsp;from? <p>My name is Hamzat and I am an Ontology harbinger.</p> Tell us a bit about yourself. What did you study? What are your&nbsp;hobbies? <p>I am a quiet and simple person in general. However, I get things done quickly when something piques my interest. My strength is my ability to work really well within a team. I like to have an impact on the success of my team, therefore, I work hard and contribute many of my own&nbsp;ideas.</p><p>I completed a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering before starting my career. My hobbies include reading, traveling, and going on adventures. If I could have a superpower, it would be to be positioned whereby I can do things that make me happy and support humanity each and every day without having to worry about financial implications.</p> What kind of work do you do on a day-to-day basis? <p>I joined Ontology as a harbinger in 2017 to help others to understand and contribute to the company’s vision and mission. My role is to provide support for Ontology’s English-speaking community members. This involves providing members with information on the Ontology project or assisting them with any questions they might have. I also run a procurement company (BitKong General Merchandise) aside from volunteering with Ontology.</p> In your opinion, what makes Ontology stand out from other blockchains? <p>Ontology has been well-funded from the start and devoid of any crypto drama. As a project, it places huge value on its community and acts on any community feedback related to the Ontology product offering. Ontology is wholly dedicated to building the most impactful thing for the crypto space — a framework for Decentralized Identity Management, and this is something that sets it apart as a Web3&nbsp;project.</p> What is the most exciting part of the project you’re working on for Ontology? <p>Although I don’t have an active part in developing the Ontology project, I enjoy supporting the success of the project through my role. I contribute to building a community with a rich knowledge of the Ontology project, disseminating any information, and offering support to&nbsp;users.</p> What has been the most important moment in your career so&nbsp;far? <p>I am very grateful for the time spent working with Ontology. While it has been a tough journey, it has sharpened my perception as an individual. Also, being able to provide support to other people, irrespective of their background, and being recognized for my efforts frequently, is very fulfilling for&nbsp;me.</p> What are you most excited about in your future at Ontology? <p>I am most excited about being able to contribute to the growth of the Ontology community and provide much-needed support to the ever-growing network of Ontology members. I have seen how Ontology has succeeded in recent years as a decentralized identity provider and how the project has grown steadily, so I am very excited to see how it&nbsp;expands.</p> As we mark Ontology’s five-year anniversary, where do you see Ontology and Web3 going in the next five&nbsp;years? <p>I expect Ontology to be very successful in the next five years and to become a dominant force to contend with in the industry. I think it will outpace its competitors with its data privacy protection products and decentralized identity management tools, and thus, become a widely adopted Web3 project with a high price appreciation for its native&nbsp;token.</p> Contact us <p>- Ontology official website: <a href="https://ont.io/">https://ont.io/</a></p><p>- Email contact: contact@ont.io</p><p>- GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/ontio/">https://github.com/ontio/</a></p><p>- Telegram group: <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetworkCN">https://t.me/OntologyNetwork</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/meet-the-team-ontology-harbinger-hamzat-5f01a23ee227">Meet the Team: Ontology Harbinger, Hamzat</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Phishing, hacking, threats, fraud, and malicious behavior online of all types all share a common root: verification. In this session we’ll go beyond identity and explain how decentralized identity and verifiable credentials can provide a complete, secure system for exchanging different types of information between multiple parties. Learn how Trusted Data Ecosystems can connect people, machines, companies or any two entities to multiple businesses and jurisdictions without sharing private information. In this conversation, long-time community contributor at Hyperledger, working group leader at Decentralized Identity Foundation, and Indicio Senior Engineer Sam Curren will share more about digital trust and describe the critical importance of digital verification to decentralized healthcare, finance, the metaverse, and to the interaction of digital objects and non-digital objects in the spatial web—the “Internet of Everything.”</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-trust-metaverse-eic2023"></a>

  <p>As organizations undergo digital transformation to zero-trust architectures, identity-driven security becomes a critical aspect. Beyond new authentication technologies, organizations must have strong authorization controls. Today, if and when an identity is compromised, the attacker can make lateral movements with very few restrictions and access a wide range of critical systems and information. Much of this over-permissive environment can be attributed to manual permissions management processes that are hard to maintain over time. Role-based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC), which underlie these manual processes, provide a good baseline for access security. However, their complexity grows over time and the management overhead they place oftentimes subvert the very goals of security and compliance they are deployed for. Just-In-Time Access Management (JITAM) represents a new robust and secure authorization strategy that can reduce the need for periodic access certifications and manual role administration, while providing auditability. Learn how the authorization space is rapidly changing from RBAC and ABAC to JITAM, and how it could benefit your organization.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/whats-next-in-enterprise-authorization-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Decentralized identity has long been seen as a solution to the interconnected problems of verification, privacy, and security online, but now that it is being deployed in the marketplace, how does it manage the complex information flows and rules required by enterprises and governments? Much theoretical discussion has focused on what should happen, but in this conversation, we’ll discuss what actually happens when a customer implements a decentralized identity solution. We’ll explain why decentralized ecosystem governance is preferred to centralized trust registries, the importance of portable trust, automation, updating, and offline functionality, and why customers need to be able to choose between hierarchical and distributed governance.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/decentralized-identity-ecosystem-governance-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Cross device flows lets a user initiate an action on one device (e.g. a SmartTV) and authenticate or authorize that action on a trusted personal device (e.g. a mobile phone). Examples includes authorizing a smart TV to access streaming content, or authenticating to a service by scanning a QR code with a mobile phone and completing the authentication on the mobile phone. This process of authorizing an action on a separate (but trusted) device from the one on which an action is initiated is an increasingly common flow, whether used for devices with limited input capabilities, multi-factor authentication or credential presentation. A number of standards have adopted this pattern including Device Authorization Grant (formerly Device Code Flow), Client Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) and Self Issued OpenID Provider (SIOP). These flows solve important business problems, but is vulnerable to attacks where the user is tricked into granting consent to an attacker. The IETF OAuth working group has recognised this challenge and is creating new guidance that leverages zero-trust principles to defend against these "illicit consent grant" attacks. This session will discuss the attacks and how the new guidance can mitigate these threats against cross device flows.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/cross-device-flows-illicit-consent-grant-attacks-eic2023"></a>

  <p>The past few years have seen a startling increase in decentralized technologies for Digital Identities. So far, much of their adoption has been limited to academic or proof-of-concept integrations (barring some shining examples) rather than consolidated production-ready use cases.</p>
<p>Generally, there isn't an enforced link between real-world and digital identities, and rightfully so. Still, enterprises' policies and regulations mandate companies to ensure restricted access to reserved data and undeniable attribution, which collides with general anonymity and distributed principles. Albeit SSI technologies aim at filling this gap with trusted-yet-privacy-preserving solutions, companies still need to consolidate digital identities and collapse them into a well-defined entity. We will talk about a hybrid approach to classic IAM for workforce management including W3C native credential integration with solidified and well-established SSO federations. In other words, delegate to the end users the choice of which identity technology to use as long as they can provide a trust chain that the companies can verify.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/hybrid-iam-interoperable-verifiable-credentials-eic2023"></a>

Will we still need Identity Governnance Tools in 5 years time or will a universal cyber-AI have taken over the task of securely running the enterprise you currently work for?&nbsp;What about Tech Analysts and their guidance work? Will 90% of their work be done by non-humans? In this session we will try to jointly find answers on how tech guidance and consulting/advisory will change and, at least partly, disappear.</p>
<p>And this is how ChatGPT would write the Abstract of this discussion:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The session on "Tech Guidance in the Era of Polycrisis &amp; AI Driven Disruptive Change" will examine the increasing disruptive pressure on today´s business models caused by an evolving landscape of AI driven technology and the critical role of tech analysts to help organizations navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by the convergence of multiple crisis and the rapid pace of technological change.</p>
<p>Topics to be covered include the evolving role of tech analysts in an AI-driven world, the importance of understanding the ethical implications of technology, and the impact of technological change on job markets and society as a whole. The session will also delve into the challenges of staying abreast of an increasingly complex and rapidly changing technological landscape, as well as the importance of fostering a culture of innovation and collaboration within organizations.</p>

Cyentia completed a global study of high-level practices which measurably contribute to a more successful cybersecurity program based on a rigorous survey of nearly 5,000 practitioners. Within that study, we analyzed commonalities of organizations implementing and operating Zero Trust. Let's look closely at where we are today.</p>
<p>Now imagine it is 2028. You’re five years into your Zero Trust transformation. People like it and usability has improved. Defensibility is better, too, with a number of attacks having been stopped over the past couple years. But then, in 2028, you get the call. There’s been a security breach. What happened!? This session will explore the future with a pre-mortem on how breaches will look under a Zero Trust architecture.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/zero-trust-in-five-years-eic2023"></a>

<p>OAuth 2.0 is a widely adopted standard for authorization, but it can be complex to implement correctly. It's not uncommon for developers to have difficulty understanding the nuances of the OAuth 2.0 flow and instead rely on simpler approaches such as using API keys in "god mode."<br> <br> OAuth 2.0 can be difficult to set up and configure, especially for developers who are new to the standard. It involves creating an OAuth 2.0 client, setting up redirect URIs, and managing access and refresh tokens, which can be confusing and time-consuming. Additionally, the standard requires developers to handle user authentication and authorization separately, which can be difficult to understand for those who are not familiar with the concepts.<br> <br> Many developers may not understand the security benefits of OAuth 2.0 over API keys. OAuth 2.0 allows for fine-grained access control, enabling developers to limit access to specific resources and actions. In contrast, API keys provide more open access, allowing all actions on all resources. Developers may be inclined to use API keys instead of OAuth 2.0 because they are simpler and easier to implement, but they don't offer the same level of security.<br> Developers may find it hard to understand the standards, and may end up using an inconsistent approach.<br> <br> The panel will discuss these reasons and other potential causes for why developers may not be using OAuth 2.0 correctly, and provide recommendations for how to overcome these challenges. We will highlight the benefits of OAuth 2.0, such as improved security and the ability to provide fine-grained access control, to encourage developers to adopt the standard. Additionally we will give examples of real-world attack scenarios that could have been avoided if the application was using OAuth 2.0.</p>

<p>We entrust workloads and devices with our most sensitive data, giving them access to far more information than the human on whose behalf it operates, if it is even operating on behalf of a human. Yet, managing these non-human identities and applying Zero Trust Policies to them is a Herculean task complicated by a heterogenous technology landscape, amplified by multi-cloud/multi-hybrid environments, exacerbated by critical skills shortages and magnified by exponential growth in workload and device identities. <br> <br> It's the kind of problem standards excel at solving by creating interoperability layers between heterogenous environments, codifying the wisdom of the crowd to alleviate pressures on rare skills, and creating eco-systems of interoperable solutions that meet a common security bar. <br> <br> Fortunately there are already several standards efforts that can help us manage non-human identities. But how are all these efforts related and how to we avoid replacing a patchwork of heterogenous solutions with a patchwork of heterogenous standards? Is it possible to craft a standards framework and connect all these efforts in a single identity trust fabric, and is that desirable? If we had such a framework, what would it look like? <br> <br> In this talk we explore the benefits of weaving a standards framework for non-human identities by bringing together more than 18 standards from at least 7 standards bodies while identifying opportunities to align and connect them all to solve the emerging challenge of managing non-human identities at scale.</p>

<p>As always, there is something new and relevant in this. The fundamental question for many organizations will be on how to address the identity threat challenge best. Does it require new or different tools, or just a different use of what is already there? What to look for specifically? And how to reduce the risk of identity-based attacks?

Most frequently encountered are probably “user” and “identity” - do they represent the same type of entity or is a difference intended?

  <p>Regulatory bodies, government agencies, and CIOs are mandating Zero Trust as a cyber security framework. What does Zero Trust mean for your security strategy? With a Zero Trust security model, nobody is trusted automatically, even when they’ve cleared the perimeter. Instead, all identities are verified, minimum access is granted based on context, and activities are monitored to make sure controls are working as expected. The Zero Trust model requires multiple security controls throughout an IT environment to protect and manage identities, devices, networks, applications, and data. This session will take you through the reality check of where Zero Trust started, how it has evolved over the years and what does it really mean for your organization today.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/beyond-zero-trust-zero-friction-eic2023"></a>

So let’s keep them all together in a scalable cloud storage repository. Once it is there, it is just like any other big data. We need to analyze and apply intelligent monitoring to detect situations of interest. So we need to apply trained ML models to a stream of such data for immediate alerting when the traces indicate an unwanted behavior occurring or brewing.

This enables a frictionless experience for “good users” without lowering the defenses for “bad users.” <br> In this session, we’ll explore Dark Web techniques, open-source tools, and services that fraudsters use for credential stuffing, fake account creation, and account takeovers. In addition, we’ll share a practitioner's viewpoint on rolling out various active and passive authentication solutions and how the convergence of identity and fraud can help you build the right passwordless strategy.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/better-passwordless-experience-eic2023"></a>

  <p>This decade may well be labeled “the decade of the digital credential.” From COVID passports to mobile driver’s licenses, digitized credentials transforming to “born digital” credentials, and governments and large tech companies developing their own wallets, personal information has never been easier to share with the wave of a device. The convenience is amazing, and the privacy implications are terrifying. <br><br> Even scoping the issue down to government-issued credentials or credentials directly derived from government data, there are a variety of requirements feeding into this growing ecosystem:</p>
 
 user control of data 
 data minimization 
 relying party accountability 
 extensibility to other domains 
 optional audit log of transactions and ability to assert rights (CCPA, GDPR) 
 minimization of fraud 
 
<p>In this session, Heather Flanagan and Mike Kiser will discuss the outcomes of the recently released white paper on government-issued credentials and the privacy landscape (publication date expected in April 2023). The issues at hand are not solely about policy, nor are they only about technology. It is about closing the policy and protocol gaps that exist between today’s disparate solutions and services and providing a vision of a privacy-preserving, globally viable privacy landscape.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ubiquitous-credential-government-issued-identity-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Securing access to data and applications has become a cornerstone of any modern cybersecurity strategy.</p>
<p>User access governance projects however have a history of incurring multi-year roll-outs and requiring specialized personnel, making many companies shy away and bear excessive cyber risk.</p>
<p>For those companies, approaching user access governance as a data problem can provide the answer. This approach effectively trims down user access governance to its essentials: low-effort data collection, user-friendly risk analytics, access reviews and plugging into the existing ITSM processes. This data-driven approach has the potential to let companies achieve mature access governance in a matter of days, not months.</p>

  <p>Access control is a key part of cyber security, however traditional approaches do not work well for modern business IT environments that nowadays typically include a mix of applications on-prem and across multiple cloud environments.</p>
<p>Most modern companies tend to struggle with access management for a variety of reasons. These include the fact that it is difficult to make the necessary connections to the many disparate IT systems for which they need to provision access, role-based access management is challenging, static role-based entitlements are difficult to manage and typically require regular recertification processes, and traditional approaches are focused on granting access to resources required by an individual to perform their job function, but do not cover how those rights are actually used to stop any abuse of entitlements.</p>
<p>In addition, course-grained authorization is no longer sufficient because modern applications and sensitive data assets in cloud-native, containerized and DevOps environments require fine grained authorization capabilities that can also supply identity attributes and context variables.</p>
<p>A policy-based approach can address many of the pain points experienced by organizations today by enabling a centralized, consistent, dynamic, on-demand (just-in-time) way of managing access to IT resources. In this panel session we will discuss nothing less than the future of Access Management.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/getting-rid-of-roles-recertification-eic2023"></a>

  <p>In this talk, Krishna Balan Kannappan will describe Kone´s path to a holistic and integrated Identity Security infrastructure.</p>
 
 IDM Deployment in KONE includes Lifecycle management of KONE Internal Users and non person accounts. Automated Processes in IDM ensures that minimum accesses required for Internal Users are granted automatically based on User Attributes and all accesses are removed automatically when user leaves the organization. Non Person accounts are hardened automatically based on the usage. 
 Applications authorization is managed by IDM using various provisioning mechanisms. 
 Applications authentication is controlled by Azure AD, MFA enabled is mandated for all applications and end users. 
 Admin Accounts used for Accessing KONE Infrastructure and Workstations are managed in IDM(Microsoft recommended Tier based model is used). 
 Self Service allows Role Owners and Account Owners to Create Access Reviews, Manage Passwords, Manage Access. 
 KONE SOC team uses IDM for performing emergency actions to disable/enable/reset Password of AD Accounts. 
 
<p>Privilege Access Management:</p>
 
 KONE uses PRIVX as the PAM Solution for allowing access to Infrastructure. PAM is integrated with IDM for authorizations. PAM Solution ensures KONE Infratructure cannot be accessed outside PAM by access controls and continuous monitoring. 
 PAM Uses Separate MFA for added Security. 
 Automations are implemented to onboard/offboard Application servers into PAM 
 
<p>DevSecops model is used for Development, automated deployments, Security Scans and automated Testing.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-security-implementation-eic2023"></a>

You may have seen this before through the disguise of acronyms such as ReBAC (relationship-based), KBAC (knowledge-based), PBAC (policy-based), NGAC (Next-Generation), FGA (fine-grained), and even some implementations of ABAC (attribute-based). All of these terms refer to techniques that use graphs to enforce access-control for any level of coarseness.<br> <br> In this session you will learn why all the latest Dynamic Authorization offerings on the market use GBAC in a way or another, and how you can successfully adopt the technique yourself. Graphs are becoming ubiquitous - one can just look at the rise of the GraphQL API model to witness their popularity first-hand. Through concrete, real-life examples we will showcase the use of graphs to solve common access problems using the same modern and future-proof techniques that you see in the current authorization market.<br> <br> As a result, storing all identity data in graphs truly unlocks its full potential. Graphs are data-science and analytics enablers, and have the potential to transform the IAM practice from a cost centre to a true revenue generator. We’ll explore how this can happen for you too…</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/graph-based-access-control-eic2023"></a>

Jacoba Sieders, Denny Prvu, and Ian Glazer will debate the pros and cons of the notion of a Chief Identity Officer role. Topics will include:</p>
 
 What would the value of such a role be? And how is such a role measured? 
 What would the responsibilities of said Officer be and what is the role’s remit? What are its boundaries? 
 What questions should the Board and C-Suite be asking? What should they know about identity that they don’t today? 
 How would such an Officer quantify the value of the identity infrastructure to the business? 
 Does the need for the role differ based on industry sector and geography? 
 How would this role fit with the Chief Digital Officer, Information Security Officer, and Privacy / Data Protection Officer? 
 And how would this make things better for the digital identity practitioner and the industry as a whole?

  <p>Imagine a world where security risks are identified and mitigated before they even happen. Imagine if access and auditing recommendations were made with the precision of a computer algorithm. Imagine the power of artificial intelligence to revolutionize your organization's identity governance and administration practices. We have reached an inflection point in the world of AI.&nbsp;The release of technologies like ChatGPT is as monumental as the development of the internet or Google as a search engine.&nbsp;AI is going to change the way we think about IGA. With the capabilities of AI, IGA solutions can provide a higher level of granularity, faster data processing, and more complex analysis to better identify and mitigate risks in real-time. This will lead to more effective risk management, smarter access and auditing recommendations, and increased automation of processes and operations. But this is just the beginning. As this technology continues to evolve, we can expect to see even greater benefits from AI-enabled IGA solutions in the future. Imagine a future where your organization's security is not just protected but anticipates and proactively prevents threats before they happen. So I ask you, are you ready to join us in shaping the future of IGA? Are you ready to harness the power of AI to revolutionize your organization's identity governance and administration practices? The future is here, and it's time to embrace it.<br> In this talk, attendees will learn about the potential for AI to revolutionize Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) practices.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ai-future-of-iga-eic2023"></a>

  <p>When I travel aboard or do business with someone from outside my country, my payment cards and phone work across international boundaries. When will my Digital ID do the same? <br> <br> This presentation will share how OIX’s work on Global Interoperability, part of the GAIN initiative, is defining how this will be possible through smart digital IDs or wallets that dynamically adapt to the policy rules of each new trust framework they encounter in a way that works seamlessly for the end user. <br> <br> So, when I fly to the EU from the US my Digital ID from my US based wallet provider reads the rules of the EU trust framework and simply adapts. I don’t need to get a new local Digital ID for my visit to the EU. The EU trust framework policy rules will be described using a new globally applicable Open Policy Rules Exchange Framework that allows all frameworks to publish their policy characteristics in a standard machine-readable way. <br> <br> My digital ID wallet contains key ‘golden credentials’ that should be accepted all over globe: passport, driving licence, bank account, telco account and my digital national ID card. Each trust framework will value these differently in its own Assurance Policy, which can also be published via the policy rule exchange framework. To make this work, new proofing and data content standards for some of the golden credentials will be required.<br> <br> Technically, exchange of policy rules will be a decentralized approach, where policy rules are shared directly from each trust framework only to wallets they trust. The presentation will also outline the technical architecture to underpin this, and how the Open Policy Rules Exchange Framework will fit as a policy component as part of the Open Wallet Foundation architecture. <br> <br> OIX is working with and analysing various trust frameworks around the global to create the Open Policy Rules framework, including the UK, Canada, EU, Australia, Singapore, MOSIP and Bank ID Sweden. <br> <br> Come and find out more about how OIX’s vision of allowing us all to have a trusted Digital ID that can be accepted anywhere in the world can be achieved.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-id-wallet-all-over-the-world-eic2023"></a>

<p>Employees don’t need us. And by employee, I mean more than end-users. This is a broader conversation; including software developers, IT engineers, DevOps practitioners, and more. To get people to opt in and follow secure practices, we turn to behavior science. IT security leaders must offer them a compelling experience.

  <p>PAM (Privileged Access Management) is one of the established core disciplines within IAM. PAM also is the IAM discipline that is changing most from what it has been in the past.</p>
<p>On one hand, there is the impact of CIEM &amp; DREAM, Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management or Dynamic Resource Entitlement &amp; Access Management. This is about the expansion of PAM beyond humans accessing servers and selected applications towards any type of human and non-human (silicon) identity accessing any type of workload, from servers to dynamic cloud resources. This also implies an expansion from serving static data center infrastructures to dynamic workloads in today’s agile IT. PAM is changing, with more parties involved – a “PAMocracy”, as KuppingerCole Analyst Paul Fisher recently named it.</p>
<p>These changes also require expansions in integration to other IT services. There needs to be a dynamic governance approach, where IGA comes into play. It requires rethinking whether PAM tools really should care for authentication. There is no need for authentication point solutions in an age where most organizations have a strong Access Management solution with MFA, passwordless authentication and adaptive, risk- and context-based access in place. Finally, this new PAM must integrate with the DevOps tools chain for permanent updates about new code and the resources used as well as with IT Asset Management for an always up-to-date insight into the ever-changing, dynamic IT landscape that needs to be protected.</p>
<p>Also worth to think about is integration with further security solutions, beyond the standard SIEM/SOAR integration. AI-powered security solutions are one aspect. Integration to Cloud Security Posture Management is another example.</p>
<p>In this panel, the state and requirements on the future PAM will be discussed.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/future-role-of-pam-eic2023"></a>

  <p>From digital identity to full scale digital trust, this session is perfect for anyone new to identity, as well as identity professionals who are trying to get a handle on what decentralization is all about and why it is so important for Internet-scale digital trust.<br> <br> In this session, we will cover a brief history of how the identity landscape has gone through an evolution from the dreaded username and password, through centralized, federated and social logins, to now the need for decentralized solutions that support digital trust for both human and objects.<br> <br> We will explain the various actors involved in a decentralized identity trust triangle, what role technology plays (e.g., digital wallets and digital credentials), and how governance of an ecosystem fits in to create the trust diamond. We will discuss various technical components that may be employed and what is required — and more importantly what is not? We will also present how decentralized trust solutions can support the trust of objects that have nothing to do with human identity, but are necessary to create a digital trust landscape that enables digital transactions to happen seamlessly, efficiently, and automatically.<br> <br> We’ll also touch on how the traditional identity solutions and emerging decentralization can co-exist in context appropriate settings.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/decentralized-identity-rage-eic2023"></a>

  <p>There’s a lot of foundational work happening in the space of Selective Disclosure (SD) right now. Selective Disclosure enables you to have a token with many claims (say, an ISO Mobile Drivers’ License (mDL)), and only release the claims necessary to the interaction – for instance, your birthdate but not your home address.&nbsp; Selective Disclosure enables Minimal Disclosure.&nbsp; This is sometimes realized using Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) but that’s not always necessary.</p>
<p>In decentralized identity ecosystems, users hold their own credentials to share them with others when needed. One key requirement for these credentials is selective disclosure: instead of sharing the entire credential, users should be able to share only the minimal amount of information necessary for a given use case. This is where SD-JWT comes in.<br> SD-JWT (Selective Disclosure JWT) is a new format for enabling selective disclosure in JWTs. It is based on the JOSE family of standards for signing and encryption, making it easy to understand and implement.<br> Developed by the IETF OAuth Working Group, SD-JWT is not limited to verifiable credentials, but can be used universally to provide selective disclosure for any JWT.<br> <br> Due to its simplicity, SD-JWT has quickly gained traction, with several implementations already available and ongoing adoption as an important building block in both commercial and public projects. In this talk, we will introduce the concepts behind SD-JWT and provide a detailed overview of its capabilities and benefits. We will also discuss the current state of SD-JWT adoption and future directions for its development.</p>
<p>Some of the current work pertinent to Selective Disclosure is:</p>

  <p>Italy has two National Digital Identity schemes, namely: SPID and CieID (leveraging the national ID card). Both of them are based on SAML2 and are on their way to supporting OpenID Connect. The reasons for this decision are numerous, and they are primarily related to OpenID Connect Core features such as flexibility, ease of implementation, better support for mobile applications, and widespread adoption, particularly in the private sector. To manage this transition, we considered several documents by the OAuth working group describing security best Current Practices and the OpenID Foundation specifying a profile for iGov and a framework for federation. In particular, the latter defines a hierarchical federation model with high security, interoperability, scalability, and transparency based on dynamic delegation mechanisms; Italy is an enthusiastic early adopter. <br> In this talk, we introduce the Italian OpenID Connect profile based on the iGov and federation profiles and explain the main security measures that we considered within our design from the aforementioned standards and available best current practices. We also discuss how the Italian OpenID Connect profile contributes to the iGov and OpenID Connect Federation documents. We conclude the presentation with a brief discussion of eIDAS 2.0 and some of the ongoing preliminary works in the context of the Italian digital identity ecosystem to move toward an SSI-based solution using the Italian OpenID Connect profile as a starting point.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/italian-digital-identity-ecosystem-eic2023"></a>

				  With growing interest in decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, it’s easy to think that they are something only big business or nation states can use. But even the smallest businesses can benefit from this technology. So the question we will answer: What can verifiable credentials do for you if, say, you have a small business?  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>Let’s start with a few of the problems that all businesses face: employee and access management, engaging customers, and payroll. While larger organizations can have entire teams dedicated to each of these tasks, leaner businesses — such as a single location — might have a small number of people trying to manage everything; this is where verifiable credentials can make all the difference.</p>
<p>Let’s break down exactly how for each business problem.</p>
<p>Employee and Access Management</p>
<p>Employees at any business need to be allowed access to certain things to do their job properly, such as&nbsp; interacting with the suppliers to procure ingredients, or a manager or team lead may need to set the schedule and hours for other employees. By providing everyone a credential it becomes easy to grant these permissions, and for the employees to be able to share that they are authorized by their employer to act on their behalf.</p>
<p>Creating these different levels of access is super easy to set up, it can be as simple as checkboxes — employee X can access suppliers, while employee Z is new, and can only access the time clock to clock in and out. Should an employee leave, removing their access, business-wide, is as simple as revoking their credential: no more need for changing passwords or getting their keys back.</p>
<p>All of this can be coordinated without the complexity and expense of creating direct integrations with external databases. Some of this vision is far reaching (such as lock access via credentials), but some of this (such as employee software access via credentials) is quite real today.</p>
<p>Engaging Customers</p>
<p>Customers are the lifeforce for any business; so, you need to do your best to keep them.This means building relationships, online and in person — and this is where verifiable credentials shine. They enable you to create a trusted digital relationship that enhances the customer’s experience.</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials allow you to build a trusted relationship by enabling direct, semantically described, privacy-preserving, and secure communication with your customers. This is not the same as sending your customer an email or text message and he or she sending one back. This is direct communication that is solely between you and your customer, by consent, and managed through a digital wallet.</p>
 
 Secure verification
 
 Customers can verify they are dealing with a business representative and workers can verify customers. This would be critical for any home medical provider. 
 The Agent software can detect when a customer is approaching and verify the customer and their order. 
 
 
 Secure messaging
 
 A customer can ask business or restaurant for today’s business hours, and where exactly it is, the special offers (if any), and the method of payments they accept. 
 The restaurant can alert a customer that their order is ready, the customer doesn’t need to stay within earshot or sight, and the business saves the cost of a specialized solution. This also prevents the need to share private data, such as a phone number, to receive the notification. 
 
 
 Enhanced data handling
 
 The business can save customer order history on the customer’s device with the customer’s permission, allowing the customer to share their preferences on a subsequent visit if they want to order their “usual.” 
 Data is saved on the customer side, so there is no need for the business to store customer data and manage data privacy compliance. 
 
 
 Balanced power
 
 Customers have full control over the connection with the business; they don’t need to unsubscribe or ask to be taken off a list. 
 Businesses benefit via simple customer relationships that are both powerful and regulation compliant. 
 
 
 
<p>The customer can interact with the business knowing that their personal data is not being stored or their behavior tracked, and they have consent over how they engage with the business. Loyalty programs built with this technology contain significant advantages over traditional solutions.</p>
<p>Payroll and Timekeeping</p>
<p>Tracking hours and payroll&nbsp; is a huge part of running any business. Verifiable credentials provide a secure way for everyone to clock in and out&nbsp; and automated payroll. By using an employee credential, no one else will be able to clock in for another employee if they are running late, or be able to see when anyone else clocked in unless they have access to that data, providing the business with a more accurate look at employee hours.</p>
<p>Easier than you think</p>
<p>Finally, if you take nothing else away from this article, we hope that you understand that none of this has to be complicated or particularly expensive. Whether you see your business as big or small, verifiable credentials offer a way to streamline several different aspects of your operations and make your life easier. If you want to learn more, or have specific questions you can <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">contact our team of experts</a> and they’d be happy to answer any questions or help you get started.</p>

<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Good morning, Robert. How are you?</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
I’m good Huzefa. How are you this morning?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Wonderful. I’m so excited about next week.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
So am I.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
We are going to be at the European Identity Conference in Berlin, which starts on May 9th and goes through May 12th. We will be at Booth 40, so we will have a presence there. Anybody can stop by, come and say hello, or if you just want to learn about 1Kosmos, stop by our booth. In addition to this, we are also hosting two sessions, one of the sessions is titled Utilizing Verifiable Credentials in the Workforce for Vendors and Contractors. This session is hosted by Mike Engle, our co-founder, our Chief Strategy Officer as well. This will be a very, very exciting session, primarily because how verifiable credentials can play in the workforce and his thoughts around it, along with live implementation that we’ve done. And the second session that we are providing is around Trends in Passwordless Authentication in Customer Identity and Access Management. Passwordless authentication has grown rapidly. The need for Passwordless is there in the market, but it’s primarily targeted on the workforce today. So we talk about how the customer identity and access management market is changing the passwordless access, and that would be another talk track, and I’m hosting that one.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
So I know that I’m excited about a bunch of things. What are you excited about going to be there?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
EIC or the European Identity Conference, in my opinion, is a premier identity conference, which is out there. It brings together the whole notion of how digital identity plays on the cloud with security as well. Very, very excited to see new emerging trends, which are going to be in the market for identity and digital identity in particular, as well as very excited to see our customers, partners and a few prospects as well.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
Yeah, absolutely. I’m same boat. I always like going over and just listening to what’s going on in the market, how Kuppinger sees the world, just in general, where they see the market going. Plus, it’s always good to see new friends, old friends, just kind of catch up. We know that this industry is pretty small, so it’s always fun to catch up with people and then obviously talking to customers and potential prospects is also a lot of fun. So I’m looking very forward to it. Plus I’ve never been to Berlin, so I’m looking forward to that too.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
There you go. And I’ll have a great company in Berlin with you.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:<br>
That’s right, that’s right, that’s right. It is just going to be you and I. And you mentioned the booth earlier. We’re going to be at Booth 40 just for people that are coming by. When you do come by, we’ve got a great demo that we’d love to show you. It really illustrates what makes 1Kosmos different and as a thank you, we’re going to enter you into a draw for a brand new Apple Watch plus we’ve got some pretty cool 1Kosmos socks, so if you need some socks, swing by, we’d love to get you a new pair of socks. And then one of the activities at the EIC, which is short for the European Identity and Cloud conference is the passport. So if you are an attendee and you’ve got your passport, don’t forget to swing by. We’ll stamp that for you as well.</p>
<p>And aside from that on our website Huzefa, I’m pretty sure you’re aware, but for those of you that haven’t seen it, there’s a opportunity there to book a meeting with us ahead of time. So as we know, we get to conferences, calendars fill up. It gets a little bit crazy sometimes so if you want to plan your days a little bit more in advance, you’re more than welcome to go to our website, click on the EIC link, and there’s an option there where you can enter in your information and book a time to meet with either Huzefa or myself or both of us while you’re at the event. So it’s a great way to kind of plan for things ahead of time, or you can do it while you’re at the event as well. So looking forward to seeing everybody there.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:<br>
Absolutely. Looking forward to seeing you next week. Looking forward to seeing our customers, and all the analysts as well.</p>

<p>The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and the last-minute rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS brought the banking industry into the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/03/22/1165274305/the-fed-raises-interest-rates-again-despite-the-stress-hitting-the-banking-syste">global spotlight</a>. The banking sector has been in a state of uncertainty after California regulators closed Silicon Valley Bank in the largest U.S.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-banks-face-scrutiny-fed-rate-decision-looms-2023-03-22/">bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis</a>.&nbsp;The Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-03-17/tabbush-report-founder-reacts-to-recent-bank-turmoil-video">has delivered</a> a small rate hike amid global banking tension.</p>
<p>There are many factors that could cause a bank to fail, including undercapitalization, liquidity, safety and soundness, and fraud. In the case of Silicon Valley Bank, when interest rates started sharply rising last year, and depositors demanded their deposits, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/mar/17/why-silicon-valley-bank-collapsed-svb-fail">the bank was forced to sell</a> U.S. Treasury bonds at a loss. Amid this environment, it is more important than ever for banks to project an image of calm, stability, and transparency to their customers.</p>
<p>Since the invention of instant payment card issuance in the mid-2000s, it has quickly become a top priority for banks and credit unions as it provides convenience and a better experience for customers and members. We saw it become a top priority first through a dramatic increase in the use of instant issuance for getting chipped cards quickly into the hands of cardholders during the transition to EMV, and then through persistent availability of instantly issued cards through the COVID-19 pandemic via drive-up, drive-thru, and self-service terminals.</p>
<p>However, recent macroeconomic impacts in the retail banking sector have heightened consumers’ awareness of who they use as their primary banking institution, making it even more critical for financial institutions to differentiate themselves and prove their commitment to their clients and the broader community.</p>
<p>Instant card issuance allows cardholders to receive their debit or credit card from a local branch or interactive teller machine in minutes – the moment they open their account or are in need of a new card. These instantly issued cards are activated, personalized, and permanent. This quick and easy process can enhance the customer experience and improve customer loyalty, affinity, and likelihood to become a brand ambassador. By offering instant card issuance, banks and credit unions can demonstrate their commitment to their clients by providing a convenient and efficient service that meets their needs. This can help build trust and confidence in the institution, which is particularly important as consumers have more options for banking than ever before.</p>
<p>In addition to demonstrating commitment to cardholders, instant card issuance can also help banks compete with fintech startups and other financial institutions. These players are known for their agility and ability to quickly respond to customer needs, which has driven traditional banking models to leverage a unique differentiator: their physical footprint in the community. Instant card issuance allows financial institutions to offer a similar level of speed and convenience but through an in-person relationship-building event.</p>
<p>As we move through 2023, instant card issuance will become more important than ever before as banks and credit unions are looking to demonstrate their commitment to their community, differentiate themselves in a competitive market, and enhance the customer and member experience.</p>

<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) recently published a working paper on May 8th, 2023, diving into the complex world of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and their potential impact on the economy. The paper, titled “CBDC and business cycle dynamics in a New Monetarist New Keynesian model,” provides a deep-dive into the intricacies of an economy intertwined with CBDCs.</p>



<p>To embark on this exploration, the authors of the study ingeniously integrate a New Monetarist-type decentralized market into a New Keynesian model with financial frictions. This hybrid model, featuring a centralised market (CM) and a decentralised market (DM), helps to simulate the potential impact of an interest-bearing CBDC on the economic landscape.</p>



<p>The centralised market (CM) in the model encapsulates the New Keynesian dynamics, introducing familiar frictions such as monopolistic competition among retail goods producers and Calvo-type sticky prices, which allow for real effects of monetary policy. In addition, the model includes investment adjustment costs for intermediate goods-producing firms and a unique incentive constraint for bankers, leading to frictions in the bank intermediation process.</p>



<p>In contrast, the decentralised market (DM) is a monetary search model, providing a platform for CBDCs and bank deposits to function as a medium of exchange. Here, households receive a preference shock at the beginning of the DM, determining their roles as sellers or buyers, creating a double-coincidence-of-wants problem.</p>



<p>The study shows that the introduction of an interest-bearing CBDC can help stabilize the liquidity premium. This can influence bank funding conditions and the opportunity costs of money, potentially smoothing the reaction of investment and consumption to macroeconomic shocks.</p>



<p>An increase in CBDC supply, which leads to a decrease in the liquidity premium, can boost consumption, output, and inflation. The study underlines the pivotal role of the central bank’s adjustments to the CBDC supply in response to changes in the liquidity premium in shaping the dynamic impact of the CBDC on the economy.</p>



<p>The findings suggest that the existence of a CBDC does not significantly alter the model’s responses to typical macroeconomic shocks. Instead, it tends to dampen and smooth their transmission to core variables such as output and inflation.</p>



<p>By integrating the New Monetarist decentralised transactions with the New Keynesian business cycle dynamics, this research provides a comprehensive framework to evaluate the properties and impacts of CBDCs.</p>



<p>The implications of this study are profound, casting light on how CBDCs could affect monetary policy, financial stability, and the broader role of digital currencies in our economic systems. As central banks worldwide continue to explore the potential of CBDCs, this research presents a crucial step towards understanding the multifaceted effects of these digital currencies.</p>

<p><br><a href="https://northernblock.io/orbit-enterprise/">Orbit Enterprise</a> is a no-code, self-sovereign identity platform that facilitates the orchestration of trust tasks. We’re all very familiar with digital credentialing trust tasks such as issuing a credential or verifying a presentation proof. However, Orbit Enterprise supports other trust tasks, including secure messaging and <a href="https://northernblock.io/feature-showcase-6-aries-credential-issuance-orchestration/">negotiations</a>.</p>
<p>Our recent 0.6.10 Orbit Enterprise release includes a Trust Decision Helper module which allows for an additional trust task called “ask a trust registry” to be used alongside others. Not only do we facilitate the lookup of trust registries when a party is looking to make a trust decision, but we’ve also implemented options that leverage the DNS zone of a party you may be interacting with.</p>
<p>Here is some additional details from the release notes that capture the module being applied towards a holder receiving a credential offer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve enabled Orbit Enterprise users to update their DID Documents with pointers to their domain names. Consequently, when someone resolves an issuer’s DID document, they can extract the issuer’s domain from the document and query the issuer’s DNS for additional information addressing the two concerns mentioned earlier. This integration provides a more comprehensive and reliable way of verifying issuers and their authority.</p>
<p>A holder receiving a credential offer can query the issuer’s DNS records to verify if there’s a match between the DID presented in the DID Document and the DID written in their DNS. Additionally, the holder can query trust registry locations that the issuer directs them to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are interested in better understanding why we’re leveraging DNS in this flow, we recently wrote a <a href="https://northernblock.io/leveraging-dns-in-digital-trust-credential-exchanges-and-trust-registries/">blog post</a> which covers the use case in much more detail.</p>
<p>In this demonstration, we show how an organization being offered a credential can use the issuer’s DNS information, which has been put into their DID document, to validate that the owner of the DID also has ownership of a specific domain name. Additionally, they can use pointers in the domain name system to discover trust registries that could facilitate trust decisions to be made.</p>
  
			
		
<p>We hope you find this demonstration useful and thought-provoking. Please get in touch with us if you’re looking to do any work in the intersection of credential exchange and trust registries. As we continue to work on more trust registry enhancements and features, we would love to collaborate with different community members.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and&nbsp;thank you for joining us. As the years have been passing, I&nbsp;have noticed&nbsp;actually that, digital signatures are becoming more and more common. At a time when we need to sign some agreements, electronically or Internet services. So, let’s take some time today and&nbsp;hear what is going on, what the trends are, in the European Union, but particularly, in&nbsp;Sweden, where today’s guest is coming from.</p>
<p>So, our guest today is Magnus Kardell.&nbsp;He is the product owner of SignPort, a product developed by Knowit, enabling high&nbsp;security, e-identification and e-signatures. He is a specialist in identification and signing&nbsp;services, with a focus on IAM and SSO Federations. Magnus started his career in this field in 2013&nbsp;and has since then gained extensive experience in the public sector, catering to clients&nbsp;with high security standards and needs. With a strong background in the industry, Magnus&nbsp;is dedicated to delivering innovative and secure solutions to his clients through SignPort.</p>
<p>Hello, Magnus.</p>
<p>Magnus Kardell: Yes, hello. Hello, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: Welcome. It’s great having you. We are going to talk about signatures. But&nbsp;let’s get started. Let’s talk about digital identity. First of all, we want to hear about our&nbsp;guest, so we want to hear about you. Tell us a bit about your journey to this world of identity.</p>
<p>Magnus: Thank you. Yeah, Magnus Kardell is my name, and I work at Knowit Secure&nbsp;Solutions, as Oscar mentioned, and I’m product owner for SignPort, which is an&nbsp;identification and signing service. I started roughly 10 years ago with IT security and at the&nbsp;time we were having, and working with, identity and access management. Providing single sign on&nbsp;and federations between different organisations, and soon after that, we were adding&nbsp;also signature services.</p>
<p>In Sweden, there is a technical framework provided by the&nbsp;Swedish agency, DIGG, the agency for digital government. We have always complied to that&nbsp;standard, and that’s where we built our services. It’s mainly targeting public sector, but it’s&nbsp;also good for private sector. And I think in 2016, we made the first signatures, doing it this way&nbsp;and according to this standard. So, we were first with that one. And I’ve been a project manager&nbsp;for establishing about 40 customers in Sweden, in different configurations, and they&nbsp;are mainly government agencies and large municipalities.</p>
<p>So that’s basically my&nbsp;journey and where I got my experience in this.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sounds great. So magnus, what would you&nbsp;say are the main challenges that organisations, we talk about public and private,&nbsp;these organisations’ face, when they ask you for a digital signature solution?</p>
<p>Magnus: When it comes to public sector, you have to consider many things, maybe more than&nbsp;for a private company. For example, to start with, you need to be able to connect to different eID&nbsp;issuers. So, you can’t only have one.</p>
<p>In Sweden, BankID is the most common, but you need to be able&nbsp;to connect to different, both for identification and also signing. And also, there is a request for&nbsp;dividing into what we call private eID issuers where we use your personal number, which is more&nbsp;private. But that can also be as an employee at an organisation. So, you have that kind of&nbsp;– maybe you don’t want to mix your private entity and your employee entity, so you have&nbsp;to consider that. And also, international, so you can also identify yourself and sign with&nbsp;an eID issuer that is from another country. So that’s one of the things.</p>
<p>The most common eID&nbsp;issuer is BankID, of course, but there is also Freja e-ID, Freja org ID, which is for employees&nbsp;more, and foreign e-ID, that is international. So those are examples, but there are more. So, you&nbsp;need to cope with that, and you need to be able to connect to those.</p>
<p>They are also high security&nbsp;when it comes to signatures. It’s level three, which basically means that you need a hardware&nbsp;secure module, where you do the actual signing. So that’s also a bit higher in security than&nbsp;the general need.</p>
<p>A signed document must be self-supporting over time. So, you can’t&nbsp;rely on our service later on, it has to be self-supporting. And the supplier of the signature&nbsp;service must be replaceable. That’s not good for us, but it’s good that we are, because well, all&nbsp;companies, they are not forever. So, it’s, we should be able to replace as a supplier. So&nbsp;that would be in our system cemeteries that our customers that they, that the document itself&nbsp;is self-sustaining. And you have different things, in some cases, the documents to be signed are&nbsp;really sensitive, or the content is delicate, so you need to be able to sign the document&nbsp;without the document itself leaving the customer’s IT environment. But some requirements&nbsp;also on the signature service.</p>
<p>There are also, in some cases, you need a pure e-service, like&nbsp;signing portal. But in some other cases, the customer probably has their own platform&nbsp;that we would like to connect to our, how to say – signing engine. So, we have to provide APIs for&nbsp;our customers’ e-services– sometimes you have a simple signing portal, and in other cases,&nbsp;you let the customers e-platforms connect to our signing service. So, these are things that&nbsp;they need.</p>
<p>And then, of course, going into public sector, there can be really high volumes, when&nbsp;citizens in the country are using the service. It’s demand for high availability, and there is&nbsp;also a demand for high level automation. That means that the signatures need to be – you need to&nbsp;be able to validate the document electronically to the person who has signed it. If you look into&nbsp;the electronic signature of the PDF and read, signed by the supplier of the service, that is&nbsp;a no go, because then you can’t electronically extract what person who has actually signed&nbsp;the document.</p>
<p>So, this also put some specific requirements, and this is about the journey to&nbsp;digitalisation, and we’re not there yet. We may be in the beginning, of course, so far, when we&nbsp;sign a document on, electronically, like a PDF, that’s good. But often, it’s human reading&nbsp;it, at the end, at the other end anyway. So, we have replaced the paper, which is good.&nbsp;It’s much smoother. That’s very good. But still, it isn’t, the flow isn’t really digitalised.&nbsp;And if looking at these challenges that our customers have, they need to be able to do&nbsp;this high level of automation, at least have it further on.</p>
<p>And then, of course, there are&nbsp;requests for sustainable operations. For example, excess heat in the operation centre should be fed&nbsp;back into the district heating network. So, this kind of, you don’t really think of them, but if&nbsp;looking at society, you need to think about those things to be sustainable. Those requirements I&nbsp;mentioned now, or the challenges there were, these organisations have. Of course, they’re mainly for&nbsp;government authorities or municipalities, but, I mean, it could apply also for private companies.&nbsp;It’s not bad, it’s really good things. So that’s about the challenges.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I can see quite many, different types. As you mentioned, some are purely&nbsp;security, some more like usability, what the user is going to face. What else? And the last one,&nbsp;you mentioned actually, the sustainability side. So yeah, different – and some are, yeah,&nbsp;legal. So yeah, different for different fronts, there are these type of requirements for signature&nbsp;services. And when it’s great that our solutions that, yeah, fix all these together and give a&nbsp;great product to, for us, for the users.</p>
<p>So, I would like to hear now, how are you solving&nbsp;some of these challenges? What are the main use cases? Just, if you can illustrate some&nbsp;of those use cases, hot use cases, let’s say?</p>
<p>Magnus: Signature service that we provide,&nbsp;SignPort is following the, I mentioned before, DIGG, the agency for digital government in&nbsp;Sweden they put up a framework for how to solve these issues. But there is also architecture or&nbsp;reference architecture for how to cope with these challenges. So, we follow that. And if looking&nbsp;at our service, it’s split up in four different components, mainly, four different components, and&nbsp;it’s a Signing Portal, Support Service, a Digital Signing Service, and Identification Service.&nbsp;So, these are the four different components.</p>
<p>And the Signing Portal is like a web page that is&nbsp;an e-service, a service provider. The only thing you can do is to just create a signing assignment.&nbsp;Just to, for example, take a PDF document, drag and drop, and then you apply the email address to the&nbsp;signers, and you send it away, and create the sign message, so that’s how it works. It’s a&nbsp;very simple, but useful tool for just keeping the, having a web interface to the users.</p>
<p>Then we have a Support Service. And the support service is basically calculating the hash of the&nbsp;document to be signed, and then the hash is sent further on to the digital signing service.</p>
<p>Digital Signing Service is a bit more – has the highest security, it contains these hardware&nbsp;secure modules, etc. That are creating those signings with the highest security.</p>
<p>And then&nbsp;we have the Identification Service, which is actually different identity providers connecting&nbsp;to each e-ID issuer. And we’re splitting this up, you can facilitate several things, because&nbsp;the signing portal and the support service is – those are the only components that are hit by&nbsp;the document to be signed, and they are done in a way that they can be installed in our customers’ operations.&nbsp;So, by doing it that way, the document to&nbsp;be signed is never leaving our customers’ IT departments. So, they stay at our customer.&nbsp;That is one thing. And by splitting up, so you have an API towards the support service, you also&nbsp;facilitate the possibility that the customer has other e-services that also would like to use an&nbsp;API for signing documents.</p>
<p>Those two parts, the signing portal and support service are rather&nbsp;easy components, that doesn’t contain any hardware or anything like that. So, it’s easy for the&nbsp;customers to install and operate themselves. Some other customers might – doesn’t have&nbsp;that requirement. They want the software as a service solution, and we can provide that&nbsp;as well. So, that’s possible to do it that way.</p>
<p>The Digital Signing Service, containing the&nbsp;hardware secure modules, and everything around that, that we always operate ourselves,&nbsp;but that part is never hit by the documents to be signed. And then we have the&nbsp;Identification Service, which is basically SAML 2.0 IDP connecting to, to different. It can be&nbsp;used as a pure identification service only for logging into it, and e-service, for example,&nbsp;but not in this case, also for signing. So that’s how our service is split up with those&nbsp;four different components, and how we can meet all these requirements that we have from the&nbsp;customer. But it is possible to do it this way.</p>
<p>And for the signing portal, we – it is a rather simple web page, and it has a basic structure, but we can customise it for our customers. So, if a municipality use that, we can customise it for that municipality; so it states the name and everything. So, the user feels that they are in the same. But when connecting to the support service then the – our customers can fully integrate and have everything that is shown to the users and the e-service that the agency provide. So that’s a little bit how it works and how it’s set up.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. Actually, one topic, I think you mentioned a little bit, maybe to&nbsp;understand even better is the self-supporting signed document. Right? So, you said – tell&nbsp;us a bit more about that, how it works.</p>
<p>Magnus: If taking a PDF, for example, the&nbsp;standard we use are PDF advanced electronic signatures. When I say that agency for digital&nbsp;government, the technical framework is based on eIDAS. So, it’s international standards that&nbsp;is based on. And when I say self-sustaining, then I mean that it should be able to validate the&nbsp;document to the person who has signed it, using only the document.</p>
<p>It isn’t really through, but&nbsp;you don’t need SignPort in order to validate it. You just need the public key from our signing&nbsp;service. And that’s the only thing you need, then you can validate the signature to the&nbsp;person who has signed the document. And the public key is – it can be downloaded, it can&nbsp;be stored, so that you have it. But it’s public service, so it’s, once it’s out, it is possible&nbsp;to achieve later on. But if you have that, you can validate the document to the person.</p>
<p>And&nbsp;then you can do, for example, if a government, an agency received a signed document, you&nbsp;can validate it and extract the person, electronically, that has signed a document&nbsp;provided that you rely on our public key. But then you also include the verification list in&nbsp;the document, so you can see that when it was signed, the identity wasn’t revoked. So, it’s sustainable also over time, together with a signed timestamp as well. So, basically, that makes it, self-supporting.</p>
<p>There might be other ways to&nbsp;do this onwards, the standards aren’t really set&nbsp;yet. But this is how we do it, in order to achieve this. Possibilities there are very replaceable,&nbsp;but it’s a good thing, I guess, if looking at.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. You have mentioned also that, a big part of your requirements come from the public service, and you’re following what needs to&nbsp;be comply in Sweden. So, let’s focus on that. So, what are signature service must comply in Sweden?</p>
<p>Magnus: It is for the public sector. In Sweden, the agency for digital government, they have&nbsp;set up a technical framework and a normative specification, and this setup addresses all&nbsp;the requirements that I listed above. So, it’s not a requirement on the public sector in&nbsp;Sweden, but it is the recommendation. And if following it, it will be much easier when,&nbsp;for example, different agencies collaborate and send documents between each other, if the signed&nbsp;documents follow the standard, the same standard. And there is also a requirement to&nbsp;connect to foreign eID, eIDAS.</p>
<p>So, for example, if you – it isn’t that many&nbsp;countries that is connected foreign eID yet. But, for example, if someone from Germany would like&nbsp;to use e-services in Sweden, it’s possible. Also, Denmark and several other countries, and there&nbsp;are more upcoming. So, there is a possibility to use also within Europe, both for identification&nbsp;and signing.</p>
<p>For the private sector, it isn’t – of course, there are requirements that the service&nbsp;has to be easy to use. I think that’s the main thing. But otherwise, there aren’t that,&nbsp;must have requirements as I believe on, when it comes to security or sustainability, and so on that. Maybe companies would like such things, but it isn’t a real requirement. So, you can use more or less whatever signing service you like. And there are many, and that’s OK. So, what we’ve seen in private sector is mainly, we have some customers, but they are mainly connected to either health care or law, when you’re more close to the public sector. So that’s what we’ve seen.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right, perfect. Definitely a good overview&nbsp;how signatures have being applied in Sweden. I would like to ask a final question. So, for all&nbsp;business leaders that are listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that&nbsp;they should write on their agenda today?</p>
<p>Magnus: Yeah. I think if you do not yet&nbsp;have a digital signature service, get one. It’s so much more efficient and sustainable than&nbsp;paper. So, if you don’t have one, get one. And when getting one, think about the future, how is&nbsp;the validity of the signed document proven over time? What happens in collaboration with other&nbsp;parties? And also, what happens when replacing the supplier, what’s next? I think those things you&nbsp;should consider when choosing a signature service.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right, excellent. Excellent, Magnus,&nbsp;for this final recommendation. So please, yeah, let us know if someone would like to follow the&nbsp;conversation with you, or follow the work you’re doing. What are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Magnus: If you want to reach me, I think it’s easiest on an email address, which&nbsp;is magnus.kardell@knowit.sc, M-A-G-N-U-S dot K-A-R-D-E-L-L @knowit.sc. So, you can reach me&nbsp;there. And I believe we’ll set up a home page for SignPort, there is one, but I think we will update it soon.</p>
<p>Oscar: All right, perfect. Again, thank you, Magnus, for this conversation, and all the best.</p>
<p>Magnus: Yeah, thanks a lot.</p>

  <p>Authorization in modern applications is becoming increasingly complex, particularly when it comes to managing access to resources at the individual user and group levels. OAuth has become a widely-used standard for granting access to resources on behalf of a user, but it is not well-suited for these more nuanced use cases. In this talk, we will explore the confusion surrounding the use of OAuth for user and group-focused authorization in applications. We will discuss the standard meaning of authorization in OAuth, which is to grant access for an application to call APIs on behalf of the user, and how misusing OAuth for this purpose can lead to bad architecture and bloated JWT tokens. We will also introduce alternative standards like UMA (User-Managed Access) and GNAP (Group-Based Nested Access Protocol) as potential solutions for user and group-controlled resource delegation. These standards provide a more fine-grained and dynamic approach to access control and can be integrated with policies created by a PBAC (Policy-Based Access Control) server for a more comprehensive solution. Attendees will leave with a better understanding of the limitations of OAuth for user and group-focused authorization, and with a clear understanding of the potential of UMA and GNAP as solutions for these use cases.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/authorization-modern-applications-eic2023"></a>

  <p>Decentralized Identity protection is important in data collaboration because it helps to protect the privacy and security of individuals and organizations involved in the supply chain. By ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive information, identity protection helps to prevent data breaches and other security incidents. &nbsp;A chain of trust establishes a series of checks and verifications that ensure that the data being shared is accurate and trustworthy. This is critical in the context of supply chain regulations, where inaccurate or incomplete information can have serious consequences for compliance and risk management.</p>
<p>In the second part of the talk, we will explore the concept of adaptive protection for identities in Microsoft Purview. By using a combination of machine learning, behavioral analysis, and risk-based decision making, we can create a dynamic system that adapts to new threats in real time. This approach offers a more proactive and effective way to safeguard identities, and can be applied across a range of industries and contexts. Together, we can work to develop a more robust and resilient digital identity ecosystem that protects individuals and organizations alike.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/adaptive-protection-for-identities-eic2023"></a>

  <p>OpenID Connect Federation enables trust establishment at scale and is being deployed to do so in Europe.</p>
<p>A key question when granting access to resources is “Who do you trust?”.&nbsp; It’s often important to know who the party is that you’re interacting with and whether they’ve agreed to the terms and conditions that apply when accessing a resource.</p>
<p>OpenID Connect enables identities of participants to be securely established but doesn’t answer the question of whether a participant is trusted to access a resource such as your personal data.&nbsp; A complementary mechanism is needed to do that.&nbsp; In small-scale and static deployments, it’s possible to keep a list of the trusted participants.&nbsp; However, in large-scale and dynamic deployments, that doesn’t scale.</p>
<p>This presentation will describe how the OpenID Connect Federation protocol enables scalable trust establishment with dynamic policies.&nbsp; It does so by employing trust hierarchies of authorities, each of which are independently administered.&nbsp; Examples of authorities are federation operators, organizations, departments within organizations, and individual sites.</p>
<p>Two OpenID Connect Federations are deployed in Italy, enabling secure access to digital services operated by Italian public and private services with Italian digital identities.&nbsp; This presentation will also describe why OpenID Connect Federation was selected for them and how it meets their needs.&nbsp; OpenID Connect Federation is being used by the GAIN PoC.&nbsp; A public deployment is also being planned in Sweden.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/who-to-trust-eic2023"></a>

Major vendors have implemented the Continuous Access Evaluation Protocol / Profile (CAEP) and analysts, practitioners and decision makers agree that it is critical to the future of zero-trust. This keynote, by the inventor of CAEP, goes into the pain points that led to the development of CAEP, the process to recast it as a part of the Shared Signals working group in the OpenID Foundation and the trends that make it an indispensable component of any zero-trust architecture. CAEP’s non-prescriptive nature makes it easy for anyone to implement their own policies and the Shared Signals Framework makes communicating changes efficient and nearly instantaneous. A future powered by Shared Signals and CAEP enables enterprises and vendors to break information silos to create a highly secure outcome.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/caep-and-shared-signals-eic2023"></a>

  <p>The shift to multi-cloud introduces a wide range of cloud security risks that remain unaddressed due to the siloed approach and limited focus of existing cloud security tools. Most cloud security tools offer highly focused solutions that are limited in scope and capabilities to address the growing spectrum of multi-cloud security risks. The convergence of IAM and multi-cloud security tools (CSPM, CWP and CIEM) offer a cloud security platform that takes an integrated approach to securely manage identities and their access entitlements to cloud resources for cloud-native application development, deployment and operations in the cloud. In this session, we will discuss:</p>
 
 What are the emerging archetypes of IAM and multi-cloud security tools convergence? 
 What are the essential building blocks to effectively address your code-to-cloud security risks in a multi-cloud environment? 
 What are the industry best practices and recommendations to deploy and operationalize multi-cloud security tools for best results?

One of the corner stones of&nbsp;our strategy is identity &amp; access management for millions of users and customers. Over the last 6 years we’ve gone through many iterations of&nbsp;our Identity platform; from a fully managed SaaS platform to our own custom built solution. In this talk we’ll share our journey with you and&nbsp;highlight some of the challenges we’ve faced, how we’ve dealt with them and why we believe our homegrown platform has been the right choice for&nbsp;the company.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ciam-in-media-company-eic2023"></a>

  <p>The claim or desire for authorizations, permissions and the rights set in practice often have a wide divergence. Typically, more rights are assigned unconsciously than were actually required.</p>
<p>The resulting vulnerabilities can have significant consequences therefore, it is essential to be able to monitor the true permissions at any time, regardless of how the permissions have been set. It is almost impossible to manage monitoring manually, even in small environments. Therefore, independent automatisms that can automatically explore, analyze and report the real settings are becoming a requirement.</p>
<p>In this session we will show you how Cygna Labs can support you in these challenging tasks and thereby ensure and improve security in your company.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/entitlements-claim-vs-reality-eic2023"></a>
