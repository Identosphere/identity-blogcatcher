 Verida and zkPass collaborate to bring privacy-preserving data verification to web3 users with Polygon ID zk&nbsp;Proofs Verida and zkPass collaborate to bring privacy-preserving data verification to web3 users with Polygon ID zk&nbsp;Proofs<p>We are thrilled to welcome <a href="https://zkpass.org/">zkPass</a> to the <a href="https://www.verida.network/ecosystem">Verida ecosystem</a>, marking a significant stride towards privacy-preserving data verification in web3. This collaboration harnesses the power of <a href="https://polygon.technology/polygon-id">Polygon ID</a> zero-knowledge proofs and decentralized technology to put users in control of their personal information.</p> Empowering Users Through Decentralized Identity <p>With zkPass and Verida technologies, users are empowered to take the reins of their personal information. Decentralized identity eliminates the need for central authorities to manage and store sensitive data, placing users firmly in the driver’s seat. In addition to enhancing privacy, decentralized identity enables users to decide when and how their information is&nbsp;shared.</p> Enhanced Security with Polygon ID Zero Knowledge Proofs <p>The use of <a href="https://news.verida.io/polygon-id-and-verida-make-zero-knowledge-credentials-accessible-to-all-fc0ac17538c9">Polygon ID zero-knowledge proofs</a> adds an extra layer of security to the verification process. This cryptographic approach allows users to authenticate their information without revealing unnecessary details. It establishes a new standard for security in web3, where privacy and trust are not negotiable but fundamental.</p><blockquote>“We’re delighted to team up with Verida in our shared vision to enhance private data verification. Our technology, designed to offer secure and private authentication through cryptography technologies, complements Verida’s commitment to privacy and decentralization. Together, we aim to redefine user experience in the digital space, where privacy and trust is not a choice but a standard.” <a href="https://twitter.com/zk_Bing">Bing Jiang</a>, Tech Lead of&nbsp;<a href="https://zkpass.org/">zkPass</a>.</blockquote> zkPass and Verida in Action: Real-world Examples <p>zkPass allows individuals to prove and verify some private information about themselves without revealing unnecessary details, across a range of industries</p><p>Here are some examples:</p>  Web Banking: Prove you have over $10,000 in your bank&nbsp;account.  Gaming: Prove you control and own a particular gaming&nbsp;account.  Government: Verify you are a resident of a particular country without revealing personal information,which can help prevent identity theft and protect&nbsp;privacy.  Decentralized Finance: Verify identities and credentials for DeFi applications, ensuring that only authorized parties have access to sensitive financial data.  Job Applications: Verify your qualifications, education, and experience for a job application without revealing personal information.  <p>These verifications are generated directly on the user’s local device. Once a user generates a zkPass proof, it is securely sent to the user’s Verida Wallet, stored on the privacy-preserving Verida Network as a Polygon ID credential. This credential can be leveraged with a zero-knowledge proof, both on and off-chain.</p>Verida Wallet supports zero-knowledge credentials on Polygon&nbsp;ID An Integrated Solution: Building the Future with a Privacy-First Technology Stack <p>This end-to-end solution demonstrates the software architecture of the future. Decentralized identity, private storage, zero knowledge proofs, credentials and blockchain, all working together to provide an incredibly secure and private technology stack.</p><blockquote>“From the outset, Verida has been focused on providing the necessary infrastructure to build a privacy preserving, decentralized technology stack. zkPass’ zero-knowledge proof technology is another example of the innovation happening in this space and we are thrilled to welcome them to the Verida ecosystem.” <a href="https://twitter.com/tahpot">Chris Were</a>, CEO and co-founder of&nbsp;Verida.</blockquote><p>Stay tuned for updates as we further our partnership with zkPass and provide new opportunities for you to be part of the data ownership revolution with <a href="http://missions.verida.network">Verida Missions.</a></p><p>Developer Resources</p>  <a href="http://verida.io">Verida Wallet</a>  <a href="https://developers.verida.network/">Verida Documentation</a>  <a href="https://zkpass.gitbook.io/">zkPass Documentation</a>   About zkPass <p>zkPass is a private data protocol that enables privacy-preserving verification. It primarily employs technologies such as Three-Party TLS (3P-TLS), Multi-party Computation (MPC), and Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP). It allows the conversion of private data from HTTPS websites into zk proofs without needing API authorization. This approach not only safeguards privacy but also protects against data forgery by malicious actors.</p><p><a href="https://zkpass.org">Website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/zkPass">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://medium.com/zkPass">Medium</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/zkpass">Discord</a></p> About Verida <p>The <a href="http://verida.io/">Verida Wallet</a> is a self-custody web3 mobile wallet and a gateway for decentralized identities.

Singapore’s implementation came into effect <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2020/payment-services-act-comes-into-force">on January 28, 2020</a>, whereas the Philippines began enforcing the Travel Rule on <a href="https://www.bsp.gov.ph/Regulations/Issuances/2021/1108.pdf">February 5,&nbsp;2021</a>.</p><p>Germany’s adoption of the Travel Rule <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1auLvlIOx2zJb8i2CSe9lFEStzlC3BP3zvSKhkejF-jo/edit?usp=sharing">dates back to October 1, 2021</a>, followed by Gibraltar’s enforcement, which began on March 22, 2022. Canada joined in <a href="https://fintrac-canafe.canada.ca/guidance-directives/transaction-operation/travel-acheminement/1-eng">on March 31, 2022</a>. <a href="https://www.fma-li.li/files/list/fma-wegleitung-2021-18-travel-rule.pdf">Liechtenstein</a> and <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/api/documentms/download.ashx?id=b682d829-38bc-4827-b48d-022726d75a17">Malaysia</a> joined next, as they both implemented the crypto Travel Rule on April 1,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>South Korea’s implementation date was <a href="https://www.fsc.go.kr/eng/pr010101/75410">March 25, 2022</a>, and both<a href="https://www.cr.gov.hk/en/publications/docs/es32022262516-e.pdf"> Hong Kong</a> and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/japan-to-enforce-crypto-travel-rule-from-june-1st">Japan</a> started enforcing the rule on June 1, 2023. Finally, Estonia began enforcing the Travel Rule <a href="https://www.riigiteataja.ee/en/eli/ee/515042021009/consolide/current">on June 15, 2022</a>, with the United Kingdom implementing it on <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1082704/MLRs_SI_2022_-_Consultation_Response.pdf">September 1,&nbsp;2023</a>.</p> Who Does the FATF Crypto Travel Rule Apply&nbsp;to <p>The FATF Crypto Travel Rule applies to a wide range of entities in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Primarily, it targets virtual asset service providers (VASPs), including cryptocurrency exchanges, digital wallet providers, and other financial services dealing with virtual&nbsp;assets.</p><p>The rule requires these entities to collect and share personal data during transactions. This includes the name, account number, physical address, national identity number, or date and place of birth of both the sender and the recipient for transfers exceeding a certain threshold.</p> What is the FinCEN Travel Rule Crypto; How Does it Affect Cryptocurrency Transactions <p>The “FinCEN Travel Rule Crypto” refers to a regulatory framework originally established by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) for fiat currencies and later extended to include cryptocurrencies.</p><p>Targeting virtual asset service providers (VASPs) like cryptocurrency exchanges, digital wallet providers, and other financial services dealing with virtual assets, the FinCEN Travel Rule Crypto requires these entities to collect and share key personal data during transactions. This data includes the sender and receiver’s names, account numbers, physical addresses, national identity numbers, or their dates and places of birth for transactions that exceed&nbsp;$3000.</p><p>This adaptation of the rule to cryptocurrencies aims to enhance transparency in digital currency transactions and combat money laundering and terrorism financing. It aligns the regulatory requirements of the rapidly evolving world of cryptocurrencies with those of traditional banking, posing new challenges and compliance requirements for businesses in the virtual currency&nbsp;space.</p> What Challenges Do VASPs Face During Travel Rule Compliance <p>VASPs (Virtual Asset Service Providers) face several challenges during Travel Rule compliance, including data privacy concerns, varying international regulations, technology integration issues, and the risk of non-compliance penalties.</p><p>Data Privacy Concerns: Ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive customer data while complying with the Travel Rule is a significant challenge. VASPs need to strike a balance between adhering to regulatory requirements and protecting client information against unauthorized access and data breaches.</p><p>Varying International Regulations: The Travel Rule requirements vary across different jurisdictions, making it difficult for VASPs to develop a uniform compliance strategy. This lack of standardization requires VASPs to adapt their compliance processes according to the regulations of each country they operate&nbsp;in.</p><p>Furthermore, since many countries have not yet enforced the Travel Rule, VASPs operating in jurisdictions where the rule is implemented face challenges when dealing with transactions from countries that are non-compliant. This is known as the Sunrise&nbsp;issue.</p><p>Technology Integration Issues: Implementing the necessary technology to comply with the Travel Rule often involves significant investment and integration challenges. VASPs need to upgrade their systems to handle additional data requirements and ensure interoperability with other service providers.</p><p>Risk of Non-Compliance Penalties: Failure to comply with the Travel Rule can lead to hefty fines and legal penalties. This risk puts pressure on VASPs to ensure strict adherence to regulatory requirements, which can be resource-intensive and&nbsp;costly.</p><p>Veriscope effectively addresses these challenges. Its decentralized framework enhances data integrity and reduces risks, while the absence of centralized PII storage boosts data security.</p><p>An open-source platform, Veriscope fosters transparency and continual improvement. Key features like automatic counterparty VASP discovery, secure P2P PII transmission, and robust due diligence streamline the compliance process.</p><p>Additionally, its pay-as-you-go model, interoperability with various platforms, and unique features like historic transaction lookback and user signing for wallets, position Veriscope as a versatile and comprehensive solution for Travel Rule compliance.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>As we conclude the third part of our series on the FATF Travel Rule, we have navigated through the essential aspects of its global implementation, targeted entities, and the profound impact on cryptocurrency transactions. This analysis has also shed light on the multifaceted challenges VASPs encounter in complying with these regulations.</p><p>Our journey through these complexities underscores the importance of continual adaptation and informed compliance within the evolving crypto landscape, ensuring that stakeholders in the cryptocurrency domain remain aligned with international regulatory standards.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

			 Gonzalo García Arahuetes is a Back-End Developer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself! 
<p>My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gonzalo-garcia-arahuetes/">Gonzalo García Arahuetes</a>, and I was born in Segovia, Spain. I work as a Back-end Developer at Tokeny, although it would have been crazy for me to think of such a job some years ago, since my initial formation had nothing to do with computers. I started Law and Business Administration studies in Madrid but soon changed it for Humanities and moved to Barcelona for my master’s degree. Although I did a lot of research on Literature and Philosophy, I eventually started some courses on Digital Humanities, focused on database maintenance and data management, and this is how I became more and more curious about technology and its ethical and political implications. With that in mind, I started another master’s degree in Web Development and began to study the consequences of blockchain for economies and individuals.</p>
<p>I love keeping those two paths alive, as I regard them as complementary. While my professional career is devoted to web development and tech-related issues, I am still working on a Ph.D. thesis on Peter Sloterdijk’s early work, and I dedicate a great deal of my free time to books, writing, and research.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>I was working for a small start-up as a Full-Stack developer. One day, I saw a job offer from Tokeny for senior developers. I applied, specifying that I was not a senior at all but that I had plenty of curiosity for the blockchain world and was eager for an opportunity like this. Of course, I expected no response, but Luc himself, the CEO, replied! We had a very pleasant meeting, and he told me that all he wanted were ‘smart and motivated people.’ The process took some time because Tokeny was opening its Spanish office in Barcelona, but joining this team was the perfect decision for me.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Luc wanted a team of ‘smart and motivated people,’ and I think that is what he got! Working at Tokeny means sharing time and goals with some of the most fun, skilled, and professional people I have met. On top of that, it is a company committed to remote work, which makes life so much easier for all of us in terms of schedule and location. In a few words, I would say that Tokeny always considers the workers’ necessities in the first place.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life?  
<p>My family is at the top: my wife Yaos and my little Lila, who was born in June. Other than that, I am very passionate about many things: books, films, my guitars, my friends, cooking, sports… In this regard, being passionate about something reveals its ambiguity (for the word ‘passion’ has a very ancient origin, always related to suffering): I love all these things, but often, it is demanding to keep up with them and not end up frustrated or exhausted.</p>
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>I am rather cautious when it comes to making long-term plans for my life, not to mention having big dreams about changing the world. I always remember Walt Whitman’s beautiful verses: “The Earth, that is sufficient, I do not want the constellations any nearer, I know they are very well where they are, I know they suffice for those who belong to them.” In my opinion, being focused on big dreams and aims keeps us from noticing that sometimes we are just carried away. Knowing that the tide is dragging you may or may not make a better swimmer out of you, but at least you will take it easy and stop worrying about reaching a certain place.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>My personal view is that we are on the verge of mass adoption for blockchain technology. Given that scenario, being part of a company so involved in the transformation of the entire financial industry is a thrilling and adventurous experience. There is so much yet to learn and to witness!</p>

This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p><p>DF64 is live today, Nov 23. It concludes on Nov 30. 150K OCEAN and 100k ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF64  Section 5: Challenge DF Wind-down   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has three substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and earn.<br>– Challenge DF. Accurately predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are four ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), Challenge DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> Ocean docs</a> has details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash bad Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. <br>– Challenge DF substream. To earn: make ETH predictions for specific times; the next section gives an overview of how. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/blob/main/challenges/challenge-df.md"> Challenge DF README</a> has detailed instructions.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF64 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% except what Challenge DF gets = 37,000 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% except what Challenge DF gets = 37,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.

<p><br>
Northern Block Product Update: Supporting Mote Credential Exchange Protocols and Credential Formats<br><br></p>
 
<p>We’re excited to announce that Northern Block products now support two credential exchange protocols – DIDComm/Aries-based protocol implementations and the newly added OpenID4VC. Additionally, we’ve expanded our support to three credential formats: AnonCreds, JWT, and JSON-LD.</p>
<p>As staunch advocates for open agent technology, which is crucial for digital wallets and achieving digital trust, we’ve consistently integrated DIDComm and various Aries-based implementations (such as ACA-Py, AFJ) into our products. The recent focus on the European Union’s Architectural Reference Framework (ARF) has highlighted the importance of the Open ID for verifiable credential specifications. We’ve embraced these specifications in response to feedback from issuers who appreciate the protocol’s simplicity and the widespread availability of OpenID/oAuth resources, making the issuance of verifiable credentials more streamlined.</p>
<p>Our aim is to provide our customers with the flexibility to receive and store their preferred credential format via any protocol. We also strive to enable verifiers to accept a diverse range of credentials and protocols available in the market. Looking ahead, we plan to support the mobile driving license (mDL) standard.</p>
<p>Here’s what we now offer:</p>
 
 
 For Issuers: Our platform now allows issuers to use either DIDComm/Aries or our OpenID4VCI issuer to issue an AnonCred, JWT, or JSON-LD credentials. (Note: our issuance service allows users to issue AnonCreds and JSON-LD through DIDComm, and JSON-LD and JWT through OpenID4VCI) 
 For Holders: Customers using our wallet or wallet SDK can now receive and store in any of the three formats over DIDComm/Aries or OpenID4VC implementations. 
 For Verifiers: Our verifier customers can now consume credentials in their preferred combination of formats and protocols. (Note: our verifier toolkit allows for presentations of AnonCreds and JSON-LD over DIDComm, and JSON-LD and JWT over OpenID4VP) 
 
 
<p>We’re excited to see how these enhancements will empower our users and pave the way for more innovative uses of digital credentials.</p>
<p>Here’s a short video showcasing how our Orbit Edge Mobile Wallet can now receive credentials from various protocols:<br><br></p>

   Application modernization is the process of updating legacy applications leveraging modern technologies. Learn more in this post.

<p>Application modernization is the process of updating legacy applications leveraging modern technologies, enhancing performance and making it adaptable to evolving business speeds by infusing cloud native principles like DevOps, Infrastructure-as-code (IAC) and so on. Application modernization starts with assessment of current legacy applications, data and infrastructure and applying the right modernization strategy (rehost, re-platform, refactor or rebuild) to achieve the desired result. </p>



<p>While rebuild results in maximum benefit, there is a need for high degree of investment, whereas rehost is about moving applications and data as such to cloud without any optimization and this requires less investments while value is low. Modernized applications are deployed, monitored and maintained, with ongoing iterations to keep pace with technology and business advancements. Typical benefits realized would range from increased agility, cost-effectiveness and competitiveness, while challenges include complexity and resource demands. Many enterprises are realizing that moving to cloud is not giving them the desired value nor agility/speed beyond basic platform-level automation. The real problem lies in how the IT is organized, which reflects in how their current applications/services are built and managed (refer to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">Conway’s law</a>). This, in turn, leads to the following challenges:</p>



 
 Duplicative or overlapping capabilities offered by multiple IT systems/components create sticky dependencies and proliferations, which impact productivity and speed to market. 



 Duplicative capabilities across applications and channels give rise to duplicative IT resources (e.g., skills and infrastructure) 



 Duplicative capabilities (including data) resulting in duplication of business rules and the like&nbsp;give rise to inconsistent customer experience. 



 Lack of alignment of IT capabilities to business capabilities impacts time to market and business-IT. In addition, enterprises end up building several band-aids and architectural layers to support new business initiatives and innovations. 
 



<p>Hence, application modernization initiatives need to be focusing more on the value to business and this involves significant element of transformation of the applications to business capabilities aligned components and services. The biggest challenge with this is the amount of investment needed and many CIOs/CTOs are hesitant to invest due to the cost and timelines involved in realizing value. Many are addressing this via building accelerators that could be customized for enterprise consumption that helps accelerate specific areas of modernization and one such example from IBM is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/cloud-accelerator">IBM Consulting Cloud Accelerators</a>. While attempting to drive acceleration and optimize cost of modernization, Generative AI is becoming a critical enabler to drive change in how we accelerate modernization programs. We will explore key areas of acceleration with an example in this article.</p>



<p>A simplified lifecycle of application modernization programs (not meant to be exhaustive) is depicted below. Discovery focuses on understanding legacy application, infrastructure, data, interaction between applications, services and data and other aspects like security. Planning breaks down the complex portfolio of applications into iterations to be modernized to establish an iterative roadmap—and establishing an execution plan to implement the roadmap.</p>







<p>Blueprint/Design phase activities change based on the modernization strategy (from decomposing application and leveraging domain-driven design or establish target architecture based on new technology to build executable designs). Subsequent phases are build and test and deploy to production. Let us explore the Generative AI possibilities across these lifecycle areas.</p>



 Discovery and design:  



<p>The ability to understand legacy applications with minimal SME involvement is a critical acceleration point. This is because, in general, SMEs are busy with systems lights-on initiatives, while their knowledge could be limited based on how long they have been supporting the systems. Collectively, discovery and design is where significant time is spent during modernization, whereas development is much easier once the team has decoded the legacy application functionality, integration aspects, logic and data complexity.</p>



<p>Modernization teams perform their code analysis and go through several documents (mostly dated); this is where their reliance on code analysis tools becomes important. Further, for re-write initiatives, one needs to map functional capabilities to legacy application context so as to perform effective domain-driven design/decomposition exercises. Generative AI becomes very handy here through its ability to correlate domain/functional capabilities to code and data and establish business capabilities view and connected application code and data—of course the models need to be tuned/contextualized for a given enterprise domain model or functional capability map. Generative AI-assisted API mapping called out in this paper is a mini exemplar of this. While the above is for application decomposition/design, event-storming needs process maps and this is where Generative AI assists in contextualizing and mapping extracts from process mining tools. Generative AI also helps generate use cases based on code insights and functional mapping. Overall, Generative AI helps de-risk modernization programs via ensuring adequate visibility to legacy applications as well as dependencies.</p>



<p>Generative AI also helps generate target design for specific cloud service provider framework through tuning the models based on a set of standardized patterns (ingress/egress, application services, data services, composite patterns, etc.). Likewise, there are several other Generative AI use cases that include generating of target technology framework-specific code patterns for security controls. Generative AI helps to generate detail design specifications, for example, user stories, User Experience Wire Frames, API Specifications (e.g., Swagger files), component relationship diagram and component interaction diagrams.</p>



 Planning:  



<p>One of the difficult tasks of a modernization program is to be able to establish a macro roadmap while balancing parallel efforts versus sequential dependencies and identifying co-existence scenarios to be addressed. While this is normally done as a one-time task—continuous realignment through Program Increments (PIs)—planning exercises incorporating execution level inputs is far more difficult. Generative AI comes in handy to be able to generate roadmaps based on historical data (applications to domain area maps, effort and complexity factors and dependency patterns, etc.), applying this to applications in the scope of a modernization program—for a given industry or domain.</p>



<p>The only way to address this is to make it consumable via a suite of assets and accelerators that can address enterprise complexity. This is where Generative AI plays a significant role in correlating application portfolio details with discovered dependencies.</p>



 Build and test:  



<p>Generating code is one of the most widest known Generative AI use case, but it is important to be able to generate a set of related code artifacts ranging from IAC (Terraform or Cloud Formation Template), pipeline code/configurations, embed security design points (encryption, IAM integrations, etc.), application code generation from swaggers or other code insights (from legacy) and firewall configurations (as resource files based on services instantiated, etc.).&nbsp;Generative AI helps generate each of the above through an orchestrated approach based on predefined application reference architectures built from patterns—while combining outputs of design tools.</p>



<p>Testing is another key area; Generative AI can generate the right set of test cases and test code along with test data so as to optimize the test cases being executed.</p>



 Deploy:  



<p>There are several last mile activities that typically takes days to weeks based on enterprise complexity. The ability to generate insights for security validation (from application and platform logs, design points, IAC, etc.) is a key use case that will help assist accelerated security review and approval cycles. Generating configuration management inputs (for CMDB)and changing management inputs based on release notes generated from Agility tool work items completed per release are key Generative AI leverage areas.</p>



<p>While the above-mentioned use cases across modernization phases appear to be a silver bullet, enterprise complexities will necessitate contextual orchestration of many of the above Generative AI use cases-based accelerators to be able to realize value and we are far from establishing enterprise contextual patterns that help accelerate modernization programs. We have seen significant benefits in investing time and energy upfront (and ongoing) in customizing many of these Generative AI accelerators for certain patterns based on potential repeatability.</p>



<p>Let us now examine a potential proven example:</p>



 Example 1: Re-imagining API Discovery with BIAN and AI for visibility of domain mapping and identification of duplicative API services 



<p>The Problem: Large Global Bank has more than 30000 APIs (both internal and external) developed over time across various domains (e.g., retail banking, wholesale banking, open banking and corporate banking). There is huge potential of duplicate APIs existing across the domains, leading to higher total cost of ownership for maintaining the large API portfolio and operational challenges of dealing with API duplication and overlap. A lack of visibility and discovery of the APIs leads API Development teams to develop the same or similar APIs rather than find relevant APIs for reuse. The inability to visualize the API portfolio from a Banking Industry Model perspective constrains the Business and IT teams to understand the capabilities that are already available and what new capabilities are needed for the bank.</p>



<p>Generative AI-based solution approach: The solution leverages BERT Large Language Model, Sentence Transformer, Multiple Negatives Ranking Loss Function and domain rules, fine-tuned with BIAN Service Landscape knowledge to learn the bank’s API portfolio and provide ability to discover APIs with auto-mapping to BIAN. It maps API Endpoint Method to level 4 BIAN Service Landscape Hierarchy, that is, BIAN Service Operations.</p>



<p>The core functions of solution are the ability to:</p>



 
 Ingest swagger specifications and other API documentations and understand the API, end points, the operations and the associated descriptions. 



 Ingest BIAN details and understand BIAN Service Landscape. 



 Fine-tune with matched and unmatched mapping between API Endpoint Method and BIAN Service Landscape. 



 Provide a visual representation of the mapping and matching score with BIAN Hierarchical navigation and filters for BIAN levels, API Category and matching score. 
 



<p>Overall logical view (Open Stack based) is as below:</p>







<p>User Interface for API Discovery with Industry Model:</p>







<p>Key Benefits: The solution helped developers to easily find re-usable APIs, based on BIAN business domains; they had multiple filter/search options to locate APIs. In addition, teams were able to identify key API categories for building right operational resilience. Next revision of search would be based on natural language and will be a conversational use case.</p>



<p>The ability to identify duplicative APIs based on BIAN service domains helped establish a modernization strategy that addresses duplicative capabilities while rationalizing them.</p>



<p>This use case was realized within 6–8 weeks, whereas the bank would have taken a year to achieve the same result (as there were several thousands of APIs to be discovered).</p>



 Example 2: Automated modernization of MuleSoft API to Java Spring Boot API 



<p>The Problem: While the current teams were on a journey to modernize MuleSoft APIs to Java Spring boot, sheer volume of APIs, lack of documentation and the complexity aspects were impacting the speed.</p>



<p>Generative AI-based Solution Approach: The Mule API to Java Spring boot modernization was significantly automated via a Generative AI-based accelerator we built. We began by establishing deep understanding of APIs, components and API logic followed by finalizing response structures and code. This was followed by building prompts using IBM’s version of Sidekick AI to generate Spring boot code, which satisfies the API specs from MuleSoft, unit test cases, design document and user interface.</p>



<p>Mule API components were provided into the tool one by one using prompts and generated corresponding Spring boot equivalent, which was subsequently wired together addressing errors that propped up. The accelerator generated UI for desired channel that could be integrated to the APIs, unit test cases and test data and design documentation. A design documentation that gets generated consists of sequence and class diagram, request, response, end point details, error codes and architecture considerations.</p>



<p>Key Benefits: Sidekick AI augments Application Consultants’ daily work by pairing multi-model Generative AI technical strategy contextualized through deep domain knowledge and technology. The key benefits are as follows:</p>



 
 Generates most of the Spring Boot code and test cases that are optimized, clean and adheres to best practices—key is repeatability. 



 Ease of integration of APIs with channel front-end layers. 



 Ease of understanding of code of developer and enough insights in debugging the code. 
 



<p>The Accelerator PoC was completed with 4 different scenarios of code migration, unit test cases, design documentation and UI generation in 3 sprints over 6 weeks.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Many CIOs/CTOs have had their own reservations in embarking on modernization initiatives due to a multitude of challenges called out at the beginning—amount of SME time needed, impact to business due to change, operating model change across security, change management and many other organizations and so on. While Generative AI is not a silver bullet to solve all of the problems, it helps the program through acceleration, reduction in cost of modernization and, more significantly, de-risking through ensuring no current functionality is missed out. However, one needs to understand that it takes time and effort to bring LLM Models and libraries to enterprise environment needs-significant security and compliance reviews and scanning. It also requires some focused effort to improve the data quality of data needed for tuning the models. While cohesive Generative AI-driven modernization accelerators are not yet out there, with time we will start seeing emergence of such integrated toolkits that help accelerate certain modernization patterns if not many.</p>

<p>IBM® Maximo® has been a leading enterprise asset management solution in the industry for four decades, helping customers streamline work processes with a centralized platform for managing tasks, inventory, regulatory compliance and reporting capabilities. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo">IBM Maximo Application Suite</a> (MAS), the next generation of IBM Maximo, delivers a better user experience, faster integration, robust AI analytics, and a broad range of cloud deployment options. MAS provides organizations with a robust and modern asset management solution.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift">Red&nbsp;Hat® OpenShift®</a>, the industry’s leading hybrid cloud application platform powered by Kubernetes, brings together tested and trusted services to reduce the friction of developing, modernizing, deploying, running and managing applications. OpenShift delivers a consistent experience across public cloud, on premises, hybrid cloud or edge architecture.</p>



<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-azure/">Azure</a> is Microsoft’s public cloud platform. Azure offers a large collection of services, which includes platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and managed database service capabilities.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/openshift">Microsoft Azure Red Hat® OpenShift®</a> (ARO) provides highly available, fully managed OpenShift clusters on demand, monitored and operated jointly by Microsoft and Red Hat. OpenShift brings added-value features to complement Kubernetes, making it a turnkey container PaaS with a significantly improved developer and operator experience.</p>



<p>Maximo customers will be required to move to MAS when <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6570953">Maximo 7.x reaches end of life</a>. MAS has been containerized to run specifically on <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift/container-platform">Red Hat OpenShift</a>. To ease this transition for customers who are unfamiliar with running containers in production, IBM, Microsoft and Red Hat have teamed up to provide a validated architecture for running MAS on Azure Red Hat OpenShift.</p>



<p>This blog will walk through the recommended options for running MAS on Azure and describe how the IBM, Red Hat and Microsoft Azure components come together and provide a solid foundation for running MAS. We will also explore the architectural decisions to consider, so you can choose the one that best fits your organization’s needs.</p>



<p>For each option below, there are two components to keep in mind: the MAS application and the platform MAS runs on (Red Hat OpenShift or Microsoft Azure Red Hat OpenShift).<br><br>Option 1 provides a scripted install process for the MAS application and the underlying OpenShift Container Platform (OCP). This process makes the overall installation process simpler. However, the ability to customize the MAS installation is limited since it is script-based. Additionally, because the underlying platform is a self-managed OCP, the customer has complete control over the infrastructure in exchange for monitoring and maintaining that OCP cluster.</p>



<p>Option 2a requires the customer to install MAS themselves but allows for greater customization of MAS during the installation process. This option also provides complete control over the underlying OCP but requires the customer to install, monitor and maintain OCP.</p>



<p>Option 2b requires the customer to install MAS themselves but allows for greater customization of MAS during the installation process. In this option, the underlying platform is Microsoft ARO, a managed version of OCP offered by Microsoft. The installation of ARO is scripted, and Red Hat site reliability engineers (SREs) are responsible for monitoring and maintaining the OCP cluster. However, because Red Hat SREs manage the cluster, customers will have less control over the platform infrastructure than in options 1 and 2a.</p>

 Option 1: MAS on self-managed Red Hat OpenShift through Marketplace 



<p>This deployment option involves setting up MAS on an OpenShift cluster, which runs on the Azure platform. Azure Marketplace serves as the conduit through which this deployment is made possible.</p>



<p>One of the primary advantages of choosing this deployment option is the ease of deployment. Azure Marketplace simplifies the process by providing pre-configured templates and scripts that are deployed on the customer’s behalf. One can use this pattern to set up MAS quickly and efficiently, reducing software deployment complexity.</p>



<p>You can deploy a new cluster, use an existing one or deploy a new one into an existing network. However, you must provide the expected database and email configurations before the deployment. This flexibility enables organizations to optimize their infrastructure and adapt to changing needs. The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/mas-cd/continuous-delivery?topic=o-installation-topology">Azure Marketplace pattern</a> simplifies the deployment process, allowing businesses to focus on using MAS to enhance their asset management practices quickly.</p>



<p>It’s essential to carefully consider resource allocation, data security, integration and support to enable a successful deployment and maximize the benefits of MAS. With the right planning and execution, organizations can unlock the full potential of MAS in their asset management journey through Azure Marketplace with minimal effort.</p>



Figure 2: MAS installation option 1



 Option 2a: MAS on self-managed Red Hat OpenShift through “do it yourself” option 



<p>Deploying MAS on a self-installed OpenShift cluster on Microsoft Azure through the “do it yourself” option means you have complete control over the installation process. Unlike other deployment methods, where the environment is pre-configured, this approach empowers you to customize your MAS deployment to align with your specific requirements.</p>



<p>One of the primary advantages of choosing the “do it yourself” option is its unparalleled level of control. You can tailor the deployment to your unique needs, ensuring every component is configured to optimize the asset management processes.</p>



<p>With this option, you can select your preferred installer from various options, including installer provisioned infrastructure, user provisioned infrastructure and even an airgap configuration. This flexibility allows you to use your existing expertise or choose the installer that aligns best with your infrastructure and security requirements.</p>



<p>However, it’s essential to recognize this option’s need for skilled resources, the potential complexity of the deployment process and the ongoing support and maintenance responsibilities. With the right expertise and a well-thought-out plan, the “do it yourself” option can be a powerful choice for organizations looking to maximize the potential of MAS in their asset management journey.</p>



Figure 3: MAS installation option 2a



 Option 2b: MAS deployment on Azure Red Hat OpenShift managed by Microsoft Azure 



<p>MAS is deployed on ARO in this option. This strategic combination offers a range of advantages for businesses looking to streamline their processes. This option provides a middle ground between the previous two options.</p>



<p>MAS on ARO is straightforward to set up and will require less effort than the “do it yourself” approach while giving you similar levels of control over OpenShift and MAS. It is mainly for those who prefer not to manage OpenShift themselves, but who still want control over the hosting platform. However, as you’ll be interfacing with OpenShift directly, you will still need team members skilled in OpenShift to make this option work. While this option requires less work from an ongoing management perspective, as OpenShift management is taken care of, it will take additional upfront work because you will be deploying MAS by yourself.</p>



<p>The advantages of MAS deployment on ARO are multifaceted. First, it lowers the entry barrier and requires a smaller OpenShift/Kubernetes resources skill set on day one to get started. Most importantly, you no longer need to spend time and effort setting up OpenShift and applying subsequent updates.</p>



<p>Second, it provides a managed experience through a PaaS offering supported by Microsoft and RedHat. It provides distinct benefits for those prioritizing rapid access to support services. It simplifies the overall experience of managing the health and updates of OpenShift, as Microsoft is responsible for that.</p>



<p>Each MAS on Azure deployment option has its advantages and limitations. You should review these factors to align their deployment with your business needs and requirements.</p>



<p>You should assess their infrastructure, customization and cost considerations to make an informed decision that ensures a successful and efficient MAS deployment. By understanding the strengths and limitations of each option, customers can choose the deployment option that meets their business objectives.</p>

<p>Cloud optimization is essential as organizations look to accelerate business outcomes and unlock the value of their data.&nbsp;At its core, cloud optimization is the process of correctly selecting and assigning the right resources to a workload or application. But cloud optimization is also a lifecycle process that balances performance, compliance and cost to achieve efficiency. And getting it right is crucial. Gartner predicts that enterprise IT spending on public cloud will exceed 51% by 2025, while Flexera’s State of the Cloud Report in 2023 highlighted that managing cloud spend overtook security as a top challenge facing all organizations for the first time.</p>



<p>Research shows that that 90% of enterprises have a multi-cloud strategy and 80% have a hybrid cloud strategy—a combination of public and private clouds. Only 7% of enterprises are using a single public cloud provider.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s easy to see the complexity of the cloud optimization problem given the use of multi cloud. Many organizations have elected to deploy Cloud Centers of Excellence or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ibm-consulting-accelerates-the-future-of-finops-collaboration-with-apptio/">FinOps</a> practices with the goal of optimizing cloud spend. But building out a FinOps practice or Cloud Center of Excellence is easier said than done. It takes time and talent. Sometimes organizations are short on both. Cloud optimization goes well beyond simple cost reduction and workload placement and is more about making sure your costs align with your business goals.</p>



<p>Remember the TV game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&nbsp;There was a feature on the show called “Phone a Friend.”&nbsp;On the show, the contestant was connected with a friend over a phone line and was given 30 seconds to read the question and answers and solicit assistance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, the contestant wants to call the RIGHT friend—the one that can help them with the correct answer and lead them to the money.</p>



<p>As it relates to cloud optimization, workload placement and app modernization, it feels like enterprises need a Phone a Friend feature. But they need to call the RIGHT friend too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why should you phone a friend?&nbsp;Because you need help to answer the IT question and the clock is ticking.&nbsp;If an enterprise calls the wrong friend, they lose the chance to modernization their apps on time, optimize their costs and digitally transform. In short, by calling the WRONG friend, they lose the game.</p>



<p>Enterprises aren’t just looking for tools that manage resources and costs in multicloud and hybrid cloud environments. Tools are great but you need the right tools in the right order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, organizations need help to build out a roadmap or implement the roadmap especially as they are looking to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/legacy-application-modernization/">modernize legacy virtual environments</a>.&nbsp;They want AI powered automation capabilities that span from AIOps to application and infrastructure observability.</p>



<p>They need to win the game. They need the right friend with the right answers to help them win.</p>



<p>There is a strong synergy between digital transformation and IT modernization and it’s a long game.&nbsp;While transformation sets the vision and strategic direction of the organization, IT modernization is the practical implementation of that vision.&nbsp;These initiatives reshape and transform organizations.&nbsp;By embracing new technologies, organizations improve efficiency, enhance customer experience and remain competitive.</p>



<p>No matter where an organization is on this journey, phoning the “Right Friend” can move them along the game board from siloed systems to integrated platforms, from on-premises infrastructure to cloud computing and providing the answers around the move from monolithic applications to microservices. A solid strategy involves knowing which friend to call for guidance to help drive business growth and innovation.</p>

<p>Black Friday—and really, the entire Cyber Week—is a time when you want your applications running at peak performance without completely exhausting your operations teams.</p>



<p>Observability solutions can help you achieve this goal, whether you’re a small team with a single product or a large team operating complex ecommerce applications. But not all observability solutions (or tools) are alike, and if you are missing just one key capability, it could cause customer satisfaction issues, slower sales and even top- and bottom-line revenue catastrophes.</p>



<p>The observability market is full of vendors, with different descriptions, features and support capabilities. This can make it difficult to distinguish what’s critical from what is just nice to have in your observability solution.</p>



<p>Here’s a handy checklist to help you find and implement the best possible observability platform to keep all your applications running merry and bright:</p>



 
 Complete automation. You need automatic capture to achieve a comprehensive real-time view of your application. A full-stack tool that can automatically observe your environment will minimize mean time to detection (MTTD) and prevent potential outages. 
 



 
 High-fidelity data. The most powerful use of data is the ability to contextualize. Without context, your team has no idea how big or small your problem is. Contextualizing telemetry data by visualizing the relevant information or metadata enables teams to better understand and interpret the data. This combination of accuracy and context helps teams make more informed decisions and pinpoint the root causes of issues. 
 



 
 Real-time change detection. Monitoring your entire stack with a single platform (from mainframes to mobile) can contribute to your growth. How? You can now see how transactions are zipping around across the internet, keeping the wheels of your commerce well lubricated. Another advantage of real-time detection is the visibility you gain when you connect your application components with your underlying infrastructure. This is important to your IT team’s success, as they now have the visibility of your stack and services and can map them to your dependency. 
 



 
 Mobile and website digital experience management. End-user, mobile, website and synthetic monitoring all enable you to improve the end-user experience. You should use an observability tool with real-user monitoring to deliver an exceptional experience for users and accommodate growth. This allows you to track real users’ interactions with your applications, while end-user monitoring captures performance data from the user’s perspective. Synthetic monitoring creates simulated user interactions to proactively identify potential issues, ensuring your applications meet user expectations and performance standards. All three capabilities combined can: provide real-time insights into server performance and website load times; capture user interactions and provide detailed insights into user behaviour; and monitor server loads and traffic distribution. This can automatically adjust load balancing configurations to distribute traffic evenly, preventing server overloads and ensuring a smooth shopping experience. 
 



 
 Built-in AI and machine learning. Having AI-assisted root cause analysis in your observability platform is crucial if you want to diagnose the root causes of issues or anomalies within a system or application automatically. This capability is particularly valuable in complex and dynamic environments where manual analysis might be time consuming and less efficient. 
 



 
 Visibility deep and wide. The true advantage of full stack lies in connecting your application components with the underlying infrastructure. This is critical for IT success because it grants visibility into your stack and services and maps them to dependencies. 
 



 
 Ease of use. An automated and user-friendly installation procedure minimizes the complexity of deployment. 
 



 
 Broad platform support. This monitors popular cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, MS Azure, IBM Cloud®) for both Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service with simplified installation. 
 



 
 Continuous production profiling. Profiles code issues when they occur for various programming languages, offering visibility into code-based performance hot spots and bottlenecks. 
 



<p>In a market with detection gaps, 10 seconds is too long. Let this checklist guide you as you build a real-time full-stack observability solution that keeps your business running smoothly for the entire holiday season.</p>

				  Indicio’s Digital Travel Credential streamlines identity verification at border crossing points for a faster and more secure journey.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Heather Dahl</p>
<p>Never would I have thought I’d use the word ‘beautiful’ to describe my experience passing through immigration when traveling internationally, but that’s exactly how it felt last week in Aruba. The reason? <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aruba-makes-steady-progress-in-launching-new-digital-travel-credential-301989815.html">Aruba’s Happy One Pass (AHOP).</a> I was able to walk through border control without having to take my passport out of my pocket. It was so quick and smooth that I didn’t realize it happened.</p>
<p>With this system, you can actually go from the airplane to the beach in just 30 minutes, completely transforming the typical airport and arrival experience. And lucky travelers to Aruba will begin using the same technology to enter and depart the island nation in March 2024. This is not a federated system that sends information to other third parties and is held by others. Travelers hold their digital passport data just like they hold their physical passports — and there is full consent for data sharing at each step of the process.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works. Every traveler must apply for an Embarkation Debarkation card (ED card) to enter Aruba. The night before flying to Aruba, I downloaded the AHOP app on my personal mobile phone using a special invitation sent by the Government of Aruba. Then I used my mobile phone camera to scan my passport and the RFID scanner to collect the information from the chip inside, allowing me to create a Digital Travel Credential (DTC). After taking a selfie, my face was matched and liveness was checked to ensure the passport was actually mine. Then, I sent my DTC, directly to the government of Aruba during my ED Card application process. They used my biometrics and personal information to process my application and send me my approved digital ED card. In other words, the Government of Aruba was able to check my passport and clear me for arrival all while I sat on my couch.</p>
<p>The next day when I landed in Aruba, instead of standing in a long line in the immigration terminal to get my paper documents and passports visually inspected, I headed toward the “AHOP” line, where I was presented with a camera that took my photo. Within seconds, the system had matched my face with the photo I’d sent the night before, verified my immigration status, showed the security officer the match, the green light flashed and I went on my way. It was the easiest immigration system I’d ever encountered.</p>
<p>In adopting this technology, Aruba isn’t just positioning itself as a global leader in digital travel, it is extending the seamless digital experience to everything a tourist might need or want when they visit the island, from hotel check in to booking activities with approved tour operators.</p>
<p>This seamless approach to guest services fully aligns with consumer expectations that anything and everything digital should be quick, contactless, and frictionless. The bonus with the technology used by Aruba is that it does all this while providing travelers with state-of-the-art data privacy and protection.</p>
<p>While this technology will change the experience of travel and tourism, the underlying technological accomplishment — the ability to verify the source of any data and that the data hasn’t been altered — will transform every facet of digital interaction across every sector.</p>
<p>AHOP is a milestone for Indicio, its partner in the air travel sector, SITA, and Aruba. Next stop, the world.</p>

<p>Enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions offer organizations a one-stop-shop for managing daily operations. The business management software has gained popularity in the business world as organizations try to keep up with the changing landscape. As with most business solutions, there are advantages and disadvantages of ERP systems to consider.</p>



<p>It’s important to understand how enterprise resource planning can work for an organization and its capabilities at a granular level. Here are some key benefits an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/enterprise-resource-planning">enterprise resource planning</a> system can bring when managing all aspects of the business.</p>



 Advantages of ERP 



 Improve customer service 



<p>The business world is hyper-competitive and that’s no different when it comes to attracting and retaining customers. The customer service experience is a vital part to an organization and an ERP solution can help advance customer relationship management. Since a new system like ERP software puts all customer information into one place, it can facilitate quicker customer service and a more personalized approach.</p>



<p>ERP stores contact information, order history, past support cases and more in one simplified system. Separately, since ERP will track past orders and real-time inventory the customer is much more likely to receive the correct items on time. If those factors are in place, it’s much more likely a customer leaves happy and will return for more down the road.</p>



 Customize reporting 



<p>Real-time data reporting is one of the highlights of an ERP solution and why it’s a serious advantage over other business management systems. With ERP reporting tools, organizations can customize reporting across many different functions, such as finance, inventory, procurement and human resources and be able to calculate it depending on what matters most to the organization. This tailor-made approach lets the business measure whichever KPIs they find most important and track performance of different business components.</p>



<p>The other advantage is ERP offers the latest data in real-time. This means if an employee is trying to assess an issue, they don’t have outdated data to analyze and instead have the most accurate and up to date numbers to refer to. The customized reporting can help an organization make informed decisions, which is critical when the business environment is ever-changing.</p>



 Expand collaborations 



<p>The way that ERP solutions are built make for excellent collaboration across different departments. With integrated applications and data storage all under one solution, teams get a clear picture into how each is functioning and contributing to the business.</p>



<p>With the enterprise resource planning system in place, teams across the organization can communicate freely as they aren’t functioning on separate platforms. The integration on the back-end is extremely important and helps employees integrate and work as one. With access to all data, one employee on a completely irrelevant team might be able to point out a malfunction or something that cuts down on duplicate work. This expanded collaboration can increase decision-making, while being a single source of truth for all data entry.</p>



 Greater sustainability 



<p>The fast-paced ever changing business world has seen a big emphasis on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-erp-is-breaking-down-silos-and-driving-sustainable-change/">sustainability</a>. C-suites are facing pressure from boards, investors, customers and others to regulate the negative impact of their carbon emissions.</p>



<p>To find out how organizations use ERP implementation to attain sustainability goals, the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/erp-sustainability">IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV) and SAP</a>, in collaboration with Oxford Economics, surveyed more than 2,125 senior executives involved in their organizations’ environmental sustainability strategies—around the world and across industries. The surprising result: those who outperform their competition in both environmental and financial outcomes also boast the most deeply engaged ERP implementation.</p>



 Improve transparency and insights 



<p>One of the benefits of ERP is that it offers full access to every business function and process in an organization all in one place. With the implementation of ERP, data from every department can be accessed by executive-level employees. The ERP solution monitors data daily and can provide day-to-day information, helping an organization be as precise as possible when it comes to factors such as inventory levels and business operations.</p>



<p>The complete visibility ERP provides gives organization leaders better functional business insights and more accurate business forecasting. As a result, this can streamline tasks and make clearer, more concise workflows. In addition, having accurate forecasting models is a competitive advantage, as they allow for improved data-driven strategy and decision-making. As ERP can monitor each department and keep all data in one place, there’s an opportunity for more efficient processes and improved cross-collaboration. In addition, ERP can improve business data security across the whole organization for both on-premises and cloud-based ERP systems.</p>



<p>An example of the success of an ERP implementation is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/neste">Neste</a>, a market leader in renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, and renewable polymers and chemicals based in Espoo, Finland. The company took a joint-team approach when it came to implementing its new ERP system. Neste worked with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/sap">IBM Consulting™ for SAP</a> to roll out the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/sap-s4hana">SAP S/4HANA</a> solution on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/microsoft">Microsoft Azure</a>&nbsp;cloud across most of its operations, including its renewables supply chains. Neste’s new ERP platform is enabling supply chain process efficiency improvements and making its data more transparent. “Among the most far-reaching benefits,” notes Neste Head of Integrated ERP, Marko Mäki-Ullakko, “is the ability to spot and resolve process inefficiencies.”</p>



<p>“We’ve been able to use SAP’s process discovery capabilities to spot supply chain and production bottlenecks,” he explained. “In that way, integrated SAP has been and will be a critical tool for our process optimization efforts.”</p>



 Increase flexibility and scalability 



<p>One of the unique features of ERP software is the inclusion of applications or modules across many different business needs. ERP applications, such as procurement, supply chain management, inventory and project management, are all separate applications offered under ERP.</p>



<p>ERP applications can stand on their own but can also be integrated in the entirety of the ERP system, making for easier scalability and configuration in an organization. By being able to add or take away applications, ERP can help scale a business as it evolves over time.</p>



<p>Scalability will look different depending on which ERP solution your organization chooses to use. If a business plans to grow rapidly over time the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/flex-cloud-enabled-erp/">cloud-based ERP system</a> is the best choice since cloud ERP systems are run on remote servers.</p>



 Increase productivity 



<p>By automating different tasks, ERP software frees up employees to work on more pertinent tasks and increased efficiency. The ERP system boosts productivity in a range of different ways that all stem from the automation of basic tasks and making processes more straightforward. With the streamlined approach from an ERP system, there is less time dedicated to digging up information and allows for employees to perform other tasks faster. Manual data entry is not necessary, making tasks such as inventory management much easier and making metrics tracking much simpler.</p>



<p>With a lens into the entire organization, employees are no longer tasked with tracking down the right data set or the employee who knows how a certain process works and can instead focus on more important tasks and projects. ERP solutions offer these features using technology, such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI), <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/rpa">robotic process automation</a> and more. These technologies support the automation and intelligent suggestion features in ERP software applications.</p>



 Reduce ongoing costs 



<p>The way an ERP solution is structured makes it so data input only occurs one time but can serve multiple purposes across the organization. This can result in saving the business time and money as it streamlines redundant tasks. The upfront costs and cost savings will also depend on which type of ERP solution you choose.</p>



<p>Without a centralized ERP software solution, organizations rely on numerous systems to run the business. The more systems, the higher the potential IT costs. An ERP system could potentially reduce those costs. Separately, it could also reduce training requirements for the end-user since they would only need to learn on one system. This could result in more profitability and less disruptions.</p>



 Standardize business processes 



<p>The purpose of implementing an ERP solution is to highlight and build from an organization’s best practices and consistencies. This allows you to streamline operations and standardize workflows, ultimately to reduce manual labor and human error across your business. Platforms such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/crm">customer relationship management (CRM)</a> can simply be integrated into the ERP system.</p>



<p>ERP software offers many advantages, but standardization is one of the most important. By relying on standardization and configuration, organizations could also see reduced project costs and better cross-team collaboration with less friction. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Disadvantages of ERP 



 Increase complexity 



<p>ERP is an all-encompassing business management tool, and it can be quite complex. The software can be exciting. Organizations can get caught up in that excitement and risk failing to make a well-thought-out plan for ERP implementation.</p>



<p>The processes of some organizations may find the ERP solution to be too large and not well-suited for its needs. This can result in a poor ROI and should be avoided if possible. The best way to avoid these pitfalls is to build role-based user training and simplify your ERP software to fit your organization’s needs.</p>



 Add short-term costs 



<p>There are multiple factors to consider when thinking about switching to an ERP software. One of them is cost; not only the cost of the software, but the cost of time and resources needed to implement the system and train employees across all departments.</p>



<p>Another aspect of cost is the ongoing operational costs required of an ERP solution, specifically an on-premises ERP solution. The best way to avoid this ongoing cost is to utilize a cloud-based ERP system, which is a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/saas">Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)</a> solution that can be run from any location.</p>



<p>One other factor to consider is the change management that is required when implementing an ERP system. ERP implementation requires changes to business processes and workflows. These changes are major investments in time and resources. When selecting ERP software, consider these factors and select the system type that best fits your organization’s needs.</p>



 More time-consuming 



<p>Since ERP is customizable, and not a one-size-fits-all software, it can become very time-consuming. Customization is a huge advantage to the ERP solution, but can be a challenge as it needs to be built from the ground up. &nbsp;</p>



<p>An implementation process takes time; organizations must prepare for a lengthy process. The time it takes to transfer to the ERP system depends on which legacy system is being used. The best way to avoid this issue is, again, to have an ERP implementation plan in place that is clear, concise and includes an assigned implementation team.</p>



 IBM and ERP 



<p>The migration from a legacy system to ERP software can be a huge undertaking no matter the size of the organization. When considering an ERP solution, it’s important to bring in experts to help run a smooth and transparent implementation plan.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/sap">IBM Consulting®</a> experts can help your organization successfully migrate legacy ERP applications to the cloud, redesign processes to leverage data, AI and automation, and transform finance into a competitive advantage within your business.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/consulting/sap-managed">SAP managed services for applications and ERP</a> can help manage an organization’s workloads, giving you more time to focus on innovation and new opportunities. Managed services for SAP applications enable agility and resource optimization by supporting and optimizing underlying operational functions. Areas like security and compliance reporting, application management, and service delivery to lines-of-business become more predictable from a pricing, resource and workload perspective.</p>

  <p>Within an organization, inactive user accounts can persist for various reasons, including former employees, service providers, and service accounts associated with products or services. These accounts may remain inactive temporarily or for extended periods. If an account remains inactive for 90 days or more, it is more likely to remain inactive. It’s crucial to periodically review these inactive accounts and eliminate any that are unnecessary. Microsoft Entra ID Governance Access Reviews now offers the capability to detect inactive accounts effectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the Entra ID Governance Access Review feature, it’s possible to identify accounts that have not been actively used to sign into Entra ID, either interactively or non-interactively, for up to 720 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accounts that are left inactive are susceptible to being targeted by cybercriminals for several reasons:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Inactive accounts may still use well-known passwords or credentials that have been compromised.&nbsp; 
 Inactive accounts are less likely to have multifactor authentication (MFA) enabled.&nbsp; 
 Due to their inactivity, these accounts may go unnoticed by advanced security controls in place.&nbsp; 
 
<p>While organizations with a formal JML (Joiners, Movers, and Leavers) process in place can mitigate some of these risks, regular reviews are still essential to ensure that security measures are effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Understanding the standards for monitoring accounts&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-navigator">CIS Control V8 Safe guard 5.3</a> it’s recommended to delete or disable any dormant accounts after a period of 45 days of inactivity, where supported. This is also aligned with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/benchmark/azure/security-controls-v3-privileged-access#pa-4-review-and-reconcile-user-access-regularly">Azure Security Benchmark v3 PA-4 Control</a> - Review and reconcile user access regularly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Account Management | Disable Accounts - Disable accounts within [Assignment: organization-defined time period] when the accounts: (a) Have expired; (b) Are no longer associated with a user or individual; (c) Are in violation of organizational policy; or (d) Have been inactive for [Assignment: organization-defined time period].&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These standards serve as additional confirmation of the importance of monitoring inactive or dormant accounts. Let's proceed to explore how Microsoft Entra ID Governance Access Reviews can assist in identifying these inactive accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Setting up Entra ID Governance Access Reviews&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that it's essential to review the licensing requirements for Microsoft Entra ID Governance before proceeding.

<p>Yuting and Nico are the founders of ZKorum. Yuting earned her Bachelor's degree at NYU Abu Dhabi and her Master's at ESSEC Business School. Nico is a Software Engineer and previously worked on projects that utilized Filecoin. </p><p>Nico is passionate about self-sovereign identity, and when he and Yuting joined forces, they started building this vision of a social network that runs on verifiable and anonymous data. </p><p>They both recognized a big problem with social media today. It's incredibly invasive and full of bots, scams, and disinformation. We cannot trust anyone online, and we have no way to prove that we are who we say we are unless we trust a third party to verify our identities. For example, some apps require you to verify your identity by uploading your ID. But this is very invasive. </p><p>Furthermore, our personal information is being collected and sold online every day by data brokers. In fact, the global data broker market was valued at <a href="https://www.knowledge-sourcing.com/report/global-data-broker-market#:~:text=The%20global%20data%20broker%20market,US%24545.431%20billion%20in%202028.">$319 billion</a> in 2021. According to the <a href="https://epic.org/issues/consumer-privacy/data-brokers/">Electronic Privacy Information Center</a>, data brokers collect and aggregate numerous types of personal information, including names, addresses, telephone numbers, e-mail addresses, gender, age, marital status, children, education, profession, income, political preferences, cars, and real estate owned. </p><p>Is there a better solution? How can we verify ourselves without trusting the third-party verifier and keeping our personal information safe?</p><p>Zero-knowledge proofs! A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic method or protocol used to demonstrate the authenticity of a statement or the possession of certain knowledge without revealing the actual information or knowledge itself. </p><p>Currently, ZKorum uses zero-knowledge proofs by acting as both the issuer and the verifier of Verifiable Credentials. Most large organizations already own a domain name and distribute unique email addresses to their members. Using this infrastructure, ZKorum can issue the user corresponding Verifiable Credentials, such as "female employee of XYZ Company." In this way, the user can prove her eligibility without revealing any unique identifier. ZKorum's closed-source competitors also rely on email addresses to verify that users indeed belong to those companies, but by being 100% open-source, ZKorum minimizes the trust that users need to put in them. In other words, "Don't trust, verify." Even in the event of a security breach, data would already be anonymized and unlikable to user profiles. &nbsp;</p> ZKorum as a Social Site <p>Yuting and Nico wanted to build an online forum where communities and verified members could create and participate in anonymous polls, surveys, discussions, and votes - a progressive web app where anyone can browse the existing public surveys and view their results.</p>Example Poll (Source: ZKorum)<p>ZKorum strives to create a safe and inclusive space where everyone feels secure and comfortable sharing their experiences and exchanging opinions without fearing backlash. That is why privacy-preserving technology is so important!</p> How is ZKorum using Fission Tech? <p>ZKorum is using <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCAN</a> for passwordless authentication between the client and the server. Since ZKorum took a DID-centric authentication approach using a wallet, they needed cryptographic keys.</p><p>However, ZKorum innovated even further by taking the security and seamlessness of UCAN authentication and combining it with the ease of use of email address verification. A one-time code is used to register a new user and their device, and then every request is signed using the device’s DID. Currently, ZKorum is utilizing the WebCrypto API to store cryptographic secrets in the browser, but eventually, it will switch to passkeys. ZKorum opted to hide the UCAN authentication behind the email address login flow because users are used to it, and they did want to overwhelm folks with technical jargon or multiple steps. ZKorum's end users are not expected to be highly technical users. They might be, but there is no assumption there. The idea is that anyone who can answer surveys on a computer will be able to understand how to use the ZKorum web app.</p> Future Plans <p>Yuting and Nico see ZKorum as a powerful way to protect people's privacy by separating a user's profile from their actions, also known as unlinkability. They want to build an open-source library providing this core feature of unlinkability, making it available for other developers to use across different products of their own.</p><p>ZKorum also actively provides feedback to the EU regulators and builders working on the EU ID Wallet. ZKorum aims to be compatible with official Verifiable Credentials, such as the European Digital Identity.</p><p>Yuting and Nico are also working with the Master's Program at ESSEC Business School in France to issue Verifiable Credentials, which would be a novel way to engage the student body and gather their opinion.</p> <p>If you want to learn more about Zkorum, please visit their <a href="https://zkorum.notion.site/9c3e955c69204a2a82d23dd2e2621a30?v=1d312aa5f20b43a09f95a94ca98b75ac">website</a>.</p>

Participants unraveled the data, made it clean and coherent for analysis then subsequently explored it to uncover insights, correlations, and patterns within the data. The key purpose for participants in this challenge was to Submit a comprehensive report synthesizing their findings from the data analysis in a format that is accessible and engaging for a non-technical audience, such as car enthusiasts or prospective car buyers; or even Doug DeMuro&nbsp;himself.</p><p>The winning reports for this challenge are as&nbsp;follows:</p> 1st place — Luca Ordronneau <p>Full report available to download: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:8883bc816cea8651382e83caa1193a1c7ac3fbe7ef0ad4abaca3415c21d2677b">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:8883bc816cea8651382e83caa1193a1c7ac3fbe7ef0ad4abaca3415c21d2677b</a></p><p>Due to an emphasis on the business readiness objective of this challenge and reporting structure, the review committee agreed that the report entered by Luca Ordronneau included the most precise, clean, and thorough information about the data and challenge at hand. Luca’s report efficiently demonstrated relationship analysis in the data, a complete understanding of the dataset, and business-ready formatting in this winning&nbsp;entry.</p><p>A snippet above shows a slide from Luca’s report that tells an audience the top 20 cars with the highest Doug score. Further data organization leads readers to learn that Doug often favors German vehicles, and as the year of the car model increases, so does the average score that Doug gives to the given car make &amp;&nbsp;model.</p> 2nd Place — FonkMasterFlexr <p>Full report available to download: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:858bb213650fe33e086560e7743c52ff2ba37817a8678dad5ca1c43cc26c4141">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:858bb213650fe33e086560e7743c52ff2ba37817a8678dad5ca1c43cc26c4141</a></p><p>The 2nd place finish in this challenge includes a high-speed and high-impact approach to navigating through Doug’s car scores. FonkMasterFlexr, in this exercise, displayed great execution in delivering clear-cut and direct findings from the dataset and recommendations to prospective luxury car buyers whilst leveraging data science&nbsp;tools.</p><p>The above shares a snippet from FonkMasterFlexr report: here the Fonk Master shows readers a dual nature between the weekend score and daily score. If you know Doug’s brand and channel, you know there are different sides to not only the personalities of weekday and weekend vibes of classic cars but also the personalities of the people driving said&nbsp;cars.</p><p>This data challenge received a record-high 18 qualifying submissions. After scoring and review, the calculations for podium finishes and prizes resulted in a 3-way tie for 3rd place. To accompany so many high-value reports, the Ocean Data Challenge team approved allowing all 5 submissions to enter the podium finish. The 3-way tie for 3rd place includes the following:</p> 3rd — Haumea <p>Full report available to download: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:969d503eb93dbe852748159ce9422f3eb99670f02bf80ad6432e1f20973730ad">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:969d503eb93dbe852748159ce9422f3eb99670f02bf80ad6432e1f20973730ad</a></p><p>The report “The World of Cars through Doug DeMuro’s Eyes” by Haumea analyzes Doug DeMuro’s car review dataset to understand how various factors influence a car’s overall rating. Relevant findings include a negative correlation between Practicality and Fun Factor, with Practicality scoring negatively influencing the overall DougScore, and a strong positive correlation between Acceleration and Handling, suggesting sportier cars excel in both, though at a cost to Comfort, especially for cars with Acceleration ratings above 6. The report also identifies a weak correlation between Styling and Quality, indicating that a car’s aesthetic appeal doesn’t always match its build&nbsp;quality.</p><p>The analysis shows that sport-oriented brands like Lamborghini and Ferrari typically score higher on Weekend Scores, while family-oriented brands like Lexus and Hyundai excel in Daily Scores. The study also reveals non-linear relationships and interaction effects between scoring components, such as high Acceleration and Handling scores disproportionately boosting the overall DougScore, while improvements in Styling or Comfort have diminishing returns beyond certain thresholds. The report’s insights provide a nuanced understanding of Doug DeMuro’s scoring system and offer valuable perspectives for automotive industry professionals and car&nbsp;buyers.</p> 3rd — Nicolas&nbsp;Landry <p>Full report available to download: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:b1eee66c360e73b45844689f05614260bf3e285748fe57d2f9d53a6fbcb4ebad">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:b1eee66c360e73b45844689f05614260bf3e285748fe57d2f9d53a6fbcb4ebad</a></p><p>A standout finding is a negative correlation between Practicality and Fun Factor, with vehicles like the Rivian R1T and GMC Hummer EV Pickup ranking high in these categories, but Value remains a distinctly independent factor. The analysis also uncovers a strong positive correlation between Handling and Acceleration, indicating that cars that accelerate faster generally handle better. However, this comes at the expense of Comfort, especially for cars with an acceleration rating above&nbsp;6.</p>The image above shows a heat map of interaction effects found between DougScore indicators.<p>Further, the report explores the nuanced relationship between Styling, Quality, and Cool Factor, with a subtle positive correlation between Styling and Cool Factor, but a weak negative correlation with Quality. Brand-wise, sports brands like Lamborghini, McLaren, and Ferrari focus on Weekend Scores, contrasting with family-oriented brands like Lexus and Hyundai, which excel in Daily Scores. The report is insightful for its exploration of how different scoring components interact, particularly highlighting the disproportionate impact of high acceleration and handling scores on the overall DougScore and the diminishing returns in areas like styling or comfort beyond certain thresholds. This comprehensive analysis offers valuable perspectives for both the automotive industry and potential car buyers, dissecting the nuances that make a car stand out in Doug DeMuro’s&nbsp;reviews.</p> 3rd — Philip&nbsp;Roman <p>Full report available to download: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:0cf0fbd28a359ce8ff06c5f1bab47f2e70a4e25f6e0c51fd7dd110890fec04b3">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:0cf0fbd28a359ce8ff06c5f1bab47f2e70a4e25f6e0c51fd7dd110890fec04b3</a></p><p>Key findings in this 3rd place tying report include strong correlations between score categories, such as the negative correlation between Fun Factor and Practicality, and the positive correlation between Acceleration and Handling.

<p>We are thrilled to share that IBM is named a Leader in the most recent Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Access Management.&nbsp;IBM is recognized for its Ability to Execute and Completeness of Vision.</p>



<p>As a team, we’ve been working hard to deliver on a roadmap of identity and access management capabilities that we believe solve the biggest challenges organizations are facing when it comes to managing identities in today’s dispersed, hybrid cloud environments. Ultimately, our vision is to provide the right building blocks for organizations to build an “identity fabric” that integrates, augments and streamlines the myriad of disconnected and incompatible identity tools organizations are using today.</p>



<p>Let’s dig into what this looks like in practice.</p>



 The challenges of managing identity across hybrid cloud 



<p>As cloud migration and digital transformation accelerate, organizations are facing a huge amount of complexity when it comes to identity and access management (IAM). They are increasingly working across multi-cloud environments and tools — each of which provides their own set of identity and access management (IAM) capabilities to manage. At the same time, they’re also still relying on legacy systems and architectures, which often lack some of the standard capabilities needed for a modern IAM strategy. Ultimately, these tools are creating a disconnected and complicated web of identities to be managed, with no easy way to integrate or streamline between them. These identity silos disrupt strategic intentions of providing users a consistent and frictionless authentication experience and improving identity security.</p>



<p>Taking an “identity fabric” approach can help organizations bridge the gap between legacy identity infrastructure and modern cloud-based IAM systems. An identity fabric aims to integrate and enhance existing identity solutions rather than replace them. The goal is to create a less complex environment where consistent security authentication flows and visibility can be enforced.</p>

<p>Recent technological advancements in data storage have prompted businesses and consumers to move away from traditional <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/hard-disk-drive-vs-solid-state-drive/">hard disk drives (HDDs)</a> towards faster, lower-latency <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/solid-state-drives">solid-state drive (SSD)</a> technology. In this post, we’re going to look at this new technology, as well as the fastest and most popular protocol available to connect it to a computer’s motherboard—<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/nvme">non-volatile memory express (NVMe)</a>.</p>



<p>While the terms SSD and NVMe are often used to describe two different types of drives, they are actually different data storage technologies that are can used to complement each other. SSDs are a type of semiconductor-based storage used with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/flash-storage">flash storage</a>, and NVMe is a protocol for data transfer with reduced system overheads per input/output operations per second (I/O, or IOPS) that is used in SSDs with flash memory.</p>



<p>The differences between NVMe and SSD technology are subtle and can be confusing. While every NVMe device is also an SSD drive, not all SSDs are NVMe drives. According to a <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US49243923">2023 International Data Corporation (IDC) report</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), NVMe was designed to speed data transfer to systems connected via a PCI express, a serial expansion bus that’s standard for connecting a computer to one or more peripheral devices. However, not all SSDs use PCIe technology; some use the older SATA and SAS interfaces that were designed for HDDs, making them compatible with older devices.</p>



 What is an SSD? 



<p>Before SSDs were invented, HDDs and floppy drives were the most widely used storage drives on the market. But while HDDs and floppy drives both relied on magnets to store data, SSDs use a new technology called NAND—a non-volatile type of storage that doesn’t require power to retain its data. In an SSD, each memory chip is made of blocs that contain cells (also known as pages or sectors) that each have their own bits of memory.</p>



<p>Unlike HDDs that have inherent latency and access time because of their platters, spinning disks and read/write heads, SSDs contain no moving parts, making them much faster. Since the early-to-mid 2000s, SSDs have been rising in popularity in both the consumer and enterprise marketplace due to their superior performance and lightning-fast speeds.</p>



 NVMe SSDs 



<p>For the fastest data transfer speeds available, look no further than the NVMe SSD. Through its Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) bus, NVMe SSDs can achieve transfer speeds of up to 20 gigabytes per second (Gbps)—more than three times the speed of a SATA SSD. Another attractive feature of an NVMe drive is right there in its name—non-volatile memory. This specification means that, unlike other types of drives, power is not required for an NVMe device to retain its memory. Additionally, unlike other technologies, NVMe storage can connect directly to a computer’s CPU using a PCIe socket and enable the drive’s flash memory to function through PCIe as opposed to a SATA driver, which is slower.&nbsp;</p>



 SATA SSDs 



<p>Another popular type of SSD is the SATA drive, which has become more popular recently due its compatibility with older technologies. While NVMe SSDs still have more bandwidth, many older computers don’t support either the NVMe or PCIe technology, making a SATA interface the best option. SATA SSDs can achieve a maximum data transfer speed of six gigabytes per second (Gbps), slower than other, newer interfaces, but still considerably faster than a traditional HDD.</p>



<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/nvme-vs-sata/">Learn more about how NVMe and SATA relate</a>



 M.2 SSDs 



<p>M.2 drives, introduced in 2012, are a type of SSD that can connect directly into a computer’s motherboard using an M.2 form factor. Compared to other kinds of SSDs, M.2 drives are more power efficient and take up less space. They are also smaller and faster than the widely used 2.5-inch SSDs and don’t require cables of any kind to connect. Despite their relatively small size, M.2s can hold just as much data as their peers—up to eight terabytes (TBs)—and are compatible with any motherboard that has an M.2 slot. When they use the NVMe interface, M.2 NVMe SSDs can deliver some of the fastest data transfer speeds available today.</p>



<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/nvme-vs-m2/">Learn more about how NVMe and M.2 relate</a>



 PCIe SSDs 



<p>A PCIe SSD is an expansion card that connects a computer to various components (such as a graphics card or external storage device) using the PCIe serial expansion bus standard. PCIe slots are available in five different sizes (x2, x3, x4 … etc.) with the x referring to the number of lanes each card has for a data transfer.</p>



 What is NVMe? 



<p>NVMe&nbsp;(non-volatile memory express)is a data transfer protocol&nbsp;that was designed for&nbsp;flash storage&nbsp;and SSDs. It was introduced in 2011 as an alternative to the SATA and Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) protocols that were the industry standard at the time, and it conveys better throughput than its predecessors. In addition to improvements in storage and technology, NVMe contributed to the development of important technologies that were being developed at the same time, including the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things (IoT)</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning (ML)</a>.</p>



<p>Since 2011, NVMe technology has distinguished itself through its high bandwidth and blazing-fast data transfer speeds. Because of improvements to the NVMe drivers that allow for parallelism and polling, NVMe SSDs can optimize response times and write speeds and help reduce latency to avoid CPU bottlenecks. Additionally, NVMe technology has a smaller infrastructure footprint at the enterprise level and uses less power than the popular Small Computer System Interface (SCSI).</p>



<p>Top-performing NVMe drives can surpass 3000 megabytes per second (MB/s), with some of the newer models reaching speeds as high as 7500 MB/s. Unlike its predecessor, Serial Advanced Technology Attachment (SATA), NVMe was designed for high-performance, non-volatile storage media, making it an excellent choice for challenging, data-rich compute environments.</p>



 Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) bus 



<p>NVMe SSDs access flash storage through a PCIe bus that removes the “middleman” controller, greatly reducing latency. However, NVMes can also run on any type of “fabric” interconnect—such as Fibre Channel and Ethernet—and within Ethernet, iWarp, RoCEv2, iSER and NVMe-TCP. PCIe Gen4 is the latest PCI Express specification, and its data transfer rate is double Gen3’s. While Gen3 PCIes have a transfer rate of eight giga transfers per second (GT/s) per PCIe lane, Gen4’s rate is 16 GT/s, or 2 GB/s per PCIe lane.</p>



 Parallel command queues 



<p>NVMe SSDs can run tens of thousands of parallel command queues at once, another key differentiator from drives that utilize the older, slower SCSI protocol and can only deploy a single command queue. With NVMe SSDs, the connection method is independent of the protocol. For example, NVMe PCIe connectors can access a single drive via a PCIe link running the NVMe protocol.&nbsp;</p>



 NVMe vs. SSD: What kind of data storage is right for you? 



<p>There is no way to accurately compare NVMe and SSD technology, as they are different and often complement each other. NVMe SSDs provide some of the fastest data transfer speeds available, but that doesn’t mean they are necessarily the right choice for your needs. Many factors come into play when choosing a data storage solution. To help with the process, we’ve compared some of the most popular options available by four critical factors: Price, technical specifications, storage capacity and speed.</p>



 
 Price: Until recently, SATA SSDs were comparably cheaper than NVMe SSDs, making them an attractive choice for budget-minded users. However, the price of NVMe SSDs has been dropping for the past few years as the technology becomes more widely available, making price less and less of a differentiator. Today, the popular Samsung brand of SSDs—in both NVMe and SATA variety and with comparable storage—ranges in price from between USD 64 and 130 on Amazon. 



 Technical specifications: Many older devices don’t support the newer, faster NVMe technology, making a SATA SSD the necessary choice. Before purchasing an SSD, users should also make sure their system has enough PCIe connections to support the number of devices they wish to connect. Many motherboards only have two or three slots, which will limit the number of devices they can connect. 



 Storage capacity: NVMe and SATA SSDs usually come in either 1TB or 2TB options. Users looking for more capacity can upgrade to the 4TB and 8TB models, but at a higher price point. At the time of writing, 4TB NVMe and SATA SSDs cost between USD 200 and 300 on Amazon, while 8TB SSDs were going for closer to USD 400. &nbsp; 



 Speed: NVMe SSDs’ key differentiator is speed and performance. NVMe technology uses a PCIe interface that enables it to connect directly to a CPU, reducing latency and improving responsiveness. But some users simply don’t need that level of speed, in which case a SATA SSD could be a slightly cheaper option. While quite not as fast, SATA SSDs still transfer data much faster than their older HDD counterparts. Depending on your needs, the speeds of a SATA SSD might be sufficient. 
 



 SSD and NVMe use cases 



<p>At the enterprise level, the speed and performance of NVMe technology are difficult to ignore. While some enterprises still use SATA SSDs, they are more common among consumers looking to upgrade the speed and performance of a laptop or PC they’re using for gaming or to run basic office applications. Here are some of the most common use cases for SSDs.</p>



 
 High-performance/high-speed computing: NVMe SSDs’ ability to handle parallel processing makes it an ideal solution for many of today’s most demanding and complex compute environments. Many high-demand applications, such as high-frequency financial trading apps and AI and ML deployments, rely on NVMe SSDs for speedy access to large volumes of data. 



 Compute-intensive applications: Apps that feature real-time customer interactions often rely on NVMe technology to run their workloads. Examples of these apps include e-commerce, personal finance and many <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native">cloud-native</a> applications. 



 Data centers: NVMe SSDs help <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data centers</a> everywhere expand their storage capabilities and achieve lightning-fast transfer speeds. While SATA SSDs are still in use at the enterprise level, according to a <a href="https://research.esg-global.com/reportaction/DataInfrastructureTrends2021/Toc">recent report from Enterprise Strategy Group (ESG)</a> (link resides outside ibm.com), nearly three-quarters of businesses have either already switched to NVMe SSD storage or are planning to in the next year. 



 Video editing: Many video editors use NVMe and SATA SSDs to expand their storage and still get the high processing speeds they need. One example is the slim, small, highly portable NVMe M.2 SSD that is an ideal solution for lightweight computers like laptops, notebooks and ultrabooks. 



 Gaming: Serious gamers everywhere depend on the fast load times that both NVMe and SATA SSDs provide. Both kinds of SSDs can deliver a smooth, fast gaming experience at comparable prices, as well as improve the speed and performance of day-to-day applications for any PC build. 
 



 IBM and SSD and NVMe solutions 



<p>SSDs help consumers and enterprises achieve the fast data transfer speeds they require. For gaming enthusiasts and video editors, older, SATA SSDs are often enough, but for enterprise workloads, the NVMe SSD is fast becoming the industry standard. IBM Storage FlashSystem 5200 provides compact, powerful storage along with all the benefits of NVMe technology. The 5200 helps enterprises achieve greater speed, performance and scalability with their data storage solution.</p>

<p>In 2023, organizations have faced an unprecedented level of pressure to digitally transform with the rise of generative AI as well as imperatives such as sustainability, labor productivity and security. The “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/data-story-hybrid-cloud-ai">Cloud Transformation Report</a>,” a new global survey from the IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV), found that many leading enterprises share a common foundation to digital transformation—a clear hybrid cloud strategy.¹ These businesses cite several key benefits to using a hybrid cloud approach to fuel business transformation, including modernization, agility, security, sustainability and the ability unlock the power of generative AI.</p>



<p>Here’s a look at the key drivers that impacted cloud transformation over the past year and what they mean for companies on their cloud modernization journey:</p>



 Considerations for adopting generative AI 



<p>This year, generative AI captured the attention of business leaders—but it also raised questions including what’s the right foundation to accelerate and scale impact? For many organizations, the answer is a hybrid cloud approach. The new study found that 68% of hybrid cloud adopters have already established formal, organization-wide policies to direct their approach to generative AI.</p>



<p>With the rise of generative AI comes an influx of data. While this can fuel tremendous business innovations, it also requires strategic considerations. When executing an AI strategy, enterprises need to consider their current compute capacity, where data resides—in the cloud, on premises, at the edge—how data is accessed, necessary security controls, and how to use existing technology investments effectively. In addition to helping deliver enhanced reliability and performance, a hybrid cloud approach can enable increased agility with the ability to connect cloud and on-premises environments, removing barriers to flexible AI workflows.</p>



 Addressing security and compliance concerns 



<p>When it comes to generative AI, enterprises are also concerned about the potential exposure of sensitive data. For example, 45% of cloud leaders cited concerns about cybersecurity or privacy and confidentiality of data and information as the key obstacle in their push to implement generative AI. The findings indicate that highly regulated industries are increasingly weighing risks, such as security, when considering the technology. These organizations are less likely to have a formal approach to AI than some other industries, but they are showing progress: 57% of banks and financial markets organizations,&nbsp;54%&nbsp;of insurers and&nbsp;54%&nbsp;of life sciences/pharma institutions have adopted a formal approach to the technology so far.</p>



<p>For highly regulated industries that are tasked with safeguarding critical data, there’s a lot on the line. To avoid blind spots, a holistic security strategy that provides visibility across an entire hybrid cloud infrastructure is vital to mitigate risk.&nbsp;</p>



 Overcoming skills challenges 



<p>The report also shows persistent obstacles to more widespread cloud adoption — perhaps none as great as the ongoing skills gap. For example, 58% of global decision makers say that cloud skills remain a considerable challenge and 72% of organizations have created new positions to fulfill the need for cloud skills. Within individual industries, this deficiency is even greater: 79% in highly regulated industries such as banking and financial markets, as well as 81% in transportation and travel, and 79% in chemicals and petroleum.</p>



 Putting sustainability initiatives in the spotlight 



<p>Recently, sustainability has been tied to broader business goals and become a larger priority for technology investments for organizations across industries. Yet as generative AI grows, the increase in data processing required for AI workloads does too. This can present new challenges for organizations that are looking to reduce their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.</p>



<p>With the right tools in place, cloud can help enterprises track, manage and report on sustainability goals — including for partners and third parties. In fact, our findings determined that 42% of global decision makers confirm they are already using the cloud to help deploy, track and manage sustainability goals internally.</p>



 Looking to the future 



<p>With more enterprises embarking on their AI journeys, it will become critical for these organizations to ensure they have the right infrastructure and talent in place to support these initiatives. Organizations that shift to an agile, secure data structure with a hybrid cloud architecture will likely be the winners of tomorrow — armed with a strong foundation from which to compete in the future AI-driven landscape.</p>

<p>Apache Kafka is a well-known open-source event store and stream processing platform and has grown to become the de facto standard for data streaming. In this article, developer Michael Burgess provides an insight into the concept of schemas and schema management as a way to add value to your event-driven applications on the fully managed Kafka service, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/event-streams">IBM Event Streams on IBM Cloud</a>®.</p>



 What is a schema? 



<p>A schema describes the structure of data.</p>



<p>For example:</p>



<p>A simple Java class modelling an order of some product from an online store might start with fields like:</p>



 <code>public class Order{

private String productName

private String productCode

private int quantity

[…]

}</code> 



<p>If order objects were being created using this class, and sent to a topic in Kafka, we could describe the structure of those records using a schema such as this Avro schema:</p>



 <code>{
"type": "record",
"name": “Order”,
"fields": [
{"name": "productName", "type": "string"},
{"name": "productCode", "type": "string"},
{"name": "quantity", "type": "int"}
]
}</code> 



 Why should you use a schema? 



<p>Apache Kafka transfers data without validating the information in the messages. It does not have any visibility of what kind of data are being sent and received, or what data types it might contain. Kafka does not examine the metadata of your messages.</p>



<p>One of the functions of Kafka is to decouple consuming and producing applications, so that they communicate via a Kafka topic rather than directly. This allows them to each work at their own speed, but they still need to agree upon the same data structure; otherwise, the consuming applications have no way to deserialize the data they receive back into something with meaning. The applications all need to share the same assumptions about the structure of the data.</p>



<p>In the scope of Kafka, a schema describes the structure of the data in a message. It defines the fields that need to be present in each message and the types of each field.</p>



<p>This means a schema forms a well-defined contract between a producing application and a consuming application, allowing consuming applications to parse and interpret the data in the messages they receive correctly.</p>



 What is a schema registry? 



<p>A schema registry supports your Kafka cluster by providing a repository for managing and validating schemas within that cluster. It acts as a database for storing your schemas and provides an interface for managing the schema lifecycle and retrieving schemas. A schema registry also validates evolution of schemas.</p>



 Optimize your Kafka environment by using a schema registry. 



<p>A schema registry is essentially an agreement of the structure of your data within your Kafka environment. By having a consistent store of the data formats in your applications, you avoid common mistakes that can occur when building applications such as poor data quality, and inconsistencies between your producing and consuming applications that may eventually lead to data corruption. Having a well-managed schema registry is not just a technical necessity but also contributes to the strategic goals of treating data as a valuable product and helps tremendously on your data-as-a-product journey.</p>



<p>Using a schema registry increases the quality of your data and ensures data remain consistent, by enforcing rules for schema evolution. So as well as ensuring data consistency between produced and consumed messages, a schema registry ensures that your messages will remain compatible as schema versions change over time. Over the lifetime of a business, it is very likely that the format of the messages exchanged by the applications supporting the business will need to change. For example, the Order class in the example schema we used earlier might gain a new status field—the product code field might be replaced by a combination of department number and product number, or changes the like. The result is that the schema of the objects in our business domain is continually evolving, and so you need to be able to ensure agreement on the schema of messages in any particular topic at any given time.</p>



<p>There are various patterns for schema evolution:</p>



 
 Forward Compatibility: where the producing applications can be updated to a new version of the schema, and all consuming applications will be able to continue to consume messages while waiting to be migrated to the new version. 



 Backward Compatibility: where consuming applications can be migrated to a new version of the schema first, and are able to continue to consume messages produced in the old format while producing applications are migrated. 



 Full Compatibility: when schemas are both forward and backward compatible. 
 



<p>A schema registry is able to enforce rules for schema evolution, allowing you to guarantee either forward, backward or full compatibility of new schema versions, preventing incompatible schema versions being introduced.</p>



<p>By providing a repository of versions of schemas used within a Kafka cluster, past and present, a schema registry simplifies adherence to data governance and data quality policies, since it provides a convenient way to track and audit changes to your topic data formats.</p>



 What’s next? 



<p>In summary, a schema registry plays a crucial role in managing schema evolution, versioning and the consistency of data in distributed systems, ultimately supporting interoperability between different components. Event Streams on IBM Cloud provides a Schema Registry as part of its Enterprise plan. Ensure your environment is optimized by utilizing this feature on the fully managed Kafka offering on IBM Cloud to build intelligent and responsive applications that react to events in real time.</p>

<p>In a previous blog we introduced <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/09/digital-certificate-linting/">Digital Certificate Linting</a>. It is interesting how certification authorities (CAs) have deployed certificate linting of public trust certificates without policy requirements from the browsers or the CA/Browser Forum. Linting does not need to be mandated as it naturally helps CAs to be compliant by limiting certificate miss-issuance. This also increases customer service as certificates do not need to be revoked and reissued.</p>
<p>Over a number of years, Entrust has slowly deployed linting. Our first goal was to ensure the linters were not developed by the same team which developed our products. The thought was to minimize the duplication of errors in the policy software and the linting software. We focused on using third party linters for TLS certificates such as cablint and <a href="https://github.com/zmap/zlint">zlint</a>.</p>
<p>Entrust first ran linting against all of our active TLS certificates to find issues and remove errors. We ran post-issuance linting to detect errors, which do not interfere with certificate issuance. When we were happy with the results, we implemented pre-issuance linting.</p>
<p>With pre-issuance linting, if there is a linting error detected a certificate should not be issued. When a pre-certificate is issued for certificate transparency (CT) logging, then the pre-certificate with a linting error will be revoked. The goal of pre-issuance linting is to not miss-issue certificates and provide the details of the error to the team in order to correct the issue.</p>
<p>Although the public certificate linters were designed for TLS certificates, we expanded post-issuance linting to all certificate types. This was done first by only using the non-TLS components of the linters, plus adding other specific components. For each issuing CA, we created a certificate profile, which the CA could issue. This would separate each CA to its certificate type and would narrow down the CA scope to its key usage, extended key usage, permitted key size, hash algorithm, certificate policy, CRL link, etc. We also added in weak key checking, CT logging requirements, and ensured the subject name met the requirements which were validated.</p>
<p>Certificate linting can support the three per cent self-audit requirement from the CA/Browser Forum baseline requirement documents. In fact, since linting is done in an automated fashion, it can be extended to 100 per cent of the certificates. The result is the most extensive and non-subjective self-audit methodology, which may be the primary source of detecting certificate miss-issuance. In the case where a CA miss-issues a certificate which is not detected by linting, the CA may consider updating the linting software to better detect the error in the future. In addition, the linting results and actions can also be provided to the compliance auditor, which shows extensive monitoring and actions when an error is detected.</p>
<p>All CAs issuing publicly trusted certificates should consider certificate linting. Also, CAs which perform linting, but have miss-issued certificates should consider whether linting can be updated to detect the error in the future. Updates to shared linting software will reduce the risk to browser users and the inconvenience to secure server operators.</p>

To us, this recognition is an acknowledgement to our deep understanding of the market, our teams of innovators, and our close collaboration with customers, partners, and industry experts to deliver the products and services needed in the dynamic, digital economy.</p>

<p>We take pride in our history of providing simple and safe access experiences for all identities across any environment and we're thrilled to be recognized as a Leader in this space. And now that ForgeRock has joined forces with Ping Identity — another recognized Leader in the Magic Quadrant for Access Management — we anticipate even greater opportunities to serve customers' needs through broader and deeper product capabilities.</p>

<p>For more information, please download the full <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/forgerock-named-leader-access-management-2023">2023 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Access Management report</a>.</p>

<p>Ping Identity's PingOne Cloud Platform and ForgeRock Identity Cloud were both named as a Leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Access Management. The two solutions were evaluated independently before Ping Identity and ForgeRock were combined on August 23, 2023.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

 ForgeRock Product Capabilities 

<p>ForgeRock Access Management capabilities come together seamlessly through identity administration and <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration">access orchestration</a>.</p>
	
<p>ForgeRock's identity administration capabilities help our customers connect and manage their identity data in ways that align with their business objectives. For example, our customers can create organizational hierarchies that represent the reality of their specific customers, brands, partners, suppliers, and more. Next, customers can create relationships between users and organizations to best manage different experience and security requirements for each different user population. At runtime, this data is provided as an input to the orchestration flow, which delivers personalized user journeys based on the dynamic data inputs — all from a single platform.</p>
	
<p>Recent <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-cloud">ForgeRock Identity Cloud</a> enhancements noted by Gartner include:</p>

  <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-access">New signals for threat detection</a>: Our AI/ML-powered big data architecture ingests data from various sources and converts that data into signals, giving customers fine-grained control over how the signals are weighted for risk, synthesized, and interpreted. Out-of-the-box signals detect anomalous user behavior, suspicious IP addresses, credential stuffing and brute-force attacks, impossible traveler scenarios, and bots. We are bringing rich signals and prevention from the endpoint to the application and building practical features around those signals to ensure they are explainable and usable in real-world scenarios. 
	 <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/intelligent-access/orchestration/capabilities">New flows and connectors to orchestration trees</a>: Intelligent Access (“Trees”) gives customers ultimate control of their user identity experiences through the use of low-code orchestrated identity journeys. We continue to evolve this capability, providing new journeys and nodes (the building blocks of journeys) for common use cases. We also have extended our cloud solution to include Trust Network marketplace nodes for common partner integrations. 
	 <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/passwordless-authentication">Passkeys compatibility</a>: We have always been a leader in the passwordless space with early adoption and support of FIDO standards, including WebAuthn. This year, we added support for passkeys, further strengthening our ability to support CIAM and workforce use cases looking to go truly passwordless. 
  ForgeRock and Ping Identity: A Winning Combination 

<p>As we look into the next year, the combination of ForgeRock and Ping Identity will drive further innovation and greater customer value in the access management space. I believe having a unified vision and strategy is a winning combination for customers seeking the best solutions for their often complex needs — and our collective team has years of expertise and diverse backgrounds to help on that journey.</p>

<p>To learn more about the access management market, I'd encourage you to read this latest version of the Gartner Magic Quadrant and check Ping Identity's positioning. I believe analysis by Gartner can help you select a partner that can support your enterprise's need for a modern access management solution.</p>

<p>Advanced organizations know their greatest assets are their employees. However, keeping employees happy and engaged can be challenging, especially when considering available resources and the need to meet other organizational goals. An organization is only as strong as its talent pool, so organizations have increasingly embraced <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/talent-management">talent management</a> as a core component of their overarching strategy. Identifying top talent and cultivating their ability to produce value for the organization is a business imperative.</p>



<p>Talent management, which often encompasses&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/talent-development">talent development</a>, recruitment, onboarding and other facets of the employee lifecycle, is essential for keeping top talent happy. Consider the rise of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/gone-for-now-or-gone-for-good-how-to-play-the-new-talent-game-and-win-back-workers">Great Resignation</a>, where workers were more likely than ever to leave organizations or the workforce entirely. While&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230731-the-great-resignation-is-over-what-does-that-mean">reports</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/18/70percent-of-gen-z-and-millennials-are-considering-leaving-their-jobs-soon.html">vary</a>&nbsp;on whether the Great Resignation is still happening, the memory remains. Thus, organizations are prioritizing talent management more than ever. According to McKinsey, many executives say it contributes to outperforming their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/mckinsey-explainers/what-is-talent-management">competitors</a>.</p>

 Building an effective talent management strategy 



<p>Organizations cannot approach talent management initiatives with half-measures. Talent management needs to become a holistic part of the organization. That means the organization needs to identify the metrics it wants to track and create employee assessments to ensure it is tracking employee growth accurately.</p>



<p>Having a strong talent management process ensures that an organization is efficiently and effectively minimizing employee turnover, boosting performance and keeping employees happy. Here are the steps an organization should take to create an effective talent management strategy:&nbsp;</p>



 Set a strong foundation&nbsp; 



<p>To maximize a talent management system, an organization and its human resources team must make clear the importance of human capital as a key organizational asset. One way to do so is to invest in the organization’s “company culture,” where executives and the HR team demonstrate to employees how integral they are to the business, how they are part of a larger team, and how they and other team members can be comfortable to bring their authentic selves to work.</p>



<p>Doing so creates a halo for the organization to be known as an “employer brand.” This signals to new hires and future employees that they are joining an organization that has their priorities in mind. This is an underrated but smart way to increase an employee’s likelihood of making referrals, where existing employees are proud to recommend the organization’s former colleagues, friends and family.</p>



 Create the right organizational structure 



<p>Organizations that create and staff&nbsp;<a href="https://www.heidrick.com/en/insights/human-resources-officers/first_time_chief_people_officers_a_guide">chief people officer (CPO) positions</a>&nbsp;demonstrate they take talent management seriously and are willing to invest in the discipline. While CPOs often lead the HR department, their remits extend beyond. CPOs are often in charge of organizational culture, ensuring the organization uncovers and resolves unconscious bias in decision-making processes and other components arising during the entire employee lifecycle. By elevating an employee responsible for talent development to the C-suite, an organization demonstrates its people are a core asset.</p>



 Activate executive buy-in 



<p>Creating a winning talent management strategy requires an organization’s executives to advocate for the investment and to demonstrate their commitment by working directly with HR professionals. </p>



<p>Leading executives are increasingly aware that employees are a huge component of business success. Knowledgeable executives understand that strong talent management programs improve KPIs like employee retention percentages and employee satisfaction and decrease recruitment costs. Done right, talent management is a core component of an organization’s business strategy that aligns with key business goals such as revenue, profitability and cost control.</p>



 Demonstrate a strong approach during recruitment and onboarding 



<p>Talent management strategies begin before an organization ever hires someone. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/talent-acquisition">talent acquisition</a>&nbsp;phase is a crucial time to establish an organization’s talent management bonafides. Simple touches like easy-to-understand job descriptions, overall skill development opportunities and examples of how the organization cares for its employees all demonstrate to the right talent that they would be joining an employee-driven organization.</p>



<p>Every prospect should receive a clear picture of how the organization approaches talent management. This includes what skill sets the job requires, how the employees at the organization acquire new competencies or continue to learn more about existing skills, and how they will be judged on performance and career paths.</p>



<p>How the organization treats its new talent during the onboarding process sets the tone for their work at the organization and serves as a reflection of how the organization treats employees. Even in these early stages, solid talent management practices, such as employee engagement surveys and clear role expectations, can help establish a strong employee experience.</p>



 Prioritize the employee’s well-being and career growth 



<p>Successful talent management requires an organization to demonstrate through words and actions how it cares for its employees. It usually involves creating a positive work environment and communicating a message of mutual respect and equality. Employees are increasingly perceptive about whether their employer is contributing to their well-being, so it is important to match any promises with concrete action. There are many ways an organization can follow through, including mental health days, rules about communications after business hours, guest speakers and involving employees in the decision making about what benefits and training the organization should offer.</p>



 Supercharge the performance management strategy 



<p>Tracking and building employee performance is a critical component of any talent management strategy. No two employees are alike; even the best employees are likely to have a skill gap or two that their manager can and should help them resolve.</p>



<p>Organizations should invest in broad training programs to ensure the entire workforce has up-to-date skills. Going a step further, they can offer bespoke upskilling to the most promising and best talent, helping them excel at their jobs. It is also crucial to track results through performance reviews, surveys and more.</p>



 Embed workforce planning into everything 



<p>It may be hard to confront, but the harsh reality is that nearly every employee will leave an organization at some point. Whether they retire, take a new role at a competitor or switch fields because they want to pursue a new career, their departure can halt an organization’s momentum or create challenges.</p>



<p>Since many of these departures can happen out of the blue, it is never too early to begin thinking about succession planning, which is the process of identifying and preparing the best talent to replace executives who may leave because of retirement, a career switch or a better offer from another organization. Organizations should create robust mentoring programs where executives can help create a foundation for those who may replace them if they leave.</p>



<p>Ultimately, prioritizing talent management strategy is an organizational decision that, done right, will deliver ROI on any program costs. It is becoming an increasingly core component of an organization’s overarching business strategy. It is the right thing to do not only for an organization’s goals but also to ensure the employees who work hard are treated fairly and given the tools to succeed at their current jobs and beyond.</p>



 Talent management and IBM 



<p>From the global labor shortage to the widening skills gap, the battle for talent and skills requires HR leaders to evolve the way they serve the workforce and re-imagine the way they approach talent recruitment, job restructuring, skills development and employee experience. </p>

<p>Generative AI presents the opportunity to influence enterprise transformation and help their business adopt technologies to better serve its people. IBM helps enterprises deliver customized experiences, apply data-driven insights, and develop impactful recruiting and adaptive skilling capabilities to establish a more modern HR function. We focus on each company’s unique business goals and challenges, dig deep to understand their workforce realities, and create strategies that unlock new levels of performance inside their business, helping deliver their vision and develop a skilled, sustainable workforce. With IBM, you can enhance employee engagement and productivity, reskill your workforce faster and re-imagine ways of working.</p>

<p>In the digital age, the symbiotic relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity is undeniable. As AI technologies advance, so do the methods and tactics employed by malicious actors seeking to exploit vulnerabilities. The intersection of AI and cybersecurity creates a dynamic landscape where innovation and risk coexist. As AI becomes increasingly embedded at every level of our daily lives, it’s important to understand not just the risks from AI, but also the risks to AI.</p>
 Identifying the Threats 
<p>Let’s start with one of the most direct threats to AI, which is what is commonly referred to as data poisoning – the idea of corrupting the data that the AI model learns from. These alterations are strategically crafted to manipulate the behavior of the AI system, causing them to produce unintended outputs or become biased. This could lead to several threats, including propagation of false information, generation of malicious content such as spam, phishing emails, and even flawed code. Data-poisoning attacks can have dire and harmful consequences. For instance, an image recognition system might misclassify a stop sign as a yield sign in real-world applications like autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>Even if not directly and deliberately poisoned, it’s also important to consider what data a given AI platform is being trained on. At the moment, there is something of a free-for-all when it comes to scraping data for input for many of the popular generative AI platforms and other large language models. This is undergoing something of a backlash, both technological and legal. Where an AI application gets the data it learns from has implications for bias and hallucination, but also potentially opens the door for proprietary information getting out.</p>
<p>On a related note, with so many vendors trying to jump on the proverbial AI bandwagon and add AI capabilities to their applications, it’s right to be concerned about the levels of robust design, learning, and testing being implemented in the rush. This is a complex domain and is rapidly becoming not just a new tool but also a new attack surface.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the ethical implications of AI pose a unique set of cybersecurity challenges. Issues such as biased algorithms and the misuse of AI for malicious purposes raise concerns about the potential for discrimination and privacy violations. Cybersecurity measures must not only focus on protecting AI systems from external threats but also address internal risks related to the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies.</p>
 Mitigating Risks 
<p>A bit like Isaac Asimov’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics">three laws of robotics</a>, we have the three Hs to manage the potential risks due to advanced AI systems – to be Helpful, Harmless, and Honest. For an enterprise looking to implement business, security, or automation AI-enhanced tools within their business, this boils down to asking where, in all of the interactions with the AI tool, can verification steps be added and what assurances can the vendor provide.</p>
<p>To mitigate these cybersecurity threats, organizations must adopt a multi-faceted approach based in the same core principles of Zero Trust, treating output from AIs as “Never Trust, Always Verify.” Establishing standardized best practices, sharing threat intelligence, and fostering an environment of continuous learning are essential components of a resilient cybersecurity ecosystem. Additionally, robust encryption and authentication mechanisms are essential to secure the communication channels between AI systems and prevent unauthorized access. Regular audits and vulnerability assessments should also be conducted to identify and address potential weaknesses in AI infrastructure.</p>
<p>When it comes to managing the ethics side, collaboration between the cybersecurity community, industry stakeholders, and policymakers is crucial to developing and implementing effective strategies against AI-related threats.</p>
<p>As AI continues to revolutionize industries and reshape the technological landscape, the importance of safeguarding these powerful systems from cybersecurity threats cannot be overstated. By maintaining core development principles and fostering collaboration, we can navigate the nexus of AI and cybersecurity to harness the full potential of artificial intelligence while minimizing the associated risks.</p>

<p>The European Digital Identity (EUDI), a cornerstone of the eIDAS regulation, represents a cross-border digital identity initiative set to revolutionise electronic identification in the EU. Available to all EU citizens, residents, and organisations, EUDI is designed to offer a unified, secure, and efficient method for online identity verification. Central to its functionality is the innovative EUDI Wallet, a sophisticated platform for electronic identification that digitally encapsulates individual identities. This wallet integrates various attributes and credentials, ensuring they are stored and managed with utmost security and respect for privacy. As an integral part of the EU digital identity and trust services framework, EUDI extends beyond the wallet, offering a comprehensive solution for digital identity management across the European Union.</p>
 Why is EUDI Needed? 
<p>Although the majority of countries within the EU have some form of national digital identity solution or eID, only 60% of citizens from 14 member states are able to use their eID in another state (cross-border). That leaves over 150 million people in the EU alone without access to strong cross-border authentication, and with only 14% of public service providers allowing cross-border authentication. Yet, 63% of EU citizens want a single eID for online services across the EU according to the Eurobarometer survey (<a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">EU Commission</a>). The EUDI will provide an EU-wide digital identity that will allow for cross-border trust service usage.</p>
 Key features of EUDI 
 User-Centric Control: 
<p>At the heart of the EUDI’s design is user-centric control, aligning with eIDAS principles. It empowers both individuals and businesses to manage their electronic identification and digital identity with autonomy. Users have the discretion to select the information they share, the entities they share it with, and the purposes for which it is used. This feature not only enhances user autonomy but also bolsters privacy protection within the digital ecosystem.</p>
 Interoperability: 
<p>EUDI exemplifies interoperability as envisaged in the EU digital identity framework. It offers a harmonised solution across the EU, enabling seamless cross-border access to digital services. An EUDI issued in any member state is recognised across all others, facilitating service access without the need for redundant verification. This interoperability is a significant step towards realising a cohesive digital Europe.</p>
 Security: 
<p>Security is a paramount feature of the EUDI, incorporating state-of-the-art encryption and authentication mechanisms. These technologies protect against identity theft, fraud, and other cyber threats, making EUDI a reliable and secure tool for electronic identification and online transactions.</p>
 Accessibility: 
<p>The EUDI champions digital inclusion, crafted to be accessible to everyone, including those with disabilities or limited access to technology. This inclusive approach is integral to the EU digital identity and trust services ethos, ensuring equal access to online services across all member states.</p>
 Expandability: 
<p>Designed to be versatile, the EUDI supports a wide array of applications, from basic online authentication to more complex uses like digital licenses and insurance. It even facilitates instant payments using the digital Euro, showcasing its adaptability to various digital identity needs and trust services within the EU framework.</p>
 Benefits of EUDI 
<p>The EUDI will be available for all EU citizens that are eligible for a national ID card and will be recognised across the EU. It will be a secure way to share information with services, allowing users to control how much information they want to share. The EUDI will be operated via digital wallets on mobile phones and other devices and will enable users to identify themselves both online and offline. The EUDI wallets will allow users to store and exchange government-provided data (i.e. name, date of birth and nationality), information provided by trusted private sources, and to use the information as confirmation of the right to reside, work, or study in a certain member state. It ultimately provides a cross-border digital identity that will benefit citizens across the EU.</p>
 Practical Uses of EUDI 
<p>There are a variety of key use cases that the EUDI can be used for, including public service applications and requests, opening bank accounts, tax returns and applications to universities, alongside proof of identity, storing medical prescriptions, and securing transactions. There are some use cases that underpin the development of the EUDI Wallet, to support meeting objectives.</p>
 Practical Example of EUDI Usage 
<p>Currently, opening a bank account involves multiple steps that may involve in-person meetings, signing paperwork and a tedious back and forth if any documents are missing. In addition, any cross-border banking is hampered by the lack of standard document formats, document coverage/accuracy and even simple language barriers. However, with the introduction of the EUDI a user would simply be able to respond to the bank’s request by selecting the required documents that are stored on their EUDI wallet, already in a standard format. These documents will then be sent securely to the bank as verifiable digital documents, for the bank to process and continue with the application.</p>
 The interplay between EUDI pilots and eIDAS Regulation 
<p>After a six-month delay, the EUDI pilots are now starting and will continue well into 2024. Unusually, the actual eIDAS legislation is still being developed at the same time, even as the pilots are running. In addition, there are two further parallel streams: writing of the standards and documenting the reference implementation. All four of these elements: legislation, standards, reference implementation and the pilots, are dependent on each other. The standards must comply with the law, the reference implementation needs to implement the standards, and the pilots should utilise the reference implementation. Ideally, feedback from the pilots should in turn guide the legislative process, closing the circle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This loop of interdependencies is caused both by the repeated delays in defining the base architecture and by the aggressive “Swiss knife” approach to the EUDI by the European Commission. What is often missed, however, is that the main hurdles regarding the whole EUDI project are not technical, or legal framework but political. The EUDI is designed to be much more than a simple mobile authenticator and therefore it must forge a compromise between 27 nation states from minute technical details to very profound decisions potentially affecting hundreds of millions of people – for example, whether to force every resident to adopt a persistent unique identifier.</p>
 The road to hell is paved with eternal secrets 
<p>When we think of strong digital identities, likely the first thing that we visualise is a unique identifier or a “name tag” that is then linked to a natural person for life. That is indeed one possible solution, but perhaps surprisingly there are alternative designs as well. The 27 EU member states have widely varying approaches. In some member states, one is automatically assigned a persistent unique identifier before leaving the maternity hospital. Elsewhere one will be assigned only in specific circumstances, while finally some member states do not assign such identifiers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On paper, having an identifier can simplify many governmental processes and ease digitalisation. However, its unchanging nature makes it very unwieldy in practice. The identifier will continue to exist, unchanged, for the lifetime of an individual. As the end users are required to use it to identify themselves in both on- and offline transactions, it becomes very challenging to simultaneously keep it secret for their entire lifetimes. The same applies to every private and public organisation who stores or processes it, and sadly it takes just a single data breach to lose control of it forever. In the age of pen and paper perhaps this was deemed a not so omnipresent threat. But as digitalisation marches on and KYC legislation spreads from finance to the hospitality industry and beyond, having copies made of one’s personal documents is turning from an exception to a standard policy. As it stands, the persistence and omnipresent use of the unique identifier leaves the unfortunate victims of identity theft with only bad options: either be on constant lookout for any misuse for life or go through the massive process of changing the identifier (if allowed by national legislation) and then getting every single document from one’s birth certificate to school records to work contracts changed to reflect the new identity.</p>
<p>Nothing is certain until the legislation is finalised, but currently it seems likely that the EUDI will controversially force everyone to adopt such an identifier yet seeks to bypass some of the shortcomings both via the magic of public key cryptography and by optionally allowing the creation of pseudonyms – aliases that only officials are able to link to an individual. For example, there could be a ‘healthcare me’, distinct from a ‘banking me’ and a ‘social media me’. Officials would be able to link all three together, but a cybercriminal or a data breach would be (hopefully) limited to an identity affecting a single sector. Of course, this is not a perfect solution, but it certainly is better than no solution.</p>
<p>Once again it should be emphasised that the 27 member nations have very differing opinions on how to best proceed and marking features as optional – like the pseudonyms mentioned above – is a well-known compromise when the standardising body cannot gather enough support to either include or exclude it from the core standards. Optional features rarely become universal, and worryingly it seems likely that any optional features of the EUDI will not be exceptions to this rule. Any optional features will be adopted by some of the member states, while others will decline to take them into use. This threatens the fragmentation of the whole European digital market from day one… which is exactly how the situation stands after eIDAS version 1, and what the EUDI is seeking to solve.</p>
<p>Controversies around the fundamental design principles highlight both the importance of the whole EUDI project, as well as how politically influenced or even driven any cross-border effort can be. It is wrong to say that international projects would be generally disadvantaged from intense debate though, as having over two dozen interest group opinions and different viewpoints is a tremendous advantage to any undertaking. The varied features and pilots of EUDI would not be possible if a single member state would have to carry all the burden by themselves.</p>

             November 2023   
	 
		 
			 Navigating the Booming Trend of Tokenized T-Bills&nbsp; 
 
<p>In recent weeks, the tokenization of Treasury bills (T-bills) has become a trending and popular topic, with on-chain data from our friends from RWA.xyz (see the chart below) revealing a total value of approximately $750 million and an average yield of 5.24%.&nbsp;This marks a remarkable 700% increase for the year, sparking market enthusiasm. However, it’s worth noting that the actual aggregate value of tokenized real-world assets, including T-bills, exceeds reported figures due to traditional players withholding on-chain data, indicating&nbsp;a larger market size than apparent.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>While it is fascinating to see the surging assets brought on-chain, a fundamental question arises:&nbsp;‘Why tokenize?’&nbsp;If the motivation behind tokenizing T-bills is solely market-driven, without added value, it won’t succeed in attracting traditional issuers and investors into the market.&nbsp;Traditional T-bills are already extremely accessible and liquid&nbsp;for US citizens. Individuals outside the US can easily purchase and sell T-bills ETF via fintechs or distributors.</p>
<p>The true value proposition of tokenized T-bills lies in transferability and interoperability,&nbsp;providing holders with unique utilities and automation beyond the scope of traditional forms. This encompasses the capacity for peer-to-peer transfers with eligible counterparts, trading across diverse platforms, utilizing them as collateral for borrowing, and staking to earn additional yields.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>To access these advantages,&nbsp;issuers need control to enforce compliance at the token level, requiring sophisticated smart contracts. Basic standards like ERC20 and ERC721 (NFT) are inadequate, as they are inherently permissionless, allowing unrestricted transfers. This limits issuers to conducting KYC only during the onboarding and redeeming process, with intermittent actions going uncontrollable by issuers.</p>
<p>Hence, the issuance of tokenized T-bills must adopt&nbsp;permissioned token standards such as ERC3643. This enables tokens to embed data and compliance rules&nbsp;to ensure compliant automation, transfers, and interactions throughout the entire token lifecycle while enabling issuers to obtain controls.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Having successfully supported clients in tokenizing T-bills and money market funds through the ERC3643 standard, we’re here to assist if you’re contemplating a similar issuance with a turnkey and white-label solution.</p>

<p></p><p>It was Friday night in New Orleans, and I was ready to kick off the weekend in true local style with a drink. I ordered my favorite wine on a food delivery app, but before the sale could be finalized, the wine store needed to verify my age. Seamlessly, they connected to my digital <a href="https://lawallet.com/">LA Wallet</a>, and without sharing any extra details, my wallet confirmed I was 21+. Within 30 minutes, I was sipping my wine, in awe of the blend of tradition and cutting-edge technology - technology that I'm fortunate to work on, and also enjoy the convenience of.</p> LA Wallet<a title="Direct link to LA Wallet">​</a> <p>Louisiana leads the way with its fully operational mobile driver's license (mDL) system. In the Big Easy, where I live, we go with the flow - meaning you never know what your day may entail. In such a culture, I've really enjoyed the convience of having things like my driver's license and COVID vaccination cards readily available on a mobile app for whenever I may need them.</p><p>Recognized legally as an equalivalent to physical identification, LA Wallet is my go-to for age-restricted purchases/entry, voting, and (heaven forbid) police encounters.  Because of this, the mDL ensures legal compliance and security while leveraging the convenience and accessibility of mobile technology. They accomplish this by using Verifiable Credentials.</p> Verifiable Credentials<a title="Direct link to Verifiable Credentials">​</a> <p>In the simplest terms, <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/verifiable-credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a> are digital versions of traditional documents like driver's licenses, passports, or university degrees. But they're more than just digital copies; they're secured with encryption, making them tamper-evident and instantly verifiable.</p><p>When the store connected to my LA Wallet, it wasn't just pulling up a digital version of my driver's license. Instead, the app used a Verifiable Credential – a piece of digital data that proves certain information about me without revealing everything. In this case, it confirmed that I am over the age of 21. The beauty of this system is in its respect for privacy; it didn't disclose my exact age, or any other personal detail that would be available had I shared my full driver's license.</p><p>Once my age was verified, the vendor allowed the purchase, and the delivery proceeded as planned. The entire process was seamless, fast, and respectful of my privacy. This is particularly interesting in my scenario where there's likely legal responsibilities for the delivery company as well as the wine vendor to verify my age. My mDL is a trusted source that can provide this proof to all of the involved parties without sharing all of my details.</p><p>This experience is a prime example of how Verifiable Credentials can simplify and secure everyday transactions. As we move more into the digital realm, the need for secure, private, and efficient verification methods becomes increasingly crucial. Verifiable Credentials meet these needs by offering a way to share necessary information without over-sharing.</p><p>The use of Verifiable Credentials is set to expand in various sectors, from healthcare to finance. As technology continues to evolve, it's exciting to see how innovations like Verifiable Credentials are making our digital lives more convenient and secure. It's not just about the technology; it's about how it enhances our daily experiences, one verification at a time.</p>

   The blog post discusses Federated Identity and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), comparing the two architectures. Functionally, there's a lot in common. Technically, not so much. Read on to learn more!

<p>Understanding federated identity and how it compares to self-sovereign identity (SSI) requires a basic understanding of when, where, and how digital identities are used online today. There is no “one size fits all,” though passionate proponents of various technologies may beg to differ. Alas, the world is not that simple: Different use cases drive different architectures and prioritize different technologies. That makes for quite a bit of confusion and a rather long blog post.</p>



 Why the confusion? 



<p>One question you might ask is, why is there so much confusion, anyway? The terms don’t look anything alike, so surely they must be entirely different things! Well, no, not at a functional level. (The technology stacks used to support that functionality differ, but we’ll discuss that later.)</p>



<p>First, let’s recognize that not everyone even likes the term SSI. It’s unclear whether digital wallet technologies fall under this category; some people say they do, others don’t. Other people are immediately turned off by how early proponents of SSI focused almost exclusively on blockchain technology. For the sake of this post, know that I’m coming at this from the perspective of SSI as an architecture that encompasses a user-centric focus for digital identity credentials. YMMV.</p>



<p>Both Federated Identity and SSI models support similar (but not wholly overlapping) use cases. For example, both models can support remote identification, authentication, and/or authorization to online services. Both require an entity that holds the source records, issues credentials, and supports the possibility of a third party using those credentials. It’s also possible (but rarely implemented in the Federated Identity model) that the person engaged in the transaction has some control over what exactly is shared with the third party requesting the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But wait, there’s more!&nbsp;</p>



 Discovery 



<p>In both models, there is also the requirement that an individual be able to make some choices about what credential they want to use. Within Federated Identity, that means being able to pick the identity provider (IdP) from a list or type an identifier for it into a dialog box. In the SSI model, that means being able to pick from a list of locally stored credentials OR picking the correct container (aka, the digital wallet) used to store the appropriate credentials.</p>



<p>If this sounds like a UX nightmare, it is. Federated identity has been used in production environments for decades, and they still haven’t definitively solved what’s referred to as “the discovery problem.” In the research and education sector, for example, a single relying party (RP) might need to offer a choice of nearly 6,000 IdPs for the user to select from. The SSI model is realizing the same pain now, exacerbated by the desire not to let any third party know more information than they absolutely have to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, there is just enough functional similarity to make things interesting when talking about these two architectures. Some might even say that SSI is just another flavor of Federated Identity (note: that way lies madness). Now, let’s talk about some of the differences.</p>



 Federated Identity 



<p>What use cases drive decisions toward one model and not the other? Well, for one thing, it provides the company that operates the IdP control over the authentication process and the information shared during the transaction. In the case of an enterprise organization, that makes a lot of sense. Authentication and authorization in this use case is by, for, and about an individual as they relate to a company. It’s not about the individual’s private information; it’s the data about them as associated with and owned by the enterprise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s all a question of functional requirements. The technology stacks, however, are quite different. When talking about federated identity models, protocols like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.onelogin.com/learn/saml">Security Assertion Markup Language</a>&nbsp;(SAML),&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/openid-connect-protocol">OpenID Connect</a>&nbsp;are what describe (and constrain) everything including the claims, the assertions used, the structure of the attributes shared, the way identity provider discovery is handled, and more. A great deal of control is given to both the RP and the IdP, and there is a coarse level of control for the individual (generally in the form of “you can either choose to log in or not, but you aren’t guaranteed control over what information is shared as a result”).</p>



 SSI 



<p>The SSI model is a very different beast in the underlying assumptions, protocols, and architecture used. The most important entity involved in any transaction is the individual, aka the user (not my favorite term, but it’s pretty common in the documentation). The individual decides what information is shared and with whom. In a typical use case, when an individual uses a credential in an SSI model, nothing reports back to the issuing authority that lets them track what the individual is doing with their credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ideally, the individual has discrete control over every bit of information in their credential. In fact, the protocols are being designed to ensure a minimum of information is shared in an identity transaction. For example, when a third party asks for verification that the individual is over 55, all they should get in return is a ‘yes’ or ‘no.’ They should not get the date of birth, home address, a photo, and whether the individual has chosen to donate organs upon death: the information shared when presenting a physical US driver’s license to verify age. Another name for this is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dock.io/post/selective-disclosure">selective disclosure</a>.</p>



<p>When considering the protocols, SAML (as far as I know) will never properly fit in an SSI world. OAuth and OpenID Connect may, and there’s work in progress to make that happen (check out&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OpenID for Verifiable Credentials</a>&nbsp;if you want to know more). Work is also underway regarding the credential itself, most notably the W3C’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/vc/">Verifiable Credential</a>&nbsp;efforts, the&nbsp;<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">IETF’s SD-JWT specification</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ul.com/resources/new-isoiec-standard-electronic-credentials">ISO’s mdocs</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 New Solutions 



<p>The good news is that, as one likes to see when it comes to evolving technologies, SSI is helping solve some of the challenges that traditional Federated Identity models weren’t able (or chose not to for reasons that made sense at the time) to support. I already mentioned selective disclosure. SSI models have this as a fundamental requirement of the technology, not just something that an IdP might implement on behalf of its users but rarely under the control of its users. Big privacy win here!</p>



<p>Another possibility in this brave new world is cross-device support. Rather than a password that has to be memorized and/or copied over to multiple devices (for example), a credential that lives on one mobile device can be used in an authentication or authorization process on another device, like a desktop or tablet. (I will note that this may fall under the category of “just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.” There will be a LOT of different types of credentials, even identity-focused ones, available to the individual. They are not all designed with authentication in mind.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>That said, when a credential is designed for authentication and authorization AND moves us away from relying on passwords, it is really a Very Good Thing.&nbsp;</p>



 New Problems 



<p>Sign me up! Let’s do it! Rah Rah, go, team!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Or, maybe not quite yet, because new challenges must be addressed before people decide to jump on the SSI bandwagon.</p>



<p>For one thing, the UX challenges are pretty significant. The technologies under development to move ahead in an SSI model support more than just identity. They also support payment systems, transportation tickets, library cards, insurance cards, hotel keys, car keys – the list goes on. It’s one thing to compare this model as similar to having all these cards in a physical wallet, but there comes the point where there are too many cards for me to find the right one when I need it. Surely, a computer can search for the one I need, right? Right?</p>



<p>Well, not yet. This is where the privacy considerations make usability that much harder. Credentials are often stored in a digital wallet, and that wallet protects the credentials from any random request. Arguably, the wallet shouldn’t have anything to do with the credentials it holds any more than a physical wallet has anything to do with the cards it holds. Just to make sure we’re maxing out on the potential for complexity here, there may be more than one wallet holding various credentials!&nbsp;</p>



 More New Problems 



<p>Not everyone wants to live in a paternalistic nation-state that assumes people are unlikely to make good choices and protects their population by restricting various freedoms and technical innovations. That said, not everyone wants to live in a completely libertarian environment that leaves individuals responsible for their actions, whether or not the ramifications of those actions are clear. Trying to find the compromise in the middle usually involves some level of transparency and accountability so that it’s possible to verify all parties did the right thing as defined by contract or law.</p>



<p>That’s not too hard in a traditional Federated Identity system. The IdP has logs of transactions. The RP has logs, too. The only entity that (probably) doesn’t have logs is the individual (although the IdP and the RP sometimes make their logs visible to the user). With two out of three parties having info on what happened, cross-checking becomes possible if something goes to court.</p>



<p>However, In an SSI model, the entity that issues the credential knows that it issued it. When it comes to the credentials being used, however, they (in some implementations) don’t know anything – on purpose. The RP (aka, the Verifier) may only know a potentially small subset of information that doesn’t identify the individual at all. Whether the individual (or the device or application holding their credential) has a transaction log is still under debate and may be an implementation detail. Some developers may implement one (and get yelled at regarding the privacy implications), and some may not (and get yelled at for not supporting accountability and transparency).&nbsp;</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>The functionality of Federated Identity and SSI architectures is similar if you tilt your head just right. Both serve to support remote authentication and authorization. Both have one party responsible for creating the digital identity credential, another party expected to consume it, and an individual (and their devices) instigating the transaction in the first place.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The technical decisions that inform the protocols and subsequent implementations, however, are where the designs quickly divide. While no one wants to support more identity systems than is necessary; the traditional Federated Identity model and the newer SSI architecture are not mutually exclusive. They just focus on solving different problems.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It doesn’t help that SSI technologies are very young and under active debate and development. The technology you see right now is not fully baked, and it still needs to grow to solve everything technologists hope it will. Of course, you can wait for that and ask someone to let you know when it’s all resolved. Or, as always, my preferred option: you can get involved in the discussions to ensure you help guide these technologies’ development and deployment.</p>

 DF62 Completes and DF63 Launches. Predictoor DF is&nbsp;here  Stakers can claim DF62 rewards. DF63 runs Nov 16 — Nov 23,&nbsp;2023  1. Overview <p>Data Farming Round 62 (DF62) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 100K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Nov 9, 2023 and ended 12:01am Nov 16. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>“<a href="https://medium.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">DF Main is Here”</a> is a self-contained description of DF. It’s up-to-date with weekly OCEAN budget allocations and how rewards are computed.</p><p>“<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa">Predictoor Data Farming</a>” is a new Ocean incentives program that amplifies predictoors’ earnings, via 37K OCEAN + 100K ROSE (≈$22K USD) in weekly extra sales to Predictoor data feeds [1].

DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has three substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and earn.<br>– Challenge DF. Accurately predict future ETH price; rewards are a function of prediction accuracy.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are four ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), Challenge DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF.

Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF63 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 100,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% except what Challenge DF gets = 37,000 OCEAN + 100k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% except what Challenge DF gets = 37,000 OCEAN<br>– Challenge DF. 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  You can read the details for how Predictoor DF Reward Amounts work&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#58d9">here</a>.  <p>Challenge DF rewards parameters:</p>  Submission deadline: Wednesday at 23:59 UTC when the DF round finishes.  Prediction at times: Thursday at 00:05 UTC, 00:10,&nbsp;…, 1:00 (12 predictions total)  The contestant with lowest error gets 2,500 OCEAN reward. 2nd-lowest gets 1,500 OCEAN. 3rd-lowest gets 1,000&nbsp;OCEAN.  Further parameters are in “<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Introducing Challenge DF</a>” blog post, and the Challenge DF README (linked from&nbsp;post).  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams.

 Although financial promotion rules are nothing new for the UK’s financial services industry, when it comes to crypto, there appears to be confusion over what is and what isn’t allowed, and who the new rules actually apply to. Our Global Head of Crypto and FinTech, Jason Tucker-Feltham explains all. 



 



<p><br>Within just 24 hours of the <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/">Financial Conduct Authority</a> (FCA) releasing its<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/fca-issues-146-alerts-first-24-hours-new-crypto-marketing-regime#"> financial promotions regime</a> for the crypto industry, it had issued 146 alerts of unregulated crypto firms illegally promoting crypto assets in the UK.</p>



<p>While these startling high numbers could be interpreted as a reflection of the FCA’s commitment to safeguarding consumers and fostering a responsible crypto industry amidst ongoing regulatory developments, it also showcases how unprepared the UK’s crypto industry is. Or, at the very least, how difficult the FCA registration process for crypto firms can be.&nbsp;</p>



 What is a financial promotion? 



<p>According to <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/8/section/21">Section 21</a> of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, a financial promotion refers to “an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity, communicated by a person in the course of business.”</p>



<p>In other words, financial promotions are advertisements or other promotional materials used by financial firms to market their products to consumers. Financial promotions can be disseminated via newspapers, mailings, product brochures, social media platforms (remember the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-183/"> Kim Kardashian scandal for touting crypto in 2022?</a>), websites, in fact, any medium if they include an invitation or incentive targeting consumer credit activity.</p>



<p>The FCA regulates the conduct of nearly 50,000 firms to ensure the fairness, honesty, and competitiveness of the UK’s financial markets. According to the <a href="https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/">FCA Handbook</a>, all financial promotions must be clearly identifiable, accurate, balanced, and not misleading. Promotions must explicitly mention prominent risk warnings and must not contain inappropriate incentives. Since financial promotions by firms can influence a consumer’s decision when choosing a financial product or service, they must comply with specific FCA rules. Firms must also, of course, be registered with the FCA.</p>



<p>The fact that the FCA had to issue so many alerts on the first day of the new regime emphasizes its vigilant approach to crypto asset promotions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, it’s not only the UK that has measures in place to protect consumers from unregulated entities. The <a href="https://www.sec.gov/">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC) regulates financial promotions in the US, while in Canada, the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency.html">Financial Consumer Agency of Canada</a> protects the rights of consumers of financial products and services.&nbsp;</p>



 Financial promotion punishments. 



<p>So, what punishment awaits the 146 companies that broke the rules on the very first day of the regime? Well, as per the FCA Handbook, anyone committing a financial promotion criminal offense may face up to two years of imprisonment and an unlimited fine. The FCA will assess the severity of the breach to determine the appropriate penalty level, which ranges from Level 1 to Level 5.</p>



<p>Crypto firms in the UK have been aware of the upcoming rules, and the potential repercussions of sending out financial promotions for quite a while. In 2022, there were <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/annual-reports/annual-report-2022-23.pdf">1,882 warnings issued</a>, marking a 34% increase from the previous year. As a result, 8,582 financial promotions were amended or withdrawn, which was 14x more than observed in 2021. Financial promotion rules are nothing new for the UK financial services industry.</p>



 Riding the wave of crypto. 



<p>The rise of crypto and <a href="https://crypto.com/university/bull-vs-bear-market-difference">extreme market cycles</a> have resulted in many wondering if they too could benefit financially from investing in crypto assets. Recent reports suggest there are as many as <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/newsroom/press-releases/crypto-wealth-report-2023#:~:text=There%20are%2088%2C200%20crypto%20millionaires,investment%20migration%20specialists%20Henley%20%26%20Partners.">88,200 crypto millionaires</a>, including some fairytale stories of people amassing their wealth by investing very small amounts. However, the sheer number of <a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/cryptocurrency/articles/heres-how-many-crypto-coins-failed-last-year/#:~:text=How%20many%20cryptocurrencies%20have%20failed,to%20fail%20than%20new%20ones.">cryptocurrencies that have ceased to exist</a> is less highlighted, and as a result, many people’s investments have just been completely wiped out. As such, the financial promotions regulation seeks to protect the most vulnerable, especially from influential celebrity endorsements.</p>



<p>In March 2023, the SEC charged eight celebrities, with some of the most notable examples including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/mar/22/sec-sues-celebrities-cryptocurrencies-lindsay-lohan-tron">Lindsay Lohan and Jake Paul</a>, for failing to mention that they were partaking in a paid promotion.</p>



 UK’s proposed crypto regime. 



<p>The addition of crypto to the UK’s financial promotion regime marks a step toward a full <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">crypto regulatory framework</a>. Much like its European equivalent, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">MiCA</a> (Markets in Crypto Assets), a core aim of the UK’s proposed crypto regime will be to protect retail investors.</p>



<p>The UK’s proposed crypto regime is expected to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/british-crypto-balancing-act/">take effect</a> in 2024, and crypto firms wishing to operate in the UK must register with the FCA and adhere to its regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The government’s proposed <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653bd1a180884d0013f71cca/Future_financial_services_regulatory_regime_for_cryptoassets_RESPONSE.pdf">changes</a> for crypto firms include the following:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/01/britain-sets-out-plans-to-regulate-crypto-industry-in-wake-of-ftx-collapse.html">Establishing</a> a world-first system for crypto lending<br>  Introducing new regulations to safeguard consumers from market manipulation<br>  Enforcing a market abuse system for cryptocurrency trading<br>  Requiring crypto exchanges to have clear and detailed requirements for admission criteria<br>  Mandating disclosures for new crypto assets<br>  Offering a 24-hour <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/letter-to-cryptoasset-firms-financial-promotions-regime.pdf">cooling-off</a> period for new investors<br>  Banning referral bonuses  



<p>The FCA will regulate crypto firms under the current <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/finalised-guidance/fg23-3.pdf">promotions</a> law, which is expected to protect consumers from misleading or inappropriate crypto <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/documents/cryptoasset-registration-flowchart.pdf">promotions</a>. The FCA’s rules for marketing crypto assets include the following:</p>



  Advertisements must be transparent, fair, not misleading  



  Crypto asset firms must ensure consumers have the necessary understanding and expertise to invest in crypto<br>  Crypto promotions must establish clear risk warnings  



 Weighing the benefits and drawbacks of the new regulations. 



<p>These new crypto regulations will prevent users from being exposed to unregulated platforms and crypto scams like the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/11/09/ftx-takes-its-place-among-historys-most-infamous-financial-scandals/">FTX scandal</a>, which involved the collapse of a crypto exchange, in November 2022. The collapse was due to a liquidity crisis that revealed an US$8 billion hole in company accounts.</p>



<p>Of course, a potential drawback of the financial promotions regime is that only firms registered with the FCA or partnered with someone registered by the FCA will be able to operate in the UK, which may pose a barrier to entry for firms. This is because becoming FCA-<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/cryptoassets-aml-ctf-regime/registering">registered</a> in order to comply with the financial promotions regime could prove costly, not to mention time-consuming. Registering as a crypto asset firm falls into <a href="https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/FEES/3/Annex1A.html">Category 6</a> of the FCA’s pricing categories, meaning that firms currently have to pay at least £10,000 to register. The FCA also imposes an annual fee following authorization.</p>



 Promoting crypto in the UK? 



<p>The recent publication of the UK’s revised ‘<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-crypto-regulatory-regime/">Future financial services regulatory regime for crypto assets</a>’ marks a crucial advancement in the nation’s journey towards cryptocurrency regulation. The document, released by HM Treasury, outlines the present regulatory framework for crypto assets, definitions of different kinds of crypto assets, and a proposed policy approach to introducing crypto asset activities under the UK’s regulatory boundaries. As of April 2023, the FCA had registered just <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/business-plans/2023-24">41</a> crypto asset firms under its AML regime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Balanced regulation that ensures consumer safety while maintaining an attractive marketplace for crypto firms is crucial, especially to fully realize the UK government’s aims to become a major crypto hub.</p>



 Putting the KYC into crypto. 



<p>While <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">KYC processes</a> are an integral part in ensuring crypto exchanges can protect themselves and their customers from fraud and money laundering, they are also a requirement to be able to comply with FCA requirements. Having these controls in place will protect investors from financial losses and add stability to a notoriously volatile market.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>We often think about our personal identities when we think of verifiable identifiers and verifiable credentials. We think of things like personal credentials, mobile driver’s licenses, or professional accreditations. But what about using the same tools and principles when it comes to managing the identity of an organization? How do the same tools and principles apply when managing the identity of an organization? Is it easier or more challenging to implement these concepts for organizational identities compared to personal ones? And importantly, what are the implications and impacts of effectively managing organizational identity?</p>
<p>In this podcast conversation with Lance Byrd, we delve into these questions, exploring the nuances and potential of organizational identity in the digital age.</p>
<p>Lance has been closely involved with the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (<a href="https://www.gleif.org/">GLEIF</a>), an initiative born out of the 2008 financial crisis. GLEIF’s primary mission is to foster a transparent global system for identifying legal entities, known as the Legal Entity Identifier (<a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/about-lei/introducing-the-legal-entity-identifier-lei">LEI</a>). This system is crucial for enhancing transparency in organizational identities, which is essential for effective regulation and risk assessment. More recently, GLEIF has focused on expanding the LEI’s utility by transforming it into a verifiable credential, termed the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei">vLEI</a>. This discussion with Lance taps into various use cases, frameworks, and insights from GLEIF, providing a deeper understanding of the complexities and significance of organisational identity.</p>
<p>In our conversation, I was particularly intrigued by Lance’s insights on the contrast between administrative and cryptographic trust. Administrative roots of trust, which are widespread in our daily lives, often lead to persistent cybersecurity challenges. Lance elaborated on how cryptographic roots of trust offer more secure and dependable methods for identity verification. We delved into real-world scenarios, including the recent MGM/Okta cyberattack, to illustrate these concepts.</p>
<p>This discussion was enlightening, and it felt like we could easily spend many more hours exploring this topic. There might be more on this in 2024! I hope you find this podcast episode as engaging and informative as I did.</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Lance and I in this podcast include:</p>
 
 Differences Between Personal and Organizational Identity: We explored the unique challenges and political concerns surrounding personal identity, contrasting them with the complexities yet seemingly smoother processes in organizational identity. 
 Legal and Privacy Concerns in Identity Management: The discussion highlighted how legal structures and privacy concerns shape the management of both personal and organizational identities, with a special focus on GDPR and its implications. 
 Governance and Trust in Organizational Identity: The conversation shifted to the role of governance and trust in shaping organizational identity, using examples like the EU Banking Authority to illustrate these concepts. 
 Integrity of Signatures and Cybersecurity: We discussed the critical importance of signature integrity in preventing cybersecurity attacks, examining recent incidents like the MGM Okta attack. 
 Security Mechanisms and Key Rotation: The podcast touched upon the importance of security mechanisms like key rotation in enhancing digital security, differentiating it from traditional password changes. 
 The Interplay of Security Features and User Experience: We delved into how user experience and design play a crucial role in the adoption of security technologies, balancing ease of use with robust security measures. 
 Differences in UX Between Consumer and Organizational Contexts: The discussion concluded with an examination of the varying approaches to user experience in consumer versus organizational settings, and the challenges in changing consumer behaviour regarding privacy and security.

<p>We frequently use the word “identity” when we don’t really mean it. We frame digital identity solutions around proving who you are or proving who someone is.</p>
<p>But IRL we rarely want to know who someone else really is (and from the personal perspective, we rarely want to reveal who we really are).</p>
<p>The fact is, we do not routinely ask “Who are you?” not with any seriousness anyway. “Who you are” is just vernacular, or shorthand. And it stands for something that is very different from identity.</p>
<p>In business and administration, we are always much more precise about what we really want to know about the other party.</p>
<p>Two parties always go into a transaction with a clear idea of what they need to know about each other and what they are going to have to prove about themselves.</p>
<p>These are known unknowns. In the case of business applications, the unknowns are defined when the systems are designed (typical examples are usernames, legal names, account numbers, licence numbers, government IDs and device serial numbers). And there are recognised sources or systems from which pertinent information originates, together with conventions and mechanisms for telling if the information is reliable.</p>
<p>In general, “digital identity” should not be the question. When we design a transaction system, we should start by asking What Do We Really Need To Know about each party. And the answer should include the all-important metadata that confirms the information is fit for purpose.</p>

<p>If you were present for CEO Boris Mann's presentation at the PL Summit, you heard the alpha on Everywhere Computer. Yes, that's right. After several years of being deep in the protocol mines, Fission is thrilled to launch our first product! </p>IPVM Protocol | Everywhere Computer | Homestar Mascot<p>We've shared several exciting announcements over the past few months, so let's break them down in full context now.</p><p>IPVM is the open source protocol that powers Everywhere Computer.</p><p>Homestar is the individual node that makes up the network (similar to how IPFS Kubo, Iroh, Nabu, or other implementation nodes make up the IPFS network). It's written in Rust, and is designed for performance and composability.</p><p>Everywhere Computer is Fission's platform: a branded and supported distribution that bundles Homestar + control panel, a function &amp; workflow marketplace, and managed compute resources.</p>Slide from Boris Mann's PL Summit 2023 Presentation Writing Wasm Functions  <p>Today we've got a few sample functions to test the network, with Rust → Wasm being the happy path. We'll have some tooling and examples for JavaScript → Wasm soon.</p><p>Like NPM providing a library of functions that developers use to quickly write applications, Everywhere Computer's directory will lead to re-use of serverless functions. UCAN can be used to gate access to functions, or specific communities or companies can federate their own set of functions for internal usage only, or to share with everyone.</p> Goodbye Cloud, Hello Crowd <p>As an application developer you can take advantage of Everywhere Computer's Wasm functions to replace backend functions in a serverless style. You're not locked into any one cloud provider's serverless stack, and can pick functions from the directory rather than needing to write them from scratch.</p><p>Additionally, not every job needs to go to the cloud. Many jobs can be done locally on an application's clients desktops and browsers. Every compute cycle that gets done locally is one that you don't need to pay for in the cloud.</p><p>When it's time to scale up, you can utilize Everywhere Computer's distributed network to orchestrate jobs along the parameters you've set, allowing it to utilize whichever platforms are most efficient. Everywhere Computer never locks you into any subscription. You pay when you compute, so you never worry about getting locked into one provider. </p><p>This means your job could run on your desktop, Homestar nodes in your community network, or managed compute services from Fission and other compute providers.</p> What's Coming Next - Future Plans <p>Speaking of writing functions and workflows, one of the things we'll be exploring is to fix some of the issues with directories where developers don't get directly compensated even though potentially 10s of millions of applications use their libraries. We will look to support development of high quality, performant, and maintained functions by having compute providers pay the developers who write them.</p><p>Don't have a Wasm-compatible function but still want to connect to Everywhere Computer, taking advantage of its distributed and interoperable network? If your service is <a href="https://ucan.xyz/">UCAN</a>-enabled, you will soon be able to plug it in, introducing new functionality to the entire network. As has always been the plan, UCAN's capabilities model provides a flexible IAM-like backbone that can connect the open web, rather than locked to one cloud provider.</p> <p>We are so excited to share <a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Everywhere Computer</a> with you. If you'd like to join the early access beta, please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfREjmoTBOW2gyUSFypn3omifibvptH0K_IQwtFWiGORU5vAQ/viewform">complete this form</a>. We're looking for enthusiast hackers &amp; node hosts, function writers, and compute providers.</p><p>If you'd like to learn more about the underlying IPVM protocol, you can join the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg">IPVM Working Group</a>.</p>

 <p>Een consument doet op de website een aanvraag voor een lening, en krijgt direct uitsluitsel of de aanvraag geaccepteerd wordt of (nog) niet. Oftewel; volledig STP (Straight Through Processing) accepteren, het kan!</p> 
 <p>Dat was de afdronk van de rondetafel die we organiseerden in samenwerking met iLoan. Het onderwerp: "STP Acceptatie: Hoe bereik je dit in overeenstemming met de regels".</p> 
 <p>In de consumptief krediet sector worden daar snel grote stappen gezet. Uiteraard binnen de kaders van het Keurmerk Private Lease en de VFN gedragscode.</p> 
 <p>Tijdens de rondetafel deelden we met 20+ experts van de grootste consumptief krediet- en private lease-organisaties in Nederland tips, ervaringen en inzichten die we samen met <a href="https://www.iloan.nl/">iLoan</a> en klanten zoals <a href="https://ockto.eu/kennisbank/praktijkcase-toyota-louwman-financial-services">Toyota Louwman Financial Services</a> hebben opgedaan.</p> 
  10 inzichten over STP accepteren  
 <br> 
   
   Volledig STP werken is mogelijk - voor zowel private lease als huurkoop/consumptief krediet.<br><br>  
   100% STP betekent ruim 300 businessrules die akkoord zijn; op basis van Keurmerk Private Lease of de VFN leennormen.<br><br>  
   Een lager percentage STP betekent nog steeds veel efficiency omdat de Loan Officer/Acceptant nog maar op enkel van de ruim 300 checks een oordeel hoeft te geven (in plaats van op allemaal).  
   De normen geven nog een behoorlijke interpretatieruimte; enerzijds een kans, anderzijds ook onderwerp van in- en externe discussie.<br><br>  
   Zorg dat je 'audit trail' op orde is: doe A/B-testing met een x-aantal dossiers waarbij je de consument eerst accepteert op basis van documenten, en vervolgens met (enkel) brondata &amp; banktransacties.<br><br>  
   Gebruik die testen om business rules te finetunen, om interne goedkeuring te krijgen én een goedkeurend knikje van de toezichthouder.<br><br>  
   Volume en continue verbeteren is key: dit spel krijg je niet op orde met tientallen dossiers. Er moet veel volume/data door het proces omdat je dan onderscheid zult zien in de verscheidene 'persona's': een groep die makkelijk als STP is te definiëren, kansrijke 'oranje' aanvragen en de 'hard-rode' gevallen. Met continu verbeteren stel je doorlopend de engine bij, en zorg je ook voor draagvalk bij de loan officers/acceptanten.<br><br>  
   De loan officers/acceptanten zijn wellicht wel de belangrijkste stakeholders: zij moeten vertrouwen krijgen in het digitale proces en ook vertrouwen dat (bijvoorbeeld) 296 businessrules al automatisch gecontroleerd zijn en zij enkel de nog resterende 4 oranje velden checken. Bezuinigen op FTE kan een doel zijn, maar veel partijen focussen juist op STP van de massa om de loan officers/acceptanten vooral in te zetten op enkel de oranje posten én om meer volume aan te kunnen zonder afhankelijkheid van meer handen.<br><br>  
   Er is sterke behoefte aan een ketenoplossing zoals bijvoorbeeld gebruikt wordt in de hypotheeksector (<a href="https://ockto.eu/ockto-brondata-service">Ockto Brondata Service</a>): adviseur/dealer laat een Ockto sessie doen, Ockto slaat deze max. 90 dagen op, kredietverstrekker krijgt sleutel mee bij de aanvraag en kan met eigen datafilter toegang krijgen tot de initiële brondataset van de betreffende consument. (Er zijn ontwikkelingen op die gebied met diverse partijen).<br><br>  
   En last but not least: er blijkt veel behoefte te zijn om periodiek gezamenlijk te sparren over dit onderwerp. Als ketenpartners gezamenlijk tot oplossingen komen op gedeelde uitdagingen, dan is dat winst voor iedereen én hoeft het concurrentieel voor- en nadeel daar niet meer over te gaan. Plus kunnen er in de normenkaders ook sneller verbeteringen worden doorgevoerd.

<p>Onboarding and offboarding employees to your IT systems is like an intricate dance — it can either be a graceful waltz or an out-of-sync electric slide. In this post, we’ll talk about four potential trip-ups when thinking about employee access management. We’ll also show you practical steps you can take today to streamline onboarding and offboarding. Let’s take it for a spin!&nbsp;</p>
 Using a tool that’s too big (or too small) 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Imagine trying to dance the tango in tap shoes or attempting a waltz in hiking boots. Similarly, using tools that are either too complex or too basic can throw off the entire rhythm of your onboarding and offboarding dance.</p>
<p>With advanced providers like Okta, for example, you have to configure SAML, SCIM, and JIT to authenticate and manage users. This is known as <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/the-history-of-sso-and-why-its-time-for-a-change/">the SSO tax</a> and can mean a lot of work on technology that you might not really need yet. On the other hand, people who try to manage the process with Jira tickets or Notion/Docs, often forget to track and update things.</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>Find a tool that’s your perfect dance partner — one that adapts to your rhythm by helping you accomplish what you need to get done today and grows with you. Instead of taking an over-comprehensive approach to SSO that may overwhelm customers and inflate costs, focus on the tasks you face today — the stuff you just need to work and to be secure. And with the right tool, you can actually set yourself up for success by <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/tips-for-building-effective-iam-processes-at-your-startup/">creating good processes from the beginning</a>, which will help you scale as your business expands.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">YeshID Onboard</a> provides an option for smaller companies that have embarked on their identity and access management journeys but aren’t in a place yet where they need a very technical (or expensive) solution. It’s also free for now (<a href="https://yeshid.com/post/why-are-we-giving-yeshid-onboard-away-for-free/">find out why</a>).</p>
 Trying to do it all yourself 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Picture a solo dancer trying to cover the entire stage – it might look impressive, but the risk of exhaustion and missteps is high. If you’re the Google Admin for your small startup or company, odds are you’re an overachiever, but stretching yourself too thin can have negative effects on your work and your health.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>Enter your dance ensemble – your application administrators. Delegating tasks during the onboarding and offboarding performance lightens the load and ensures a smoother routine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Onboard, you can assign an admin to each app your company uses, then automatically route requests for provisioning to the proper admins. We also help you empower employees to initiate requests for new application access, which can also be routed to the proper application administrator.</p>
<p>In this way, automation becomes your dance partner, stepping in to handle repetitive tasks while you take center stage. Things like customizable templates, task assignments, and email notification not only help you save time but also minimize the chances of errors.&nbsp;</p>
 Putting off best practices until “later”&nbsp; 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Delaying the incorporation of best practices is akin to attempting a complicated dance routine without rehearsal – it leads to chaos and missteps. Maybe it’s too expensive to manage right now — time or budget wise — but what you end up with is a messy company footprint and opening yourself to security risks.</p>
<p><a href="https://yeshid.com/post/right-sized-onboarding-and-offboarding-free-for-the-first-100-signups/">Onboarding and offboarding tools have overlooked the middle of the marke</a>t. There are plenty of smaller businesses that want to easily manage their processes now while setting up good practices for tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>We created YeshID Onboard because we saw that gap. Specifically for 50-250 people, Onboard provides an option for smaller companies that have embarked on their identity and access management journeys but aren’t in a place yet where they need a very technical (or expensive) solution. We provide a quick and easy way to accomplish your checklist today while setting up the foundational best practices that will help you grow in the future.</p>
 Only focusing on onboarding, not offboarding 
<p>The misstep</p>
<p>Different industries have specific compliance and regulatory requirements that must be met during onboarding and offboarding. Handling third-party data can be scary and requires robust security measures. And focusing solely on onboarding is like nailing the first half of a dance and forgetting the finale. Onboarding is about efficiency, but offboarding is both a security and compliance requirement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The right step</p>
<p>Your onboarding solution should comply with data protection regulations and keep your data safe. Ideally, you should be able to track provisioning/deprovisioning in a single dashboard to offboard a user with confidence while maintaining compliance and reducing license costs. This is another area where your Product Administrators can play back-up dancers, ensuring a seamless transition.&nbsp;</p>
 Let’s dance 
<p>In the dance of onboarding and offboarding, perfecting each step is essential for a harmonious performance. Choose tools that dance to your rhythm, build a team of Product Administrators as your dance ensemble, kick off best practices from the first note, and never forget the importance of the grand finale – offboarding.&nbsp;</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Oscar Santolalla: On this episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity we are joined by Gautam Hazari, from Sekura.ID as we discuss what is the missing Identity layer of the Internet. Stay tuned to find out more.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar: Hello and thank you for joining us, a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. Today’s guest is Gautam Hazari. He is a mobile identity guru, a technology enthusiast, artificial intelligence expert and futurist. And he is the CTO of Sekura.id, the global leader in mobile identity services. Gautam led the implementation of the mobile identity initiative Mobile Connect for around 60 mobile operators across 30 countries. He has also been an advisor to startups in Digital Identity, healthcare, the Internet of Things and fraud and security management. Hello, Gautam.</p>
<p>Gautam Hazari: Hi, Oscar. How are you?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good, happy to have you here in the show.</p>
<p>Gautam: My pleasure. Thanks.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s going to be super interesting. Now, we are focusing on mobile – mobile initiatives, like the one you are working with, can help us to solve the identity problems we usually discuss in this show.</p>
<p>First of all, I would like to hear a bit more about yourself. So, if you can tell us your journey to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Gautam: Sure. Thanks, Oscar. I have been in the identity space for quite some time now. And it started in the telecom world and that’s why I talk about mobile identity a lot. So I spent many years of my life in the telecom, so I worked with the Vodafone group for nearly 14, 15 years. What I realised is that there is one thing that the mobile operators have done quite efficiently is solving what I call the identity crisis of the internet. I started to talk about it quite passionately in different forms.</p>
<p>And in 2013, end of 2013, GSMA approached me. GSMA as you know is the GSM Association which is the trade organisation for the mobile operators. So the GSMA board was discussing that there were some assets within the mobile operators which can actually help in solving the identity crisis in the internet. Then they approached me that, “Hey, you were talking about this identity thing for quite some time, do you want to come and join?” And that’s when I joined GSMA to do the initiative for mobile operators to solve the identity crisis of the internet.</p>
<p>Then I led the technology for what was known and still known as Mobile Connect Initiative. I was the Chief Architect for Mobile Connect. And then me and my team created the reference architecture, the specification. And then of course, that’s not enough, so I went around the world, worked with the mobile operators to implement it as well. You know, at that time, there were around 62 mobile operators around the world who implemented it. And they did very passionately and this is where I met some of the founders, Mark and Keiron, in GSMA, working with the same team. And then I’m taking that journey forward in a much more accelerated and commercial way in Sekura.id.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. Well, definitely a lot of your journey is in identity already and mostly in mobile, as you said. Before we start going to what you are doing in Sekura.id and we definitely want to hear more about that. I know that you have a special experience which is you have even a TEDx talk. So if you can tell us a bit of that experience.</p>
<p>Gautam: Yeah. Thanks, Oscar. It has been a fascinating experience actually, while preparing for the TEDx talk and also after that. So I was invited to do this TEDx talk to share my vision and dream of a world without passwords. I have been talking about these things passionately and that’s kind of my personal journey has been as well.</p>
<p>So, I had a lot of learning, you have to compact all that you want to talk within 18 minutes and that’s very interesting, right? If you have a free floating, I mean I’m really, really passionate about this identity thing, I can keep talking for days. But if you need to give your message within 18 minutes that’s quite interesting. So I learned how to deliver the message in that concise way.</p>
<p>And after delivering that, and once the TED organisation published the video in their YouTube. Interestingly, they didn’t actually remove any part of that, generally they do some editing but they didn’t do that for me. I’m really thankful to TED on that. So it happened end of last year. It’s been just one year completed and it has been viewed more than 157,000 times. And I have been receiving some very, very interesting messages from all around the world. From identity enthusiasts to security specialist, and also, from general public as well, saying that awareness is important. And we are having some inertia, right? We have been using passwords since, you know, 1961 actually, even before the internet was invented in 1989. But we don’t actually think that we are actually using it, and the complication that it brings too. I have been fortunate enough to hear lots of personal stories as well. These viewers, they have been sharing their personal stories related to passwords, and discussing what is the solution that can actually solve this.</p>
<p>Yeah, so it has been a fascinating experience and I’m really, really thankful for all the viewers who have been watching it and also most importantly, interacting with it and sharing their stories.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, excellent. Yeah, I also watched and as you said, the way you explained also definitely appeals to the general audience which is of course what mostly TEDx is about, reaching wider audiences. So it’s definitely a good job you have done there. And I am happy to hear also that there have been a lot of conversation because that’s also important that people not only hear the stories or the ideas but also get involved in, spreading those problems, sharing their own pains, et cetera.</p>
<p>Gautam: Thanks, Oscar.</p>
<p>Oscar: I also know that you have written, of course, you write blogs, particularly, I read the you talk about the missing identity layer of the internet, missing identity layer of the internet. Could you tell us what is that?</p>
<p>Gautam: Yeah, absolutely, Oscar. I mean it’s extremely important that we acknowledge and realise that. Let me go back to when the internet was invented, right? Let’s face it, the internet was never designed to identify the human users. It was designed to identify the computers, right? That’s why there are IP addresses. Fortunately, or unfortunately, we humans don’t have IP addresses.</p>
<p>So, in the initial days of the internet, if you remember, all we used to do in the internet was browsing, right? We used to browse AOL, we used to browse Yahoo, different stories within Yahoo. So, it did not matter if for me, Gautam, is browsing AOL or Yahoo, or it’s Oscar browsing, or there’s fraudster who is browsing, right?&nbsp; Because all we did was browsing the internet. Yes, the returning user needed to be identified, not as Oscar or Gautam but whoever was browsing, right? So that’s why cookies were invented just to provide a continuity of the experience, right?</p>
<p>But then we started to do interesting things on the internet. We started to do commerce on the internet. We started to look for things on eBay and started to pay for those things. We started to do banking on the internet. We started to interact in the social media in the internet. And then it did matter whether it’s me, Gautam, doing that commerce transaction, whether it’s me, Gautam, who is doing that banking transaction or it’s you, Oscar, or it’s the fraudster. Or, in the current days, if it is that AI chatbot who is doing that transaction, right?</p>
<p>Internet was not designed to do that. Internet did not have that identity layer. So what did we do? We created a trustless model. So, if I want to pay for some things that I found on eBay, or if I want to do a banking transaction, my bank will say, “Hey, you cannot do that, because I don’t trust you. First, I’m challenging you to prove that you are Gautam.” That’s what we created, because the internet didn’t have that identity layer.</p>
<p>So how did that challenge happen? And they initially did this, this challenge happened in the form of user ID and password, right? And again, we all aware of all the complications related to password from convenience to security, right? Then we said, “Hey, passwords are not enough. Let’s add other things.” So, we started to talk about MFA, Multi-factor authentication, we added SMS OTP, right? And again, OTP, the last P is about password, right? Just changing the acronym doesn’t change the problem.</p>
<p>But then again, they said, “OK, maybe that’s not enough. Let’s add the biometrics on top.” But again conceptually what we are doing is, we are creating a trustless model where these services are challenging me and the human user to identify myself, right? And whenever the human user is involving in providing a response to the challenge, for example in form of I need to type back the password, or I need to provide back the OTP, however I give, whether by typing back the OTP or some auto read happens. Or even if I do this, let’s say, biometrics in the form of facial recognition and so on, I, as a user, is the weakest link in the chain. I do something wrong, which is perfectly fine because me, as a user, is not a security architect. As a normal user, I am not aware of all those security complications that can go away, right? And that’s where all the problems that you have seen and again, why? Because the internet was not designed to identify this human user. Internet never have the identity layer. It still doesn’t have.</p>
<p>But we almost ignored the fact that almost at a similar time, there was a parallel internet that was getting created. So, as you know, I’m actually using the world wide web as synonym to internet, so when I say internet, it’s actually the world wide web, right? So, 1989, this wed, world wide web or internet as we call it was invented. In 1991, there was a parallel internet that was created. And we never call it the internet, we call it the mobile network, right? The first SIM-based GSM mobile network was used in 1991. And that parallel internet worked completely differently.</p>
<p>So, as we discussed, in the traditional internet, if I want to do any interaction, where I, as a human user, needs to be identified, I’ll be challenged, right? My bank will challenge me, my social media will challenge me, my e-commerce provider will challenge me, even my grocery store, online store will challenge me, right? But this parallel internet, which we call mobile network, worked completely differently, still works differently.</p>
<p>If I need to make a phone call, receive a phone call, send an SMS, receive an SMS, it doesn’t challenge me. My mobile network doesn’t say that “Hey, I don’t trust you. First, you prove that you are Gautam, then only you can make a phone call.” It doesn’t work that way. It just knows that it’s me, who is Gautam. So how did they do that? They actually created this identity layer. They actually created a mechanism which identifies this human user from day one, since 1991.</p>
<p>But we know this. How did they do that? They did that using this small gadget that we always carry in our mobile phone, this is the SIM. We almost forget that I, in the SIM, stands for identity. It’s Subscriber Identity Module. SIM was created to solve this identity problem in that parallel internet, which we call the mobile network, right?</p>
<p>So, isn’t that a solution? We were just ignoring it and also, just unfortunately, these mobile operators knowingly or unknowingly, kept this with themselves, right? What we are doing at Sekura.id, I’ll just mention here, that we are bringing in that identity layer from this parallel internet which we call the mobile network into this traditional internet so that we actually solve the fundamental problem rather than keep creating technologies on top like password, like SMS OTPs, like biometrics. And that is what will solve the problem from its root and bringing in an identity layer from this parallel internet to the traditional internet.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you for the explanation, of the lacking, missing identity layer of the internet. And then you put a parallel, I haven’t thought of it in that way, the parallel of the mobile network which always had this identifier of the subscriber. As you say, even in the term it’s subscribe, the SIM card. So, I understand that Sekura.id solution is primarily based on the SIM card. Tell us a bit more how it works and if you can give also how it works, Sekura.id besides being based on the SIM card.</p>
<p>Gautam: Sure. So, GSMA doing this Mobile Connect, the conceptual idea was very similar, right? It’s to utilise the assets from the mobile operators, not just the SIM card. SIM card is a cryptographic engine. But there’s a lot of data available with the mobile operators which can help to identify the human user without challenging them. &nbsp;And also, protect them without putting a hurdle for the user, like what user ID, password, OTPs or biometrics are. They are hurdles, right? They are actually saying, “Hey, you cannot access the service until you pass that hurdle.”</p>
<p>This is where Mobile Connect started and this is the journey that we are continuing in Sekular.id as well. So, in Sekular.id, what we do is, as I say, the SIM is a cryptographic engine. And now, in the digital world, there is realisation that all the different, let’s say, identification and authentication methods where the user is actively involved, which means the user is challenged to prove who they are, or authenticate themselves, that is a limitation. A limitation in the form of that you know, if let’s say the user has got an OTP they have received, these fraudsters will always call this user and say, “Hey, I’m calling from your bank, or I’m calling from the government, you have received an OTP, can you hand it over, right?” If the user is not involved, right, these fraudsters can call the user but they have nothing to handover. So in that case, we solved this problem of all the fraudulent activities that’s going on.</p>
<p>So now, there is a realisation in the digital world as I was seeing that we need to avoid involving the user. So we need to do passive authentication. And how do we do that? Cryptographic authentication is one way to do. So, Apple last year in WWDC announced these passkeys which is basically based on the FIDO, the Fast Identity Online mechanism, where this is reliance on cryptography and cryptographic key on the device. And then that’s how we identify the user, right?</p>
<p>But exactly same mechanism is what happens in the SIM. And it is happening for the last 30 years. There is a cryptographic key which sits in the SIM which the user is not even aware of. And that’s an important thing. The user is not aware. As soon as the user is aware, or the user is involved in that awareness, OK, all these problems will happen because these fraudsters will approach the user and try to do some funny things, right?</p>
<p>And that’s another aspect that we say that here, this cryptography is humanised. If the user is not involved, it just happens behind the scene. In that case, this technology is humanised. Invisibility is more humanised. Steve Jobs used to say that technology should either be beautiful or it should be invisible. So here, this technology is invisible so that makes it much more humanised, right?</p>
<p>So, at Sekura, we’re utilising this cryptography in the SIM to seamlessly, invisibly authenticate this user. At the same time, there are a lot of what we call signals associated with the SIM which can help protect the user, at the same time, identify the user. For example, one of the largest fraud happening in the digital space right now is SIM swap fraud, right?</p>
<p>If we can identify that hey, is there a recent SIM swap happen? By recent, I mean in the last few hours, for example, to one day. If there is a SIM swap happen, in that case, that’s a red flag, that might mean that the user who is in the transaction process, who is interacting with the digital service may not be the genuine user, it could be a fraudster who have got access to the phone number of the user and using their own SIM. That’s one data signal that’s there in the mobile, with the mobile operator, that doesn’t need to involve the user to ask if something has happened or not.</p>
<p>Similarly, setting up a call redirect, right? The fraudsters can actually setup a call redirect for my number calling up the operator, doing some mechanism, some process there where they can say, “Hey, I have lost my phone, or I left my phone at my home and I’m expecting an urgent call from my family who is in the hospital. Can you please redirect all the calls to my number to this?” If I can convince the operator, in that case what will happen is, all calls, SMSs will be redirected or forwarded to me as a fraudster, right? So, if we can actually identify, is their call forward active for this number? That data itself can protect the user, again, without involving the user. So, we have identified 66 such potential data signals which can invisibly protect the user and their identity. And that’s what we do at Sekura, working primarily with the mobile operators.</p>
<p>Oscar: I like the idea of this invisibility because from the beginning you started that the human side is going to make security fail, right? But if the human doesn’t have to be involved, yeah, I’m sure, there will be less hacking. So that is definitely the concept, it’s very interesting.</p>
<p>Gautam: And just to add there, Oscar, you know, of course, there is this identity protection, there is this authentication without involving the user. That element is there. At the same time, it is allowing these good guys to access the service, right? So, as I was giving that example, it’s me, right? I’m not the fraudster. It’s me who wants to pay a particular merchant online, right? And I’m assuming I’m the good guy, right? And I want to pay. In that case, there shouldn’t be a barrier for me, right? And it’s good for the business because the business will get me to pay them. That’s what they want, right? So, in that case, it’s important that the good guys should sail through, right? For them, there is no barrier.</p>
<p>If we make it invisible for the user, in that case, these good guys can actually access, you know, without any trouble. At the same time, because it’s invisible, we can actually protect this user behind the scene as well. What does that mean is – it’s not just helping out with the identity verification, security and authentication, it’s also getting better business. Because if we put barrier to the good customers, good users, in that case, there are dropouts happen.</p>
<p>We have been told by our clients all around the world that on an average globally 20% of the users dropout due to all these, let’s say, challenges. They say, “Hey, I’m not going to use it.” SMS OTP is needed to do our transaction or to pay and OTP doesn’t get delivered or it is delayed, the user say, “Hey, I’m not going to pay now, right?” So that will direct 20% on an average globally, dropouts happen.</p>
<p>Here, if you make it invisible, you don’t have any dropouts, right? Because there are no barriers. There is no door which is closed that needs to be opened. So, in that case, the businesses get 20% more conversion, so that’s more business, more revenue. So that element is also there, if you make is invisible using the mobile operator’s asset like the SIM and all the data. That needs to be considered as well alongside security.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what if, myself as a normal user, I want to try Sekura.id, how can I use it already? There might be some services which is already available?</p>
<p>Gautam: Yeah, absolutely, Oscar. So one element here is you know as you can understand, this is B2B service, right? So the businesses are using us. Businesses are protecting that. All our services are, you know, they go through one single API, right? So, it’s not the user who is accessing our services directly. As I was giving the example, I, as a user, accessing my banking service, right? And my banking service is using the Sekura.id services through the API, right? So that’s how I, as a user, as a consumer use it. Not directly through Sekura, through my services. And then again, I may not be even aware that that service is getting used, right? Because this service, as I said, for the human user it’s invisible.</p>
<p>So majority of our clients right now are mostly from the financial services, so the major banks in the UK, they are using our one or more of the services like Barclays is using our services, Virgin Money is using our services. In the US as well, Morgan Stanley, they are using our services, Flora Bank, they are using our services.</p>
<p>But again, just to reiterate, it’s not a B2C service, right? So it’s not that me, as a consumer, is using the Sekular.id services. It’s my business who is using the service to help me as a user getting protected. And at the same time, no buyer has been put by the businesses to access it. And we are actually expanding globally. As I mentioned to you earlier, I was in India, I came back yesterday, we are actually launching in there. We have some very, very exciting discussions happened across the use cases there, not just in the financial sector, beyond as well. And then we will be announcing those pretty soon.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK,as soon as they are launched, it will be interesting to know what are these use cases. So, very interesting initiative that you have in Sekura.id. So what happens for instance if – because this depends on people having good mobile networks and good phones, so what happens if that’s not available in some regions in the world?</p>
<p>Gautam: That’s a very important question you ask, right? And there are two elements you said, one is good mobile phone. One of the thing that we really passionately believe in Sekura is inclusiveness. And that’s very important for us. We have a mission statement for identity for all and everything. So no one should be excluded from identity protection, right? And this is why we tackle it from multiple angles.</p>
<p>So for example, we have platform that we have created from ground up based on all our learning from the GSMA and also my learning from Vodafone. That platform can integrate with any mobile operator in the world, right? Because all mobile operators are different. There are 700 plus mobile operators there. Right now, we are connected to around 75 mobile operators globally and we want to connect to all. Why? Because we don’t want any operators to be excluded because if we exclude that, their consumers or their users will be excluded.</p>
<p>So, one example is in India, one of the phone smallest operator is BSNL, right? It’s government-owned operator. They are quite small. They don’t have platform. And they were actually not included in this identity space. So what we have done is we have provided our platform to them so that, that platform can actually connect to that mobile operator and then it can actually expose their services, right? So that we don’t want to exclude their users.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is important, as you rightly asked. What happens if I don’t have a good phone? So, this is where the principle that we use in all our services has got two major aspects. One, I already talked about – not involving the user because if you don’t involve the user, we increase the security, because user is the weakest link, right? And rightly so. And the second thing is not depending on the mobile device, because that’s extremely critical. Because let’s say, if the user can afford an iPhone 15 right? Of course, that’s extremely secure. The key chain there where the keys are stored is a hardware, right? That’s an HSN. So, it will be extremely secure.</p>
<p>But what about the user in let’s say Southeast Asia or in Sub-Saharan Africa where it’s a sub $10 phone? That may not have that much security. So, it’s unfair on the user because they cannot be pay for that advanced phone, they are getting excluded from security and identity verification. At the same time, it is unfair on the businesses, they cannot rely on a security because the user cannot afford that high end phone.</p>
<p>That’s why that’s the principle we use. We don’t rely on the mobile device. What do we rely on? The SIM. The exact same SIM is in the iPhone 15 or any of the high-end devices or in the low-end, not so expensive phone and provides the exact same security, right? The cryptographic security that I talked about doesn’t differentiate whether it’s a very high-end, expensive phone or not so expensive, much simpler phone. So that’s an important element here, right? So, our services don’t rely on the device. It doesn’t matter what device the user is using.</p>
<p>Secondly, all the data elements that I talked about is in the mobile network. This is completely independent of what device it is. So that way as well, all those data elements that I talked about, all those 66 potential data elements are independent of the device. So, that’s how we use the service and then make it inclusive end to end, for any user, right?</p>
<p>The other thing you asked about is what if there is no mobile network? It doesn’t really matter. So, the way to look into this thing is, we are relying on the mobile network. But the user doesn’t have to use the mobile device even at that moment of time for majority of the services. For the authentication services, the mobile device need to be in the network. But again, if the mobile device is not in the mobile network, it is connected to Wi-Fi or any other networks, in that case, we have fall back mechanism because we cannot really, rely on the mobile network because the device is connected to Wi-Fi, still we have a fallback mechanism.</p>
<p>And in some regions, like in US, we have worked with one of the large mobile operator there. Where we have worked with them to utilise the SIM, even if the device is connected to Wi-Fi. Because even if the mobile device is not connected to the mobile network, still there is a SIM there, right? If you can reach out to the SIM, we protect the device anyway.</p>
<p>And the other thing I was talking about, all these 66 potential data signals, they are available at the mobile operator’s secure CRMs, CVM and all the OSS, BSS system, right? So they don’t need the user to be using the mobile device at that moment of time. For example, if there is a SIM swap that has happened in the last few hours, the mobile operators databases, they already are aware of that even if there is no network. So, all our services other than the authentication service which we call SAFr Auth, all our services are data-related or signal-related services where these businesses, let’s say, this is a bank or an e-commerce provider or even a social media provider, their server makes the API call to our platform to get this data signal. So the mobile device is not involved, mobile network is not also involved there. Because again, we want that inclusivity for every user to be involved in there.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK. Well, definitely very novel way of addressing these problems. So I’d like to ask you one final question, Gautam, for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Gautam: Thanks a lot Oscar for asking that. The most important thing to add into their agenda is an acknowledgement that the internet doesn’t have that identity layer. Because that’s a fundamental problem. Because if we start to add technologies on top to fill the gap, that will not solve the problem. And we have seen over the years, right? We have seen user ID password, they didn’t solve that, SMS OTP or any form of OTP, they didn’t solve that. Then we added all sorts of other OTPs, right? TOTPs, authenticated apps, we even used those RSA tokens that we used to carry on. Then we evolved into biometrics. And by the way, biometrics, I’m sure your audience is aware of this, after Generative AI, every form of biometrics is challenged.</p>
<p>And then actually, you know, interestingly, LexisNexis, which is one of the largest fraud management provider on app based in US, their CEO of the government affairs came to the press. This person gave an interview to Fox News in June, saying that we are so much relying on these biometrics and after Generative AI revolution, there is a financial impact in the industry and then that impact is around 1 Trillion USD because every form of biometric is challenged through this Generative AI. Not just through deep fake, through all sorts of mechanism. I mean you can actually search the internet on those kind of fraudulent activities happening on almost a weekly basis.</p>
<p>So, let’s acknowledge that there is a fundamental issue with the internet and that’s no one’s fault because internet was not designed for that. If you acknowledge that, then we can solve the fundamental problem, right? And that can be done through the already existing identity layer which is existing in the mobile operators. Let’s work through that and solve the problem forever.</p>
<p>So, basically, what I am saying is, let’s bring in that identity layer from that parallel internet which we call mobile internet into the traditional internet. And let’s solve that problem at the root. And that’s what we are doing in Sekura.id. And that’s what we would invite all the leaders in the digital space to look into and solve the problem.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you very much, Gautam, for this very insightful conversation. And let us know if people would like to find more about you on the net, what are the best ways for that?</p>
<p>Gautam: Thanks a lot, Oscar. Thanks for inviting me. I am on LinkedIn. Please connect to me. It’s Gautam Hazari, G-A-U-T-A-M H-A-Z-A-R-I. If you Google me, you will find me there as well. And also, please visit Sekura.id, S-E-K-U-R-A.ID. You will find insightful solutions there and also we post lots of insightful stories, articles, blogs and what the future is looking like. Recently, one of my article is published in Forbes, I’m calling it Internet of Thoughts, where the future is coming and where, if you don’t solve this identity crisis in the internet it may create more issues. So, please reach out. Please look into Sekura.id and let’s solve this identity crisis together.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, of course. Again, thank you very much Gautam for this conversation, and all the best.</p>
<p>Gautam: Thank you very much Oscar for having me.</p>

<p>Exactly one year ago, on November 16, 2022, the first post on Bluesky was created:</p>

The first post on Bluesky.
<p>Fast forward a year later, and we’ve just crossed two million users after opening the app to users around February. We’re excited to continue growing a truly open social network.</p>
 Toward Federation 
<p>Imagine you’ve just spent 10 years building your audience and making friends on a social platform, only to decide that it’s no longer for you. When you leave this platform, you’re essentially leaving behind all of your relationships, your saved posts, and more.</p>
<p>We’ve been there too, and we’re similarly tired of packing our bags each time another platform winds down and everyone collectively moves to the next big thing. Signing up for a new social network every few years and losing all our data on former ones shouldn’t be the price that we have to pay in order to keep our relationships online.</p>
<p>That’s why our biggest priority right now is launching federation, which is <a href="https://atproto.com/blog/2023-protocol-roadmap">timelined</a> for early next year. This is one of the core features of Bluesky that makes it “billionaire-proof” — you’ll always have the freedom to choose (and to exit) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms. And wherever you go, your friends and relationships will be there too.</p>
 A Public Network 

<p>More exciting news: around the end of this month, we’ll release a public web interface. With this, you’ll be able to view posts on Bluesky without being logged in on an account.</p>
<p>This will make posts on Bluesky much more accessible, which will be especially useful for real-time commentary and breaking news.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Bluesky is a public social network, so your posts, likes, etc. have always been publicly accessible through the API. We designed Bluesky with the openness of the internet in mind, and you can think of your profile as a blog on the internet. To read more about data privacy on Bluesky, here’s our <a href="https://blueskyweb.xyz/blog/5-19-2023-user-faq">user FAQ</a>.</p>
 Other Updates 
<p>In between all of the above, we’ve also shipped some much-requested features, including:</p>
 
 Mobile push notifications: receive notifications on your phone 
 General user lists: add users to shareable lists and see their posts in one feed 
 Email verification: verify your account email for added security 
 Advanced feed and thread preferences: sort replies by time, likes, or randomly; see replies from your follows first; show/hide replies or quote posts in your feeds, and more 
 Media tab for user profiles: easily find and see the photos that a user has posted 
 A Likes tab on your own profile: see all your liked posts in one place 
 Improved startup and loading time: reduces the time spent loading the app 
 Suggested follows: get recommended follows based on each user 
 Accessibility improvements: improvements to alt text, component labels, screen flashing, and more 
 
<p>And there’s much more to come — join us for the ride! See you on <a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a>!</p>

  <p>Fraud is a major cost to businesses worldwide. Banking, finance, payment services, and retail are some of the most frequent targets of fraudsters. However, insurance, gaming, telecommunications, health care, cryptocurrency exchanges, government assistance agencies, travel and hospitality, and real estate are increasingly targeted as cybercriminals have realized that most online services trade in monetary equivalents. After years of being the focus of cybercriminals, banking and financial institutions are more likely to be better secured than other industries, meaning that fraudsters are increasingly likely to attack any potentially lucrative target if given the opportunity. Fraud perpetrators are continually diversifying and innovating their Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).</p>
<p>The most prevalent types of fraud businesses, non-profit organizations, and government agencies experience today are:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Account Takeover (ATO) Fraud - occurs when fraudsters use breached passwords, phishing, social engineering and credential stuffing attacks to execute unauthorized transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Account Opening (AO) Fraud – also called New Account Fraud or Synthetic Fraud, often happens as a result of using stolen identities or assemblages of personal information to create synthetic digital IDs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this session we will provide an overview of Fraud Reduction Intelligence Platforms and show the highlights of our latest research in this area.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/technology-powers-fraud-prevention-cre23"></a>

  <p>Most contemporary digital identity discussions deserve another label: They are mostly about electronic trust ecosystems, considering all kinds of attributes beyond just pure identity. Additionally, nowadays they include natural persons, legal entities and (internet of) things. Everyone seems to agree the future is decentralized and all this only works with these curious wallets. Andre Kudra takes us on a journey through electronic trust ecosystems, diving into questions like: Which ones do we already have today? Some are successful, others not – why? Regulators are on it, too: What will eIDAS 2.0 and the EUDIW bring? What’s in the pipeline in other parts of the world? Will organizational digital identity (ODI) now invoke the breakthrough of decentralized identity overall? Why is decentralized identity the only way for Zero Trust Architectures which deserve the name?</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/electronic-trust-ecosystems-cre23"></a>

  <p>The realm of cloud security has been extensively covered in books and articles, yet a crucial aspect remains ripe for exploration. It revolves around the fundamental understanding of what your cloud service provider offers and, equally vital, where your responsibilities lie in the realm of cloud security.</p>
<p><br> When embarking on the journey of adopting a cloud service, the foremost question to answer is, "What aspects of security do I need to oversee?" In a traditional on-premises setting, roles are distinct: IT manages infrastructure, information and cybersecurity handles security, and application developers bear the responsibility for code integrity. However, the landscape is evolving, with many organizations embracing DevOps, where these responsibilities are often shared, and the lines between development and operations blur or vanish.</p>
<p>Regardless of organizational structure, the majority of security obligations reside within your company's domain when you use an on-prem environment. Transitioning from an on-premises environment to a cloud environment presents one of the most intricate challenges—a more intricate shared responsibility model for security.</p>
<p>In the context of cloud security, two paramount concerns need close attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first is the risk of misconfiguration. In a cloud environment, misconfigurations can inadvertently expose sensitive data and vulnerabilities, underscoring the critical importance of ensuring that cloud services and resources are set up correctly to mitigate such risks.</p>
<p>The second concern is insider attacks. Cloud users often lack influence over the staff of cloud service providers, making it essential to consider the possibility of insider threats. While cloud service providers typically promise robust security measures in place, it's crucial for organizations to implement their own layers of security to safeguard against insider attacks and unauthorized access, fortifying the shared responsibility model in the cloud.</p>
<p>In my presentation, I will delve into these intricacies, providing valuable insights and real-world examples of what your cloud service provider can do, irrespective of your specific needs and/or preferences.</p>

  <p>The 2023 Cybersecurity Workforce Study identifies a daunting 4 million-person workforce gap. This shortfall in qualified candidates hampers industry growth. To tackle this challenge, the industry must broaden its recruitment scope, targeting individuals with potential to learn, including those from diverse backgrounds like business, arts, or engineering. Cultivating entry-level opportunities for students, young professionals, and career changers is vital for industry expansion. However, assessing cybersecurity aptitude in candidates without direct experience poses a challenge. Traditionally, the industry has lacked accessible entry points for newcomers. In this presentation, ISC2's CEO, Clar Rosso, advocates for a clear and adaptable pathway to cybersecurity careers, offering data-driven insights and strategies to ignite recruitment efforts and welcome new talent into the field.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/global-cybersecurity-workforce-gap-cre23"></a>

This discussion begins by delineating the critical components of software supply chains and the potential risks associated with each link—from development and deployment to maintenance and decommissioning.</p>
<p>Key to establishing a chain of confidence is the adoption of transparent processes and tools that provide verifiable evidence of security at each step. The audience will be introduced to Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), cryptographic signing, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines fortified with automated security checks.</p>
<p>The talk will also consider the human aspect, emphasizing the need for cultivating a culture of security awareness and collaboration among stakeholders. This includes not only developers and security professionals but also suppliers, distributors, and end-users.<br>Finally, the talk will provide actionable insights and strategies for organizations to audit, monitor, and continuously improve their software supply chains.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/chain-of-confidence-cre23"></a>

<p>A couple of years ago, I published a blog post <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/11/aes-turns-20/">AES Turns 20</a>, celebrating the 20th year since the trusted symmetric algorithm was approved by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In the article, I dug into post-quantum and how Lov Grover’s quadratic speed-up algorithm might be applied to brute force attacks on symmetric algorithms. NIST’s position on this remains unchanged; symmetric algorithms such as AES 192 and AES 256 bit are good for the next couple of decades. The general recommendation persists: Anything with less than 112 bits of classical security should not be used. If there are any doubts, consider doubling the key length if you are using shorter bit lengths.</p>
<p>It got me thinking about the post-quantum threats being discussed and the Harvest Now, Decrypt Later attack frequently mentioned on technology websites and cited by some of my colleagues. I decided a blog post was in order to investigate a bit further. My colleague Dave Butcher, Technical Sales Consultant, is as passionate about PQ as I am, and I enlisted him to discuss the topic in more detail and exchange ideas.</p>
<p>First, a quick recap on what is meant by Harvest Now, Decrypt Later. The attack assumes that classical encryption techniques applied to data today, to make it unreadable and unusable, will in the future be vulnerable to attack from post-quantum computers. They will be able to crack the hard math problems that today’s computers would take in some cases hundreds and even thousands of years to solve. So, the idea is bad actors and nation-states will intercept and steal (harvest) data. They’ll then store it and wait until quantum computers are capable of crunching the numbers and decrypting the data to make it readable.</p>
 Data In Motion With TLS 
<p>Some of you might be thinking that most data at rest is encrypted using symmetric algorithms like AES, so surely we are in decent shape and this isn’t a real threat? I initially jumped to the same conclusion and then realized it is a bit more nuanced. Data at rest is typically encrypted using symmetric algorithms like AES and should be resilient to Harvest Now, Decrypt Later attacks. However, data is typically transported to a location before it comes to rest using network switches, routers, load balancers, etc. And this is where is gets a bit more nuanced. As data is moved around on the internet, a range of communication protocols are in play. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the de facto protocol in use on the Internet securing HTTPS web pages, email, WhatsApp, and a myriad of other applications. To establish a secure connection between a client and server the TLS handshake is invoked:</p>
 
 The client sends a Hello message detailing the TLS version being used and available cipher suite. 
 The server responds back with their Hello message confirming TLS version and cipher suite followed by the server’s certificate, which includes the public key of the server’s asymmetric key pair. 
 This is then used in a key exchange where a symmetric-based session key is encrypted and sent to the server using the server’s public key. 
 
<p>The server now has the same symmetric encryption key as the client – this is a pre-requisite for symmetric encryption. A secure bi-direction channel is now established between client and server and data can be efficiently encrypted, transported, and stored at its final destination.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The main takeaway here is the session key is based on a symmetric algorithm, which is the most efficient way to encrypt bulk data – asymmetric algorithms are not efficient at<br>
encrypting bulk data. Based on current NIST recommendations, as long as the symmetric key is a decent length of bits it’ll be resistant to a PQ attack. However, the asymmetric public/private keys used in the key exchange step are most likely using RSA- or elliptic-curve-based cryptography. These are the classical asymmetric algorithms that Peter Shor identified in the late 1990s as being vulnerable to being compromised by a quantum computer. It is unlikely that state-sponsored actors will be targeting data stored at rest; instead they’ll be targeting data in transit armed with the knowledge that asymmetric keys are used in the key exchange process. If they can intercept that transaction and store it away while biding their time, then in the future they’ll be able to use a quantum computer to factorize the asymmetric key pair, allowing them to expose the symmetric key and thus decrypt the data. Voila!</p>
 Actionable Steps to Mitigate Against Harvest Now, Decrypt Later 
<p>So, Harvest Now, Decrypt Later is a valid concern for organizations who store long-term encrypted data. What steps should you be taking to mitigate such attacks?</p>
 
 Start using longer symmetric key lengths. This is likely an easy change as AES with a 256-bit key has been part of the AES standard from the beginning. Most TLS services rely on standard TLS implementations that include configurable cipher suites. Changing to a longer key length is likely as easy as updating a configuration file and restarting a service. Many other tools you are using may also have this option. 
 Consider adding protection to communication paths that move high-value data to prevent Harvest Now, Decrypt Later later attacks. For example, there are VPN implementations (e.g. Open Quantum Safe’s OpenVPN project) that have been built using newer quantum-resistant cryptography. These are not fully standardized, but when you control both ends of a communication path (for example, between a branch location and headquarters) utilizing a non-standard protocol is not an issue. 
 Think about using pre-shared keys for certain interactions where you share symmetric encryption keys out of band, such as by exchanging physical media. This eliminates the asymmetric key exchange that is vulnerable to quantum computers. 
 Understand if there are already quantum-resistant versions of the protocol that you are using that you could migrate to today. For example, the <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/pqxdh/#introduction">Signal messaging protocol</a> has been updated to be quantum-resistant. Consider becoming a first adopter. 
 Prioritize crypto-agility within your organization. Planning and building crypto-agility are going to be key to adopting quantum-safe cryptography. While this does not fix the problem today, it puts your organization in the best position to quickly adopt post-quantum cryptography as it becomes available and minimize the vulnerability window for Harvest Now, Decrypt Later. 
 
<p>One of the tools that can help you plan is Mosca’s Theorem. Understanding how long your data needs to be secure is key to prioritizing projects to mitigate Harvest Now, Decrypt Later. Data that has fleeting value is probably not at high risk for Harvest Now, Decrypt Later. Data whose value remains high even as time begins to approach the advent of cryptographically relevant quantum computers needs to be a priority for secondary protection. Mosca’s Theorem is discussed in more detail in an earlier blog post, <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2021/07/a-bridge-to-post-quantum-cryptography/">A Bridge to Post-Quantum Cryptography</a>.</p>
 The PQC Elephant in the Room 
<p>The elephant in the room when post-quantum cryptography is being discussed is “when”? When is this going to happen? The answer is of course we don’t really know. It could be five years away. It could also be 10 or 20+ years away. However, to play devil’s advocate, what if nation-state actors already have quantum computers with sufficient processing capability running in their labs? It’s not quite apples to apples, but there are some precedents. Public key cryptography was first postulated by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976 and its implementation as RSA announced in 1977 by Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman. At least that is what was understood to be the case until in 1997 some UK secrets held by Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) became declassified, revealing that British mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Cocks">Clifford Cocks</a>, working for the&nbsp;intelligence agency, described an equivalent public/private key system in an internal document in 1973. Whether it was ever used is pure speculation, but it does illustrate the art of the possible. With that we will leave you to ponder, but at least you should now be clear that Harvest Now, Decrypt Later is real.</p>

 Protect access to all applications and resources with Security Service Edge 
<p><br>Microsoft’s Security Service Edge (SSE) solution, <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Network_Access/Welcome.ReactView">now in preview</a>, includes Microsoft Entra Internet Access and Microsoft Entra Private Access, and secures access to any app or resource for users and devices connecting from anywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The integrations across Microsoft’s SSE solution and the Microsoft Entra portfolio make it possible to enforce unified Conditional Access policies that consider identity, device, application, and now network conditions before granting access to any application or website. This works no matter which identity provider the application uses—without requiring any changes to the application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many of you are testing <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-internet-access?rtc=1">Microsoft Entra Internet Access</a>, our identity-centric Secure Web Gateway (SWG), to secure access for Microsoft 365 traffic. We are expanding the public preview to include all internet apps and resources by the end of 2023 with new core capabilities:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Context-aware SWG with web content filtering to restrict end user access to unsafe and non-compliant content.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Universal Conditional Access to extend adaptive access controls to any network destination, such as an external website or a non-federated SaaS application.  &nbsp; 
 Compliant Network Check,&nbsp;an easy-to-manage construct within Conditional Access. With this control, you can protect Microsoft Entra integrated cloud applications against token theft and ensure users do not bypass network security policies specific to their tenant while accessing critical cloud services.&nbsp; 
 Source IP restoration in ID Protection and Conditional Access location policies that maintains each user’s original source IP to enable backward compatibility of trusted location checks and continuous access evaluation, identity risk detection, and logging.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-private-access">Microsoft Entra Private Access</a> is our identity-centric Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) for any private app or resource. New capabilities in private preview include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Support for more protocols in addition to TCP, including UDP and private DNS, so you’ll be able to transition from your traditional Virtual Private Network (VPN) to a modern ZTNA solution. 
 Conditional Access controls and modern authentication methods, such as multifactor authentication (MFA), to secure access to all private applications and resources for remote and on-premises users. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our SSE solution works with your existing security and network solutions through integrations across Microsoft’s security stack and open partner ecosystem. We’re partnering with other vendors in this space, starting with <a href="https://docs.netskope.com/en/netskope-help/integrations-439794/solution-guides/microsoft-security-and-netskope-integration-solution-guide/microsoft-and-netskope-sse-coexistence/">Netskope</a>, to demonstrate seamless side-by-side operation in the same environment. We’re committed to giving you the flexibility to choose the SSE solution that best fits the network traffic in your environment. For both Internet Access and Private Access, we’re also announcing cross-OS client support for Windows and Android in public preview, and for MacOS and iOS in private preview. Our SSE solution is now available globally (except in China and Russia) with SSE edge locations coming in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join us at our upcoming <a href="https://aka.ms/AccelerateSecurity">Tech Accelerator Ask Microsoft Anything (AMA) session</a> to discuss with our product experts all your questions about Microsoft’s SSE solution!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Auto-rollout of Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies and more 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year, we turned on security defaults in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/new-name">Azure Active Directory</a>) for almost seven million existing tenants, which cut the number of compromises in those tenants by 80 percent. Based on the positive customer feedback, we’re helping more Microsoft Entra ID customers protect themselves by automatically enrolling eligible tenants into Conditional Access policies based on customer risk signals, current usage, and licensing. Microsoft-managed conditional access policies&nbsp;will start with three policies that enforce multifactor authentication (MFA) in high-risk scenarios. You can learn more details in Alex Weinert’s recent blog post, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">Automatic Conditional Access policies in Microsoft Entra streamline identity protection</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenant with Microsoft managed Conditional Access policies. The policy details are shown in a context pane to the right, indicating that the selected policy requires certain administrator roles to perform multifactor authentication when accessing the Microsoft admin portal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But not all MFA methods offer equal protection. The more effective MFA methods, such as FIDO2 Security keys, Windows Hello, Microsoft Entra certificate-based authentication (CBA), and passkeys, use cryptographic techniques to make authentication phishing-resistant. The preview of Microsoft Entra CBA allows you to tailor authentication policies by certificate, resource type, and user group. All these phishing-resistant authentication methods make it possible to eliminate passwords altogether, so they can’t be guessed, intercepted, or phished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft is committed to supporting passkeys across our ecosystem, starting with Windows 11. Once you create a passkey for a website, application, or service using Windows Hello, you can sign in from your device using your face, fingerprint, or device PIN. This gives enterprises and government customers an additional, phishing-resistant alternative to physical FIDO2 security keys. Microsoft Entra ID users will soon be able to sign in using passkeys managed from the Microsoft Authenticator app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lastly <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id-protection">Microsoft Entra ID Protection</a> now detects anomalies such as an unusual token lifetime or a token played from an unfamiliar location. When a trigger is alerted, Conditional Access can immediately expire the token and force reauthentication along with other measures, such as a password reset or step-up MFA, without requiring manual intervention. If a user makes a password change on-premises, Entra ID Protection can now <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/remediate-user-risks-in-microsoft-entra-id-protection-through-on/ba-p/3773129">automatically remediate their risk</a>. This makes it easier for hybrid organizations to take advantage of user risk policies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Integrations for more robust Permissions Management 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-permissions-management">Microsoft Entra Permissions Management</a> has two significant integrations that will give you insights on permission risks so you can improve your security posture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://aka.ms/PermissionsManagementDefenderForCloud">Microsoft Defender for Cloud (MDC) integration</a> preview consolidates identity and access permission insights with other cloud security information in a single interface. This view will display actionable recommendations for addressing permissions risks, as well as the Permissions Creep Index, and make it easier to enforce least privilege access for cloud resources across Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra Permissions Management integration with Microsoft Defender for Cloud (MDC), which is now in public preview, provides and efficient way to consolidate insights into other cloud security posture information on a single interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://aka.ms/ServiceNowPoD">second integration</a>, now generally available, allows ServiceNow&nbsp;customers to request time-bound, on-demand permissions for multicloud environments (Azure, AWS, Google Cloud) via the ServiceNow portal. This popular IT service management (ITSM) solution strengthens your Zero Trust posture by adding access permission requests to existing approval workflows in ServiceNow. Now when a user requests access approvals, the ServiceNow Plugin fetches the latest data from Permissions Management, then sends the requested user permissions, along with time-bound approval based on the requestor’s roles, back to ServiceNow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Evolving secure identity and network access 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adopting a single integrated solution with comprehensive capabilities with Microsoft Entra will simplify access security for your admins and give your end users a better experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Entra portfolio works together to help you secure identities, devices, networks, and workloads. It extends to any user type, including customers, partners, and digital workloads. And now, with our SSE solution, Microsoft Entra is converging identity and network access controls into a single policy engine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope the latest innovations in Microsoft Entra will make it easier for you to secure access to everything for everyone.</p>

<p>Zug, Switzerland – November 15, 2023 – <a href="https://appruvr.co.uk/?ref=blog.dock.io">Appruvr</a>, a platform that automates the qualification verification process for employers and candidates, announced the integration of <a href="http://dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock</a>’s Verifiable Credential technology. Using Verifiable Credentials, Appruvr makes it easy for organizations to verify credentials instantly without contacting the issuing party or checking physical documents while enabling individuals to control their own data.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href="https://www.dock.io/post/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.dock.io">Verifiable Credential</a> is a fraud-proof digital document that proves something about an individual or entity, such as someone’s identity or qualification. Verifiable Credentials are instantly verifiable and enable users to present information in a privacy-preserving way.&nbsp; </p> Problems: Credential Fraud and Unnecessarily Long Verification Processes  <p>Delaney Millward, Founder of Apprurvr, started the company because he had first-hand experience of seeing how many job applicants embellished their credentials. He relied on websites including LinkedIn and recruitment agencies but found many people didn’t fit what they were looking for.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem with the traditional recruitment processes is that the information relies solely on what candidates claim they are qualified for. This experience started his journey to find a solution where an organization could quickly and efficiently verify the credentials. At the time, the solution didn’t exist.</p><p>Credential fraud is a huge global problem:&nbsp;</p>  83% of employers believe their hires have lied about qualifications  1 in 5 employers admit to not verifying graduate qualifications  47% of job applicants admit to inflating grades  Fake diplomas and degrees make 7 billion dollars a year worldwide  Credential fraud costs UK businesses £23 billion pounds every year  <p>Credential fraud has financial consequences and affects public safety, particularly when fraudsters work in high-stakes jobs like surgeons, nurses, or construction workers. Many people around the world have died or been injured by unqualified people working in jobs that they got as a result of fake credentials.&nbsp;</p><p>Credential verification is still generally slow, complex and expensive. To illustrate, even the fastest verification times are approximately 3.8 days, which is cumbersome when we consider the speed of the job market in many sectors. Employers don’t have the capacity to verify all of these credentials, particularly when they need to hire many people in a short period of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Appruvr is at the forefront of harnessing verifiable credential technology to solve credential fraud issues and give organizations the solutions to make credential verification easier and faster.</p> How Dock's Technology Enables Appruvr to Fast-Track the Credential Verification Process <p>When Appruvr was building their solution and researching Verifiable Credential providers, they felt that Dock could meet their technological needs and shared the same goals of empowering both organizations and individuals with tools to make the journey from education to employment more seamless and efficient.</p><p>These are some of the key benefits of Verifiable Credentials in the education and workforce sectors:&nbsp;</p>  Employers can hire candidates faster because they can check the authenticity of credentials instantly.&nbsp;  Organizations can verify credentials without storing that data because individuals hold and control the data on their mobile identity wallet app.  Graduates can conveniently and efficiently prove their credentials in a way that preserves their privacy without relying on a third party.  Job applicants can prove their credentials anywhere in the world at any time in an era where remote and gig work is growing.  <p>By integrating Dock’s <a href="https://www.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Verifiable Credentials Platform</a>, Appruvr seamlessly transforms education and workforce credentials into fraud-proof and instantly Verifiable Credentials.

  <p>How can I effectively address cybersecurity vulnerabilities within my organization? Also, what are the implications of the Cyberresilience Act for this? EDITH, the European Digital Innovation Hub for Hesse, has extended an invitation to Dr. Steven Arzt, a cybersecurity expert from the Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology SIT, for a #DigiTalk session discussing best practices for Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure.</p>
<p>Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) is the process with which ethical hackers report vulnerabilities in software and systems to manufacturers and system operators. Researchers commonly often assess the security status of a system or product independently, i.e., without a formal invitation, contract or integration into a company’s strategy. While these unasked-for vulnerability reports are still considered an insult by some companies, others openly embrace their value for strengthening the company’s IT security by interacting with the hacking and research communities. In his talk, Dr. Arzt shows how a proper CVD process can greatly benefit companies and the wider IT security community at the same time. It is shown how CVD can not only help identify and fix vulnerabilities, but also send a strong positive message about a company’s attitude towards IT security.</p>

  <p>The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), which entered into force on 16 January 2023 and will apply from 17 January 2025, aims to enhance the digital operational resilience of entities across the EU financial sector and to further harmonise key digital operational resilience requirements for all EU financial entities. DORA sets out uniform requirements for the security of network and information systems of companies and organisations operating in the financial sector as well as critical third parties which provide ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) services to them, such as cloud computing or data analytics services. DORA creates a regulatory framework on digital operational resilience, whereby all financial entities need to make sure they can withstand, respond to, and recover from all types of ICT-related disruptions and threats. These requirements are homogenous across the EU, with the core aim to prevent and mitigate cyber threats. DORA is complemented with several “regulatory technical standards (‘RTS’)” which give more details on requirements for cyber security.</p>
<p>As the whole DORA legislation cannot be presented in a short timeframe, I will focus on the part that is most important to ensure cybersecurity and the part that is the most interesting one for the audience, the RTS on ICT Risk Management Framework. I will give a quick overview and highlight the topics, which will bring the most workload to the industry. The biggest challenges will be in the areas of Asset Management, Operations Security, Network Security and Encryption.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/what-are-the-main-challenges-cre23"></a>

  <p>AI actors are poised to eclipse the number of human users on the internet. Many industry observers have decried such growth, pointing to the immense risks that such a brave new world poses. How can security systems even keep up with the rate of expansion in AI technologies? How can enterprises hope to compete with the vast amounts of money, time, and resources that AI companies use to train their models? Such questions presage a significant evolution in the way the tech industry envisions, develops, and deploys security systems.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there’s a way forward, but it requires the cybersecurity market to shift toward a pattern that follows what AI vendors have done: make the science of biological systems the template for cybersecurity. Breakthroughs in social science, political science, evolutionary biology, and neuroscience demonstrate that our focus should be on establishing trustful relationships rather than a direct reliance on structural interventions such as identity management, attack surface management, and zero trust practices. The pathways that enable biological entities to come to trust and successfully collaborate with each other are known to science. In this presentation, Global Head of Research Mike Neuenschwander will delve into what changes are coming to the security market in order to achieve such levels of trust online.&nbsp; The presentation will provide a market roadmap for vendors, enterprises, governments, and standards organizations alike to create a security model that is highly collaborative and ultimately highly trustworthy.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/the-future-of-security-is-collaborative-cre23"></a>

  <p>Attackers don’t sleep and find new ways to get into a company and move laterally through the environment. This session starts with an overview where we come from and the pure reactive approach of detecting someone in our network and then moving into the proactive way of security. Using the same tools for asset discovery, risk assessment and automatic checks for compliance of the customers environment.</p>
<p>So the solution should not just stop the attack, but before check automatically how an attacker possibly could come in and have a full overview of the environment including automatic risk factors for assets and overview combined with integrations with other solutions.</p>
<p>Additionally the task of risk management is stated in the new NIS2 directive and should be clearly a topic for all companies that are affected.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/risk-assessment-the-attacker-way-cre23"></a>

CISO’s tell us they are flying blind and hope for the best. You shouldn't have to simply trust your app teams or run periodic third-party assessments to stay on top of how your SaaS is configured. What if you could define the security guardrails, which identities have access to which data, continuously monitor for drift, and be automatically alerted when a metric needs your attention? Nothing falls through the cracks.

  <p>Comprehensive protection of networks, system infrastructures, hardware and software, applications and data is part of every cyber security strategy. But what does this actually mean for identity and access management?&nbsp;Unloved for many years and repeatedly declared dead: passwords. Large IT companies have been promising us a password-free future for a long time. Is it really that easy to finally turn your back on passwords? The fact is that we have to deal with a large number of passwords every day in order to complete our professional and private tasks. Every password should be unique, highly complex and as long as possible. But what does the frightening everyday life with passwords look like today, what will it hopefully look like in the future and why it is essential to deal with the topic right now, explains&nbsp;Daniel&nbsp;Holzinger in his lecture.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/is-the-future-really-password-free-cre23"></a>

  <p>Automated Threats to web applications are according to the Open Web Applications Project (OWASP) a misuse of their inherent valid functionality by applying automated means. Usually, those automations are referred to as `bots´. The attackers usually reverse engineer the web application, e.g. an e-commerce platform, and based on their discovery, craft bots to exploit vulnerabilities or gaps that allow them to pursue their goal on the platform in an undesirable way. A famous example are sneaker bots, whose goal is to obtain a competitive advantage over human clients in purchasing hyped articles like sneakers. Addressing automated threats is a company-wide effort and requires to tackle the problem from many angles reaching from DevSecOps, architectural changes, raising awareness, establishing transparency in the business, implementing preventive controls, to detective controls. In the first phase of our research, we tackled the problem in a big e-commerce company on this entire spectrum of challenges and are now at the position to enhance our approach in a second phase. In the second phase, we aim for an approach to harden a web-application platform with existing detective and reactive controls using aspects of generative approaches and adversarial attacks while also considering explainability.</p>
<p>In the talk, we are going to explain and motivate the problem space, explain the insights from the first phase and outline the goals of the second phase of our research.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/enhancing-web-application-security-cre23"></a>

				  What sets one digital wallet apart from another and what are the key features you should look for before starting to store your personal data? Here, we discuss the three that we find the most important and explain why.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>Between Apple Pay, Cash App, Google Pay and others, the number of digital wallets has exploded in recent years, with Capital One reporting there were <a href="https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/digital-wallet-statistics/#:~:text=Digital%20Wallet%20User%20Statistics&amp;text=In%202022%2C%20there%20were%203.4%20billion%20digital%20wallet%20users%20in,60%25%20of%20the%20global%20population.">roughly 3.4 billion users</a> worldwide in 2022. As more consumers familiarize themselves with wallet apps, using them for moving money or purchasing goods or services has become commonplace.</p>
<p>If identity verification is to emulate the convenience of digital payments, the wallets we use need to offer more functionality than just the ability to accept, hold, and present a verifiable credential, they need to have the tools to fully manage your digital identity and data sharing.</p>
<p>The first additional feature to look for in a digital identity wallet is process management. Sometimes the process for being issued with a verifiable credential is simple: you fill out a few forms from the issuing party, which are confirmed by the issuing party, and then you are issued with a credential. For example, when applying for a mobile driver’s license there are several attribute fields to fill out, such as name, height, weight, eye color, etc. These allow the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to confirm that you are the correct person to issue the license to.</p>
<p>But what if the DMV decides it needs more information? Does the wallet notify you? Does the DMV have a procedure in place to notify you? Often services like this simply don’t have the time or processes in place to inform you of the need for more information, and the onus is on you to follow up. By having process management built into the wallet it would be able to easily notify you that the process is stalled and explain why.</p>
<p>The second feature to look for is the ability to act as a verifier and be able to read credentials. Every identity wallet by default is designed to hold credentials and create presentations of the information they contain; this allows you to share your mobile driver’s license or a proof of your age. But before you share this information, it would be ideal to be able to verify for yourself who you’re sharing this information with. For example, if you were pulled over by someone dressed as a police officer, this functionality could confirm that they actually are a police officer, and even provide you with important information such as their jurisdiction, name, and badge number. Similarly, this function would also allow two people to simply verify each other, for example when meeting someone for the first time: if a person comes to your door claiming to be from the gas company you could verify their credentials before letting them in to your house, and they could verify that you are the correct customer they are supposed to be helping, providing an additional layer of security and confidence.</p>
<p>The third feature we recommend is the ability to offer mutually authenticated two-way messaging. This allows you to cryptographically validate the identity of who you are interacting with (and they, you), and is a powerful way to deter fraud. (To learn more about how this works, <a href="https://indicio.tech/secure-two-way-communication-is-decentralized-identitys-secret-sauce-to-stopping-financial-scams/">read our recent article.</a>)</p>
<p>But besides stopping fraud, this feature also changes the way businesses and individuals can interact: instead of getting a letter or email from your bank, it can ping you to ask questions or start a conversation. Unlike email, this is a direct, encrypted communication that you know is coming from your bank. You can also easily sever this connection, and while you probably don’t want to do this with your bank, you may want to remove the ability for other parties to contact you.</p>
<p>In sum, we see identity wallets as building the foundation for digital relationships and these features provide powerful ways to build trusted digital relationships that are more richly interactive.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Indicio offers a free-to-use wallet, <a href="https://indicio.tech/holdr/">Holdr+</a>, which you can download right now to see some of these features in action, such as secure, mutually authenticated communication. Future versions of Holdr+ will have all the functionality outlined above.</p>

<p>Passwords, while integral to security measures, can pose significant threats due to their inherent vulnerabilities. Weak or reused passwords, susceptibility to phishing and brute-force attacks, and potential insider threats all make passwords a weak link in your security posture.</p>
<p>Although ubiquitous and seemingly secure, passwords can pose a significant threat to organizations for various reasons. Common issues include the use of weak or easily guessable passwords and password reuse across multiple accounts, making it easier for malicious actors to gain unauthorized access. Additionally, the prevalence of phishing scams and brute-force attacks means that even the most careful users can become victims. Lastly, the risk of insider threats, where employees with compromised credentials can exploit their access, is an ever-present concern.</p>
<p>To effectively counter these risks, organizations need to look beyond passwords and embrace robust security measures such as multi-factor authentication (MFA). Implementing MFA introduces an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide additional authentication factors. It not only validates user identities using their passwords but also involves a second form of verification like a one-time code sent to the user’s mobile device. However, while MFA provides additional security over passwords, it is still susceptible to MFA bypass attacks such as SIM swap, MFA prompt bombing, and more.</p>
<p>For these reasons, organizations must explore comprehensive security solutions beyond just passwords and traditional MFA and look to phishing-resistant MFA such as certificate-based authentication.</p>
 The Entrust Solution 
<p>Entrust Desktop Credential Provider for Microsoft Windows, which provides robust passwordless and multi-factor authentication for Windows desktop login, is one such solution. It integrates with Entrust Identity Enterprise (IdE) and Identity as a Service (IDaaS), allowing comprehensive user authentication and management. Entrust Desktop responds to various use cases like workstation login, password change, and unlock, thereby enhancing security and providing better access controls.</p>
<p>Using MFA with Entrust Desktop Credential Provider increases organizational security, provides better control over system access, offers various choices to meet specific security needs, and helps meet regulatory requirements.</p>
 MFA Methods Supported by Entrust Desktop: 
 
 Passwordless Authentication: This method eliminates the need for users to remember and input a password for subsequent logins after their initial setup. Instead of the traditional password-based approach, it relies solely on Entrust’s second-factor authentication mechanisms. This not only simplifies the user’s experience but also offers a secure way to verify their identity, given the robustness of the second-factor authentication techniques involved. 
 OTP (One-Time Password) Authentication: A unique, time-sensitive password is dispatched to the user’s registered contact details – either their email address or phone number. Since the PIN is valid for only a short duration and can’t be used more than once, it reduces the chances of unauthorized access. 
 Token Authentication: Here, users authenticate themselves using secure tokens, which can be either hardware devices or software-based. These tokens can originate from Entrust or other reputable vendors in the cybersecurity realm. Entrust provides support for two main types of tokens:
 
 Response-Only Tokens: Provide authentication through a simple response mechanism 
 Challenge-response Tokens: Engage users in an interactive authentication process, where the system sends a challenge and awaits a correct response 
 
 
 
 
 Mobile Soft Token Authentication: In this approach, users receive an out-of-band authentication challenge directly on their mobile devices. These challenges can range from simple prompts to more interactive mechanisms, making the process both user-friendly and secure. 
 Grid Authentication: A unique method that presents users with a grid filled with an assortment of characters organized in rows and columns. During the login process, users are asked to provide specific characters from predetermined coordinates on the grid. Given its unconventional nature, this method offers an extra layer of security against automated bot attacks. 
 Knowledge-Based Q&amp;A Authentication: Here, users respond to a set of personalized questions either online or offline. These questions are typically formulated during the user’s initial setup and are based on information only the user is likely to know. The Q&amp;A mechanism can be seamlessly integrated into the Entrust Identity Enterprise platform, specifically via the Entrust Identity Enterprise Self-Service Server (or the Entrust Identity Enterprise Self-Service Module) or the Identity as a Service platform. This method combines the security of knowledge-based tests with the convenience of user-defined answers. 
 Mobile Smart Credentials Authentication (Certificate-based authentication): This is an advanced out-of-band authentication strategy. Users receive a challenge on their mobile devices, which is then signed by the Entrust Mobile app upon verification of the user through biometrics or a unique PIN. Once signed, the challenge is verified by the Entrust Identity Enterprise or the Identity as a Service platforms. 
 
<p>Entrust supports multiple MFA authentication mechanisms and we highly recommend using phishing-resistant authentication mechanisms.</p>

   A new study shows that organizations can enjoy a range of benefits by migrating — if they can overcome internal challenges 

<p>In the early days of cloud adoption, organizations were understandably apprehensive. Many of the early adopters were particularly concerned about security, and tested the waters with non-essential apps that were easy to migrate and presented minimal risk. In the years since, with most organizations well into their cloud journeys, cloud migration has proven its value in material ways, enabling greater productivity, better customer engagement, lower costs, and improved efficiency. And it's strengthened security by moving visibility and control to anywhere users and data happen to be.</p>

<p>Most would agree that identity and access management (IAM) is a critical component of a robust security ecosystem. So, it only makes sense that organizations would look to move IAM to the cloud as part of their overall digital transformation initiatives. Yet, many organizations remain hesitant to jump in and begin the process of migrating IAM systems to the cloud, despite its potential benefits.</p>

<p>We set out to find out why with the help of Forrester.</p>

<p>The result of this work is a custom study by Forrester Consulting in November 2023, commissioned by ForgeRock and Ping Identity and titled, "<a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/cloud-migration-optimizes-identity-and-access-management">Cloud Migration Optimizes Identity and Access Management</a>."</p>

<p>The study's purpose was to investigate the challenges that are holding organizations back from migrating IAM to the cloud. The survey also explored the benefits and opportunities awaiting those that embrace cloud IAM.</p>

 About the study 

<p>The commissioned study queried organizations around the world with at least 5,000 employees to explore their concerns about migrating IAM systems and solutions to the cloud. It also sought to understand the perceptions of IAM administrators and security leaders about cloud migration, the potential benefits of embracing a move to the cloud, and how cloud migration impacts their success. Ultimately, it looked to help guide organizations considering a move to the cloud to create a plan for IAM cloud migration.</p>

 Cloud IAM can help organizations achieve their objectives, so why aren't more adopting it? 

<p>Organizations in all sectors face challenges related to demands for stronger security and better experiences for customers and employees. They're fielding requests for multi-factor authentication (MFA), including passwordless authentication, while navigating a complex web of regulations that vary by region.</p>

<p>For most, the answer may be cloud IAM. According to the survey, 86% of respondents indicate that fully migrating IAM to the cloud is important to their success. That number jumps to ninety-two percent for organizations using both workforce IAM and customer IAM (CIAM).</p>

<p>But despite broad interest in its benefits, organizations have been slow to make the move. According to Forrester, only 12% of organizations are fully embracing identity in the cloud.<a>1</a></p>

 For many organizations, the culprit is internal 

<p>The survey showed that organizations are having trouble overcoming the challenges with cloud migration, primarily in two areas: organizational barriers and complexity.</p>

<p>One of the great advantages of cloud IAM technology is that it enables enterprises to transition from an on-premises IAM system to the cloud to deliver the agility, reliability, and scalability commonly associated with cloud technologies and services. But the complexity of legacy IAM ecosystems creates barriers to success.</p>

<p>Assessing and managing existing infrastructure, including highly distributed identities, identifying integrations and incompatibilities between apps and cloud solutions, and realigning internal technologies to facilitate a move to the cloud represent arduous but critical tasks. Add to that organizational silos, including siloed IAM, and a lack of leadership support at the highest levels, and it's no wonder that the journey to the cloud for many organizations is an uphill battle.</p>

 What benefits await? 

<p>Although the challenges can be intimidating, the journey to the cloud offers a bounty of rewards that make the endeavor worthwhile. More than 60% of survey respondents indicate that successful migration can enhance security, including improving password security and enforcing Zero Trust security.</p>

<p>Cloud IAM also helps businesses deliver the kind of frictionless user experiences that attract, engage, and retain customers, and enhance employee engagement and productivity. Equally significant are the operational improvements offered by cloud migration, including reduced complexity in governance and management, improved agility to comply with regulations, and the freeing of resources normally burdened with these tasks — many of the manual — to focus on other activities that deliver greater business value.</p>

 How can you move forward?

<p>Driver’s licenses serve more use cases for us than simply proving our capability to operate a vehicle–many people use their driver’s license as their primary form of identification. As we shift to a digital-first world, people will need credentials to represent all facets of their identity digitally in a secure way. Whether it be proving identity to apply for a loan or purchasing a controlled substance online, it’s becoming increasingly important and necessary for entities to offer people the option to present a digitally issued ID document remotely.</p><p>This means that it is critical to build mobile driver’s license (mDL) solutions using standardized data formats, so verifiers across different geographies and industries can use a consistent framework to confirm a person’s identity. To ensure the secure and interoperable use of these digital credentials, international standards are being developed and tested. The August 2023 ISO/IEC 18013-7 Interoperability Event, organized by SpruceID, was a significant milestone in this ongoing journey.</p><p>We’re delighted to have hosted a successful, fully-remote, and asynchronous interoperability test event for mobile driver’s license implementations. Read on to learn more about ISO/IEC 18013-7, a recap of the interoperability event, and how the results and findings are being used to drive the digital identity industry forward.</p> A Brief Introduction to ISO/IEC 18013-7 <p>ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 is the working group that defines standards for motor vehicle driver’s licenses and related documents, to provide a common technical framework and promote the safe and secure use of this technology. The 18013-5 standard specified by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17 defines requirements for the security, data elements, and information exchange of mobile driving licenses (mDL) between the mobile device and authorized parties while upholding user data protection and safeguarding driver privacy.</p><p>ISO/IEC 18013-5 focuses on attended in-person use cases where parties are in close proximity during the presentation of a digitally issued ID document. After introducing the ISO/IEC 18013-5 standard, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC17 took another step forward by publishing a Committee Draft consultation of ISO/IEC 18013-7, a draft technical specification that focuses on unattended or fully online use cases of mDL where parties are remotely connected at the time of presentation.</p><p>The objective of our interoperability event was to provide a collaboration forum for implementers of ISO/IEC 18013-7 to come together and test their respective solutions to drive forward cross-industry interoperability and adoption while accelerating feedback and clarity for implementations of the standards.</p> Joining Forces for Testing <p>The Interoperability Event was hosted remotely, with an asynchronous testing window spanning three weeks. This allowed participants enough time to actively test and collaborate iteratively with other implementers to optimize their own implementations and use cases.</p><p>The event was open for all implementers of 18013-7 to participate without any restrictions regarding organization size or any particular working group membership. Participants came from a variety of backgrounds, including both public and private sectors, across multiple geographies. Any observers interested in understanding the maturity and adoption of the draft standard were also welcome to join and listen in.</p><p>The participating mDL reader implementers included: Bundesdruckerei GmbH, Credence ID, Google, HID Global, ImproveID, MyNextID, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Okta, OneProof, Panasonic, Ping Identity, Samsung, Scytales, SpruceID, and Thales.</p><p>The participating mDL implementers included: Bundesdruckerei GmbH, Google, HID Global, ImproveID, MyNextID, NEC, OneProof, Panasonic, Samsung, Scytales, SpruceID (jointly with the State of California Department of Motor Vehicles), and Thales.</p><p>Testing participants were encouraged to test both Rest API and OpenID4VP implementations to inform recommendations for refining the clarity of the technical specification related to both protocols.</p> Results and Reflections <p>There were many takeaways and learnings from the test event that will ultimately help to inform both the standard and interoperability moving forward. Notably, the draft specifications were found to have no major issues necessitating normative changes. Most interoperability challenges were largely a result of updates to the draft documents in advance of the interoperability event, which some participants did not have sufficient time or resources to address. However, the successful resolution of these issues demonstrated a shared commitment to fostering interoperability and will help improve this documentation in the future.</p><p>Feedback from the event, along with preliminary aggregate, anonymized test results, and troubleshooting, was presented to ISO/IEC JTC1/SC17 WG10 in Singapore. The findings and resolutions were documented as N2349 in the ISO Global Directory. So far, these insights have been incorporated into the latest version of ISO/IEC 18013-7, submitted as N2356. N2356 is the first draft of a Technical Specification, which includes all the improvements and insights we've gathered during our test event to enhance the specification for better interoperability.</p><p>If you’re interested in taking a deeper dive into these findings, a comprehensive event results publication can <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M4ufcKqmj8gycNovslOSWzFB2nB1o1eu/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=114730549750609434292&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">be found here</a>. </p> Onwards and Upwards for 18013-7 <p>We look forward to continuing to play a role in advancing the 18013-7 standard and other digital identity standards. The August 2023 ISO/IEC 18013-7 Interoperability Event was a testament to the collective effort to advance standards for mobile driver's licenses, and how much progress we can make together to eventually bring this standard to life for public use. The successful interoperability demonstrations of mobile driver’s licenses that can be presented and verified remotely over the internet will introduce a new class of use cases for verifiable digital identity and evolve the way we use mobile driver’s licenses today.</p><p>At SpruceID, our mission is to let users control their data across all digital interactions. As digital identity technologies, such as mobile driver's licenses, become more pervasive and usable for online user experiences, it is important to be mindful of introducing privacy-preserving capabilities from their inception. To that end, we think carefully about technology mitigations for privacy risks and concerns raised by civil liberties organizations, such as "phoning home," in the mDL implementations that SpruceID works on. You can learn more in our <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/the-considerations/existing-critiques?ref=blog.spruceid.com">knowledge base</a>.</p><p>We’d like to thank all implementers for taking the time to participate in the test event. This event marked a crucial step towards creating a digital identification landscape that is secure, interoperable, and universally accessible. As we continue our journey towards fully realizing the potential of mDLs, collaborative, open events like these play a vital role in shaping the future of digital identification.</p>  📄  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M4ufcKqmj8gycNovslOSWzFB2nB1o1eu/edit?rtpof=true&amp;sd=true&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">Read the Event Results Publication</a>   <p>About SpruceID: At SpruceID, our mission is to let users control their data across all digital interactions. </p>

 The Brazilian gambling industry is about to become regulated. IDnow investigates how the grey market currently works, and some of the dangers of using unregulated gambling platforms. 



 



<p>Brazil effectively banned gambling in 1946; a more-or-less all-encompassing restriction that remained largely in place until 2018, when sports betting was legalized. However, as virtually no regulation was ever implemented, Brazilian players and international gambling platforms have been operating in a somewhat grey area ever since. This is all due to change once Brazilian online gambling regulation is formally approved in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The limbo appears to work, at least on the face of it. And at least for international operators. Surprisingly, despite the lack of clear regulation, Brazil still manages to generate over<a href="https://denmark.net/top-countries-online-gambling-traffic/?expand_article=1"> 20% of all global online gambling</a> traffic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is for this reason that the Brazilian authorities have introduced new regulations to help the Brazilian gambling market capture what is viewed as lost revenue (<a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/brazil#:~:text=Revenue%20in%20the%20Online%20Gambling,US%243.23bn%20by%202027.">a projected $1.5 billion in 2023</a>) and bring it back within the fold of the Brazilian economy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In fact, the projected numbers are likely to be even larger when regulation finally passes, as there are vast swathes of the Brazilian would-be gambling community that are not currently gambling, despite wanting to.</p>



 To gamble or not to gamble? That is the Brazilian question. 



<p>In 2021, a survey on Brazilian attitudes toward gambling discovered that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/o-desafio-da-preven%C3%A7%C3%A3o-%C3%A0-lavagem-de-dinheiro-nos-jogos-odilon-dutra/?originalSubdomain=pt">39% of Brazilian participants said they didn’t gamble</a> because they felt uncertain of the safety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just over half of all potential players said they would feel more confident playing online if they had more information about the companies. This is understandable as many gambling operators are not very clear about who their owners are, or even the location of their headquarters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the same survey, 51% of participants said they would like to see more player protection mechanisms put in place. Read more opinions from the Brazilian betting community in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-players-regulation-gambling/">blog, ‘How does the Brazilian betting community really feel about upcoming regulations.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite operating in the grey, international gambling operators have achieved considerable visibility through advertising on television and the internet, and through sponsorship of Brazilian football clubs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the wave of publicity and ensuing popularity <a href="https://mundorubronegro.com/apostas-brasil/casas-apostas-ilegais">has raised concerns</a> about the impact of gambling addiction, the growth of scams, and the threat of money laundering.</p>



 Wait, so is online gambling legal or illegal in Brazil? 



<p>The most obvious question that many have when they see adverts for online gambling platforms but find out online gambling is essentially illegal, is well, how does that work? The answer lies in <a href="https://seudireito.proteste.org.br/site-de-apostas-e-ilegal/">Law 13.756,</a> which allows operators to offer their services in Brazil if their headquarters are outside of Brazil and there are no physical points of sale. In practice, this law enables bookmakers to use websites, on the condition they are hosted internationally.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As these websites operate according to the rules of the countries in which they are based, such as Curaçao, the UK or Malta, they are not required to obey Brazilian laws, such as the Consumer Defence Code. This is all set to change when Brazilian regulations are formally passed and implemented.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This has meant that from 2018 until whenever the regulations finally come into force, international bookmakers have operated with a sort of impunity and without needing to implement fair gaming rules or player protection measures.</p>



 What do Brazilian players think about using unregulated gambling platforms? 



<p>The Brazilian gaming community is waking up to the realities of dealing with unregulated gambling operators. Common complaints made on social media and forums include users making deposits but being unable to withdraw them, and even stories of players who have had their accounts blocked following a good streak in sports betting or on online casinos. However, there is a growing awareness among the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-players-regulation-gambling/">Brazilian betting community</a> that these kinds of scams are not representative of the entire gambling industry, but rather just unreliable websites.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>An upside to the online proliferation of so many negative stories has led to <a href="https://www.extraclasse.org.br/geral/2023/03/bicheiros-e-contraventores-investem-em-cassinos-on-line-e-apostas-esportivas/">increasing numbers of Brazilian gamblers</a> actively seeking information about the risk of less reliable, unregulated online gambling sites.</p>



 Arguments for and against KYC processes in Brazil. 



<p>While the vast majority of the Brazilian betting community seem to accept the value of undergoing a KYC process, there are <a href="https://www.reclameaqui.com.br/betano/casa-de-aposta-nao-quer-pagar-meu-saque-e-fica-pedindo-fotos-de-todos-o-tip_DSBUzJ1HW0713vYD/">some who have expressed privacy concerns</a> over some operators’ requirements for players to take and send photographs of themselves holding identity documents. Many also fear that when dealing with an international operator, if there was a problem associated with sending documents, for example a data breach, then they would not be able to rely on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farialimabets/comments/11txan7/%C3%A9_seguro_enviar_meus_documentos_para_uma_casa_de/">national legal protection measures</a>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>A common complaint among international gambling operators is on the difficulty of performing the Brazilian KYC process due to the wide variety and disparity of identity documents in Brazil. For example, each state in Brazil offers slightly different ID cards, which have dates and document numbers in different places, for example. Difficulties <a href="https://www.reclameaqui.com.br/bc-game/verificacao-kyc_OcihHkmZ_wp6BSrb/">surrounding the KYC process</a> have affected some players’ ability to <a href="https://www.reclameaqui.com.br/188bet-apostas-esportivas-online/verificacao-de-identidade-kyc-prejuizo-de-u-75_Gp8gh8oJt_YPqbvA/">transact and make withdrawals</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This makes the integration with the Cadastro de Pessoas Fiscias (CPF), a tax number that every Brazilian is issued with, all the more important for identity verification and KYC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brazilian industry insiders say that the implementation of KYC measures to obtain a licence (Read more about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">‘Unpacking the complexities of the Brazilian gambling license structure’ here</a>) means more than just following a legal requirement, it will also <a href="https://g-mnews.com/pt/compliance-kyc-transparencia-que-gera-confiabilidade/">help operators prevent fraud</a>.</p>

 Mattereum as a Synthetic Jurisdiction <p>Recently, I attended the <a href="https://lu.ma/tnsconf">Network State Conference</a> in Amsterdam, as the innovative <a href="https://mattereum.com/how-it-works/">Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP)</a> created by my company could have an important role to play in a network state future. The fact that MAPs work via the <a href="https://www.newyorkconvention.org/english">1958 New York Convention on Arbitration </a>enables them to use the new <a href="https://share-eu1.hsforms.com/1ZYEqf0C5RyKJ-hw8HuIDLwg7g8s?__hstc=210657930.7c558ff264cc857b0c08d51862ea68da.1699447173458.1699447173458.1699447173458.1&amp;__hssc=210657930.1.1699447173458&amp;__hsfp=3586936129">UK Digital Dispute Resolution Rules</a> (which the Mattereum team helped draft) in 172 jurisdictions worldwide. This means, in effect, they create a synthetic jurisdiction that sits between nation states, resting on international treaties, The Mattereum model can be seen as a new form of network state itself, as well as a convenient legal tool to be used by other network states (or indeed any other individual or entity) for managing trade in physical goods. It could become a “pluggable” legal layer to support other network states, particularly the ones exporting physical goods. If a thing has a price tag, it can be part of this synthetic jurisdiction, irrespective of whether the object is land in Oregon, gold in a vault in Singapore or investment grade whisky in a barrel in Scotland, subject to the same law and the same guarantees. It is a state for physical objects, rather than a state for people, but arguably a state nonetheless. What makes it so is that it has the machinery to resolve legal disputes between people, under the rules that they opt into when they use Mattereum. It’s where your legal problems go to be resolved. Resolving trade disputes is one of the more critical aspects of a state, isn’t&nbsp;it?</p><blockquote>The innovative Mattereum Asset Passport created by my company could have an important role to play in a network state&nbsp;future</blockquote><p>This is not new to us; while network states are gaining in prominence and importance as their potential becomes clear, Mattereum has been thinking about this kind of thing from the very start. Five years ago, in the early days of our company, I wrote a speculative document about this very thing with two of my colleagues from Mattereum. Until now it has not been published outside the organisation but given its new relevance I thought I would share it. The language does not perhaps use current terminology (e.g. for Free Economic Zones read network states, for smart property register, read MAPs), but I feel the ideas are possibly even more relevant now than they were&nbsp;then.</p> “Towards a Digital&nbsp;Hansa: <p>Past Precedents as Inspiration for a Global Confederation of Free Economic Zones By James Hester, Anton Shelupanov, and Vinay&nbsp;Gupta</p><p>As Free Economic Zones (FEZs) have emerged and developed, these unique commercial entities have gradually come to share more in common with each other than with the parent nation states in which they are located. It is only natural, then, that a desire would arise to unify their efforts towards common business goals, as for example in the Eurasian belt where the Digital Silk Road initiative seeks to facilitate interaction between FEZs in the region. Since formal unification would be geopolitically disruptive, the goal should be a strong but informal confederation capable of acting on the world stage at state-like levels and capable of facilitating commerce between members. As it happens, there exists a precedent for such a vast and formidable mercantile body in Europe’s past which could provide an inspiring model for how an equivalent organisation could be formed and governed&nbsp;today.</p><p>The Hanseatic League, also known as the Hansa (Middle Low German for ‘guild’), was a confederation of trading centres in the Holy Roman Empire which, founded in the 12th century, became the dominant mercantile power in Northern Europe for the next four centuries. Composed primarily of German towns and headquartered in Lübeck, member towns worked to ensure mutual protection of trade and the smooth conduct of commerce between them. They were never formally unified, being towns under the control of the Empire or neighbouring kingdoms including Sweden, Denmark, England, and Kievan Rus. Yet all members adhered to the bonds required of them in the Hanseatic charters, and heads of state learned quickly not to antagonise them lest they risk being cut out of trade (effectively an economic death sentence). They were governed by the consensus of their members, with regular meetings of representatives from each town to decide on pressing issues. They even levied troops and ships from members for mutual protection when necessary, meaning that they were capable of amassing a respectable military presence. So although not a state, they acted with near state-like power and were regarded as such by Europe’s&nbsp;leaders.</p><p>When we consider the degree of organisation which was achieved by the Hansa with the technology at their disposal, it is easy to see how a similar institution is not only possible today, but greatly enhanced and facilitated by our current technological innovations. Near-instant communication enables unprecedented efficiency in logistics coordination and maintaining relationships with clients and partners. Containerisation has revolutionised the transport of goods through standardisation and optimal use of space. And now, blockchain technology stands poised to automate elaborate and time-consuming administrative and legal procedures, reducing once exasperating but inevitable aspects of conducting business to previously unthinkable levels of ease and straightforwardness. Not only could we establish such an institution today and reap the resulting commercial benefits, we could do it better than our ancestors ever&nbsp;dreamed.</p><p>So what would an equivalent confederation of FEZs, our Digital Hansa, look like? A single strong economic centre (Lübeck) provided the foundation on which the original Hansa was built, with all members consenting to abide by the ‘Law of Lübeck’ in governing their activities. To avoid any one member becoming overly influential, member FEZs could jointly adopt a governance framework of a neutral body such as UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). They would also agree on a means of achieving consensus on policy and activities, and commit to abide by a single set of standards and regulations. These would apply appropriately across the confederation’s three tiers: individual companies operating in an FEZ, individual FEZs, and the combined global&nbsp;network.</p><p>Members would also pledge mutual aid to one another. This aid would take several forms. Parent states would negotiate the necessary economic concessions to enable member FEZs and their component companies to conduct business among themselves in the same manner worldwide. Members would speak with a collective voice in international forums such as the UN, and organise a communal legal defence and hardship funds to be drawn upon by any member in need. It is even possible, after delicate negotiations with each parent state, to organise some form of mutual defence pact whereby member states would contribute somehow to the protection of one another in times of necessity. A useful existing model is the single market and customs union established across members of the European Union. Just as these agreements remove economic barriers and facilitate trade with EU member states, a Digital Hansa would enable unhindered commerce between FEZs regardless of their location on&nbsp;Earth.</p><p>The blockchain applications developed by Mattereum are well placed to provide much of the necessary digital infrastructure for a global confederation of Free Economic Zones. The identities of member individuals and companies, the standards adhered to by all tiers of the organisation, and perhaps a complementary industry-standard accreditation such as a D-U-N-S Number, would be recorded on an immutable and accessible digital record. Consequently, external businesses engaging with members would be able to easily verify relevant details and proceed, safe in the knowledge that any company operating within a member FEZ operates under the same established regulations and practices.</p><p>The Smart Property Register operated by Mattereum would track and manage assets and resources across the confederation’s three tiers. No matter the asset’s location in the world, while in custody of a member, clients could rest assured that its storage and transport would be managed with an established standard of care. Tokenization of assets would also enable trade to be conducted without necessitating the transfer of physical goods from owner to&nbsp;owner.</p><p>Furthermore, since economic concessions from parent states would enable the transport of goods between member FEZs with reduced or eliminated tariffs and other expenses normally incurred while engaging in international trade, using member companies for transport and logistics would become particularly enticing.</p><p>For whatever governing framework member FEZs choose to jointly subscribe, Mattereum’s smart contracts could provide the means by which members commit to abide by them. This would prove especially useful in the resolution of disputes. Mattereum’s arbitration mechanisms would be in place both to resolve any claims or grievances that arise, and enable governing powers to enforce resolutions with all due authority and means. Streamlining such otherwise onerous processes will both reduce administrative and legal costs for all parties, as well as allay fears of time and resources wasted should a dispute&nbsp;arise.</p><p>The positive impacts would be considerable. Political benefits would be significant, as parent states which are not currently influential players on the world stage would gain influential partnerships in the wider international community. They would also have a greater voice in world affairs by virtue of the confederation’s collective actions. The economic benefits would be equally striking. Member companies would dramatically reduce administrative and legal costs, and would also see increased profits as clients are attracted to the reduction of costs and hassle which would come from working with members. Furthermore, the necessary digital infrastructure would already be in place within member FEZs, allowing businesses to plug into existing systems rather than building them from the ground up. Parent states would also reap commercial benefits through greater internal economic activity and increases in&nbsp;FDI.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest impact of a Digital Hansa would be the advent of a new commercial ecosystem. The confederation imagined here would create a new global standard of business conduct which would dramatically strengthen relationships between companies and clients. If a company is ‘Hansa’-backed, no matter its location or its jurisdiction, clients could know exactly what that means, and proceed with confidence. As the original Hansa ushered in a period of previously unprecedented commercial cooperation and prosperity for the Holy Roman Empire, a Digital Hansa stands ready to do the same for the&nbsp;world.”</p><p>Over the last year or so, I have written pieces about how the innovation created by Mattereum, the <a href="https://mattereum.com/how-it-works/">Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP)</a> can help bring about <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/why-global-trade-needs-the-blockchain-e1a380f5df2">limitless ecommerce</a>, how it can <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/ai-oracles-super-empower-real-world-assets-on-the-blockchain-and-super-empower-ai-to-act-in-the-619aa2ba5bf1">help AI </a>revolutionise the way we do business, how it can enable not only a circular economy but the more efficient and realistic <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/making-the-spiral-economy-a-reality-8a5930cc80cd">spiral economy</a> as well as how it can transform the trade in real world assets through <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/fractional-ownership-rwa-daos-and-the-holy-grail-557b99e8e045">tokenization and fractionalization</a>, and now I am talking network state. I sometimes feel we could be seen as just jumping on the latest bandwagon to catch the eye of VCs looking for the flavour of the month, but then I realise that we are just showing different facets of the same&nbsp;thing.</p><blockquote>We are showing different facets of the same&nbsp;thing</blockquote><p>Mattereum’s innovation is deep and profound; it took six years and several million pounds to get our system to work, it was not easy, and no one else has come close to achieving the same thing, but it is working, and has been live and serving customers for over two years&nbsp;now.</p><p>By creating a connection between a token on the blockchain and a physical thing in the real world that will stand up in court in 172 jurisdictions worldwide we have made something that will provide the deep foundations for trade in the future. It really can make ecommerce faster and smoother by removing the majority of the barriers to high value transactions. The same thing makes it possible for AI to recognise that the digital twin of a physical object really does represent something in the real world and to enable the tracking of objects through their lives so they can be reused and recycled efficiently. In addition, by being able to facilitate the tokenization and fractionalization of physical assets with ownership firmly established, it does utterly change the way things like <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/revolutionising-real-estate-with-the-blockchain-a9a90afd7d3d">real estate</a> and<a href="https://mattereum.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/The_Case_for_Gold_on_the_Blockchain.pdf"> gold</a> can be traded. So too, can it provide a way for network states to manage physical assets that enhances their function, and there will be other things it can revolutionise too, it’s just waiting for people to identify the potential.</p><blockquote>The MAP is deep infrastructure, like railway lines or HTML; it does the same thing, whatever the traffic you choose to run on it, and it has the potential to change the future just as&nbsp;much.</blockquote><p>If you are working on a project that you think could be enhanced by the Mattereum system get in touch with us via <a href="mailto:contact@mattereum.com">contact@mattereum.com</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/the-network-state-and-the-digital-hansa-bfccf8df0097">The Network State and the Digital Hansa</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			<p>14th November, Luxembourg – &nbsp;Today holds dual significance: not only does it mark the launch of <a href="https://www.artsgain.com/en/">Artsgain</a>‘s groundbreaking tokenized blue-chip art fund, but it’s also the birth anniversary of the legendary artist, Claude Monet. </p>
<p>A trailblazer, Monet forever changed the way we perceive art. In the same pioneering spirit, Artsgain’s tokenized fund will introduce unprecedented liquidity avenues for art investors, echoing Monet’s revolutionary essence in today’s financial world.</p>
<p>Artsgain, a Barcelona-based VC firm specializing in high-quality blue-chip investment funds featuring art, antiques, and collectibles from globally renowned artists, is excited to partner with <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, a leading enterprise-tokenization platform, to make their vision of increasing liquidity for these one-of-a-kind assets a reality.</p>
<p>Historically speaking, art has been an exclusive asset class which can be attributed to its limited access and significant initial capital requirements, making it challenging for many to participate and even more frustrating knowing that the art market has been consistently outperforming many other asset classes.</p>
<p>In fact, since the year 2000, the art market, categorized by blue-chip artists’ performance, has statistically proven a higher return than popular indices like the Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 by a multiple of 3x proving to be a great diversification strategy.</p>
<p>Artsgain is on a mission to transform the art market by offering tokenized shares, in order to improve liquidity and create a secondary market for its tokenized art securities. Their collaboration with Tokeny aims to simplify the investment process, guiding investors seamlessly into the world of blue-chip art.</p>
<p>By seamlessly integrating the open-source permissioned token standard ERC3643 via Tokeny’s platform, Artsgain not only assures regulatory compliance within the EU securities regulation framework under MiFID, but also fosters enhanced liquidity for art assets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tokenization allows for easier trading and transferability of art-related tokens, leading to improved liquidity in the market. The innovation offers new opportunities for shares in the art fund while maintaining compliance standards at the smart contract level.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Artsgain emphasizes the ESG components of its operations: from transporting to managing artworks in a sustainable way, dedicated 0.3% of the funds to NGOs for disabled artists, and positive screening for women artists.&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
    We are excited to support Artsgain in the world of art investing with our cutting-edge software. Art, like technology, is an ever-evolving canvas of innovation and creativity. Our tokenization solution will empower them to navigate this intricate masterpiece, providing the tools they need to blend the brushstrokes of finance with the vibrant palette of the art world, creating a masterpiece of investment success.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny       Our intent is clear: we aim to be inclusive and environmentally conscious while providing unparalleled investment opportunities. The world of art has for too long been an enclave for a select few. By leveraging technology and our deep expertise in art, we are democratizing access, ensuring more people can appreciate, invest in, and benefit from these incredible assets.  Xavier OlivellaCEO of Artsgain

It's one thing to discuss the theoretical aspects of Web5, with its focus on decentralization and user empowerment, but it's another to see tangible, innovative applications come to life. This is why builders, visionaries, and project maintainers at TBD are excited to showcase <a href="https://www.netonomy.io/">Netonomy</a>, a <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/">Web5</a> project built by <a href="https://github.com/demattosanthony">Anthony Dimatteo</a>.</p> What is Netonomy?<a title="Direct link to What is Netonomy?">​</a> <p>Anthony describes Netonomy as "an application that allows users and organizations to own their digital identities, data, and finances." The goal is to give users a digital home for their identity, data, and assistants - all under their control and not dependent on centralized platforms. Netonomy leverages Web5 concepts for data management and storage, but it also incorporates artificial intelligence through vector databases. </p><p>Here's how it works from a user perspective: a user can upload any document, from developer documentation to rental insurance information. Then, the user asks an AI-powered chat assistant questions about details within the document, such as "When does my rental insurance expire?" Subsequently, the chat assistant would quickly search the document and respond to the user.</p> Which Web5 technologies does Netonomy use?<a title="Direct link to Which Web5 technologies does Netonomy use?">​</a> <p>Anthony used the following Web5 technologies to build Netonomy:</p>  <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers">Decentralized Identifiers (DID)</a> - The app generates a DID to identify you when you first launch it. This is stored in the browser and acts as your identity.  <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes">Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN)</a> - A DWN is created in the browser to store your data encrypted securely. Anthony uses it to store uploaded files.   Future plans<a title="Direct link to Future plans">​</a> <p>There are many cool features Anthony wants to explore next, including:</p>  Decentralized vector databases - When you upload files like PDFs, the content is extracted and indexed in a vector database. Vectors allow data developers to embed data for meaning and quickly queried. The vector database is centralized, for now, hosted by Anthony. But he wants to eventually decentralize it by storing vectors directly in the DWN   Data sharing - Via protocols to share files with other DID owners  Payments - Integrate Bitcoin and blockchain payments  Contacts directory - Manage contacts via DIDs  Messages - Decentralized messaging between DWNs  Mobile app - Bundle DWN in a mobile app for access across devices   Check it out!<a title="Direct link to Check it out!">​</a> <p>To accelerate development, Anthony plans to open-source the project and invite community contributions. You can check out <a href="https://github.com/Netonomy/netonomy">Netonomy on GitHub</a>. </p> Rewatch the full episode<a title="Direct link to Rewatch the full episode">​</a> <p>Learn more about what he's building and watch the full live stream <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQ9Vq_Moa8I">here</a>.</p>

<p>Employers in particular are torn between giving in to the tempting benefits of this technology while, at the same time, they have to live up to their responsibility towards the law, regulations such as ESG, their organizations and their digital assets, the society and the duty of care towards their employees.

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 31st October to 13th&nbsp;November <p>Welcome to our latest Veriscope Regulatory Recap. In this edition, we dive into Turkey’s planned crypto regulations aimed at exiting the FATF grey list, the UK’s focus on stablecoins, New York’s task force on digital currencies, and the SEC’s call for clearer crypto rules. Let’s dive&nbsp;in!</p> Emerging Global Trends in Crypto Regulation <p>The landscape of cryptocurrency regulation is undergoing significant changes worldwide, with countries and regulatory bodies adapting to the evolving digital asset&nbsp;market.</p><p>Turkey’s Regulatory Push: Turkey is moving towards introducing new legislation for crypto-assets. This step is aimed at strengthening anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing efforts. The nation’s goal is to exit the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) “grey list,” indicating its commitment to addressing strategic deficiencies in its financial systems.</p><p>UK’s Stablecoin Focus: In the UK, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England are seeking public feedback on their approach to regulating stablecoins. They aim to balance the potential benefits of stablecoins for faster, cheaper payments with the need to protect consumers and maintain financial stability.</p><a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1722289568563531909?s=20">Image Source</a><p>New York’s Exploratory Task Force: New York is proposing a task force to study the impacts of digital currency and blockchain industries. This initiative aims to guide the state in addressing the challenges and harnessing the opportunities presented by these emerging technologies.</p><p>SEC’s Call for Clearer Crypto Rules: At the SEC Regulation Outside the United States conference, Commissioner Mart Uyeda stressed the importance of providing definitive rules and guidance for the cryptocurrency market rather than relying solely on enforcement actions. This stance highlights the ongoing debate over the classification and regulation of digital assets as securities.</p><p>These developments signify a global trend towards more structured and comprehensive cryptocurrency regulatory frameworks. As nations and regulatory bodies navigate this complex and dynamic field, the focus should remain on ensuring consumer protection, market integrity, and fostering responsible innovation within the digital asset ecosystem.</p> Turkish Government Proposes New Crypto Laws to Address FATF Compliance Gaps <p>Turkey is on a mission to revamp its stance on cryptocurrency regulation in a bid to shake off the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) “grey list” label, a designation underscoring the country’s previous shortcomings in anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) practices.</p><p>Recognizing the importance of addressing these critical areas, Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek has announced imminent legislative proposals targeting the crypto sector, marking a significant step towards aligning with 39 of the 40 FATF standards.</p> Impact on the Crypto Ecosystem <p>Turkey’s push to strengthen AML and CTF regulations in the crypto sector could greatly enhance investor confidence, making the market safer and more attractive for investment. Additionally, aligning with FATF standards may ease Turkey’s integration into the global crypto economy, allowing for smoother international crypto transactions and partnerships.</p><p>On the flip side, the upcoming legislative changes could also bring a wave of uncertainty for crypto businesses operating in Turkey, as the specifics remain unclear. This could create challenges in compliance and strategic planning. Furthermore, the new laws might impose rigorous compliance requirements on crypto entities, potentially stifling innovation and adding to operational costs.</p><p>Overall, as Turkey advances toward legal reform, the global financial and crypto communities remain watchful. The outcome of these regulations will not only influence Turkey’s financial standing but also set a precedent for how emerging markets should navigate the intricate balance between innovation and regulatory compliance in the digital asset&nbsp;space.</p> New York State Senate Pushes for Crypto Task&nbsp;Force <p>In a significant move, New York State Senate Banking Committee Chair James Sanders is advocating for a proactive approach towards digital currency, cryptocurrency, and blockchain industries. Sanders proposes a 16-member task force, appointed by the governor and the Legislature, to comprehensively study these sectors. This includes examining their impacts on state tax revenues, energy consumption, and the environmental implications of digital&nbsp;mining.</p><p>Mike Lomas of the Financial Guys supports minimal regulation in general but suggests more oversight in the crypto sphere, especially for currencies not traded on public exchanges. Drawing parallels with the dot-com bubble, Lomas advocates for federal rather than state-level regulation, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding investments and banking stability.</p> Positive Aspects: <p>New York’s approach, characterized by forward-thinking, can catalyze enhanced comprehension and regulation of digital currencies. This initiative positions New York potentially as a frontrunner in the evolving crypto industry. With its balanced perspective, the Task Force strives to marry regulatory needs with the acknowledgment of the burgeoning industry’s potential, thereby nurturing responsible growth within this&nbsp;domain.</p> Negative Aspects: <p>However, the path toward new regulations may breed uncertainty among crypto businesses and investors. This could translate into a temporary deceleration in market dynamics within New York. Additionally, there lies a risk of potential overregulation.</p><p>An overly cautious regulatory approach could echo the apprehensions reminiscent of the dot-com era, inadvertently stifling innovation in the crypto sector.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p>Every organization, regardless of size or industry, needs an agile and modern Identity and Access Management (IAM) platform. As the cybersecurity threat landscape continues to evolve, so do the requirements for IAM. Managing identities and access is essential to ensure that only the right people have access to the right resources at the right time for the right reasons. However, the transition to a modern IAM solution will be smoother and more secure if the basic components of Zero Trust are implemented first, such as SSO, MFA, and dynamic authentication and authorization policies. TrustBuilder’s fine-grained access control and flexible authentication methods provide customers with a scalable solution that caters to the needs of organizations seeking to implement a Zero Trust security model.

  <p>Matthias is joined by cybersecurity expert Warwick Ashford to unravel the complexities surrounding Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) security in the face of rising ransomware attacks. The discussion initiates with an overview of RDP's functionality and its indispensable role in modern businesses. They delve into the reasons behind RDP's susceptibility to cyber-attacks, accentuated by the remote work surge during the pandemic. The conversation takes a critical turn as it explores the precarious balance of remote accessibility and security, highlighting frequent oversights in RDP implementation.</p>
<p>Warwick sheds light on the alarming trend of RDP credential sales on the dark web, outlining the severe repercussions for lax security measures. The dialogue then shifts to pragmatic strategies, emphasizing the non-negotiables in RDP security protocols that companies must adopt. Reinforcing the concept of Zero Trust, Warwick advocates for its integration to enhance RDP security frameworks. The episode concludes with a forward-looking perspective, contemplating the evolution of remote access technologies and preemptive measures businesses must consider to thwart emerging cyber threats.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/preventing-unwanted-remote-control"></a>

<p>PCI DSS version 4.0 is the latest iteration of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, released on March 31, 2022, and is currently in effect. The previous version, PCI DSS version 3.2.1, will remain active until March 31, 2024, to give organizations time to adopt the latest version of the standard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PCI DSS stands for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. It is an information security standard designed to reduce payment card fraud by increasing security controls around cardholder data. The standard was created in 2004 by five major credit card companies: Visa, Mastercard, Discover, JCB, and American Express. The primary goal of PCI DSS is to safeguard and optimize the security of sensitive cardholder data, such as credit card numbers, expiration dates, and security codes.</p>
<p>The standard’s security controls help businesses minimize the risk of data breaches, fraud, and identity theft. Compliance with PCI DSS also ensures that businesses adhere to industry best practices when processing, storing, and transmitting credit card data. The standard applies to all entities that store, process, or transmit cardholder data and/or sensitive authentication data. The standard is not a law but is enforced through contracts between merchants, acquiring banks that process payment card transactions, and the payment brands.</p>
<p>The latest iteration of the PCI DSS – version 4.0 – was released at the end of March 2022. The standard provides specific, actionable guidance on protecting payment card data, which can be applied to organizations of any size or type that use any method of processing or storing data.</p>
<p>Let’s review some of the key differences between PCI DSS version 4.0 and the previous version:</p>
 
 Compensating Controls: PCI DSS 4.0 replaces the concept of compensating controls with customized implementations, which provides organizations greater flexibility in how they meet the standards. 
 Security Needs: PCI DSS 4.0 aims to address developing threats and technologies, facilitate more effective ways to combat new threats to cardholder information, boost payment flexibility, and improve business procedures to meet security needs. 
 Continuous Security Processes: PCI DSS 4.0 focuses more on maintaining continuous security processes. 
 Validation Methods and Procedures: PCI DSS 4.0 enhances validation methods and procedures. 
 Flexibility: PCI DSS 4.0 adds flexibility and support for alternative approaches to achieve security. 
 
<p>PCI DSS version 4.0 addresses emerging threats and technologies by focusing on four core goals:</p>
 
 Ensuring that the standard meets the security needs of an evolving payment industry. 
 Promoting continuous security processes. 
 Enhancing validation methods and procedures. 
 Adding flexibility and support for alternative approaches to achieve security. 
 
<p>To achieve these goals, PCI DSS 4.0 introduces new requirements and modifies existing ones to address potential vulnerabilities and reinforce the security posture of organizations. Some of the changes include:</p>
 
 Detection and protection against phishing attacks. 
 More stringent password requirements. 
 Multi-factor authentication. 
 All vendor and third-party accounts must only be used when needed and continuously monitored for vulnerabilities and security risks. 
 
<p>PCI DSS 4.0 also places greater emphasis on security results, giving businesses greater flexibility to select the security technologies and methods that are suitable for their particular environment. The standard aims to continue to evolve to meet the changing needs of the payment card industry and the new technologies being implemented daily.</p>
<p>1Kosmos can help you meet these new requirements specifically, the MFA and password requirements PCI DSS 4.0 requires. The new and more stringent authentication requirements are designed to improve the security of cardholder data by making it more difficult for unauthorized users to access systems and networks.</p>
<p>The following are the key authentication requirements for PCI DSS 4.0:</p>
 
 Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is required for all remote access to the cardholder data environment (CDE), as well as for all non-console administrative access to the CDE from within the entity’s network. MFA is also required for all access to the CDE from cloud-based or hosted systems. 
 Passwords must be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Passwords must be reset every 90 days and cannot be reused. 
 Account lockout must be implemented to prevent brute-force attacks. After a maximum of 10 unsuccessful login attempts, users must be locked out for at least 30 minutes or until they verify their identity through the help desk or other means. 
 Strong authentication mechanisms must be used for all privileged accounts. This includes using MFA and/or complex passwords. 
 
<p>The approach we follow here at 1Kosmos ensures organizations can meet these requirements out of the box. Our elegant self-service KYC workflow is an innovative identity proofing and authentication solution designed to remove friction during onboarding to accelerate customer acquisition. We then give those customers a convenient digital wallet that eliminates account takeover and financial fraud and matches the authentication method to the risk associated with the activity.</p>
<p>With 1Kosmos organizations will authenticate users via any of our methods depending on the business need, the risk profile of the activity, and the security requirement for each access request. These methods include:&nbsp; a phishing-proof real biometric – LiveID and device biometrics plus, push message, email/SMS/Token, 3rd party hardware token, Windows Hello, and Mac TouchID.</p>
<p>All user data is encrypted, and (for the highest level of security) stored in a distributed ledger compliant to the W3C DID standard. As such, they are accessible only via a FIDO2 certified public/private key pair secured in the TPM/Secure Enclave of a device and under sole control of the user, typically via their live biometric selfie, made possible by our innovative LiveID feature. The distributed ledger also provides immutable audit logs to prove every transaction.&nbsp;</p>

				  The Essence of Ecosystems 
<p>Ecosystems aren’t just about a collection of apps and platforms; they’re about the roles and activities within that ecosystem. Ecosystem governance dictates what’s encouraged, what’s allowed, and what’s forbidden. It’s the set of rules that govern how different players interact, collaborate, and contribute value to the ecosystem.</p>
 Beyond Platforms: Ecosystems vs. Platforms 
<p>Darrell made a clear distinction between ecosystems and platforms. While platforms may be a component of an ecosystem, they are not enough to define an ecosystem. Platforms primarily focus on technical interactions, such as how things work and data flow. However, ecosystems encompass a broader scope, including governance, compliance, liability, and more. The actual value of ecosystems lies in the business and governance aspects.</p>
 Minimum Viable Ecosystem vs. Minimum Viable Product 
<p>We often hear about Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) in the agile world. An MVP is a learning, exploring, and prototyping tool, but it’s not the final product. On the other hand, a Minimum Viable Ecosystem (MVE) is about delivering a real value proposition. It’s not about exploration but about having tangible value. MVEs aim to attract and align partners within the ecosystem to fulfill different roles and activities, as no single company can do it all.</p>
 Ecosystem Governance Frameworks 
<p>Ecosystems can be complex, and their governance is crucial. Darrell emphasized the importance of ecosystem governance frameworks, which help organizations understand where they fit, what value they add, and where opportunities lie. These frameworks also highlight gaps in the ecosystem that require new roles or partners to fill. Governance frameworks address compliance, liability, and other governance issues that drive value within ecosystems.</p>
 The Trust Continuum™: Tools for Ecosystem Governance 
<p>Darrell introduced the Trust Continuum™ Tools, a toolbox designed in-house to assist organizations in navigating the complexities of ecosystem governance. These tools are not only useful for governance but can also be applied in various scenarios:</p>
 
 Product and Platform Design 
 Product Strategy&nbsp; 
 Interoperability and Conformance Testing 
 
<p>These powerful resources will support your journey in building successful Minimum Viable Ecosystems and establishing effective Ecosystem Governance Frameworks. You can access the entire Trust Continuum™ Toolbox <a href="https://mailchi.mp/continuumloop/tctools">here</a>.</p>
 Influence over Control 
<p>The mantra of “Control only what you must, influence the rest” underscores the importance of understanding where strict governance is needed and where influence can lead to positive outcomes. By applying the Trust Continuum™ tools and principles, organizations can navigate the intricate world of ecosystems and drive value in this dynamic landscape.</p>
 <p>Control only what you must - influence the rest<br><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp3XwXg-Tgg&amp;text=Control%20only%20what%20you%20must%20-%20influence%20the%20rest&amp;via=continuumloop&amp;related=continuumloop">Click To Tweet</a><br></p> 
<p>Darrell’s presentation sheds light on the critical aspects of ecosystem governance and provides practical tools for organizations to navigate and excel in this complex arena. Ecosystems are the future of business, and understanding how to govern them effectively is essential for success. With the right knowledge and tools, organizations can unlock the power of ecosystems and thrive in the ever-evolving digital landscape.</p>

  <p>We‘ve repeatedly emphasized the importance of multifactor authentication (MFA) and emphasized that not all MFA is equal – the Authenticator is much more secure than phone authentication (so hang up!). Through the implementation of number matching, we've successfully thwarted criminals engaging in MFA fatigue attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this has been very effective, attackers attempting these methods can still annoy users, and Authenticator prompts—while extremely helpful when a user is trying to log in—can provide a “hook” for social phishing when triggered by a hacker. In response to this, we took additional steps to keep users happy and secure by suppressing Authenticator pop-up notifications when a request is anomalous. The rollout of these changes was completed at the end of September, and we’ve successfully reduced the number of otherwise unworthy notifications. We've prevented more than 6 million passwordless and MFA notifications since the deployment began. By the vast majority, these were hacker-initiated notifications serving no value to customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 About Suppressing Risky Authenticator Notifications&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the deployment of this feature, we now suppress Authenticator notifications when a request displays potential risks, such as when it originates from an unfamiliar location or is exhibiting other anomalies. This approach significantly reduces user inconvenience by eliminating irrelevant authentication prompts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;When everything looks acceptable, users receive notifications on their mobile devices as depicted below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in the event of a login request that looks risky to us, the standard notification will not be sent to the user. Instead, they’ll be given the following instructions: “Open your Authenticator app and enter the number shown to sign in,” with no corresponding notification displayed on the user's phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the user opens their Authenticator app, it will present the request, allowing the user to take appropriate action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the user opens the Authenticator App, the request will be available for the user:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Retrieving Authenticator Notifications&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the notifications are not deleted. They’re simply suppressed and can still be accessed by the user within the Authenticator App. If a user encounters a genuine request from an unusual source, they can retrieve the notification by accessing their authenticator app. The app serves as a repository for all authenticator notifications, ensuring users have a convenient way to retrieve any missed requests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Implementation of this feature has led to a smoother and more secure experience for users. As technology evolves, enhancing user convenience while also enhancing security is crucial, and this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-authenticator-app">new approach</a> is a great example.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The FATF Travel Rule makes it mandatory for VASPs, including crypto exchanges, digital wallets, custodial services, etc., to exchange specific customer data when transacting crypto assets above a predefined threshold.</p><p>As more countries implement the Travel Rule, the onus is on VASPs to adopt solutions that adeptly manage detailed customer information exchanges — without slowing down transactions or infringing on user privacy. It’s a delicate balance, and the right solution must navigate these requirements deftly.</p><p>This article will unpack the core attributes these solutions should have to equip VASPs for compliance in a way that aligns with the fast-moving nature of the digital asset industry.</p> Easy Integration <p>Travel Rule solutions must have a straightforward integration process within the diverse technological setups of VASPs. They should offer plug-and-play capabilities that require minimal adjustments to existing infrastructure, ensuring that different data formats, tech stacks, or protocols are harmonized effortlessly. Their aim should be to help VASPs meet their compliance obligations without the burden of significant system overhauls or operational downtime.</p> Highest Security and Encryption Standards <p>Travel Rule Compliance Solutions must empower VASPs to efficiently manage transactions with counterparts, in line with FATF Recommendation 16. These solutions must protect sensitive exchanged information with the highest security standards, prioritizing data&nbsp;safety.</p><p>Robust data security and encryption protocols are not just beneficial but essential to prevent breaches. Secure data transmission channels are equally crucial to safeguard user information from unauthorized access.</p><p>This is why leading Travel Rule Solutions incorporate stringent security practices, including sophisticated encryption and secure data transmission channels. They equip users with robust control over data exchanges, allowing for the approval or denial of transfer requests, thereby safeguarding customer data with the highest level of security.</p> Interoperability <p>There are several Travel Rule Protocols worldwide, with differing approaches to collecting Originator and Beneficiary information and how they handle transactions with self-hosted wallets. Interoperability within Travel Rule Compliance Solutions is essential in bridging these differences, enabling secure and efficient information exchange.</p><p>That’s where <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Shyft Veriscope</a> comes into the picture, as its approach to interoperability directly addresses the fragmented nature of global Travel Rule Protocols. By integrating with various Travel Rule Solutions and blockchain analytics providers, Shyft Veriscope creates a network that supports diverse fund-transfer thresholds and the intricate requirements for Originator and Beneficiary information.</p> Automated <p>Automation is a critical component of an effective Travel Rule solution. It streamlines processes, reduces the potential for human error, and speeds up the identification and verification of VASPs at an entity level. An automated system supports real-time discovery and confirmation of counterparty entities, essential for maintaining compliance and operational efficiency.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope’s capabilities exemplify this automated approach. By utilizing just the crypto wallet address, Shyft Veriscope’s system can automatically detect counterparty VASPs in real time, negating the need for manual entry of additional information or the publication of wallet addresses by VASPs. This not only simplifies the process but also enhances security and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>Additionally, Shyft Veriscope’s automated address proofing validates the accuracy of the VASP identified, mitigating the risk of data breaches due to incorrect data sharing. This system provides a reliable framework for the identification of counterparties, respecting both legal entity and jurisdictional considerations.</p> Dealing With Sunrise Issues Effectively <p>The “Sunrise Issue” refers to the staggered global implementation of the Travel Rule. Since countries adopt the FATF’s Travel Rule at different times, VASPs in jurisdictions where the rule is already enforced may need to exchange information with VASPs in places where it’s not required yet. This time lag creates a challenge: how to ensure compliance when not all parties are subject to the same regulations at the same&nbsp;time.</p><p>Shyft Veriscope addresses the Sunrise Issue with its innovative “historic look back” capability. This feature allows VASPs to comply retroactively by obtaining transaction information even if it occurred before the counterparty had implemented a Travel Rule solution. When a new VASP joins Veriscope, it can respond to past information requests, thus ensuring compliance continuity. This solution not only bridges the compliance timing gap but also facilitates a seamless transition as new jurisdictions come online with the Travel Rule, maintaining the integrity of the global VASP&nbsp;network.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>The right Travel Rule solution blends simplicity, security, adaptability, and foresight. It should effortlessly merge with existing systems, uphold the strictest security, ensure seamless communication across global protocols, automate complex processes, and skillfully handle the staggered adoption of regulations worldwide. Shyft Veriscope rises to these challenges, providing VASPs with a forward-thinking compliance partner as dynamic as the industry.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>In May of this year, Deloitte announced the integration of KILT for creating new markets with reusable KYC (Know Your Customer) and KYB (Know Your Business) digital credentials. The first Deloitte credentials are now&nbsp;live!</p><p>KYC/KYB credentials are increasingly required for regulatory reasons to verify the identity of an individual or existence of a business. Typically, these credentials are paper-based and single-use. Deloitte has now harnessed the power of the KILT blockchain to reimagine the process of issuing KYC and KYB credentials, making it more efficient and giving the user sovereignty over their personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>Deloitte used solutions “Built on KILT” that mean it could create a service built on blockchain without having to deal with cryptocurrencies or needing blockchain experience.</p><p>The Enterprise Service, provided by KILT partner <a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/">BTE BOTLabs Trusted Entity</a>, enables enterprises to pay in advance via bank transfer for a large volume of blockchain transactions, which can then be processed over time as needed. No cryptocurrency is needed by the enterprise or their customers.</p><p>Applications that interact with the blockchain can be <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/the-kilt-suite-introducing-opendid-and-the-ctype-hub-dbe5bc769560">built without blockchain knowledge</a> using the TypeScript software development kit (SDK) and code examples, or by adapting existing open source applications. Deloitte created its own digital wallet for managing credentials based on the KILT Sporran wallet (a browser extension).</p><p>Users can follow the Deloitte process to get a decentralized identifier (DID; a string of letters and numbers unique to that user) which forms the <a href="https://www.kilt.io/identity/decentralized-identifiers">core of their identity</a>. Once the information provided for KYC/KYB is approved, the credential is attested by Deloitte, linked to that DID. To maintain privacy, the user always retains control of their DID and credential in their personal wallet on their own&nbsp;device.</p><p>This reduces the need for centralized storage of credentials and puts the user in charge of their own data. The user decides who they share the credential with and how much information in the credential they share (selective disclosure). Only a hash representing the data is stored on the blockchain, keeping the information private. The credential can later be revoked using this hash when the information is no longer&nbsp;valid.</p><p>We are delighted to see credentials “Built on KILT” in action. The <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/polimec-and-deloitte-switzerland-introduce-new-kyc-credentials-to-enhance-regulatory-compliant-5a6bb0654dd4">first use case</a> has already been announced, with more to follow shortly.

This higher baseline sales also makes Volume DF and Passive DF more attractive.</p> 1. Introduction <p><a href="https://predictoor.ai">Ocean Predictoor</a> data feeds predict whether BTC, ETH etc will rise or fall 5min or 1h into the future. Such feeds are alpha to traders. These feeds are crowdsourced by “predictoors”: people running AI-powered prediction bots. Predictoors earn from sales of the feeds (to traders) and from stake reshuffling ($ going from incorrect predictoors to correct ones). Predictoor’s longer-term vision is 10,000 feeds, going beyond finance to weather, agriculture, and&nbsp;more.</p><p>Predictoor is a product built by <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> core team. Predictoor smart contracts run on <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/sapphire">Oasis Sapphire</a>, the only privacy-preserving EVM chain in production. The Ocean and Oasis core teams collaborate closely&nbsp;❤️.</p><p><a href="https://df.oceandao.org/">Data Farming</a> (DF) is Ocean’s incentive program. It rewards OCEAN to participants who lock OCEAN into veOCEAN, curate data, or make predictions — all in the name of driving data consume volume (DCV). DF is organized into two streams: Passive DF and Active DF. Passive DF allows for passive earning potential. Active DF requires more engagement; it has several substreams.</p><p><a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf">Predictoor Data Farming</a> is a new substream of Active Data Farming. It amplifies existing predictoors’ earnings based on their accuracy and stake. It does so by basically contributing extra sales to Ocean Predictoor data feeds. Let’s dive&nbsp;in!</p> 2. Predictoor DF&nbsp;Timing <p>Predictoor DF starts counting on Nov 9, 2023, at the beginning of Data Farming Round 62 (DF62). It runs indefinitely.</p> 3. Predictoor DF Reward&nbsp;Amounts <p>Predictoor DF has two components: <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/about-us/ocean-token">OCEAN</a> rewards and <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">Oasis ROSE</a> rewards. Here are&nbsp;details:</p>  OCEAN payouts of 37,000 OCEAN/week, ongoing. <br> — A special “DF buyer” bot purchases Predictoor feeds. It starts operating on Nov 9. Every day, it spends 1/7 of the weekly Predictoor OCEAN budget for another 24h subscription. It spends an equal amount per feed. (Currently there are 20 feeds: 10 x 5min, 10 x 1h.) <br> — The OCEAN comes from the Ocean DF budget, as part of the 75,000 OCEAN/week for Active DF. The Volume DF budget has been adjusted to 37,000 OCEAN/week, and Challenge DF to 1,000 OCEAN/week. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e#a171">Here</a> are&nbsp;details.  ROSE payouts of 100,000 ROSE/week for the first 4 weeks. <br> — Payout is at the end of the DF round. Therefore there will be payouts at the end of DF62, DF63, DF64, and DF65. Payout for a given predictoor is pro-rata to the net earnings of that predictoor over that DF round, specifically (total sales $ to the predictoor) minus (predictoor stake slashed due to being wrong). <br> — The ROSE comes from a generous contribution of <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/">Oasis Protocol Foundation</a> 👪🙏.  <p>For further details about DF more generally, including DF stream budgets, see <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards">Data Farming docs</a> and “<a href="http://Here%20are%20details.">Ocean Data Farming Main is Here</a>” blog&nbsp;post.</p> 4. How to Earn $ Via Predictoor DF  4.1 How to become a predictoor <p>Simple, run your own prediction bot!&nbsp;🤖</p>  Play with the dapp: <a href="http://predictoor.ai">http://predictoor.ai</a>  Then follow <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/predictoor/pdr-earn">Predictoor usage guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs  Or, go straight to <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/predictoor.md">the quickstart README</a>&nbsp;:)&nbsp;🏎️   4.2 On OCEAN Rewards in Predictoor DF   Duration: ongoing  To be eligible: predictoors are automatically eligible&nbsp;🧘  To claim: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4.3 On $ROSE rewards in Predictoor DF   Duration: Runs 4 DF rounds — DF62, DF63, DF64, DF65. Limited&nbsp;time!  ⚠️ To be eligible for a given DF round: you MUST run Predictoor $OCEAN payout script &lt;= 4 days after the round ends, i.e. between Thu 00:00 UTC &amp; Sun 11:59 PM&nbsp;UTC  To claim: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs   5. How to Earn More $ Via Passive DF &amp; Volume&nbsp;DF <p>Predictoor DF makes Active DF more attractive, and in turn Passive DF. Let’s zoom&nbsp;in.</p><p>First, we review Passive DF and Volume DF (details&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-main-is-here-49c99602419e">here</a>):</p>  Passive DF has 75K OCEAN weekly rewards budget. To participate, one locks OCEAN for <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-veocean-c5f416c1f9a0">veOCEAN</a>. Rewards to a user are pro-rata to the user’s veOCEAN holdings.  Volume DF has 37K OCEAN weekly rewards budget. To participate in Volume DF, one allocates veOCEAN towards data assets. Rewards to a user are higher for more veOCEAN allocated, and for more DCV on the data asset that’s allocated to (DCV = Data Consume&nbsp;Volume).  <p>Predictoor DF makes Volume DF more attractive than status quo, because the volume-based bounds on weekly rewards trends tend to be qualitatively higher for prediction feeds. (See the Appendix for details.)</p><p>Curating is straightforward. Ocean assets with high DCV are easy to identify: it’s the 20 OPF-published prediction feeds. This makes the choice of veOCEAN allocation easy: point to those 20 assets&nbsp;[2].</p><p>Doing Volume DF gives Passive DF rewards too, of&nbsp;course.</p><p>The net result: Predictoor DF means earnings potential from Predictoor DF, Volume DF, and Passive&nbsp;DF.</p> 6. Conclusion <p>A “predictoor” runs AI-powered prediction bots in the <a href="https://predictoor.ai">Ocean Predictoor</a> ecosystem. They onboard <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/predictoor.md">here</a>. They earn $ from sales of prediction feeds; higher accuracy and higher stake mean higher&nbsp;$.</p><p>Predictoor DF is a new incentives program that amplifies predictoors’ earnings, via extra sales to Ocean Predictoor data feeds. Predictoor DF has 37K OCEAN weekly rewards (ongoing) and 100K ROSE rewards (first 4&nbsp;weeks).</p><p>The higher baseline sales makes Volume DF and Passive more attractive.</p><p>Challenge DF rewards are reduced, and will wind down soon; the Appendix has&nbsp;details.</p><p>To read more: <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/predictoor">Predictoor docs</a>, all <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-predictoor-series-6a9122754a4d">Predictoor blog&nbsp;posts</a>.</p> Appendix: Updates to Challenge DF <p>Challenge DF rewards are reduced, and will wind down soon. Here are&nbsp;details.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-challenge-data-farming-378bba28fc97">Challenge DF was introduced &amp; shipped</a> in July 2023 in DF Round 48 (DF48). It was always conceived as an onboarding mechanism to becoming a predictoor, ie someone who runs a bot predicting ETH and more within the <a href="https://predictoor.ai">Ocean Predictoor</a> ecosystem. Since Predictoor was introduced, predictoor onboarding has greatly improved. It’s no longer worth doing Challenge DF first. So let’s simplify:)</p><p>Therefore, since the launch of Challenge DF, there are two important updates.</p>  Reduced payouts. As of DF62, Challenge DF payouts are reduced from 5000 OCEAN / week to 1000 OCEAN / week. DF62 counting starts on Nov 9, 2023 and concludes on Nov 16, 2023. (Predictoor DF is introduced in DF62.) The Active DF budget is 37K / 37K / 1K OCEAN for Volume / Predictoor / Challenge DF respectively.  Wind-down. DF65 is the final round for Challenge DF. Starting in DF65, the 1000 OCEAN / week will be redistributed equally to Volume DF and Predictoor DF. The Active DF budget will37K / 37K / 1K OCEAN for Volume / Predictoor / Challenge DF respectively.  <p>For further details, see the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45">Ocean Data Farming Series</a> post, which includes “Predictoor DF” posts and other DF posts, all in chronological order.</p> Appendix: On DCV Bounds of Prediction Feeds <p>Predictoor DF makes Volume DF more attractive than status quo. Active DF’s rewards are bounded by DCV_bound which in turn is bound by sales volume and fees. In Predictoor DF, both those factors are raised; which raises the bounding in Volume DF; this in turn means higher earning potential. Let's elaborate.</p><p>At one time, Volume DF had a “wash consume” problem, where people published and consumed their own datasets. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-reward-function-tuned-d74b5134b5d1">DF9</a> onwards address this, by putting a bounds on weekly&nbsp;rewards:</p><blockquote>DCV_bound = DCV *&nbsp;m</blockquote><p>Where m = DCV_bounding_multiplier = Ocean community fee (0.1%) + publish market&nbsp;fee.</p><p>This stopped wash consume because it became unprofitable to do wash consume: fees eat up all potential profits.</p><p>A low DCV (data consume volume) or a low m (publish market fee) mean low DCV_bound.</p><p>Predictoor DF makes both DCV and m&nbsp;higher!</p>  DCV is higher: the 37K OCEAN/week counts as consume&nbsp;volume  m is higher: publish market fee is 20% for prediction feeds  <p>Therefore DCV_bound is higher. Specifically: DCV_bound = 37000 * (0.001 + 0.20) = 7437 OCEAN. In other words, at least 7437 OCEAN is available for Volume DF in any given&nbsp;week.</p> Notes <p>[1] Source of the $21K USD&nbsp;number:</p>  CoinGecko prices on Nov 8, 2023: $0.39 / <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol">OCEAN</a> and $0.065 /&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network">ROSE</a>  $0.39 / OCEAN * 17,000 OCEAN = $14,430&nbsp;USD  $0.065 / ROSE * 100,000 ROSE = $6,500&nbsp;USD  Total: $14,4300 + $6,500 = $20,930 ≈ $21K&nbsp;USD  <p>[2] The BTC/USDT 5m and 1h feeds follow the same Volume DF mechanics as the other feeds, despite being free on the&nbsp;webapp.</p><p>Details: the BTC feeds are priced at the smart contract level. The webapp receives datatokens for those feeds and makes the prediction values public. Because the BTC feeds are priced, then: their DCV is non-negligible; allocating veOCEAN to them makes sense; and Volume DF rewards accrue to them as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a>.

Here’s the latest from our development efforts.  SpruceIDSpruce    </a><p>At SpruceID, we’re letting users control their identity and data across the web. Here’s the latest from our development efforts:</p> SpruceKit <p><a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-sprucekit/">SpruceKit</a> is a collection of libraries that power your application to accept digital credentials from users on their terms, originate trusted information for users, and interact with user data vaults. SpruceKit consists of the following open-source libraries:</p>  Reference Wallet  SSX  Sign-in with Ethereum  DIDKit  TreeLDR  SpruceKit also provides access to Kepler and Rebase   OpenID and Reference Wallet <p>We are working on implementations of OID4VCI and OID4VP and have recently refactored them to match the latest version of the specifications (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/oid4vci-rs/pull/10?ref=blog.spruceid.com">oid4vci-rs#10</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/oid4vp-rs/pull/3?ref=blog.spruceid.com">oid4vp-rs#3</a>)</p><p>Work is underway to update our <a href="https://github.com/spruceid/wallet?ref=blog.spruceid.com">reference wallet</a> (formerly known as Credible Wallet) and refactor it as a collection of our mobile-related technologies which include credentials and keys management but also the OID4VCI protocols.</p> DIDKit/SSI <p>DIDKit provides Verifiable Credential and Decentralized Identifier functionality across different platforms. DIDKit's core libraries are written in Rust due to Rust's expressive type system, memory safety, simple dependency web, and suitability across different platforms, including embedded systems, but the comprehensive DIDKit SDK includes many libraries and interfaces for using it almost everywhere.</p>  Merged an initial implementation of SD-JWT (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/529?ref=blog.spruceid.com">ssi#529</a>)  A major refactor of ssi continues to be underway. This refactor will help us to better handle Linked Data and generally improve our implementation of the various Verifiable Credentials and Decentralised IDs specifications (<a href="https://github.com/spruceid/ssi/pull/508?ref=blog.spruceid.com">#508</a>). The general API redesign is over, and we are now rewriting all ssi tests and making sure the new implementation does not introduce regressions.   Rebase&nbsp;   Rebase was refactored to support multiple async runtimes, this allows developers to use Rebase in popular Rust async runtimes like Tokio. Before, it only supported WASM.  Rebase is being refactored to support witness flows without issuance. All previous issuance work will still be available, but developers will be able to use the witness flows to simply determine if a fact is true and no longer have to issue a credential at the conclusion of the flow. This supports more flexible implementations in apps that call Rebase libraries.   <p>About SpruceID: SpruceID lets users control their data across the web. SpruceID provides an ecosystem of open-source tools for developers that let users collect their data in one place that they control, and show their cards however they want.

 Change announcements: 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changes to FIDO2 authentication methods and Windows Hello for Business</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beginning January 2024, Microsoft Entra ID will support <a href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpasskeys.dev%2Fdocs%2Freference%2Fterms%2F%23device-bound-passkey&amp;data=05%7C01%7Csdriggers%40affirma.com%7C67b44af499d14988c81108dbd404460c%7C65265dd04b2044a4aca4b7ecbb143664%7C0%7C0%7C638336889010878570%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=%2BLpGtZFtGXHPKMbnR5ifT8fFFrl0nOCa3L4K87QgoQk%3D&amp;reserved=0">device-bound passkeys</a> stored on computers and mobile devices as an authentication method in public preview, in addition to the existing support for FIDO2 security keys. This enables your users to perform phishing-resistant authentication using the devices that they already have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will expand the existing FIDO2 authentication methods policy and end user experiences to support this preview release. For your organization to opt-in to this preview, you will need to enforce key restrictions to allow specified passkey providers in your FIDO2 policy. Learn more about FIDO2 key restrictions <a href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fazure%2Factive-directory%2Fauthentication%2Fhowto-authentication-passwordless-security-key&amp;data=05%7C01%7Csdriggers%40affirma.com%7C67b44af499d14988c81108dbd404460c%7C65265dd04b2044a4aca4b7ecbb143664%7C0%7C0%7C638336889010878570%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=ac9DQ7dxszepy0kftYRCNrGS4hqqwUq46SMrAPagpgc%3D&amp;reserved=0">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the existing end user sign-in option for Windows Hello and FIDO2 security keys will be renamed to “Face, fingerprint, PIN, or security key”. The term “passkey” will be mentioned in the updated sign-in experience to be inclusive of passkey credentials presented from security keys, computers, and mobile devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Azure AD Graph Updates</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following a three-year deprecation period, we <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/important-azure-ad-graph-retirement-and-powershell-module/ba-p/3848270">announced in June 2023</a> that we are entering the retirement, or shut down, cycle for Azure AD Graph APIs, which are now out of support (other than security-related fixes). This aligns with our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/versioning-and-support">Breaking Change Policy</a> that promises a minimum two (2) year deprecation period before API retirement. In June, we also described that this retirement would happen in stages and with advanced notice between each stage. The first stage will involve newly created Applications being unable to use Azure AD Graph APIs (by default). &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>While there are limited substantial updates to share at this point, we do want to provide an interim update. Our goal is to be transparent and establish a regular cadence of communication as we work with and support our customers through this service retirement. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br>September 2023 updates:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Some customers have told us that it is hard to identify or find which applications are using the retiring Azure AD Graph APIs, and at what scale. We are now working to deliver an analytics experience through <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/overview-recommendations">Identity Recommendations</a> that will provide the information that you need to identify and prioritize applications that require update or modification to avoid further disruption. We will provide an estimated release date for this experience soon. 
 As described in our prior communication, the first stage of retirement for Azure AD Graph APIs will involve a change that prevents newly-created <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/application?view=graph-rest-1.0">Applications</a> from using Azure AD Graph APIs (by default). We will provide a minimum of three (3) months advance notice before this date. At this first stage, only newly created Applications, and not existing Applications, will be impacted.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a near-future update, we will provide more detail on the timeline and actions needed to avoid disruption for (new) Applications that are not yet migrated to Microsoft Graph. We have not yet set the date at which newly created Applications will be prevented from using Azure AD Graph APIs, but we are working diligently towards providing that clarity and to deliver experiences that will help support customer efforts in migrating applications away from this retiring API service.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Required Action:</p>
<p>Identify and migrate applications that are using Azure AD Graph to use equivalent Microsoft Graph APIs. Microsoft Graph is a feature rich API platform that provides a unified API surface for many Microsoft services, including Microsoft Entra, Exchange, Teams, SharePoint, and the full Microsoft 365 portfolio.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Migrate Sign-in risk policy and User risk policy and from Entra ID Protection to Conditional Access</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have User risk policy or Sign-in risk policy enabled in Entra ID Protection (formerly Identity Protection) today, we invite you to migrate them to Conditional Access following <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies#migrate-risk-policies-from-identity-protection-to-conditional-access">these steps</a>. The UX in Entra ID Protection for these two risk policies will be retired on October 1, 2026</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Configuring Sign-in risk and User risk policies in Conditional Access provides these benefits:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Manage all access policies in one place. 
 Report-only mode and Graph API support.&nbsp; 
 Greater flexibility by combining risk conditions with other conditions like location for granular access control.&nbsp; 
 Enhanced security with multiple risk-based policies targeting different user groups or risk levels.&nbsp; 
 Improved diagnostics experience by viewing which risk-based policy applied in Sign-in Logs.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Registration campaign improvements</p>
<p>[Action may be required]&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help your users&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/it-s-time-to-hang-up-on-phone-transports-for-authentication/ba-p/1751752">move away from publicly switched telephone networks (PSTN) such as SMS and voice</a>, we’re making improvements to the&nbsp;<a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/how-to-mfa-registration-campaign">Registration campaign feature (aka Nudge)</a>. We’ll allow users to skip the prompt a maximum of three times, after which they will have to go through the registration flow. Note: admins can decide if they want to opt out of the “limited” 3 snooze configuration or give their end users the ability to snooze indefinitely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly, for Entra ID tenants that are Microsoft managed, we’re enabling the feature for users that are fully dependent on PSTN methods (SMS and voice) today for their MFA. Beginning&nbsp;September 2023, we will initiate a phased rollout of this change for Entra ID premium tenants.</p>

<p>Optimized MFA OTP delivery via WhatsApp</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>Today,&nbsp;Entra ID&nbsp;(Azure AD) MFA supports delivering one-time passcodes (OTPs) via <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-phone-options#sms-message-verification">text message</a>. These texts get sent to the default messaging app on a user's phone depending on the phone's operating system. In many countries though, these default apps aren't users' primary messaging apps. To help deliver OTPs to users on their preferred messaging platforms, Entra ID will roll out OTP delivery to WhatsApp in select regions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting mid-September 2023, users&nbsp;in India, Indonesia, and New Zealand may start receiving MFA text messages via WhatsApp. Users that fit the following criteria are subject, but not guaranteed, to receive the updated experience:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Enabled for text messages / SMS as an authentication method 
 Already use WhatsApp 
 Have a phone number with a country code in one of the listed countries 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations with users in the listed countries that don't want their users to receive MFA text messages through WhatsApp will need to disable text messages as an authentication method in their tenant(s). Depending on where they manage their authentication methods this means they need to disable "Text message to phone" in the <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Faccount.activedirectory.windowsazure.com%2FUserManagement%2FMfaSettings.aspx&amp;data=05%7C01%7CPadma.Prasad%40microsoft.com%7C5723979d9d5d431bcb2c08dbaf172fa8%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638296286347271878%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=2wENNOj7suQmnsgX%2BErw3SzyGW2dKlEjo7%2BZ7GumgTY%3D&amp;reserved=0">per-user MFA policy</a>&nbsp;and / or "SMS" in the <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fentra.microsoft.com%2F%23view%2FMicrosoft_AAD_IAM%2FAuthenticationMethodsMenuBlade%2F~%2FAdminAuthMethods%2FfromNav%2FIdentity&amp;data=05%7C01%7CPadma.Prasad%40microsoft.com%7C5723979d9d5d431bcb2c08dbaf172fa8%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638296286347428104%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=47wDN5b8%2FVhKNbOlUc4UEyXhEtBhR9tBKn9kWBe1gac%3D&amp;reserved=0">Authentication methods policy</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Changes to My Groups admin controls</p>
<p>[No action is required]</p>
<p>Starting June 2024, the existing Self Service Group Management setting in the Microsoft Entra admin center which states, “Restrict user ability to access groups features in the Access,” will be retired. This means disabling My Groups will no longer be possible. In June, a new setting that enables admins to restrict end users from viewing and managing security groups in My Groups will take effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This change will occur automatically—admins and users won’t need to take any action:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 If the existing setting for Restrict user ability to access groups features in the Access Panel is configured as Yes, the new setting will restrict users' ability to see and edit security groups in My Groups. 
 &nbsp;If the existing setting is configured as No, the new setting will expose security groups in My Groups. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more, please see this <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-self-service-management#make-a-group-available-for-user-self-service">documentation</a>. Note: Admins can still manage end users' ability to create Microsoft 365 and security groups using the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/enterprise-users/groups-self-service-management#group-settings">group settings</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enable HTTP/2 on the Graph service endpoint</p>
<p>[Action may be required]</p>
<p>As <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-blog/microsoft-entra-change-announcements-september-2022-train/ba-p/2967454">previously announced</a> in September of 2022, the Microsoft Graph engineering team plans to begin rollout of HTTP/2 support on the Microsoft Graph service endpoint on September 15, 2023. HTTP/2 support will be in addition to existing HTTP/1.1 version support. Once HTTP/2 is enabled on the Microsoft Graph endpoints, clients that support HTTP/2 will negotiate this version when making requests to Microsoft Graph. Focus for improvements in the HTTP/2 specification concern performance, including perceived latency, and network and service resource usage (reference <a href="https://http2.github.io">https://http2.github.io</a>), including multiplexing, parallelism, and efficiency through binary encoding and header compression. These benefits may offer substantial value to Microsoft Graph clients and customers. HTTP/2 is expected to be entirely backwards-compatible with HTTP/1.1 and to require no code changes in client applications. It's possible, in rare cases, that negative impact may occur with some client applications, if the application does not adhere to HTTP specifications concerning case-insensitive comparisons for Header keys.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Government organizations with significant technical debt require modern approaches for delivering services. Deploying services using DevOps techniques and a DevOps-enabled identity and access management (IAM) platform can improve application performance, availability, and scalability, while reducing maintenance and deployment costs.</p>

 Why DevOps? 

<p>DevOps is a methodology that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to improve collaboration, communication, and efficiency in delivering software applications.</p>

<p>Docker and Kubernetes are two foundational technologies that can be used for any deployment methodology — not just cloud computing — because they support building applications that can run on any modern operating system, and in any environment.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/docker/docker">Docker</a> is a tool designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create, deploy, and run applications at scale and in any environment by using containers. Containers allow a developer to bundle an application with all of the parts it needs — such as libraries, code, and other dependences — and deploy it as one package.</p>

<p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> is an open source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.</p>

<p>Together, Docker and Kubernetes enable developers to focus on writing code without worrying about the systems that it will be running on. The combination enables them to orchestrate and deliver faster services with flexible deployment options, whether they are to run in an on-premises, hybrid, or multi-cloud environment.</p>

 The benefits of DevOps-based IAM 

<p>Time is of the essence when developing and deploying capabilities that support the growing need for digital government services or for mission-critical applications used in denied, degraded, intermittent, and limited (DDIL) environments.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to speed deployment, scale for peak demand, and increase efficiency and security is by using a modern, comprehensive IAM solution that supports a multi-cloud DevOps deployment model with Docker and Kubernetes-based containerization and orchestration technologies. With the cloud now a top government strategic priority and more workloads shifting to cloud platforms every year, it's imperative to protect these workloads, no matter where they reside.</p>

<p>Large government agencies and organizations that are using older, on-premises IAM systems can't deliver the scale and security needed for digital government services for constituents or mission-critical applications used in intelligence and defense. Traditional IAM solutions are often complex and difficult to deploy, lacking the scalability and flexibility needed for quickly rolling out new services, upgrades, or releases.</p>

<p>In contrast, DevOps-friendly IAM solutions are designed to support automated and continuous delivery requirements, which are essential for DevOps practices across any environment.<br>
By containerizing IAM using tools like Docker and Kubernetes, government agencies can achieve greater flexibility when deploying IAM solutions.</p>

 Comparing DevOps-based IAM with legacy and cloud-only solutions 

<p>ForgeRock fully supports DevOps-based IAM and offers several advantages over legacy, monolithic IAM solutions and cloud-only IAM:</p>

  Deploy anywhere, online or offline: DevOps-based IAM can be deployed in any environment: on-premises, in private or public cloud, and in offline access scenarios such as on military vessels with intermittent internet connectivity. Our Cloud Deployment Model (CDM) adheres to the DoD Enterprise DevSecOps Reference Design for deployment in a containerized environment. 
	 Best of both worlds: The comprehensive ForgeRock IAM platform provides the features, capabilities, and customization you need, without the hassle of maintaining a monolithic IAM system. Cloud-only IAM solutions offer agility and scalability, but they may not be suitable for government agencies and organizations that are managing complex use cases or DDIL low-bandwidth and offline requirements. 
	 Up-to-date security: Unlike a monolithic IAM solution, DevOps-based IAM can be patched quickly for security updates and new features without taking the entire solution offline. 
  The ForgeOps deployment methodology 

<p>Customers that use the ForgeRock DevOps deployment model called <a href="https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/forgeops/7.4/cdm/intro.html">ForgeOps</a> have accelerated projects by three to six months, saving 25% on implementation costs. Agencies can deploy updates between their containerized applications and ForgeRock with the ability to test, QA, and deploy ForgeRock into Kubernetes clusters in minutes by running a simple command. And they can choose the operating system that meets their needs.</p>

<p>Government agencies requiring high security often choose OpenShift, an on-premises platform-as-a-service Kubernetes implementation that supports public cloud, on-premises, hybrid cloud, or edge architectures. The ForgeOps-provided Kubernetes scripts can be modified to support an OpenShift deployment.</p>

<p>With the right identity solution, organizations can easily protect workloads in any cloud; support millions of identities of any type; enable rapid solution development in a repeatable way; and conduct fast, simple, and highly available deployments — all without sacrificing rich features and extensibility. This ultimately leads to immediate business benefits, including accelerated time to market, increased flexibility in rolling out new services, availability and scalability, and time savings.</p>

 The ForgeRock difference 

<p>By making it easy to utilize Docker and Kubernetes technology, ForgeRock provides the fastest and most flexible multi-cloud IAM deployment options. Our cloud deployment model removes complexity and can help you accelerate development, making it easy to deploy millions of identities in minutes, on any cloud – whether it's a private cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure.</p>

<p>You can validate deployment options against ForgeRock benchmark results and analyze the most cost-effective cloud solution based on multiple factors so that your organization can reduce costs and ensure optimal performance, availability, and reliability to meet customer demand quickly.</p>

<p>YeshID is now <a href="https://trust.yeshid.com/">SOC II compliant</a>! 🎉 Not sure why this is important? In an increasingly digital world, safeguarding sensitive information, especially during <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">employee IT onboarding and offboarding</a>, is of critical importance. SOC II compliance represents a major commitment to data security and privacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to share this news with you for two reasons:</p>
 
 To help deepen your trust in YeshID as your tool of choice for secure onboarding and offboarding.&nbsp; 
 You might want to achieve SOC II compliance for your growing company one day too! We’re hoping our journey can help you with yours.&nbsp; 
 
<p>In this blog post, we’ll explore what SOC II compliance means, its significance for YeshID, and how it benefits your organization.</p>
 What is SOC II compliance? 
<p>SOC II, or Service Organization Control 2, is a rigorous auditing process that evaluates a company’s controls relevant to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of customer data. Achieving SOC II compliance demonstrates that YeshID has undergone thorough assessments and meets high industry standards in data security.</p>
<p></p>
<p>SOC II compliance is usually conducted by a third-party assessor that measures the following:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Security: Assesses measures in place to protect the organization’s systems, data centers, networks, access controls, and more from unauthorized access, physical and otherwise 
 Availability: Examines downtime, disaster recovery, and business continuity planning to assess the reliability of systems and services as agreed upon with customers 
 Processing integrity: Evaluates if data is processed accurately, completely, and in a timely manner&nbsp; 
 Confidentiality: Assesses access controls, encryption, and data privacy measures to focus on the protection of sensitive data from unauthorized access or disclosure 
 Privacy: Assesses the management of personal information and its compliance with relevant data privacy regulations 
 
<p>There are companies that help you achieve SOC II compliance. For example, YeshID worked with <a href="https://www.vanta.com/products/soc-2">Vanta to help automate the SOC II process</a> and find a vetted third-party auditor.</p>
 Why does SOC II compliance matter? 
<p>SOC II compliance ensures that any company undergoing the process has implemented robust security measures to protect sensitive information. This is particularly essential for YeshID because during employee onboarding and offboarding, personal and confidential data is frequently exchanged. Achieving SOC II compliance shows our strong commitment to data security and privacy.</p>
<p>SOC II compliance helps reduce potential risks and vulnerabilities in your data management processes. It safeguards your organization against data breaches and regulatory fines. It also sends a signal to your customers, investors, partners, and stakeholders that data privacy and access management is a top priority for your company.</p>
 SOC II-compliant IT onboarding and offboarding with YeshID 
<p><a href="https://trust.yeshid.com/">SOC II compliance</a> is a milestone that strengthens our commitment to data security and privacy. By choosing YeshID, you can trust that your sensitive information is in safe hands during employee onboarding and offboarding processes and that you are complying with the highest data protection standards. This means that you are that much closer to achieving SOC II compliance by using a SOC II-compliant onboarding and offboarding provider.</p>
<p>In an age where data breaches and privacy concerns are ever-present, SOC II compliance is your assurance that YeshID is dedicated to maintaining the utmost standards of data security. Let us help you <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">unlock a new era of security and efficiency in your organization’s processes</a>.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>The result of this meeting was “<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-summit-2023-the-bletchley-declaration/the-bletchley-declaration-by-countries-attending-the-ai-safety-summit-1-2-november-2023">The Bletchley Declaration</a>”, an international agreement signed by 29 countries, including the US, EU, and China, to confirm their shared commitment for future AI developments that “should be designed, developed, deployed, and used, in a manner that is safe, in such a way as to be human-centric, trustworthy and responsible”.</p>
<p>Sounds promising, right? Experts have been talking about the dangers of uncontrolled AI proliferation for years. James Cameron warned us about <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088247/">AI gaining self-awareness</a> forty years ago! Elon Musk has been <a href="https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/">calling for a pause in AI development</a>, citing grave dangers for our society. On a slightly more serious note, our own KuppingerCole analysts have published numerous articles on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/iantorno/the-triple-threat-ai-ethics-bias-and-deepfakes-in-cybersecurity">AI risks and challenges</a> as well, including those in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023/blog/ai-and-cybersecurity-a-new-hope-for-cyber-defenders">the field of cybersecurity</a>. And yet, major world superpowers have been engaged in an AI arms race in recent years, and just a week ago, the US president has issued a landmark <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">Executive Order on trustworthy development and use of AI</a> to strengthen his country’s position in this race.</p>
<p>So, why such a sudden demonstration of unity amidst an ongoing global conflict? British prime minister Rishi Sunak called the Bletchley declaration “a landmark achievement… helping ensure the long-term future of our children and grandchildren”, but can we really expect any substance from this claim, or should we treat this paper as a mere symbolic gesture?</p>
<p>After all, the entire summit was full of overt symbolism. Bletchley Park, the location of the event, is, of course, the historic site where during the World War II, top British experts worked to break the secret communications of the Axis powers, especially the notorious German Enigma machine. And of course, this valiant work was led by none other than Alan Turing, the same guy that later proposed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">eponymous test</a> to measure a machine’s ability to exhibit intelligent behavior. How cool is that?</p>
<p>Well, I don’t know about you, but I’m well aware of the fact that the actual cracking of the Enigma code was mostly done by Polish mathematicians years before, as well as of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing#Death">appalling treatment of Turing himself</a> by the British authorities that led to his suicide, and this alone makes the entire symbolism a bit too shallow for me. But even if we ignore the history and only focus on the Turing test itself, we should keep in mind that it was a ground-breaking (and highly controversial) philosophical concept back then, but it bears very little relevance to the modern AI developments that the declaration is supposed to regulate.</p>
<p>Does it really matter if a chatbot can fool you into thinking that you’re communicating with a human? There are much more urgent and practical technological, cultural, and moral problems that need to be addressed soon: for example, who is responsible if a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-driving_car_liability">driverless car runs over a pedestrian</a>? Or a multitude of much smaller but equally critically important issues like dealing with bias and prejudice, ethical consequences of AI tools making carrier-defining decisions for humans, deepfakes, etc., etc. Or defending against threat actors wielding their own AI tools…</p>
<p>Surely, all these issues must be addressed, and regulation is the most efficient way to do that. But there is an important distinction between regulating AI usage and its development. The latter is simply meaningless, especially around technologies that can be easily weaponized. No matter how many times governments agree not to create “killer robots”, they will continue developing them anyway because having killer robots at your army’s disposal is much better than not having them, especially if your country is planning another war.</p>
<p>So no, I do not consider this declaration a landmark achievement. It was merely an empty gesture to make British politicians feel a bit more important than they perhaps deserve. An imitation game, if you will. Or, more likely, a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/the-cargo-cult-of-cybersecurity">cargo cult</a>. And of course, the AI battle between the US and China will continue. And nobody will voluntarily give up productivity tools like ChatGPT and surely, the black market of AI-based threats and exploits will continue to thrive.</p>
<p>But perhaps sometime in the future, when AI safety summits are attended by industry experts and not politicians, we will see more practical developments tailored to specific issues in certain fields or geographies. Until then, we will have to defend against the evil AIs ourselves. And a great place to discuss your immediate risks and challenges is the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/cyberevolution2023">cyberevolution</a> conference, which opens next week in Frankfurt, Germany, as well as online. Will we see you there?</p>

Because the systems in place to stop it are slow, outdated, or unintuitive. In this article we’ll explain how verifiable credentials can fix the issue.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Systems to prevent fraud and scams are in place across every industry; and yet, the FTC reports <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/02/new-ftc-data-show-consumers-reported-losing-nearly-88-billion-scams-2022">fraud increased by 30%</a> from 2021 to 2022. Some may point to the number of chances that bad actors have: the US averages <a href="https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/number-of-credit-card-transactions/#:~:text=Total%20global%20credit%20card%20transactions,one%20transaction%20every%201¾%20days">1,739 credit cards swiped per second,</a> with the average card holder making <a href="https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/number-of-credit-card-transactions/#:~:text=Total%20global%20credit%20card%20transactions,one%20transaction%20every%201¾%20days">210 credit transactions per year.</a> Surely, with that many transactions systems can’t catch everything. Maybe not. But it is troubling that even as security technology advances, fraud is trending ever upward.</p>
<p>2023 saw many technological advances, with one of the most noteworthy being <a href="https://chat.openai.com/auth/login">ChatGPT,</a> an artificial intelligence program that generates “human-like text.” Almost immediately, it was misused: a study by SlashNext found a <a href="https://slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SlashNext-The-State-of-Phishing-Report-2023.pdf">1,265% increase in general phishing</a> attempts since ChatGPT launched in November of 2022, and a <a href="https://slashnext.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/SlashNext-The-State-of-Phishing-Report-2023.pdf">967% increase in credential phishing</a> attempts. And with ChatGPT built on open-source code, it wasn’t long before malicious actors began making their own programs to do even more damage, leading to the creation of <a href="https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/wormgpt-and-fraudgpt-the-rise-of-malicious-llms/">WormGPT and FraudGPT.</a></p>
<p>Instead of playing “spot the scam,” against a background of ever more complex scams, we need a better way of knowing for sure who we are interacting with. This is where verifiable credentials come in. Someone once described verifiable credentials to me as “multi-factor authentication for life.” Imagine a world where before you even opened the email you could be certain who it was from because there was an authentication process built into the sending.</p>
<p>Today, if you get an important-looking email from the government or your bank, the onus is on you to verify it. Some people might call to double check (and get that second point of authentication), but many might just respond, or worse yet click on links they shouldn’t and&nbsp; provide personal information. The extra step to verify is time consuming. People want convenience, and, frankly, the main line of defense against phishing and other cyber scams shouldn’t be to inconvenience them. We need a fast, easy to use, technical answer.</p>
<p>Indicio believes that verifiable credentials are this answer because we’ve seen them work across a variety of use cases for different customers. With a simple scan of a QR code you can be sure of who you are interacting with and who has issued their credential. Think of your bank issuing you a verifiable credential for your bank account. Every time you connect with your bank, it knows you’re the person it issued the credential to, automatically. Similarly, you know you are interacting with your bank and not some fake version of it. And this all occurs before any data is shared. Combine this with the way parties can prove that information shared from a credential hasn’t been tampered with, the use cases are innumerable. Trust is foundational to all business and social activity, and now we have a way to trust each other and what we share online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to see how fast and easy verifiable credentials make accessing something like your bank account you can see a demonstration <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMZlop-TvnQ">here.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>We recognize the unique skills, experience, and dedication that veterans bring to the table. As such, we actively seek veterans to join our team and contribute to our mission to secure our ever-changing world. In this blog post, we share the story of one of our Veterans Alliance members, Mark Joynes, CD, and highlight the parallel between his military experience and the rewarding career opportunities he has built at Entrust over the last 25 years.</p>
<p>The Road to PKI</p>
<p>Mark embarked on his career in the Canadian military in 1976. He started as a ground and air-to-ground photographer and spent eight years serving in Canada and West Germany during the Cold War era. However, his true transformation began when he was commissioned from the ranks and trained in the Security Branch. In his last four years, he served in the Computer Security Shop of Defense Headquarters, diving into the very early days of computer security (and before any thought of Zero Trust technologies).</p>
<p>Mark’s exposure to computer security continued in 1985 when he attended a secure systems design course at NCSC in Baltimore. He was later assigned as a Lieutenant to the Computer Security Shop, highlighting the military’s recognition of his abilities and potential in cybersecurity. Soon after leaving the military, Mark was with Canada’s Communications Security Establishment (CSE) as the Canadian government deployed the Canadian PKI root. This experience laid the foundation for his now 30-year expertise with PKI (public key infrastructure), a pivotal technology that has shaped data security.</p>
<p>PKI and Mark’s Contributions</p>
<p>Mark’s journey in the military led him to become a PKI Product Marketing Director at Entrust, where he plays a crucial role in driving the commercialization of our comprehensive ePassport PKI architecture. Leveraging his extensive experience, Mark was instrumental in deploying CSCAs (Country Signing Certification Authorities) and signers in the UK, US, and Singapore. His ambitious vision also led to the development of the EAC (Extended Access Control) based PKI investment for 2nd generation ePassports, setting new standards in the European market.</p>
<p>As a result of Mark’s contributions, Entrust now provides the trust architecture for over 40 countries worldwide. In fact, approximately 50% of the ePassports in circulation feature the signed booklets from Entrust PKI, a testament to the trust and confidence placed in our technology.</p>
<p>Why Veterans Make a Great Fit for Our Company</p>
<p>We understand that the military instills exceptional qualities in individuals, including agility, empowerment, and a sense of urgency. These traits, combined with a “can-do” attitude and a passion for security, align perfectly with the opportunities available at Entrust.</p>
<p>In addition to appreciating the valuable skills veterans bring, we also recognize the importance of fostering capability and supporting individuals in realizing their ambitions. Our company culture emphasizes leadership development and personal growth, ensuring that each team member can contribute to our collective goals while fulfilling their own aspirations.</p>

  <p>The healthcare industry has long grappled with the challenge of delivering the retail-like consumer experiences that patients and members demand. According to a Harris Poll, 67% of patients described every healthcare step as a chore, and 62% believed the system was inherently confusing<a>1</a>. Yet, in the pursuit to improve healthcare experiences, both payers and providers face a host of challenges that are often at odds:</p>

  Provide streamlined experiences across the growing digital health ecosystem (including third parties) – yet avoid fraud, account takeover (ATO), ransomware, and breaches. 
	 Meet the demands for innovative patient- and member-facing services – but not at the expense of compliance with HIPAA, CCPA, and other stringent regulations. 
	 Create operational efficiency and achieve cost savings – while simultaneously looking for ways to improve consumer satisfaction and increase revenue. 
 <p>The remedy to these seemingly conflicting challenges lies in an enterprise-grade identity and access management (IAM) platform that provides the foundation for delivering consumer experiences to keep patients and members coming back for more. The following are a few examples of how healthcare leaders are using digital identity to revolutionize healthcare experiences that acquire and retain consumers, and drive profitability.</p>

  Build Personalized, Secure, Seamless Experiences: Use a no-code approach to build consumer journey experiences with features such as progressive profiling, passwordless authentication, and AI-informed threat detection. 
	 Give Consumers Control with Self-Service: Drive engagement while reducing operational costs by giving patients and members control over their profile, login, and data sharing preferences with self-service functions. 
	 Get A Single View of Your Consumer: Get a single, organization-wide view of a patient or member to facilitate personalized, omnichannel experiences and drive customized services across all lines of business. 
	 Add Speed to Digital Services: Accelerate the retrieval of identity-related information across all legacy and modern solutions to deliver improved application performance and user experiences. 
	 Gain Privacy Protection and Anti-Fraud Capabilities: Enhance consumer interactions, brand loyalty, and cost-savings through privacy protection, compliance features, and AI-powered anti-fraud capabilities. 
	 Achieve Interoperability and Build Secure Partner Services: Bridge the gaps in your hybrid IT environments, unlock siloed data, and safely expand your digital ecosystem to partners for value-added services that boost revenue. 
 <p>Adopting ForgeRock's robust digital identity platform is your gateway to today's era of consumer-centric healthcare experiences.</p>

Throughout the entirety of the supply chain, data can be verified, cryptographically tying back to the original&nbsp;issuer.</p> Relationships <p>The top row of ICC DSI’s diagram lists numerous relationships, which can be broadly categorized as Collections, Repetition, and Relationships.</p> Document Pouches <p>Documents are often presented to the same actor at once, in a “pouch.” A pouch of documents is expected to be related in customs and trade finance use&nbsp;cases.</p>Figure 4: A data graph representing a Packing List and a Bill of Lading Verifiable Credentials, joined together as part of the same Document&nbsp;Pouch.<p>Above, two credentials are joined by the same <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability#workflow-instance">Workflow Instance</a>, explicitly indicating relation across multiple <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations-0">Verifiable Presentations</a>.</p> Inter-Document References <p>Documents typically carry identifiers and reference each other. For example, a Commercial Invoice typically references a Purchase Order, usually with a Purchase Order number, which is unique to the two organizations’ business relationship.</p>Figure 5: Expanding data graph elements, illustrating common nodes and repeated data elements.<p>As you can see on figure 5, both the Packing List and the Bill of Lading references the same Unique Resource Identifier (the yellow&nbsp;node).</p><p>Note that the trade parties are also represented by the same green nodes, referenced from both documents. “Seller Inc.” is the Issuer, Seller and Ship From party on the Packing List, and the consignor on the Bill of Lading. This is because the documents reference URIs, in this case Decentralized Identifiers.</p> Repeating Elements <p>Non-identified values are usually just repeated on the documents where they are required. For example, a weight measurement is typically not identified (although it could be), so the values are repeated whenever required. For example, a shipment’s product Gross Weight is listed both the Packing List and the Commercial Invoice.</p><p>Also shown on figure 5, the goods weights and measurements are repeated on the Packing List and the Bill of Lading. Automating a consistency check to confirm that the documents represent the same shipment is trivial when the data comes with strong semantics in this&nbsp;way.</p> Conclusion <p>I wrote this article based on a quick implementation of ICC DSI’s model using prevalent, modern web technologies. This was quickly done using the open source for example these <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability#PackingListCredential">PL</a> and <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability#MultiModalBillOfLadingCredential">BL</a> schemas, and our Verifiable Data Platform for credentials management and constructing the corresponding <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/marketplace/adapters/urn:transmute:adapter:neo4j">data&nbsp;graphs</a>.</p><p>The intention of this article has been to present a direction, from the ICC DSI model towards a scalable, interoperable implementation model.</p><p>Similarly, talking about Linked Data, Verifiable Credentials and Decentralized Identifiers in the abstract can be rather alienating. But as we have seen, they address some very tangible elements of global trade, beautifully introduced by the ICC&nbsp;DSI.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@nis.jespersen">Nis Jespersen</a>, Transmute’s Solutions Architect, is editor of the United Nations CEFACT JSON-LD Web Vocabulary project and author of the W3C Traceability Vocabulary specification.</p><p>Connect with Nis on<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nis-jespersen/"> LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nissimsan">Twitter</a>, &amp;&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/nissimsan">GitHub</a></p><p>Sign up for free on Transmute’s Verifiable Data Platform on <a href="https://platform.transmute.industries/">https://platform.transmute.industries</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/digital-trade-document-relationships-2f263b410e3">Digital Trade Document Relationships</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The holiday season is a time of gift-giving and therefore increased online shopping, which naturally increases the risk of cyber threats. As we shop for presents online, we expose our digital identities to potential risks. Cybercriminals are always looking for opportunities to exploit vulnerabilities and steal sensitive information. In this blog, I’ll provide essential tips for keeping your digital identity safe while holiday shopping.</p>
 Use Strong, Unique Passwords 
<p>One of the most basic yet crucial steps in safeguarding your digital identity is using strong, unique passwords for each online account. Avoid using easily guessable passwords like “123456” or “password”. Instead, create complex passwords that include a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters.</p>
<p>To manage these passwords and encourage the use of strong passwords, consider using a trusted password manager, which can generate and store them securely.</p>
 Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 
<p>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provides an extra layer of security for your online accounts. An example of this is Two-Factor Authentication which typically involves something you know (your password) and something you have (e.g. a code sent to your mobile device). The other option is something you are, which generally means biometric authentication – such as a fingerprint or facial recognition. Enabling MFA can significantly reduce the chances of unauthorised access to your accounts, even if someone obtains your password.</p>
 Shop from Secure Websites 
<p>When holiday shopping online, always make sure you are on a secure website before providing any personal or financial information. Look for “https://” in the URL and pay attention to trust badges or seals from reputable security providers. Be cautious when dealing with unfamiliar or suspicious websites. And remember, even familiar websites may be duplicated to phish your login details.</p>
 Avoid Public Wi-Fi 
<p>Public Wi-Fi networks may be convenient, but they are often not secure. Avoid making online purchases or accessing sensitive information while connected to public Wi-Fi. If you need to shop online while on the go, consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your connection and add an extra layer of security.</p>
 Be Wary of Phishing Scams 
<p>Cybercriminals often use phishing scams to trick people into revealing sensitive information. Be cautious of unsolicited emails, text messages, or links, especially if they seem too good to be true. Never click on links or download attachments from unknown sources. Always verify the sender’s authenticity before sharing any personal data.</p>
 Monitor Your Accounts 
<p>Frequently monitor your bank and credit card statements for any unauthorised transactions. Set up account alerts to notify you of any unusual activity. The sooner you catch any fraudulent charges, the easier it is to resolve the issue and prevent further damage to your digital identity.</p>
 Keep Software Updated 
<p>Regularly update your operating system, web browsers, and antivirus software to patch any security vulnerabilities. Outdated software can be exploited by cybercriminals to gain access to your device or personal information.</p>
 Use a Protected Payment Method for Online Purchases 
<p>Protected payment methods offer better protection against fraudulent charges than standard debit cards, for example. When making online purchases, consider using a protected payment methods such as a credit cards or payment apps, especially with MFA setup, which reduces your risk of hackers being able to access your details and account.</p>
 Educate Yourself 
<p>Staying informed about the latest cybersecurity threats and best practices is essential. Educate yourself and your family members on the risks and preventive measures to ensure a safe online shopping experience.</p>
<p>Holiday shopping online offers convenience and access to a vast array of products, but it also exposes your digital identity to potential risks. By following these essential tips, you can significantly reduce the chances of falling victim to cyberattacks and protect your sensitive information. Stay vigilant, use secure practices, and enjoy a safe and joyful online shopping experience during the holiday season.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Marius Goeddert</a></p><p>In their constant quest for keeping organizations secure, cybersecurity professionals always need to look into the future in order to assess the likelihood of potential attacks. They need to combine their knowledge of the past and the present with their evaluation of the development of prominent attack vectors and come to a risk assessment for their work in the future.</p>
<p>In his discussion with our CEO Berthold Kerl, Jonathan Blanchard Smith, Director and Fellow at SAMI Consulting, suggests that “foresight consulting is explicitly not looking into the crystal ball”. Instead, when he and his team created the SAFIRE scenarios for the European Commission, they focused on the fact that there is not just one possible future but many. Hence, you need not only prepare for the future, but for several futures.</p>
<p>Tune in to Jonathan’s cyberfile today and take a glimpse into his two-part workshop on future scenario analysis which he will give at cyberevolution 2023 on Tuesday, November 14. Join us in Frankfurt or online.</p>
<p>Part one “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5650/1">Shaping the cybersecurity landscape of the future using the SAFIRE Scenarios</a>” deals with exploring the intricacies of future scenario analysis using the cutting-edge SAFIRE methodology and decoding the interplay of societal, technological, economic, environmental, and political factors that shape our digital future.</p>
<p>Part two “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5653/1">SAFIRE Scenarios – four Futures for the world (continued)</a>” is all about enriching your strategic thinking and scenario-building skills with the SAFIRE approach.</p>

<p>Fission is the lead organizer for IPFS Connect Istanbul. During the event, we are thrilled to be putting on our own workshop showcasing IPVM. </p><p>IPVM, or the InterPlanetary Virtual Machine, aims to be the easiest, fastest, most secure, and open way to run WebAssembly functions anywhere.</p><p>Using content-addressed data, public key infrastructure (PKI), and capabilities, IPVM liberates computation from its dependence on pre-negotiated services and paves the way for interoperability.</p><p>If you've been following our work at Fission, you'll note that IPVM has been our vision from day one. But we knew that before we could get to distributed compute, we had to build the auth and data layers first. Now that <a href="https://github.com/ucan-wg">UCAN</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wnfs-wg/">WNFS</a> are done, we're ready to launch <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/">IPVM</a>. </p><p>The IPVM workshop will be the first-ever interactive workshop. You can get hands-on without having to go to the <a href="https://github.com/ipvm-wg/homestar">repo</a>. Here are the details:</p><p>IPVM Workshop: Running WebAssembly Workflows with IPFS</p><p>November 16th, 1:30 - 3:30 PM</p><p>Join the Fission team in a live workshop about the InterPlanetary Virtual Machine (IPVM), an open protocol for decentralized computation.</p><p>We'll be walking through how to set up and install a Homestar node, an IPVM reference implementation written in Rust optimized for running WebAssembly (Wasm) functions in workflows. </p><p>Workshop participants should bring their laptops. We'll walk through the following experiences:</p>  Install a Homestar node  Connect to Homestar node peers in the workshop  Run example workflows  Share results of computation between local peers  Experiment with authoring your own workflows and functions   <p>Let's break each of these experiences down:</p><p>Install a Homestar node and connect to Homestar node peers - Homestar is Fission's Rust + Wasm implementation of IPVM. During the workshop, users will be able to install Homestar on their machines and connect to other Homestar nodes </p><p>Sneak Peak at the Homestar Mascot!</p>Homestar Mascot designed by Bruno Monteiro<p>Run Example Workflows - A workflow is a series of individual tasks (also known as a step function) wired together. In the IPVM Workshop, we will demonstrate a couple of workflows to showcase some of the capabilities of IPVM. </p><p>There will also be a control panel that will serve as the UI where the user can track their activity, view the receipts they are outputting, review pre-deployed WebAssembly tasks, and more.</p><p>Share results of computation between local peers - This is a fun one! One of the impressive features of IPVM is the more IPVM is used, the more efficient it is! That’s because every time a task is run, the output is saved in the network as a CID and is used in future computations. Think of it like global caching! The technical term for this is memoization. Homestar keeps a table (like a spreadsheet) of the ID for the function, its arguments, and its result. It allows the user to skip running the task and substitute the result. Just like IPFS's table that associates hashes to data to let anyone find and download the content, this does the same for function results. During the workshop, we will see this play out in real-time as we run computations and share those results with our fellow workshop attendees/node peers.</p><p>Experiment with authoring your own workflows and functions - Once attendees start getting comfortable with IPVM, they can begin to play with workflows, tweak parameters, and even bring their own Wasm functions.</p> <p>Who should attend this workshop?</p><p>IPVM is for Front End Web Developers</p><p>Anything you would normally need a backend for, IPVM can do for you. For example, IPVM can help you resize images. If you need to parse a large text document and it's too big to do locally on your machine, give it to IPVM. IPVM can pull data off of IPFS so you can operate on it and generate a new CID to pass around. You can even build map tiling. OpenStreetMap, for example, utilizes too much data for your phone or browser to work with, but you could parallelize that work across many machines and have them send you back the rendered map.</p><p>IPVM is an excellent serverless computing option. Whether you want to use the cloud, someone else's machine, your own machine, or a mix, IPVM is the solution you've been looking for.</p><p>IPVM is for Web3 Developers</p><p>Similar to a computation rollup, but instead of needing to be on-chain, it also extends off-chain. Imagine if you need to call something out in the real world, like Twitter, Bluesky, or an email server. You want to talk to external systems. </p><p>For example, say you want to take your NFT and make it gray-scaled. </p><p>Option 1: Do the image manipulation on-chain. The problem with this is the cost of gas would be prohibitively high. As in thousands and thousands of dollars. </p><p>Option 2: Run a server. This would work, but now you're no longer Web3 and paying money to a centralized cloud provider. </p><p>Option 3: IPVM. You get the benefits of decentralization, but the functions can run off-chain, saving you money and compute resources. </p><p>In the same way that IPFS saves developers from storing their NFTs on-chain, IPVM saves developers from having to run computations on-chain.</p><p>IPVM is for ETHGlobal Hackathon Participants</p><p>For those participating in the <a href="https://ethglobal.com/events/istanbul">ETHGlobal Istanbul Hackathon</a>, IPVM is a great tool to have in your toolkit. You'll probably do some computations locally, but if they slow your machine down, you can always push them to the hosted IPVM node to do the heavy lifting. Unlike centralized cloud platforms that require users to go through the network for everything, IPVM lets you choose where you want to do your computations, so you are always in control of how you allocate your resources.</p> <p>In conclusion, we're so excited for you to get your hands on Homestar. This is an early version for folks to experience and learn how decentralized compute with content addressing can work. Run it yourself and get ready to plug into a larger network of function writers and node providers. </p><p>Sign up for the IPVM Workshop by purchasing a ticket to <a href="https://istanbul2023.ipfsconnect.org/">IPFS Connect Istanbul</a> and <a href="https://forms.gle/kr5UedcVEcdnnYdi7">letting us know which of the workshops you'll be attending</a>, including options from our friends at Iroh and Web3 Storage + Saturn (you can attend all three!)</p><p> Can't make it to the event?

<p>For Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), compliance with the FATF Travel Rule isn’t just about adhering to regulations — it’s also a significant operational consideration that impacts the bottom&nbsp;line.</p><p>Travel Rule solutions come with a variety of pricing models, each with its distinct advantages and challenges. To simplify it, we have prepared this comprehensive guide that demystifies these models, providing VASPs with the insights needed to make informed decisions that balance cost with compliance.</p> Sign-up Fee + Annual Fee&nbsp;Model <p>In the sign-up fee plus annual fee model, VASPs pay an initial fee to gain access to the Travel Rule compliance service. After this initial payment, they are charged recurring annual fees that cover ongoing access to the service, including regular updates and customer&nbsp;support.</p><p>Sygna Bridge, for instance, follows this model. It requires VASPs to pay an upfront fee for integration into their network, followed by an annual fee that provides ongoing compliance support and secure information exchange capabilities.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Predictable annual budgeting due to fixed&nbsp;costs.  Continuous access to compliance updates and&nbsp;support.  Potentially lower costs for VASPs with high transaction volumes due to spreading the fee across numerous transactions.  <p>Cons:</p>  High initial sign-up costs can be a barrier to entry for smaller&nbsp;VASPs.  Annual fees apply regardless of actual usage, which may not be cost-effective during periods of low activity.  Less flexibility to scale costs with the business’s transactional demands.   Monthly Charge&nbsp;Model <p>The monthly charge model entails a regular monthly fee that covers the operational costs of the compliance solution. This cost often becomes more economical as more members join, thanks to shared expenses.</p><p>An example of this is TRUST by Coinbase, which allocates operational costs across its members on a monthly basis, with the cost per member potentially decreasing as more join the initiative.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Consistent monthly expenses make financial planning straightforward.  As more members join, individual costs can decrease due to shared operational expenses.  No large upfront payments are required.  <p>Cons:</p>  Costs may be relatively higher for smaller VASPs with fewer transactions.  Monthly fees accrue regardless of service usage, which can be inefficient for intermittent compliance needs.  Possible overpayment during slower business&nbsp;months.   Two-Tiered Pricing&nbsp;Model <p>A two-tiered pricing model offers a base service tier at a fixed cost and an advanced tier with more features, which may have customized pricing.</p><p>Notabene, for example, provides a ‘SafeTransact-Rise’ plan for basic compliance requirements and a ‘Full-Feature’ platform that caters to more complex needs, with specific pricing determined following a product demonstration.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Offers a choice between basic and advanced services to match different compliance needs.  Lower tier may provide an affordable entry point for smaller&nbsp;VASPs.  Higher tier can be customized, potentially offering a better fit for larger VASPs with complex&nbsp;needs.  <p>Cons:</p>  The basic tier may not be sufficient for all compliance requirements, leading to eventual upgrade&nbsp;costs.  Customization in the higher tier can be more expensive and time-consuming to negotiate.  VASPs may end up paying for unused features in the tiered structure.   Free Trial and Premium Plan&nbsp;Model <p>This model offers a complimentary trial period with fundamental service access, after which users can opt for premium plans that provide a wider range of services for a&nbsp;fee.</p><p>Sumsub exemplifies this model by giving VASPs a six-month free trial for their compliance services, after which there are options to upgrade to more comprehensive premium or enterprise plans.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Free trial period allows for testing the service without financial commitment.  Opportunity to evaluate the solution’s effectiveness before investing in a premium&nbsp;plan.  <p>Cons:</p>  After the trial, VASPs must commit to premium plans, which can be&nbsp;costly.  Transitioning from free to paid service may require budget reallocation.  Premium plans may include features that some VASPs don’t need but still pay&nbsp;for.   Membership Fee&nbsp;Model <p>With a membership fee model, organizations pay an annual fee based on the company’s size and type, which grants them access to the service network and its resources.</p><p>Open VASP, for example, uses this model where the fee structure varies based on the size and type of the company, catering to both VASPs and non-VASPs.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Annual membership provides clarity on yearly expenses.  Access to a network of compliance solutions and peers in the industry.  Fees can be tailored to company size, making it fairer for smaller organizations.  <p>Cons:</p>  Fees are due regardless of the level of service utilization.  Membership costs can be substantial, especially for larger&nbsp;VASPs.  Additional costs may arise for services not covered by the membership fee.   Pay-as-you-go Model <p>The pay-as-you-go approach is flexible and cost-efficient, particularly suitable for entities with fluctuating service needs, where they pay solely for the services utilized.</p><p>Veriscope is the only Travel Rule Solution that offers this model, allowing VASPs to pay in alignment with their transaction volumes, avoiding upfront costs, and ensuring the scalability of the compliance solution.</p><p>Pros:</p>  Ultimate flexibility with payments aligned to actual service&nbsp;usage.  Ideal for VASPs with fluctuating transaction volumes.  No upfront costs, allowing better cash flow management.  <p>Cons:</p>  Can become expensive, in general, if transaction volumes are consistently high.   Concluding Thoughts <p>The diverse pricing models of Travel Rule solutions, as we have explored, cater to the varied needs and capabilities of VASPs — ranging from startups to established financial institutions.</p><p>Each model presents a distinct approach to cost management, from the predictability of sign-up and annual fees to the flexibility of pay-as-you-go options, such as the one offered by Veriscope. This particular model is designed to adapt organically to the VASP’s activity levels, providing a cost-effective solution for those with fluctuating transaction volumes.</p><p>VASPs must weigh these options carefully, considering both short-term financial implications and long-term compliance strategies. Whether seeking a trial to test the waters, a simple membership to join a community of peers, or a comprehensive service plan for extensive transaction needs, the key lies in selecting a model that aligns with the organization’s transaction patterns, size, and growth trajectory.</p><p>Ultimately, the decision is a testament to a VASP’s commitment to not only meet the regulatory standards but to embrace the evolving digital asset landscape with a forward-thinking approach to compliance and operational excellence. The pay-as-you-go model exemplifies this commitment, offering an agile and scalable financial framework that stands as a testament to Veriscope’s understanding of the sector’s dynamic&nbsp;nature.</p><p>__________________________</p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

			<p>6th November 2023, Luxembourg –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.terazo.network/">Terazo</a>, a groundbreaking private market investment platform in India, has joined forces with <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, the leading tokenization platform, to spearhead the first regulated tokenized real estate asset in India under the regulatory sandbox framework established by the International Financial Services Centres Authority (<a href="https://www.ifsca.gov.in/">IFSCA</a>). IFSCA is a dynamic and forward-thinking regulator committed to driving India’s fintech innovation and propelling the nation to the forefront of the global financial services landscape</p>
<p>Terazo’s involvement and authorization to operate within the sandbox strengthens investor confidence and enables the platform to present premium private assets to a broader range of investors. Historically, private investments, particularly in real estate, have been limited to wealthy individuals, excluding the majority from access. With regulatory approval and Tokeny as its technology partner, Terazo seeks to democratize the market through its flagship project, Oryx and beyond.</p>
<p>Oryx, a ~USD 50 million greenfield development, is the first regulated tokenized real estate project in India. Terazo, through its maiden USD 7 million tokenized fund, will allow qualified primary investors the opportunity to invest in Oryx, from $100,000 and allowing secondary investors with as little as $1,000. The ~8,50,000 sq ft Grade A Commercial Property located in the heart of GIFT SEZ, India’s first global financial services hub, and is positioned as the first step to revolutionize the real estate investment landscape in India.</p>
<p>By collaborating with Tokeny, Terazo has utilized its SaaS tokenization platform to seamlessly issue and administer asset backed tokens on the Polygon blockchain. Leveraging Tokeny’s infrastructure and the open-source <a href="https://www.erc3643.org/">ERC3643 protocol</a>, Terazo can seamlessly incorporate compliance measures and automate ownership transfers, simplifying asset management for investors.</p>
<p>This partnership also ensures fully traceable and unalterable cap tables on the blockchain, granting investors unmediated ownership and transparency. Furthermore, Terazo can effortlessly carry out real-time procedures, including the distribution and token recovery tool of tokens to investors.</p>

		 
	 
    We are excited to launch a blockchain-based marketplace, starting from tokenization of real estate assets in India. Our vision is to democratize access to high-quality private assets such as real estate, private equity, venture capital and improve liquidity in the market. With Tokeny's expertise and technology, we are confident that we can deliver a world-class solution for investors.  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaan-zaveri-6a35a737/">Shaan Zaveri</a>Partner at Terazo       We're excited to support Terazo's mission to democratize private market investment from India.

(CSE:LQID / OTC:LQAVF / FRA:4T5) (“Liquid Avatar” or the “Company”) would like to provide the following update to its shareholders.

<p>November 3, 2023 –Toronto, Canada –<a href="http://www.aftermathislands.com/"> </a><a href="http://www.liquidavatartechnologies.com">Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc.</a> (CSE:LQID / OTC:LQAVF / FRA:4T5) (“Liquid Avatar” or the “Company”) would like to provide the following update to its shareholders.</p>



<p>As part of its ongoing efforts to maximize available corporate resources, the Company continues to dedicate efforts to its Liquid Avatar Mobile App and Aftermath Islands Metaverse programs. However, given the difficult market conditions, changes in government’s dedicated efforts with digital identity, changing market demands for new fintech services including financial card products, and despite the continuing efforts of Management and the Board of Directors, the Company continues to find itself having difficulty meeting its required capital objectives to further its program development and execution.</p>



<p>On August 21, 2023, the Company announced that it had received a non-binding offer for its controlled subsidiary, Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited (“Aftermath Islands”) and its Liquid Avatar Mobile App from a private Swiss based Metaverse and virtual experience organization.&nbsp; The offer was contingent on financing amounts and terms to be agreed between the Companies. The proposed buyer has been unsuccessful in its efforts to raise the requisite financing.&nbsp; The Company remains on cordial terms with the proposed buyer, but the non-binding offer has now expired, and it is not expected to be renewed at this time.</p>



<p>An ongoing result of these difficulties resulted in a cease trade order issued by the Ontario Securities Commission on May 5, 2023.&nbsp; The Company cannot raise capital directly into Liquid Avatar Technologies Inc. at this time due to both the cease trade order and its inability to file the Company’s financial statements for the year ended 2022 and its subsequent quarters. The Company anticipates upon raising capital that it will have sufficient resources to file the necessary statements to apply for the removal, in part, or in whole of the cease trade order.&nbsp; However, currently, the Company does not envisage, at least in the foreseeable short term, a revocation of the current cease trade order under the current circumstances.</p>



<p>On June 30, 2023, the Company filed Form 51-102F6V, Statement of Director and Named Executive Officer Compensation.&nbsp; This statement reflected the compensation earned by each member of management and outlined the outstanding unpaid compensation owed to each as of December 31, 2022.&nbsp; No compensation has been paid to management from the date of that filing and accrued compensation now dates back from April 1, 2022, for each member of management.&nbsp; Additional compensation has also been accrued and is outstanding to other employees, consultants, and vendors. Despite the Company’s inability to provide compensation, management, employees and select vendors have largely continued to support the Company’s efforts, including some members of management, on a priority basis, have provided limited loans to the Company for certain critical expenses, which are deemed a related party transaction.</p>



<p>The Company would like to report the resignation of the Chief Financial Officer, Craig McCannell, effective November 1, 2023.&nbsp; Mr. McCannell has offered to make himself available as time allows to support the Company in any future requests related to his former position and / or transition efforts, and we thank him for his years of service to the Company and wish him success in his future endeavors. Management intends to work with the Board of Directors, in due course, to create a selection committee for a new CFO.</p>



<p>“Even under these most difficulty circumstances, the team is working to resolve the current challenges that we are facing as an organization.&nbsp; Further, we believe that the public markets for small and micro-cap markets have greatly suffered under the current market conditions, which may include naked and short selling that has occurred across North America.&nbsp; It is the Company’s belief that it has been the victim of these manipulative trading practices, negatively impacting the Company and our shareholders.&nbsp; We believe that this process has greatly affected the Company’s share price contributing to the Company’s inability to raise the necessary funds to proceed with normal operations, including the regulatory requirements for the Company’s listing on the CSE and compensating its management, employees, and other partners.&nbsp; However, we remain resolved, to the best of our ability, to work to right the ship and continue to move forward,” said David Lucatch, CEO Liquid Avatar Technologies. </p>



<p>The Company continues to dedicate efforts to Aftermath Islands and its complementary programs including Lost Kingdom of T’Sara (LKoT), its play to earn (P2E) platform.&nbsp; In its first year, LKoT users generated over 9.2 million Resource Pack NFTs.&nbsp; The Aftermath Islands metaverse platform has continued to operate in Beta having achieved approximately US$3 Million in gross sales, and subject to further funding by Aftermath Islands, the Company expects Aftermath Islands to continue to develop the platform.</p>



<p>As part of the AIM Creator program (originally Meta Hero Project) Meta Karaoke, an online AI powered Avatar performance platform, was acquired by Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited, as originally announced on August 3, 2022, from Pegasus (Gibraltar) Limited, a related party of the Company.&nbsp; Further to this agreement, given the current economic and changing market conditions, Aftermath Islands has not fulfilled its agreed upon obligations to pay the appropriate fees for program sales under the terms of the agreement as well as to continue to fund the further development of the program.&nbsp; &nbsp;The parties have agreed that rather than terminating the agreement, the matter will be settled by transferring back up to 80% ownership of the Meta Karaoke program, which is currently in a development stage, to Pegasus (Gibraltar) Limited.&nbsp; Aftermath Islands Metaverse Limited and Oasis Digital Studios will retain a combined initial minority equity interest in the new entity of approximately 20%.&nbsp; Pursuant to Multilateral Instrument 61-101 Protection of Minority Security Holders in Special Transactions (“MI 61-101”), the transfer back to Pegasus (Gibraltar) Limited constitutes a “related party transaction”.&nbsp; The Company is relying on exemptions from the formal valuation and minority approval requirements of MI 61-101, specifically: (i) the valuation requirement of MI 61-101 by virtue of the exemption contained in Section 5.5(b), as the Company’s Common Shares are not listed on a market specified in MI 61-101, and (ii) the minority shareholder approval requirement of MI 61-101 by virtue of the exemption contained in Section 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101, as the fair market value of the assets being transferred back do not exceed 25% of the Company’s market capitalization (as determined under MI 61-101).&nbsp; A material change report will not be filed by the Company as the transfer does not constitute a material change.</p>

   The W3C is becoming more involved in the digital identity credential and wallet space due to the growing use of web browsers for various digital activities. This involvement includes addressing how browsers interact with identity wallets. An incubation effort is taking place within the Web Incubator Community Group (WICG) to investigate these issues and establish standards.

<p>Have you been following the latest efforts within the W3C about digital identity wallets? There is a reason the W3C is increasingly involved in the digital identity credential and wallet space. Here’s why: whether you like it or not, browsers have a role to play in the digital wallet space. People use the web for everything, from online shopping to remote access to government services. Much of the time, they use the web via a web browser. Things start to get interesting, however, when digital credentials enter into the equation. The <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/government/identity/eidas-regulations">eIDAS 2.0</a> regulation in Europe requires that EU citizens and residents are offered digital credentials. Those credentials must be usable in a wealth of digital use cases that cross international borders.</p>



<p>Similarly, in the US, more and more states are offering digital credentials and associated wallets. In all cases, governments require that the credentials they issue be usable independently of any particular platform. In most architectures, the digital credentials are stored in a digital wallet. There is an open question as to how web browsers behave in a wallet world. Are they themselves a digital wallet, or do they act as an interface to help individuals select their wallets? As browser vendors (and the rest of the world) work to answer that question, they need to determine how to manage wallets (either a third party’s or their own) predictably, safely, and consistently. That’s where standards development comes in.</p>



 Web and Identity Wallets 



<p>In the W3C, where browser vendors and organizations interested in web standards do their thing, standardization generally starts with a less formal, quickly iterative process of incubation within a community group. If the ideas developed in a community group seem viable, they will move into a working group (either an existing one or a new one created for the purpose) to further mature into a standard. What this post is talking about is a new incubation effort within the Web Incubator Community Group (WICG) called the<a href="https://github.com/wicg/identity-credential"> Identity Credential</a> project.</p>



<p>The WICG Identity Credential project is building on an existing API called the Credential Management API. According to the proposed project charter, the Credential Management API is “designed to delegate the user experience to the browser, such as presenting digital wallet(s)&nbsp; from which users can select a requested credential. The specification is designed to be extensible, with comprehensive integration points. Each&nbsp; of these points has customizable security properties, like requiring a&nbsp; user gesture or being callable only from a top-level browsing context,&nbsp; to name a few.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Keeping Data Private 



<p>The trick is to expand upon this work to enable the browser to present the individual’s claims (aka, the statement that a particular person/entity has a particular property). That includes digital credentials and wallets. This is a good thing for both privacy and security; the less the browser knows, the happier everyone is. But it does make things a bit more complicated. If you’ve read anything about digital wallets, you probably have seen words like <a href="https://www.dock.io/guides/credential-verification-guide">“issuer,” “verifier,” and “holder.”</a> Those are good words to know, but the work in the Identity Credential project is about what happens on your device.</p>



 Deep in Your Device 



<p>When someone kicks off a transaction within their web browser that requires a digital credential held within an identity wallet, that requires information sharing between:</p>



 
 the web browser, also known as the user agent 



 the native or web-based application, which is a distinct application or service acting as the digital wallet 



 the underlying platform, often the operating system though there are other models possible 
 



<p>These three parts may come from entirely different vendors, and no part fully trusts any other part. In order for them to communicate, they need to have some rules as to what to say and how to say it. That’s what these APIs do: they set the rules for how different components communicate, making it clear what type of information can be requested (and what can’t).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The web platform API’s job is to provide the line of communication between a verifier website and a browser. The browser is then responsible for getting the request into the platform via platform-specific APIs. And finally, the underlying platform is responsible for getting the request to the appropriate identity wallet (also via platform-specific APIs). Lots of hoops to jump through, but that’s how security often works.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>All of this is purely to make sure the different entities know how to talk to the wallet and request only the information required. The information within the wallet itself – the credential in whatever format it takes – is actually a separate thing. The format of the credential simply doesn’t matter for the sake of this specification, just like the postal service does not need to read your physical letters (or bills!) to deliver them.</p>



<p>There are so many questions that still need to be answered. Is this design the right one? Will it provide the privacy and security required by people (and legislation) around the world? Do browsers need to worry at all about the credential format within the identity wallet? How many formats do there need to be, anyway? You are always welcome to help find the answers to those questions by getting involved in the standards process. We would love to have you!</p>

  <p>Thousands of customers have tested or deployed Microsoft Entra ID Governance since it launched on July 1, 2023, seeing the value in governing the identities of their workforce. Many of those customers have asked about extending this governance to the identities of their business guests—contractors, partners, and external collaborators—to more fully follow least privilege access principles while still enabling seamless collaboration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm pleased to announce that we're helping organizations to more easily manage this situation by creating a new ID Governance license for business guests. This license will operate on a monthly active usage (MAU) model. Customers will be able to acquire licenses matching their anticipated business guest MAU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help our customers expand least privilege access to their business guests, ID Governance for business guest licenses will be priced at $0.75 per MAU, and we anticipate making them available in spring 2024. In the interim, organizations that govern the identities of their employees with ID Governance can govern the identities of their business guests for no additional cost.&nbsp;Existing Azure AD External ID customers are grandfathered to continue using the subset of identity governance features that are included in Entra ID P1 and P2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why govern the identities of business guests?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Business guests are external collaborators who need access to an organization’s resources and applications for a specific purpose and duration. Examples of business guests include contractors, consultants, vendors, or partners. Business guests pose unique challenges for identity governance, as they often have dynamic and unpredictable access needs, and they may not follow internal policies and standards. Without proper governance, business guests can introduce access risks, such as over-privileged accounts, orphaned accounts, or unauthorized access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra ID Governance helps address these challenges by enabling you to:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Define and enforce access policies for business guests, such as requiring sponsorship, approval, and attestation.&nbsp; 
 Automate the provisioning and deprovisioning of business guest accounts, based on their project or contract duration.&nbsp; 
 Monitor and audit the access activities and behaviors of business guests and detect and remediate any anomalies or violations.&nbsp; 
 Provide a method for internal sponsors to review and approve their requests.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this step, our customers can ensure that all identities in their organization are governed.&nbsp;Thank you for partnering with us to help protect your digital estates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This challenge was set to provide insights into a pressing geographic location in Africa, Marsabit, Kenya. The ecological well-being of Marsabit has hung in a delicate equilibrium in recent&nbsp;years.</p><p>Climate fluctuations and human undertakings sway the volatility of the general climate in Marsabit, Kenya. This challenge was designed to challenge participants in making accurate, dependable forecasts that could have a profound impact on risk mitigation, insurance pricing, and crop prediction in the region. Data scientists participating in this challenge had the potential to steer the adoption of sustainable practices within the region, as well as have their model and insights shared with decision-makers tackling this&nbsp;issue.</p><p>Ocean was fortunate to host this data challenge in collaboration with <a href="https://shamba.network/">Shamba Network</a>, a leader in monitoring and reporting verification leveraging blockchain technology. Shamba fueled this competition with relevant data sets to conduct our assessment. The data sets provided included:</p>  eVIIRS-NDVI Historical data  Dynamic GeoAPI&nbsp;data  geoJSON coordinates of Marsabit county in&nbsp;Kenya  <p>We received a basket of in-depth reports about this subject. After thorough grading and review by an evaluation committee of experts, we awarded three winners to be compensated for their efforts. The winning reports are as&nbsp;follows:</p> 1st place — Nicolas Landry ($2500&nbsp;prize) <p>Nicolas’ report is available to download via the Ocean Market here: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:61a0bef8cb43e1745435aa0981204da96ad24e7243123f085407dab2c35a6e59">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:61a0bef8cb43e1745435aa0981204da96ad24e7243123f085407dab2c35a6e59</a></p><p>A highlight of this report is Nicolas’ fantastic demonstration of walking readers through the NDVI historical data. As&nbsp;follows:</p><p>“This is in the form of 808&nbsp;.tif images. Each contains 912 by 882 pixels, which have a value between 0 and 255, corresponding to the NDVI value at each&nbsp;point.</p><p>The file name gives us an indication of the year the data is from; for example, ea1207_COG.tif is the 7th&nbsp;.tif picture of 2012. We have the tif starting from this one, ea1207_COG, to ea2316_COG, and then six of them are in the form ea2317m_COG and seem to be negatives/acquired through another&nbsp;process.</p><p>Except for 2012, which starts at 07, and 2023, which stops at 16 or 23m, for each year, we have 72&nbsp;.tif pictures that contain the NDVI value on each&nbsp;point.</p><p>From this 0 to 255 pixel value, it is easy to get the NDVI value at this&nbsp;point.</p><p>You want first to convert the pixel values of each&nbsp;.tif file using the&nbsp;formula:</p><p>NDVI = Pixel value-100100</p><p>The dynamic GeoAPI data asset (for the last 1 month, with 10 days lag) of eVIIRS-NDVI for Marsabit county of Kenya (updated).”</p><p>Nicolas had the highest accuracy metrics overall, which indicated the model created in this report was the best fit. However, one thing that stood out to the scoring committee from a qualitative point of view is that Nicolas’ model only predicted 5 days in advance (i.e., one data point since the data has a 5-day granularity.)</p><p>For this and a stellar presentation layout, Nicolas has been awarded 1st place for this data challenge.</p> 2nd place — Andrey Bessalov ($1500&nbsp;Prize) <p>This report is available to download via the Ocean Market here: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:0273191bae5ef3b7ba71909abfbec8dc453b551e5c22ac1d8aa5185339e43540">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:0273191bae5ef3b7ba71909abfbec8dc453b551e5c22ac1d8aa5185339e43540</a></p><p>Andrey’s model predicted a season in advance, differentiating this report from other contestants. This seasonal prediction is longer term, hence more useful for taking action (e.g., providing anticipatory aid). So, Andrey’s model had lower accuracy than the winning report (MAE of 0.027 vs. 0.01), but it’s more useful given its longer time&nbsp;horizon.</p><p>Andrey’s preprocessing of the data for time series analysis, particularly testing and handling of stationarity, was a more rigorous approach relative to other reports submitted in this challenge. This could be down to the fact that Andrey used SARIMA while other podium finishing reports used linear regression, and the latter model is not as affected by stationarity in the data as the&nbsp;former.</p><p>Pulled from Andrey’s report, the image below shows the average NDVI values with the addition of peak points highlighted as green and orange (max and min), calculated using the scipy.signal.find_peaks() function.</p><p>We see a clear seasonal structure of the graph with different amplitudes of fluctuations. We can also see that the frequency of fluctuations varies slightly from season to season, but in general, the spread of these values is&nbsp;small.</p><p>We have two seasons per&nbsp;year:</p><p>First season (average estimations):</p>  Starts on Feb&nbsp;25  Reaches peak value on May 12 (76 days&nbsp;later)  Ends on Aug 22 (178 days&nbsp;later)  <p>Second season (average estimations):</p>  Starts on Aug&nbsp;22  Reaches peak value on Nov 29 (99 days&nbsp;later)  Ends on Feb 25 (187 days&nbsp;later)  <p>Andrey used more sophisticated models (SARIMA and XGBOOST), while alternative reports only used regression models. While sophisticated models are only sometimes better than simpler ones, our scoring committee thought Andrey explored models more commonly used in time series modeling. This report was also able to show the difference in performance between the two different types of models and thus had a more comprehensive analytical process. Based on these highlights, second place has been awarded to Andrey’s&nbsp;report.</p> 3rd place — Mint ($1000&nbsp;Prize) <p>This report is available to download via the Ocean Market here: <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:d05ca461ac6300e86221c2edf588e0eed447a909ff72dd92040175932aab55b4">https://market.oceanprotocol.com/asset/did:op:d05ca461ac6300e86221c2edf588e0eed447a909ff72dd92040175932aab55b4</a></p><p>Mint was awarded a 3rd place finish amongst the participants in this data challenge. Mint’s report provided great detail and insights into the transformation &amp; feature creation portion of this challenge. The two-legged task of data transformation and feature creation included the following scoring sections:</p>  Transformation &amp; Imputation: Address any missing values, outliers, or skewed distributions in the dataset. Justify your chosen methodologies.  Feature Creation: Generate new features that enhance the model’s predictive capability. This could include calculating rolling averages, seasonality components, or other relevant&nbsp;metrics.  <p>To showcase this terrific showcase of data science skills, we can see below from Mint’s report that details Time-Related Feature Engineering:</p><p>In the realm of time-related feature engineering, the goal is often to encapsulate the inherent cycles and periodicities within the data. However, simply throwing raw Ordinal time-related features in the mix is unlikely to yield optimal results. Why? Because These raw features do not inherently understand the cyclical nature of time. For example, a raw month feature would treat December and January as vastly different, not recognizing the seamless transition between the end of one year and the start of the&nbsp;next.</p><p>The image above shows&nbsp;us:</p><p>● Ordinal Features: The chart highlights the limitations of using raw ordinal time-related features, which fail to capture the cyclical nature of time. For example, the transition from December to January appears as a discontinuity.</p><p>● Trigonometric Features: Sine and cosine transformations are depicted to capture the cyclic behavior of time, peaking, and troughing in line with natural cycles. However, they may not capture month-specific nuances effectively.</p><p>● Periodic Spline-Based Features: The graph illustrates the power of using splines, which allow the model to focus on specific months. Using the “periodic” extrapolation parameter ensures a smooth transition between December and January, effectively tackling the discontinuity issue.</p><p>Mint’s ability to visualize the data provided, offer insights &amp; takeaways from the issue, and present these findings in business-ready format were key characteristics that awarded this report a podium&nbsp;finish.</p> Summary <p>This challenge showed a great experiment testing machine learning tactics applied to a real-world issue &amp; a changing&nbsp;climate.</p><p>Can other regions globally benefit from predictive analytics from a data challenge with Ocean Protocol?</p><p>Reach out to us in our discord <a href="https://discord.gg/yFRPH9PCN4">#data-science-hub</a> channel: <a href="https://discord.gg/yFRPH9PCN4">https://discord.gg/yFRPH9PCN4</a></p><p>To see past, current, and future data challenges sponsored by Ocean, please visit <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/earn/data-challenges">https://oceanprotocol.com/earn/data-challenges</a>.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Jürgen Schulze</a></p><p>The side effects of (re)generative AI impacting cyber security</p>
<p>Professionally paranoids can't but look at ChatGPT and its siblings from a risk perspective. Well, at least initially. We tend to think in risk vectors, threat actors and alike. Leaving all innovative benefits of the technology aside, there are sensitive elements that require attention. This is how we currently deal with this kind of innovation: Impulse driven …</p>
<p>In a first "impulse", we try to fit what we see into the simple equation where risk equals probability times damage. As a result, we get nervous as, looking at ChatGPT and its siblings, we can do the math neither on probability nor on the potential damage that the use of this technology could bear for us. The deeper we drill, the more questions we get. Scientifically sound answers drip through the tickers only at a slow pace since many of those require research time prior to assessing the effects. And that does not happen over night.</p>
<p>In a second "impulse", we focus on the obvious: the elements, that we are familiar with and which resonate the most in public perception. I.e. those clickbaits which constantly make headlines. This can be the result of a first, publicly prominent traumatic experience in adopting a new technology. It can also be intelligent marketing where our expectations are repetitively framed in order to overshadow those risks, that are not within the "cozy" technology coloured framework of the cyber community.</p>
<p>In a third "impulse", we call for regulation and put the responsibility on the shoulders of the lawmakers as we're lacking all means of dealing with what we can't combat in the very moment. Interestingly enough, that typically does not lead to short term solutions but to a reputation disaster of the cyber community where the classic perception of us hindering innovation is taking over the public discourse. Regulation, on top, is perceived as evil. Even more than the targets of the regulatory efforts. Whoever they are.</p>
<p>In a fourth "impulse", and in absence of any progress in dealing with the tangible and intangible risks, we'll blame what will inevitably go wrong, to those who are putting this new technology to the practice and, in absence of protective measures, awareness and training, unavoidably hit wrong buttons on the way. I call that the "Lieschen Mueller-effect". The blame goes to the weakest link in the chain.</p>
<p>After all those impulses, we'll realize that we wasted time, efforts and money fighting the genie who is irreversibly out of the bottle rather than understanding the various risk factors, what they entail, their interdependence and which experts to consult, in dealing with those and, ultimately, mitigating their impact.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5394">In our workshop</a>, I'll share with you some of my findings of my book and invite you to jointly revisit a selection of those factors that detrimentally impact our cyber security infrastructure such as:&nbsp;Trust, Credibility, Identity, Authenticity, Context, Value, Bias, Control, Intellectual Property, Confidentiality, Convenience, Liability, Ethics, Integrity.</p>
<p>We'll go beyond the obvious and get a better understanding on how to consciously and responsibly put new technology to action. All of that while increasing the security awareness around the use of (re)gen AI.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
<p>I recently had the privilege to spend some time with Kumar and Pallavi to dive into the heart of the <a href="https://www.bhutanndi.com/">Bhutan National Digital Identity (NDI)</a> Project, a pioneering initiative that stands as a testament to Bhutan’s leadership in digital trust.</p>
<p>The origins of Bhutan’s digital program were particularly fascinating for two primary reasons. Firstly, it stemmed from the necessity to empower citizens, especially those in rural areas, with access to essential financial and governmental services. A question of citizen empowerment.. Secondly, the Bhutanese leadership consciously prioritized privacy as a fundamental right for its people. What stands out in this narrative is the clear identification of needs that were not dictated by a technology-first approach. Instead, it was the requirements of empowerment and privacy that naturally led to the adoption of a digital solution, encompassing digital wallets and credentials within privacy-centric frameworks.</p>
<p>This project is not just a technological leap forward but a holistic approach that intertwines the legal, business, and technological threads to weave a robust digital identity framework. I chose to approach our discussion through the lenses of business, legal, and technology, with a deliberate focus on legal aspects first. Why? Because the legal framework is the bedrock upon which the entire edifice of digital identity is built. It’s the underpinning that ensures the rights, privacy, and trust of citizens are not just considered but enshrined.</p>
<p>From there, we transitioned to the business perspective—how this digital identity initiative could catalyze growth, inclusion, and opportunity for all stakeholders. And finally, we touched on technology, the enabler, yet intentionally saved for last. In the grand scheme of things, technology is the tool, not the master; it’s the least important aspect when it comes to the values and impact on the citizens’ lives.</p>

<p>Small businesses face special challenges in managing their employee onboarding and offboarding processes with limited resources. Without a fully staffed IT or HR department, there’s often just one person covering “operations” for the whole organization. And in some companies, someone with a totally unrelated job ends up running these functions.</p>
<p>We’re like that, actually. <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/why-are-we-giving-yeshid-onboard-away-for-free/">As a startup</a>, YeshID has a small staff. In addition to my founder duties, I’m the one to handle IT employee onboarding and offboarding for our team. And that’s the way we want it for now — we’re keeping overhead low so we can concentrate on building the best product. But that doesn’t mean we want to skimp on laying a good foundation for tomorrow.</p>
<p>In a situation like this, efficiency and simplicity are so important. It’s not just about <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/a-non-technical-guide-how-to-streamline-employee-onboarding-in-google-workspace/">providing an email address for new employees</a>. You have to add them to the correct organizations and groups in your Google Workspace; keep track of who has permissions for what applications; track the number and cost of app and software licenses, keep up with which teams own which services, and the list goes on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technology can help you streamline, templatize, and automate your user onboarding and offboarding procedures. In this post, I’ll talk about what to look for in a tool.</p>
 User-friendly IT onboarding and offboarding 
<p>The first thing you should consider when evaluating an onboarding solution is its user-friendliness. You need a tool that is easy for both administrators (aka you) and users to navigate. The last thing you want on your already overloaded calendar is extensive training for a complicated system. Look for a solution with an intuitive interface and a straightforward setup process.</p>
<p>One of the most significant advantages of a user-friendly onboarding solution is its ability to templatize and automate repetitive tasks. Look for a solution that offers customizable templates, task assignments, and email notifications. This not only saves time but also minimizes the chances of errors. You’ll also want to make sure the tool lets your employees request access to the apps they need — and that access is routed to the appropriate approver.</p>
 A secure and compliant employee onboarding and offboarding tool 
<p>Handling third-party data can be scary and requires robust security measures. Your onboarding solution should comply with data protection regulations and keep your data safe. Look for features like passwordless encryption and access controls to protect sensitive information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Different industries have specific compliance and regulatory requirements that must be met during onboarding and offboarding. Ensure that the onboarding solution aligns with these requirements. Ideally, you should be able to track provisioning/deprovisioning in a single dashboard to offboard a user with confidence while maintaining compliance and reducing license costs.</p>
 New employee onboarding and offboarding that grows with you 
<p>Your business may be small today, but tomorrow’s looking bright! Consider whether the onboarding solution can grow with you. It should be able to accommodate a growing number of users without significant disruptions. Scalability ensures that you won’t outgrow your onboarding tool as your business expands. And with the right tools, you can actually set yourself up for success by <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/tips-for-building-effective-iam-processes-at-your-startup/">creating good processes from the beginning</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://yeshid.com/post/the-history-of-sso-and-why-its-time-for-a-change/">Beware the SSO tax</a> on this one though. Some access management solutions require you to advance your engineering practices far beyond what most small- to medium-sized businesses need. Don’t settle for a solution that requires you to jump over unnecessary hurdles.&nbsp;</p>
 Cost-effective IT onboarding solutions 
<p>Until someone invents the money tree, it’s essential to consider the overall cost of the tool in relation to the value it provides. This includes licensing fees, implementation costs, and ongoing maintenance. Make sure you’re getting the features and support you need without breaking your budget. A cost-effective solution should offer a good balance between functionality and affordability.</p>
<p>The flip side of this one is to make sure you’re not signing up for a solution that you’ll have to grow into fast. Many of the options in this space are overkill. They are expensive and time-consuming to implement — especially when what you really need is just to get people to work using solid best practices, not advanced technology.&nbsp;</p>
 The best onboarding and offboarding for small businesses 
<p>Identity and access management in the 21st century means digital onboarding, provisioning of the hundred-and-one software apps your org uses, plus traditional hardware setup. It’s become complex (and often frustrating) for both managers and employees. Finding the right onboarding solution for your small business can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your onboarding and offboarding processes.</p>
<p><a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">YeshID Onboard</a> provides an option for smaller companies that have embarked on their identity and access management journeys but aren’t in a place yet where they need a very technical (or expensive) solution. We provide a quick and easy way to accomplish your checklist today while setting up the foundational best practices that will help you grow in the future.</p>
 
 Templatize and schedule onboarding and offboarding tasks to set up a repeatable process for ease and speed. 
 Assign application administrator(s) then automatically route requests for provisioning to the proper owners. 
 Track provisioning/de-provisioning in a single dashboard to offboard a user with confidence while maintaining compliance and reducing license costs. 
 Empower employees to initiate requests for new application access that are automatically routed to the proper application administrator. 
 And because it’s in beta, YeshID Onboard is free (<a href="https://yeshid.com/post/why-are-we-giving-yeshid-onboard-away-for-free/">yes, like free free</a>) for the first 100 companies to sign up (must be in Google Workspace and have 50-250 employees). 
 
<p>Start streamlining your onboarding and offboarding processes without the need for budget approval or credit card information. You’ll also get access to an exclusive Slack community of small business hustlers and heroes just like you so we can share, support, and celebrate together. Take something off your never-ending to-do list and <a href="https://yeshid.com/onboard/">sign up today</a>.</p>

  <p>Join identity and experts at KuppingerCole Analysts and BeyondTrust as they discuss the impact of the evolution of business IT, the trends shaping the identity landscape, the importance of identity security, and the role of privileged access management (PAM), cloud infrastructure entitlement management (CIEM), and identity threat detection and response (ITDR).</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole, will look at the convergence of PAM, CIEM, and ITDR, and their place within the Identity Fabric concept. He will analyze why new technologies are required to deal with ever-increasing cyberattacks and the reality of today’s hybrid and dynamic IT, and why a holistic approach is needed.</p>
<p>Marc Maiffret, Chief Technology Officer at BeyondTrust, will explain the value of an identity-first security strategy and the pivotal role of PAM, supported by CIEM and ITDR, in building a next-gen security capability. He will share insights on how to reap the rewards of digital transformation, while keeping the attack surface in check and minimizing risk.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-security-pam-ciem-itdr"></a>
