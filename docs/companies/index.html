<p><a href="https://imageware.io/">TECH5</a> is trying to generate more interest in its T5-Digital ID solution. To that end, the company is launching a new pilot program that will allow organizations to move forward with rapid implementations of the digital ID offering.</p>



  



<p>At the moment, the rapid pilots are only being offered to organizations that are already a part of TECH5’s certified partner network. Those that do want to participate will have access to a partner onboarding program, through which TECH5 will offer knowledge and training to streamline (and optimize) the digital ID deployment process.</p>



<p>T5-Digital ID itself allows people to create and store a digital ID on a mobile device. That ID is <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/tech5-ties-immunity-credential-biometric-template-72202101/">linked to its owner through biometrics</a>, which in turn allows third parties to verify the authenticity of those IDs, even in areas where there is no internet connection. TECH5 believes that the digital IDs will have utility in a range of different sectors, including healthcare, <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/tech5-develop-new-payment-authentication-system-indian-market-090704/">payments</a>, and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/tech5-increases-support-mosip-identity-program-090905/">national identity programs</a>.</p>



<p>“The pilot project proposal with a pre-packaged set of services and technology components will help our partners to get a quick understanding of how the technology works in operational conditions and establish real-world references that support our claims related to the seamless process of fast and accurate contactless biometric capture and identity verification, whatever the vertical market” said TECH5 Strategic Advisor Rob Haslam.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>TECH5’s compression technology allows it to store digital IDs (with face and fingerprint templates and face images) in an efficient digital container that only takes up about 2KB of memory. The company will provide tech support for every stage of the deployment process, covering everything from concept all the way through to design and sales.</p>



<p>In doing so, TECH5 is hoping that the T5-Digital ID will help fuel its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/yinda-invests-another-8-million-tech5-052101/">ongoing expansion</a>. The company has already opened a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/tech5-opens-new-uk-subsidiary-021906/">new office in the UK</a>, and plans to raise its international profile with additional offices in India, Australia, Portugal, and the United Arab Emirates.</p>

<p>CaixaBank has integrated <a href="https://www.revelock.com/en/">Revelock</a>’s behavioral biometrics technology into its CaixaBankNow online banking platform. The solution analyzes each user’s behavioral patterns to generate a risk score during each session, and can step in if those patterns deviate from the established profile for that individual. Those discrepancies could point to the presence of a fraudster.</p>



  



<p>The news builds on the existing relationship between the two companies. CaixaBank and Revelock have been working together since 2015, when Revelock was still operating as buguroo (the company <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/buguroo-forms-new-advisory-board-rebrands-revelock-042107/">rebranded earlier this year</a>). According to CaixaBank, collaborating with start-ups like Revelock is beneficial because it allows the bank to stay ahead of the innovation curve, and bring new anti-fraud solutions to the market more quickly than their competitors. The start-ups, meanwhile, are able to scale faster than they can while operating alone.</p>



<p>In that regard, the Revelock solution is designed to prevent fraud in a digital environment. CaixaBank is currently one of the top banks in Spain, and has the country’s largest digital customer base with more than 10 million users.</p>



<p>Revelock itself is also based in Spain, and recently partnered another CaixaBank collaborator in the country. FacePhi’s facial recognition technology was deployed in <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facephi-caixabank-biometric-atm-502143/">CaixaBank’s biometric ATMs</a> back in 2019, giving customers the ability to withdraw cash with a facial recognition scan rather than a PIN at a handful of branches in Barcelona. Revelock and FacePhi officially <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facephi-revelock-team-up-provide-comprehensive-coverage-financial-sector-051209/">joined forces back in May</a>, shortly after Revelock released a new <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/behavioral-biometrics-drive-new-revelock-anti-fraud-solution-75202106/">Fraud Detection and Response Platform</a> to help financial institutions respond to fraud in a more timely manner.</p>



<p>Revelock was <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/giant-anti-fraud-startup-feedzai-acquires-revelock-080901/">acquired by Feedzai</a> just over a month ago. Euromoney credited CaixaBank with carrying out the “World’s Best Bank Transformation” in 2021, while the US magazine Global Finance listed the bank as the year’s Best Bank in Spain and in Western Europe.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nextbiometrics.com/">NEXT Biometrics</a> has hired a former executive from another fingerprint sensor specialist as its latest important hire. The company has announced that Ulf Ritsvall is its new Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing, with the position to become effective on October 15, 2021.</p>



<p>Ritsvall is coming to the company from Fingerprint Cards, where he initially started as the head of marketing and communications in 2019, and most recently occupied the role of head of business development. Like NEXT Biometrics, Fingerprint Cards is a developer of <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/fpc-forecasts-continued-growth-capacitive-sensor-business-051705/">fingerprint sensor solutions</a>, though the latter has a stronger focus on mobile device applications.</p>



<p>In announcing the appointment, however, NEXT Biometrics painted Ritsvall’s track record in broad strokes, emphasizing his management experience in the ICT and biometrics industries, and highlighting his “strong commercial background and experience from commercializing both start-ups and more established operations.”</p>



<p>“We are pleased to have an experienced executive like Mr. Ritsvall joining NEXT,” said CEO Peter Heuman. “His global track record from the Biometric industry will strengthen our ability to commercialize our solutions and accelerate growth.”</p>



<p>News of the appointment comes soon after NEXT received an <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/next-biometrics-gets-first-order-in-multi-year-contract-709132/">initial purchase order</a> from a multi-year contract with an unnamed client that the company has described as a European tech company. The company also picked up momentum in <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/next-biometrics-aadhaar-market-pagaria-order-706101/">India’s Aadhaar market</a> thanks to orders received earlier this year.</p>



<p>“NEXT offers a unique thermal biometric technology with potential to disrupt a number of selected market segments,” said Ritsvall. “With multiple recent design wins and established high potential partnerships, I am looking forward to join NEXT” said Ulf Ritsvall.”</p>

<p>In a move meant to help keep communities safe during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, two of Australia’s most populous states have announced trials of a system that will use facial recognition software to allow police to track people who are supposed to be quarantining at home. The move has already sparked controversy, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australias-two-largest-states-trial-facial-recognition-software-police-pandemic-2021-09-16/">with Reuters reporting</a> that “the vast majority of the country’s population” are opposed to the programs.</p>



  



<p>The two states in question — New South Wales (NSW), and Victoria — are home to Sydney and Melbourne, which make up more than half of Australia’s population of 25 million. </p>



<p>The system works by having people who have been asked to quarantine to respond to a series of random checks by taking a selfie in their designated home quarantine address. The software uses both facial recognition and location data to verify that the image is in fact the individual in question, and that they are indeed at home.</p>



<p>Police may also conduct a follow-up visit to the designated location to confirm the results of the selfie check.</p>



<p>The trials, which are being conducted by tech firm Genvis Pty Ltd., are on a voluntary basis using software developed by the Perth-based startup in 2020 with the help of Western Australia-based police in order to help enforce local pandemic restrictions regarding movement.</p>



<p>The last few years have seen widespread adoption of facial recognition technology throughout Australia, for a variety of purposes.</p>



<p>Recently, the government of South Australia <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/south-australia-clamps-down-on-problem-gambling-with-facial-recognition-tech-052809/">passed a law</a> that requires the use of the technology in many gambling establishments, with more than 230 such businesses reportedly already on board.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, the Australian Taxation Office added facial recognition-based identity verification to its<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/australian-taxation-office-adds-iproov-liveness-detection-digital-mygovid-system-031607/"> myGovID digital identity platform</a>, using iProov’s Genuine Presence Assurance tech to let residents access certain government services using their facial biometrics.</p>



<p>The new trials in NSW and Victoria follow the launch of a similar program in South Australia that began just last month and led to a number of warnings from privacy advocates throughout the globe concerned about the potential for the system to be used for surveillance that would go beyond its intended scope.</p>



<p>While the program has been positioned by officials as an alternative to hotel quarantine mandates under police guard, questions regarding the potential privacy problems have largely gone unanswered, with NSW police referring queries to the state premier, who said in an email that they were “close to piloting some home quarantine options for returning Australians”.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, their counterparts in Victoria are pointing to the Victorian Health Department (which has yet to make a statement) for their response, and Genvis Chief Executive Kirstin Butcher declined to comment on the trials beyond telling Reuters in a phone interview that “[y]ou can’t have home quarantine without compliance checks, if you’re looking to keep communities safe… [and you] can’t perform physical compliance checks at the scale needed to support (social and economic) re-opening plans so technology has to be used.”</p>



<p>Among the critics of the use of the technology is Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of New South Wales, Toby Walsh.</p>



<p>“I’m troubled not just by the use here but by the fact this is an example of the creeping use of this sort of technology in our lives,” said Walsh. “Even if it works here… then it validates the idea that facial recognition is a good thing. Where does it end?”</p>

<p>European door access specialist ekey is using <a href="https://www.fingerprints.com/">Fingerprint Cards</a> technology in a new solution, signaling ongoing success for the latter in its efforts to make inroads in the access control market.</p>



<p>The new solution, dubbed “ekey dLine”, features an FPC sensor to enable biometric access control. While ekey has offered biometric door lock solutions for some time, the new offering is being touted as a smart door system that can be integrated with other smart home devices, enabling functionality such as automatically turning on connected lights when a door is opened.</p>



<p>The ekey dLine solution also allows users to remotely unlock the door via a connected app, with support for push notifications and the ability to trigger a silent alarm.</p>



<p>News of the sensor integration arrives after FPC announced in June that its biometric technology had been integrated into a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/fpc-tech-used-in-new-biometric-door-lock-906241/">door lock solution from Kaadas</a>. Before that, Fingerprint Cards revealed in February that Fueb Labs was using its FPC BM-Lite module in a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-fpc-places-bm-lite-new-smart-door-lock-fueb-labs-022107/">smart home door lock</a> solution of its own.</p>



<p>For ekey’s part, biometric systems manager Raphaela Gallner praised FPC’s technology in a statement announcing the integration. “With the ekey dLine, we are proud to be providing an intelligent access control system that meets the wishes of tomorrow’s customers today, combining high-performing sensors in European quality from Fingerprints with our smart product design,” she said.</p>



<p>While Fingerprint Cards established itself as a leading provider of fingerprint sensors in the mobile biometrics boom over the past decade, the company has recently sought to expand into new application areas for its technology, including access control. In April, the company opened a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/fpc-plans-new-offices-europe-china-singapore-704091/">new office in Zug, Switzerland</a>, that would focus on its payments and access control business activities, and it is perhaps no coincidence that FPC’s latest client is based in neighboring Austria.</p>

<p>How Verifiable Credentials can transform your business</p><p>Dock’s API allows you to easily issue, verify, manage, and revoke verifiable credentials and decentralized identities. PDF certifications can be easily forged meaning online diplomas and certifications are becoming less valuable. Dock has built a decentralized network on which organizations can create their own identities, and use these identities to issue credentials that can be cryptographically verified. </p><p>This approach removes the manual verification steps from the process of issuing and handling non-verifiable credentials and saves an organization heaps of time. Verifiable Credentials also stop any fraudulent activity and ensure all credentials on a digital wallet are genuine. </p><p>With hundreds of organizations offering online courses, businesses must work to set themselves apart from the competition. Verifiable Credentials allow LMS organizations to produce unique certifications tailored to each individual and stop any fraudulent activity. Millions of people sign up for online courses daily. With most free online courses, everyone, whether they’ve attended or not, receives a certificate verifying they have completed the course. According to a study carried out by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/11/thousands-of-people-sign-up-for-online-classes-they-never-end-up-taking/281709/">The Atlantic</a>, two-thirds of people who sign up to take an online course do not show up.

 GiD Report#178 — The WSJ’s FB investigation and Gary Gensler’s Senate testimony <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-177-should-coinbase-litigate-to-innovate-3213b882c583">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The WSJ FB&nbsp;expose  Gary Gensler’s Senate&nbsp;hearing  The future of NFTs and&nbsp;DeFi  Stuff happens   1. The WSJ Facebook expose that everyone’s talking&nbsp;about Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Photo: Fortune Live&nbsp;Media<p>Throughout Facebook’s lifetime, we’ve seen a consistent pattern of behavior that goes something like&nbsp;this:</p>  Facebook does something bad that stirs up controversy. In the early days, it was typically about privacy or security. These days, that controversy has expanded into human/cultural/social impact, moderation, democracy, monopoly power (and its abuses),&nbsp;etc.  Facebook acknowledges the issue, pledges to fix it, and promises the company will “do the right thing” — whatever that might&nbsp;be.  Some time passes, the news cycle moves on, and Facebook never really addresses the&nbsp;problem.  <p>That playbook worked for years — as the budding social network grew from scrappy startup to post-IPO Big Tech behemoth.</p><p>A series of investigations from the WSJ suitably called <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">The Facebook Files</a> more or less reveals that&nbsp;fact:</p><blockquote>Facebook Inc. knows, in acute detail, that its platforms are riddled with flaws that cause harm, often in ways only the company fully understands. That is the central finding of a Wall Street Journal series, based on a review of internal Facebook documents, including research reports, online employee discussions and drafts of presentations to senior management.</blockquote><blockquote>Time and again, the documents show, Facebook’s researchers have identified the platform’s ill effects. Time and again, despite congressional hearings, its own pledges and numerous media exposés, the company didn’t fix them. The documents offer perhaps the clearest picture thus far of how broadly Facebook’s problems are known inside the company, up to the chief executive himself.</blockquote><p>For most people, it’s probably not the most surprising revelation.</p> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">The Facebook&nbsp;Files</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/carolyn">/carolyn</a> — <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-files-xcheck-zuckerberg-elite-rules-11631541353">Facebook Says Its Rules Apply to All.

The other big news of the week: Gary Gensler’s Senate&nbsp;hearing <p>Not much new here if you’ve been following the newsletter. Gary Gensler doubles down on his crusade against crypto, in particular, targeting crypto exchanges.</p><p>From <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/sec-gary-gensler-crypto-regulation-exchanges-coinbase-securities-lending-2021-9">his Senate testimony on the&nbsp;subject</a>:</p><blockquote>“I’ve suggested that platforms and projects come in and talk to us. Many platforms have dozens or hundreds of tokens on them,” Gensler&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>“While each token’s legal status depends on its own facts and circumstances, the probability is quite remote that, with 50, 100, or 1,000 tokens, any given platform has zero securities.”</blockquote><blockquote>He added: “Make no mistake: To the extent that there are securities on these trading platforms, under our laws, they have to register with the Commission unless they qualify for an exemption.”</blockquote><p>Felix Salmon <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-capital-4d8d56a5-e785-44a8-82ad-008a4fad8354.html">provides some sober analysis</a>:</p><blockquote>State of play: Few if any U.S. crypto companies can say that they are regulated by the SEC or any other national regulator. Most of them are regulated at the state level, as money transmitters.</blockquote><p>…</p>  The SEC complains that crypto companies like Coinbase don’t come to it for regulation. They should do so, says Gensler, because those companies deal every day in tokens that can be considered securities, and a thumbs-up from the SEC would confer a degree of legitimacy that would be extremely reassuring to investors both small and&nbsp;large.  The crypto companies, on the other hand, complain that they can’t stand still waiting for regulatory approval on the basis of decades-old securities laws, while the rest of the world leaps ahead with innovations like distributed exchanges — smart contracts where it can be hard to even find a corporate entity to regulate.  <p>…</p><blockquote>The bottom line: The bigger the money, the more the demand from conservative investors for clear rules and regulations. “The DeFi guys want the TradFi money, but they don’t want the rules,” Ledger’s Joel Edgerton said at the Blockworks conference, contrasting crypto-based decentralized finance with dollar-based traditional finance. “It doesn’t work like&nbsp;that.”</blockquote><p>Nice timing then for Coinbase to <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1438247595877416962">look to offer futures and derivatives trading</a>.

				 <blockquote>
<p>Vous possédez des UNIK sur Unikname Network et voudriez les sortir sous la forme d’une autre crypto ? Vous avez des ETH, des BTC, des BNB… et vous préféreriez avoir des UNIK pour utiliser les services de la Plateforme SSI Unikname ou participer à la vie du réseau ?</p>
<p>Bonne nouvelle, les équipes Unikname développent actuellement des Bridges pour que le token UNIK devienne un token multichain !</p>
<p>Mais qu’est ce qu’un bridge entre deux blockchains ?&nbsp; Comment est-ce que cela fonctionne en général et comment fonctionnent les bridges avec Unikname Network ? Quelle sera la première blockchain interconnectée avec notre réseau ? On vous dit tout !</p>
</blockquote> 
			   
				
				
				 <p></p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Qu’est-ce qu’un Bridge entre deux blockchains ?  
			   
				
				
				  Pourquoi contrsuire des bridges ?  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Le but des bridges est de permettre l’utilisation d’une crypto donnée sur une blockchain à priori incompatible. Par exemple, les BTC, ETH et BNB ont longtemps vécu dans des écosystèmes hermétiques les uns aux autres. Or depuis quelques années avec la mise en place de bridges cross-blockchain, il devient possible d’exploiter ces cryptos dans les différents écosystèmes des unes et des autres.</p> 
			   
				
				
				 <p>En effet, les bridges permettent aux tokens natifs d’une blockchain de devenir multichain. Les tokens à échanger sont verrouillés sur leur blockchain native, et ils sont forgé sur la blockchain de cible sous une forme particulière que nous détaillons par la suite. Ces programmes établissent ainsi des canaux d’échanges de token d’une blockchain à une autre en utilisant des smart-contracts pour surveiller les transactions spécifiques reliant les réseaux entre eux.</p> 
			   
				
				
				 <p>Aujourd’hui, les tokens natifs d’un grand nombre de réseaux peuvent être impliqués dans les transactions sur de multiples blockchains.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Les dessous des bridges  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Pour transférer des tokens, le bridge va donc les verrouiller sur la blockchain de départ, et les forger sur la blockchain d’arrivée. Ces nouveaux tokens émis par le bridge ne sont pas exactement les mêmes que les tokens de départ : il s’agit d’une version embalée dans un format exploitable sur la blockchain de destination. On appelle ces nouveaux tokens des Peg.</p> 
			   
				
				
				 <p>Il n’est possible de créer des Peg que sur les blockchains comme Ethereum ou la Binance Smart Chain, capable de gérer des smart-contract.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>L’interconnexion des écosystèmes se fait donc via des réseaux spécifiques, permettant de connecter une blockchain manipulant des smart-contracts à n’importe quelle autre, et donc par rebond, à connecter entre elles toutes les blockchains, qu’elles permettent l’écriture de smart-contracts ou non.</p> 
			  
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Pour faciliter le développement communautaire de bridges, des standards de Peg ont émergé. On retrouve par exemple le standard des tokens ERC20 sur le réseau Ethereum, celui des tokens BEP20 sur la Binance Smart Chain, et il en existe encore bien d’autres.</p>
<p>Le réseau bitcoin ne permettant l’écriture de smart-contract, il n’existe pas de Peg sur la blockchain bitcoin. En revanche, il existe des PegBTC sur un grand nombre de réseaux.</p> 
			   
				
				
				 <p>Comme la génération d’un Peg sur un réseau cible correspond à la suppression d’un token natif sur la blockchain de départ et inversement, il n’y a pas de création de supply. Il s’agit plutôt de transferts de tokens d’un réseau vers un autre selon un smart-contrat assurant l’équilibre des flux. </p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Les bridges de Unikname Network  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Résolument décentralisé et ouvert à l’ensemble de la communauté blockchain, Unikname s’ouvre au reste du monde des cryptos en établissant ses propres bridges avec différentes blockchain équipées de smart-contract.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Le UNIK, un token cross-blockchain  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Le projet Unikname Network est résolument tourné vers l’interopérabilité. De la même façon que les UniknameID sont des identifiants décentralisés conçus pour être multi-plateformes, les tokens UNIK doivent être utilisables sur de nombreuses blockchains.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Unikname travaille donc sur le développement de plusieurs bridges et le premier connectera Unikname Network au réseau Ethereum. Il sera disponible peu de temps après l’<a>Initial Dex Offering</a> (IDO) du projet Unikname. Il sera très prochainement possible de transformer ses UNIK en ETH et inversement, en passant par le premier PegUNIK jamais émis, qui sera donc un token ERC20. Les nouvelles avancées seront communiquées sur le canal <a href="https://t.me/Unikname_network">télégram </a>de Unikname.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Un premier bridge bientôt disponible  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Cette connexion entre le réseau Ethereum et le réseau Unikname fonctionne comme nous l’avons décrit ci-dessus : il existe une relation entre le nombre de PegUNIK disponible sur Ethereum et le nombre de UNIK destiné aux échanges sur Unikname Network qui est de un pour un.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Convertir ses ETH en UNIK  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Lorsqu’un utilisateur souhaite convertir des ETH en UNIK, il doit d’abord acheter des PegUNIK en ETH. Cet échange à lieu sur le réseau Ethereum selon le cours du UNIK. Il va ensuite demander la conversion de ses PegUNIK en UNIK. Pour cela, il va utiliser le bridge Unikname. Ce bridge va alors s’activer, et brûler, c’est-à-dire détruire définitivement, l’ensemble de PegUNIK à convertir. Simultanément, le même montant de UNIK va être déverrouillé sur le crypto-account&nbsp; de séquestre Unikname et envoyé sur le crypto-account Unikname de l’utilisateur. Ces flux ont lieu sur le réseau Unikname Network.</p> 
			   
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>La balance PegUNIK / UNIK est bien restée à l’équilibre, il n’y a pas eu de création de monnaie. En revanche, l’utilisateur a converti ses ETH en UNIK, et il peut maintenant disposer des services de la Plateforme SSI Unikname et prendre part à la vie du réseau.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Convertir ses UNIK en ETH  
			   
				
				
				 <p>À l’inverse, il est possible de vouloir convertir ses UNIK en ETH pour les utiliser sur le réseau Ethereum ou pour les trader. Il faut activer le bridge dans l’autre sens.</p> 
			   
				
				
				 <p>Lorsque l’utilisateur déclenche la conversion, il envoie les UNIK à échanger dans le crypto-account de séquestre Unikname pour les verrouiller. Ensuite, des PegUNIK sont forgés sur Ethereum et envoyés dans wallet de l’utilisateur. Il est maintenant libre de les convertir en ETH et d’en disposer comme il le souhaite.</p> 
			   
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Pour en savoir plus<br>  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Sur Unikname Network, plutôt que de brûler et de forger des UNIK, un crypto-account de séquestre à été mis en place. La création de supply sur le réseau est extrêmement limitée depuis l’entrée de la token économie dans sa <a href="https://www.unikname.com/en/discover-unikname-network-episode-3-supply-heading-into-phase-2/">Phase 2</a><a href="https://www.unikname.com/en/discover-unikname-network-episode-3-supply-heading-into-phase-2/"></a> et la création ou la suppression de token à chaque échanges compliquerait la compréhension du réseau.</p> 
			   
				
				
				 <p>L’adresse de ce crypto-account de séquestre est publique et n’importe qui peut vérifier via l’<a href="https://explorer.unikname.network/">explorateur</a> Unikname Network<a href="https://explorer.unikname.network/"></a> que les seuls UNIK qui y entrent ou en sortent correspondent bien à du forgeage ou de la destruction de PegUNIK sur Ethereum.</p> 
			   
				
				
				 <p>Comme pour l’enregistrement de n’importe quelle transaction sur la blockchain Ethereum, les échanges ETH  PegUNIK et PegUNIK  UNIK génèrent des frais qui sont entièrement à la charge de l’utilisateur.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Conclusion  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Le UNIK, bien que token natif de Unikname Network est un token multichain. Grâce à un système de bridge, il est possible de l’utiliser sur un grand nombre de blockchains, ou de convertir les cryptos les plus courantes en UNIK sur le réseau Unikname.</p> 
			   
				
				
				 <p>Les bridges développés par&nbsp; les équipes Unikname garantissent un équilibre dans le nombre total de UNIK en circulation. Lors d’un échange entre deux réseaux, il n’y a ni création ni destruction de token. Les règles de gestion de supply de Unikname Network restent inchangées, c’est l’horizon du UNIK qui s’est agrandit.</p>

<p>Badges &amp; other digital credentials significantly benefit the offerings of LMS systems</p><p>The value created by digital badges and credentials affects more than just the organizations issuing them - they also greatly empower the recipients. By receiving and managing digital badges, individuals gain control over their digital identities and can elevate the story of their professional journey.</p><p>A digital wallet allows an individual to collect and instantly share information about themselves, and this information can be instantly verified. For example, an individual can complete an online course and get a digital certification. An employer can instantly verify the certification and the individual it belongs to. </p><blockquote>With verifiable credentials and decentralized identity, credentials and certifications can be given digitally, and be digitally signed by the new employer.</blockquote><p>Leveraging blockchain and verifiable credentials can transform your business</p><p>Whether you’re comfortable developing with blockchain or quite unfamiliar with the technical concepts behind it, Dock can help you access its many benefits. Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are an open standard for digital credentials, allowing the accreditation to be verified without any contact with the issuing body. </p><p>An individual will complete an online course and receive a digital credential to hold in their digital wallet. The timestamp of when the accreditation was given, how long it is valid for, and any other information needed is stored in a hash on the blockchain. The verifier can request access to the credential on the wallet and will also have access to view the decentralized identity recorded in the blockchain. The holder of the digital wallet has control over their identity and accreditations, and should they wish to, they can send signed copies of their credentials to third parties and add it to social media platforms such as LinkedIn, which can elevate their professional story, and these accreditations can be instantly verified. </p><p>In real life…</p><p>When someone completes an online course, some organizations provide a PDF format certification. These certifications can be easily forged and it can be difficult to know what accreditations a person has completed. The reality is that employers must verify a candidate’s qualifications they claim to have accomplished, this process to verify - search for the issuing company, call or email, and wait for a response, can take weeks and months. </p><p>Fortunately, blockchain technology and digital credentials solve these issues for good. They enable a digital ecosystem of trustworthy communication where each accreditation an individual shares about themselves can be verified instantly. </p><p>For more information, <a href="https://calendly.com/d/zp6v-mk5m/free-consultation-with-dock">schedule a consultation</a> with our experts.</p>

<p>After an inaugural <a href="http://FindBiometrics%20Identity%20Summit">FindBiometrics Identity Summit</a> that galvanized biometrics industry discourse going into the summer, this week will deliver the next big event in the identity and security sectors. The <a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/25493319-e3ec-48c6-bc4b-61d4a7a17c3a/register?RefId=eml&amp;rp=713ab068-b719-48f0-b850-c16661b81030">Enterprise Biometrics Online Summit</a> will take place on Wednesday, September 22, and will offer a full day of insight and discussion from industry leaders, expert analysts, observers and advocates.</p>



<p>The event arrives at a critical juncture in the enterprise space. Digital transformation has been sweeping across the enterprise for years, and was dramatically accelerated in the wake of a pandemic that rushed organizations across a range of sectors into digital channels. This has been a boon for hackers and cybercriminals, with new vulnerabilities opening up in quick succession; in turn, forward-thinking decision makers have started looking for new digital security solutions to adapt to the threat landscape, and biometric solutions are getting more interest than ever before.</p>



<p>At the Enterprise Biometrics Online Summit, expert analysts will be on hand to assess these trends. Jeremy Grant, the coordinator of the Better Identity Coalition will set the stage for the day with an opening keynote about identity in the pandemic era, Acuity Market Intelligence Principal Analyst Maxine Most will deliver part two of the ‘Harnessing the Tornado’ presentation she delivered at the FindBiometrics Identity Summit, and Frost and Sullivan Security Analyst Danielle VanZandt will discuss the state of logical access security in the workplace.</p>



<p>The Summit will also feature insights from senior-level executives from within the industry itself, with representatives of leading companies like FaceTec, IDEMIA, Onfido, and Thales slated to deliver presentations and participate in discussions. Meanwhile, industry-adjacent perspectives will be offered by the leadership of organizations like the Better Identity Alliance and Group337, and a Senior Privacy Policy Advisor will offer the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s view in a discussion with FindBiometrics Editor in Chief Peter Counter.</p>



<p>These experts and others will help to make the Enterprise Biometrics Online Summit a rich source of valuable information for corporate decision makers looking for the best way to position for the intensifying digital transformation; and a virtual Expo Hall will make some particular biometric security solutions vividly clear. <a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/25493319-e3ec-48c6-bc4b-61d4a7a17c3a/register?RefId=eml&amp;rp=713ab068-b719-48f0-b850-c16661b81030">Registration for the event is still open and free of charge</a>, so be sure to sign up today if you haven’t already.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://riddleandcode.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6bbe708abce949d6a8bc7a0db&amp;id=d29f4e5396&amp;e=e90f533832">award</a>&nbsp;is one more milestone in the consortium’s track record of excellence with cryptography and blockchain, after Dyne.org led the flagship H2020 project&nbsp;<a href="https://riddleandcode.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6bbe708abce949d6a8bc7a0db&amp;id=d44b7f2f19&amp;e=e90f533832">DECODE</a>,&nbsp;RIDDLE&amp;CODE’s blockchain solutions&nbsp;are deployed in banking and utility markets Europe wide and InfoCert being the largest Certification Authority at European level and eIDAS certified QTSP.</p>



<p>The European Commission’s vision for EBSI is&nbsp;to leverage distributed ledger technologies to create international and intra-communautaire services for public administrations.&nbsp;The European Blockchain Partnership aims to scale the investment fund to a fully developed&nbsp;<a href="https://riddleandcode.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6bbe708abce949d6a8bc7a0db&amp;id=96293b8ac0&amp;e=e90f533832">platform</a>&nbsp;with up to €2 billion in funding.</p>



<p>The consortium led by the non-profit foundation Dyne.org is developing a multilayered network of blockchains for distributed secure execution of smart contracts, including edge-computing scenarios deployed on low-power embedded devices and chips. The blockchain-agnostic solution offers compatibility with a wide range of products to grant freedom of choice to participating member states and solution developers. Existing integrations include BigchainDB, Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Sawtooth and Bitcoin.</p>



<p>Dyne.org’s&nbsp;<a href="https://riddleandcode.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6bbe708abce949d6a8bc7a0db&amp;id=34ffac5105&amp;e=e90f533832">Zenroom</a>&nbsp;is the core component of the solution.

It is a core part of the DECODE tech stack for Smart Cities and it makes it easy to understand the complexity of data transformation while being compatible with any platform, including Legacy Infrastructure. We make Crypto for Citizens and we make it Open Source.“</p>



<p>Each member of this consortium gathers together a mature experience developing and deploying industrial standards, as well as facilitating open source community adoption of technologies, including the presence in major blockchain standardisation initiatives such as ISO TC/307, INATBA, W3C and Sovrin.</p>



<p>The combination of blockchain-specific hardware solutions for critical infrastructures, developed by RIDDLE&amp;CODE, will help turn data sources into trusted ones and lay the foundation for EBSI’s automated processes and scalability. The combination of InfoCert’s leadership and scale when providing services for digital trust, security and identity management complying with standards will allow Europe to adopt mature blockchain solutions to mission-critical environments.</p>



<p>For the initial phase of EBSI’s procurement, the consortium proposes a&nbsp;<a href="https://riddleandcode.us17.list-manage.com/track/click?u=6bbe708abce949d6a8bc7a0db&amp;id=bea7ff0c64&amp;e=e90f533832">revolutionary solution for a European Digital Product Passport</a>.&nbsp;As a path to success, the consortium plans to work actively to create an open “playing field” in Europe that can easily integrate a diversity of solutions and open this promising industrial field to new players from the public and private sectors.</p>



<p>Quote from the consortium members:</p>



<blockquote><p>“The consortium’s unique combined understanding of cryptography, blockchain and identity technologies as well as its global market positioning, give us the tools and the strength to bring EBSI to the next level. We are truly excited to embrace the policy makers, the businesses and the developers into an inclusive community, to fuel their ideas and products into the European Union’s blockchain.” </p>Andrea D’Intino (EBSI Project leader, Dyne.org)</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>“The blockchain landscape diversifies into layer one and layer two technologies. Layer one is used for attesting values and identities with a small transaction payload and low frequency. Layer two is used for high-volume, low-value, day-to-day transactions. Then, there is the neglected but important layer zero, where blockchain meets products and goods of the physical world. This is exactly where RIDDLE&amp;CODE contributes to EBSI.” </p>Thomas Fürstner (Founder &amp; CTO, RIDDLE&amp;CODE)</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>“Being involved in shaping the future EU blockchain infrastructure not only makes us extremely proud, it also could have an important strategic impact on our reference market. An EU blockchain infrastructure could represent the backbone on which EU Trust will be built in the future.” He further commented: “InfoCert, as the leading Qualified Trust Service Provider in the EU, aims to further strengthen its thought leadership role in a constantly evolving market. InfoCert has an impressive track record in building innovative solutions and an ambitious R&amp;D program focused on Digital Identity and Digital Trust. It includes the exploitation of emerging technologies, among which blockchain is one of the most promising. Our partners have tremendous technical competencies in distributed ledger technologies, while InfoCert has very distinctive expertise in building Trust Frameworks. Joining forces was natural and proved to be crucial in the success of our consortium.“</p>Carmine Auletta (Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer, InfoCert – Tinexta Group)</blockquote>

<p>Syracuse University (SU) has installed biometric palm readers at all five of its student dining centers on campus. The scanners are intended to provide students on meal plans with a contactless verification option during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



  



<p>The biometric program is completely optional, so students will still be able to swipe their SU student ID cards to redeem their meals. However, those who do opt into the system will be able to walk right up to the scanners and skip the line for those using the more traditional card-based method. Students who want to register their hands for the fast lane system will need to do so during business hours.</p>



<p>The palm scanners themselves are completely contactless, which mitigates the threat of contagion associated with shared touchpoints. To assuage concerns about privacy, SU insisted that it will not be collecting any images of student palms, and will instead be capturing a mathematical representation of a palm scan. The student’s palm will then be matched to that representation when they arrive at the cafeteria. The representation will also be encrypted, while SU claimed that it cannot be used to reverse engineer someone’s true biometric data.</p>



<p>The palm scanning service is being offered to any students on an unlimited or block meal plan. SU is hoping that the system will reduce the amount of wear and tear on physical SUID cards, which will in turn reduce costs since the school will not need to issue replacement cards as frequently.</p>



<p>While the use of campus palm scanners is relatively novel, several universities have tried to use mobile IDs to overhaul their student identification systems. The <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/allegion-cbord-provide-mobile-ids-university-tennessee-students-102006/">University of Tennessee</a>, the <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/university-alabama-moves-mobile-first-student-id-050603/">University of Alabama</a>, and <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/auburn-university-turns-mobile-id-tech-on-campus-access-control-payments-080902/">Auburn University</a> have all started issuing mobile IDs to their students, and in each case those mobile IDs can be used to gain access to campus facilities like cafeterias and dining halls.</p>

<p>Australia’s <a href="https://medibio.com.au/">Medibio</a> has unveiled a new mobile app that was designed to help people manage stress. The app has been dubbed Luca, and it tracks sleep, heart rate, and activity to generate a daily stress score and help people identify the things that trigger a negative stressful reaction.</p>



  



<p>In that regard, Luca also takes user feedback into account. The app asks users to take regular assessment tests, which are essentially brief surveys that ask them to describe how they are feeling about certain events in their lives. Correlating those responses with the biometric heart rate and sleep data helps the app pinpoints the stressors that are actually causing problems.</p>



<p>That self-reported data is important because different people can have different responses to the same kind of event. What causes stress for one person may be welcome to another, and Medibio needed to account for those subjective experiences while creating Luca.</p>



<p>However, Luca assumes that there are more objective indicators of stress’ physiological impact of the human body, which is where the biometric sensors come into play. Most notably, Medibio argues that a poor sleep score corresponds to a higher level of stress, while strong cardiac and activity scores are markers of a healthier lifestyle, insofar as people who get regular exercise ad physical activity are less likely to be stressed. Those who are sedentary, on the other hand, may have a harder time achieving that same balance.</p>



<p>Medibio is hoping that people will be able to use Luca to identify and change the aspects of their lifestyle that cause them the most stress. The company will continue to refine the app after its launch to give people an even deeper understanding of their mental health.</p>



<p>Luca itself will debut on October 1, and will be available for $8 a month, or $46 for a full-year subscription. It is compatible with smartphones and wearable devices, though at the moment the platform only offers support for <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/new-garmin-smartwatch-stream-biometric-data-during-e-sports-competition-102208/">Garmin Smartwatches</a>, Apple Watches, and the iPhone. The Garmins require Android version 8.0, while iPhones require iOS 13 and the Apple Watches must be <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/apple-watch-series-3-009127/">Series 3 or better</a> with WatchOS 5.1.2.</p>



<p>The Medibio assessments are designed to be as fast and intuitive as possible to minimize the amount of time that people need to spend on journaling. Luca, meanwhile, will generate an overall stress score on a daily basis.</p>



<p>Of course, Medibio is not the first company to try to measure stress with mobile devices. The US Army is using the WHOOP Strap 3.0 to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/us-armys-biometric-wearables-study-examine-stress-arctic-environment-soldiers-030109/">study stress in an arctic environment</a>, while FitBit started analyzing heart rate and sleep to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/fitbit-focuses-stress-biometrics-new-fitness-tracker-082807/">generate a Stress Management Score</a> back in 2020.</p>

<p>18-Month Plan Towards a Fully-Decentralized and Long-Term Sustainable Grants&nbsp;DAO</p> 1. Introduction <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-efe9ed681b84">OceanDAO</a> <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-roadmap-update-mid-2021-3ea6ba80795d">is</a> a community-curated grants DAO that is key to Ocean’s long-term sustainability. We aim for OceanDAO to be fully decentralized by the end of 2022, with the future up to the Ocean ecosystem. This post describes how we plan to get&nbsp;there.</p><p>The rest of this post is organized as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Section 2 gives an overview of past to future. It reviews how OceanDAO started from a small number of teams, and has grown and evolved since. It also outlines a future of greater scale, stability, and decentralization  Section 3 elaborates on target&nbsp;outcomes  Section 4 reviews tools towards the target&nbsp;outcomes  Section 5 gives the specific roadmap, quarter by quarter to the end of&nbsp;2022  Section 6 concludes.   2. Overview, from Past to&nbsp;Future  From 0-&gt;1 (The&nbsp;Past) <p>Based on the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">Web3 Sustainability Loop</a> design, it has been operational since Q4 2020. In early 2021 we published our <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-roadmap-update-mid-2021-3ea6ba80795d">2021 Q1/Q2 roadmap</a>. It outlined several key challenges; candidate solutions; and a cohesive plan to move forward. By <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-round-7-results-92c567d6d540">Round 7</a> (late summer 2021) we had delivered on the plan’s&nbsp;targets.</p><p>Let’s review the major&nbsp;items.</p><p>In early summer 2021, we introduced a variety of changes in order to scale out OceanDAO. These three mechanisms together enabled the DAO to improve funding and gather sufficient capital efficiency to enable positive&nbsp;growth.</p>  Granular Y/N voting enabled each project to be more thoroughly curated.  Variable funding enabled both small and large projects to easily access&nbsp;funding.  Burning the remainder of funds not granted, introduced an ROI&nbsp;floor.  <p>The impact of these updates has been significant. Internal processes to execute the monthly operations have steadily improved, and are beginning to scale out. Most importantly, projects have been able to increase their ability to access funds, and funds have been burned by the DAO as expectations from contributors continue to increase.</p> To 1-&gt;N (The Future — Scaling) <p>Where to from here? The overall goals are to scale funding, retain average ROI &gt; 1.0 (necessary for growth), and to fully decentralize. We want successful community teams to access greater funding in order to scale aggressively. We want internal OPF teams to eventually be funded by the DAO, eroding differences between “core” and “community”. All teams that are delivering should feel “safe” with stable / reliable funding; so we need to update voting systems towards less volatile outcomes. To access greater funding, DAO projects need to more easily report updates and metrics, while voters should be able to improve efficiency by more effectively navigating this data. When voters are able to easily understand ROI, and projects can measurably prove fundamental outcomes, then funding can grow with impunity.</p><p>To summarize, the focus for OceanDAO in 2021–2022 is stability, scale, and decentralization.</p><p>We’ve already started in the stability and scale path as teams can now request larger amounts of funding, an increase from $20K cap to $50K (as of R10), adjustments to the funding distribution were also implemented to continue growing the number of returning teams contributing in OceanDAO. The introduction of a reporting process to maintain good standing will help participants reconcile their deliverables and outcomes for the DAO. Decentralized teams such as Ocean Pearl, are working on a comprehensive UX to bring the underlying mechanisms to&nbsp;life.</p><p>These are near term approaches to improve stability, scale, and decentralize. Let’s discuss the strategy more rigorously for longer time&nbsp;periods.</p> 3. Target Outcomes 2021–2022 <p>During the summer of 2021, the OceanDAO team continued identifying a wide range of challenges while identifying forward-looking solutions to achieve our growth and sustainability goals. Stability, scale, and decentralization were key concepts identified. The following outcomes emerged as North Stars, directing the evolution of the&nbsp;DAO.</p><p>Stability</p>  OceanDAO needs to have sustainable voting and funding systems to enable existing DAO and OPF teams to be funded by the&nbsp;DAO.  Grantees should signal progress to the DAO in a consistent manner, while incentivizing projects to reach completion.  Whale voting and the impact of onboarding new projects, should be softened.  <p>Scale</p>  An UX that reflects the underlying mechanisms and supports the growing OceanDAO ecosystem needs to be&nbsp;built.  A snowball effect of new projects and proposals entering the&nbsp;DAO.  Multiple funding tiers should be introduced to facilitate the scaling of a wider range of projects.  New methods to calculate and report ROI to reduce friction, and introduce new funding mechanisms.  <p>Decentralization</p>  Automate grants program process to reduce overhead and human interaction.  Decentralize grants program and funding distribution to enable new web3 functionality and interoperability to be developed.   4. Candidate Tools <p>With these outcomes defined, we identified many candidate tools to help drive these outcomes. Here are several promising ones, grouped by the target outcomes of Stability, Scale, and Decentralization.</p><p>Stability</p><p>Stability enables a stream of continuous funding for OceanDAO teams, aligning projects towards delivering outcomes, while improving proposal and voting efficiency.</p>  Voting and Funding Stability. Conviction Voting for more stable funding available to support larger teams. Shift over internal OPF teams to be funded by the&nbsp;DAO.  Systems of accountability. Implement “Standing”. Teams submit updates to reconcile their grant deliverables. Integrate a decentralized dispute mechanism to remove OPF as a Certificate Authority. DAO can easily identify teams that are in good standing. Projects need to complete deliverables before applying for more&nbsp;funding.  Soften whale voting and activity. Implement Quadratic Voting. Group all proposals under a single ballot. Full voting power can only be deployed once towards New and Existing&nbsp;teams.  <p>Scale</p><p>Scale delivers important mechanisms that drive Ocean bottom-up initiatives. By improving ROI transparency and expanding funding tiers, OceanDAO can deliver funding more effectively. As incoming proposals snowball and the DAO grows in size, improvements to the UX will make significant impacts to every participant.</p>  Ocean Pearl. Define initial UX requirements and make them transparent. Formalize OceanDAO tech stack + FE/BE layers. Integrate Pearl team into Zenhub. Improve design and roadmap transparency. Decentralize FE.  Expand funding tiers. Add lower and higher funding tiers. Make it easier for smaller projects to access funding. Increase the ceiling to fund larger teams. Increase transparency of each&nbsp;layer.  Improve ROI transparency. Implement project standings. Develop new metrics and KPIs to report ROI. Improve FE/reporting systems.  Grant Proposals “snowballs”. Develop new growth strategies. Build relationships with universities and other institutions. Implement DAO Week. Launch proposal referral program to incentivize virality.  <p>Decentralization</p><p>Decentralization transforms manual processes into automated &amp; scalable systems enabling further DAO decentralization with projects like Pearl. It enables us to better leverage <a href="https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/organization-legos-the-state-of-dao-tooling-866b6879e93e">emerging Web3 / DAO&nbsp;tooling</a>.</p>  Automate grants program. Write grants program into code and reduce ongoing overhead. Remove human interaction. Integrate Pearl&nbsp;data.  Decentralize grants program. Make grants web3 native. Decentralize fund distribution. Integrate systems like Kleros to decentralize conflict resolution while leveraging the right mechanisms.   5. Specific Plans By Quarter 2021–2022 <p>With Stability, Scale, and Decentralization oriented outcomes, the OceanDAO Product Team did extensive planning. We reconciled this with internal challenges, community expectations, governance best practices, and the latest DAO&nbsp;designs.</p><p>Below is the result, for our 2021–2022 plans, organized quarterly. These plans support these three DAO pillars, and in turn (we hope) help to drive the outcomes. We also reserve the right to change our plans based on learnings in the rapidly evolving DAO environment.</p><p>The plans focus on OceanDAO products; dovetailing these are extensive activities in voting, funding, and communications towards the 2021–2022 OceanDAO&nbsp;goals.</p> Summary <p>This image summarizes the aims per quarter. It includes outreach (row 1), monthly ops (row 2)&nbsp;, and product work (remaining rows). The following subsections elaborate on product work, per&nbsp;quarter.</p> Q3 2021&nbsp;Targets <p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q3/2021. In fact, good news: the end of Q3 2021 is near; we can report that these are already complete. Highlights are automating the grants process, expanding available funding, and aligning&nbsp;Pearl.</p>  Project “Standings”. Give a means for <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">teams to report their grant deliverables</a>, so the DAO can better understand how well a team is delivering on its target outcomes. This helps align every participant towards ROI &gt; 1.0, and reduces friction across the DAO. It’s a foundational element about team track record, on which future features can&nbsp;build.  Automate via DAOBot. This is an activity to migrate grants ops from being done by hand to being executed by code. Proposals are deployed automatically, winners are calculated and reported on time, and the schedule is executed as intended. Anyone can <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/DAOBot">read the code base</a>, or <a href="https://airtable.com/shrvk1ENKwlG8vOBL">visit the Airtable configuration</a>, to see what is being designed and deployed.  Ocean Pearl Alignment. The Pearl team is building a high-quality webapp to encompass key OceanDAO tasks, such as reviewing projects. They are working closely with the OceanDAO Team to align Pearl product goals with OceanDAO goals, and planning that results from it. This has improved transparency between teams and early communication around new features, while Pearl works towards onboarding initial&nbsp;users.  Expand Available Funding: add $50k tier. The new mechanisms to increase transparency on team track record give the opportunity to raise the funding cap for teams that are delivering. So for round 10 we expand the ceiling to $50k for projects that have completed &gt;= 3 proposals, with more to come in the&nbsp;future.   Q4 2021&nbsp;Targets <p>We have the following goals for Q4/2021. The highlights include improving ROI measures, referrals, and softening whale&nbsp;voting.</p>  Easier for Teams to Calculate ROI. OceanDAO must handle softer and squishier goals, complementing the extreme precision of Ocean Data Farming. However, toward the “ROI &gt; 1” goal, we can still make it easier for teams to report metrics, by providing them with more off-the-shelf tools. That’s the aim&nbsp;here.  Referrals to Drive proposals. To continue growing, we must increase the number of proposals and new teams entering OceanDAO. The tactic here is to incentivize the DAO community to get New Teams to submit proposals that receive&nbsp;funding.  Ocean Pearl Integration. Pearl is scheduled to be further integrated in Q4. OceanDAO teams will be able to register, update, and submit their proposals to the grants program through&nbsp;Pearl.  Soften Effect of Whale Voting. Voting should reconcile skin-in-the-game (1-token 1-vote), with democratic ideals (people having sufficient voice). The Quadratic Voting (QV) mechanism balances these. We will implement it here, plus initial Sybil protection (needed once you go beyond 1-token&nbsp;1-vote).   Q1 2022&nbsp;Targets <p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q1/2022. The highlights are launching a stable funding stream to make it safer to work in OceanDAO long-term.</p>  Stable / reliable income via Conviction Voting (CV). We want to make it feel “safer” to work for OceanDAO over longer time frames. This is critical to long-term ecosystem health. The general idea is to soften monthly binary yes/no funding outcomes. The specific approach is <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-34019bd17b10">Conviction Voting</a>&nbsp;. CV gives an effect of a “lowpass filter” over time: a voter’s weight on a project depends on their amount staked and length of time staked into the project. The overall setup is: OceanDAO would have two funding tracks: monthly “batch” voting (status quo), plus “continuous” voting (CV). CV funding allocations will start small, and increase based on learnings / feedback. ROI &gt; 1.0 will be a key constraint in the CV track&nbsp;too.  Refine Ocean Pearl. Keep working with Ocean Pearl team to support more OceanDAO user stories. This is a prerequisite to full decentralization.   Q2 2022&nbsp;Targets <p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q2/2022. The focus will continue to be around Conviction Voting to improve the overall&nbsp;system.</p>  Refine “stable / reliable income”. The “batch” voting track has been evolved and refined for the better part of a year, to get continually better at serving the community. We expect similar for “continuous” (Conviction Voting) track. Accordingly, this roadmap allocates two quarters worth of work to arrive at a CV system that we’re sufficiently comfortable with in order to scale&nbsp;funding.  Decentralize Dispute Resolution. Currently, disputes on team “standing” are handled via community discussion, with the OceanDAO core team as the final arbiter if needed. The latter is centralized; fortunately it hasn’t been needed yet. To be fully decentralized, OceanDAO needs to decentralize this. Kleros decentralized arbitration is one way. Approach or timing is subject to&nbsp;change.  Refine Ocean Pearl. Keep working with Ocean Pearl team to support more OceanDAO user&nbsp;stories.   Q3/Q4 2022&nbsp;Targets <p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q3/2022 &amp; Q4/2022. The focus will be shifting existing systems into a web3 native stack, that may interoperate between other contracts and primitives.</p>  Decentralize OceanDAO. Here, we do all remaining things for the DAO to be fully decentralized. This includes decentralizing some ops tasks like “filter projects for voting” and final transfer of funds to teams. There will likely be more&nbsp;tasks.   6. Conclusion &amp; Looking&nbsp;Forward <p>Until recently, OceanDAO focused on getting initial product-market fit (0-&gt;1) using some <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-roadmap-update-mid-2021-3ea6ba80795d">key components and mechanisms</a>. Those are now in place. The aim now is to scale in traction (0-&gt;1) along with improving stability and becoming fully decentralized. This article summarized how we plan to achieve&nbsp;that.</p><p>We aim for OceanDAO to be fully decentralized by the end of 2022. At this point, there will no longer be a distinction between “community” and “core” teams, it will simply be the Ocean ecosystem. Future improvements will be up to anyone in the ecosystem. Some teams may be chasing their own business models, such as a product for a given vertical (e.g. DeFi) or for a particular user base (e.g. Gaia-X). Others may do “public goods” work for the benefit of the ecosystem. The OceanDAO voting community can vote to bias funding towards what they feel will help drive growth the most. The only constraints are to ensure growth (ROI &gt; 1.0) and being in line with Ocean mission &amp; values. The future is up to the Ocean ecosystem.</p><p>Notes</p><p>[ 1 ] “0 → 1” is a concept popularized by Peter Thiel in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296">Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the&nbsp;Future.</a></p><p>…</p><p>This blog was written in consideration of all staff, teams, and community members, whose commitment and feedback allows OceanDAO to continue improving.

   In more&nbsp;news&nbsp;on national&nbsp;privacy laws, post-Brexit Britain is using its newfound freedom from the EU to set its own data privacy regulatory agenda.

<p>In more&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/09/china-us-recognize-national-security-risks-of-surveillance-capitalism/">news</a>&nbsp;on national&nbsp;privacy laws, post-Brexit Britain is using its newfound freedom from the EU to set its own data privacy regulatory agenda.</p>



<p>According to the country’s culture secretary,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/26/uk-to-overhaul-privacy-rules-in-post-brexit-departure-from-gdpr">Oliver Dowden</a>, Britain could put an end to&nbsp;“irritating cookie popups and consent requests online,” and set new rules based on “common sense, not box-ticking.” New Zealand’s highly regarded privacy commissioner, John Edwards, has been appointed information commissioner to lead the change.</p>



<p>But while Britain plans to move away from the&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>&nbsp;with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/26/uk-to-overhaul-privacy-rules-in-post-brexit-departure-from-gdpr">“world leading data policy,”</a>&nbsp;any new rules it sets will still need to protect EU-to-UK data transfers.</p>



<p>It appears that Britain wants to revert to a data protection or privacy framework that is not as strict as the GDPR and will try to redefine the appropriate balance between individual and commercial interests. Every country has a slightly different spin on that based on their history and how they arrived at their law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A new British data privacy law could look more like the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/the-california-consumer-privacy-act-and-why-you-must-still-keep-control-of-your-personal-information/">CCPA</a>. It will be interesting to see where it lands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Da oggi tutti gli utenti Legalmail avranno la possibilità di attivare gratuitamente l’autenticazione a due fattori per l’accesso alla propria webmail, aumentando ancor di più il livello di sicurezza del proprio account di Posta Elettronica Certificata.</p>



<p>InfoCert, con Legalmail, è il primo provider PEC a offrire ai propri utenti la sicurezza aggiuntiva dell’autenticazione a doppio fattore, che sarà presto uno standard comune verso la convergenza alla PEC Europea. Ancora una volta InfoCert si conferma come provider di riferimento in tema di sicurezza e innovazione per i propri clienti.</p>



 Cos’è l’autenticazione a due fattori? 



<p>L’autenticazione a due fattori o autenticazione forte (dall’inglese Strong Authentication) è oggi uno dei sistemi di protezione più sicuri per i nostri account.&nbsp;Consiste nell’aggiungere un secondo fattore di autenticazione alle classiche User e Password, come, ad esempio, un OTP, un Token o una notifica sul proprio Smartphone. Questi elementi devono essere indipendenti tra loro, in modo che un’eventuale violazione di uno di essi non comprometta l’affidabilità degli altri.</p>



 Attiva l’autenticazione forte sulla tua Legalmail con MyInfoCert 



<p>Gli utenti Legalmail possono attivare l’autenticazione forte in completa autonomia nel menu impostazioni della propria webmail. Per abilitare il doppio fattore sarà necessario scaricare e attivare l’App MyInfoCert, e collegarla al proprio Account PEC. MyInfoCert, l’innvoativa applicazione di InfoCert già utilizzata per l’autenticazione di Livello 2 per SPID, grazie al sistema di notifiche smart ed al riconoscimento biometrico di impronta digitale o del volto, rafforzerà le difese della propria casella da accessi indesiderati.</p>



<p>MyInfoCert è disponibile per sistemi operativi Android, iOS e Harmony OS.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/reinwarth">Matthias Reinwarth</a></p><p>As social beings, people interact with their environment, whether as citizens of a state, as employees of a company or as contractual partners (customers, insured persons) with a company in the private sector. Even if a large number of such transactions can take place anonymously (coffee to go on the way to the office in the morning does not require identification), proof of identity or the reliable assurance of a particular characteristic ("of legal age," "fully vaccinated") is often indispensable.</p>
<p>From a functional and technical point of view, a distinction must be made between different steps. Identification, i.e., the one-time onboarding of a real identity into an identity ecosystem, is usually performed only once per ecosystem, but can be very time-consuming and expensive. The reward for this procedure is simplified authentication, i.e., more or less portable, rapid proof of this identification in the form of an ID card or access to a technical system. Depending on the character of the identity ecosystem (state, bank, insurance company), the stored attributes of an identity are also updated subsequently in order to reflect ongoing developments.</p>
 Between KYC and least disclosure 
<p>In many cases, a more comprehensive knowledge of the identity and its characteristics will be necessary (for example, when signing) a credit agreement. But in many cases, reliable proof of only a few, specific characteristics is quite sufficient. Permission to dance in a club after a certain time depends on a defined age (name and exact date of birth are irrelevant here). The same applies to the purchase of cigarettes or alcohol.</p>
<p>But even critical characteristics that are not necessarily everyone's business must be verifiable to third parties in individual cases without disclosing an excess of detailed information. Discounted admission to a museum as a pupil or student does not require disclosure of the respective university or course of study. It must be possible to prove an unspecified disability in order to acquire cheaper tickets for public transport without disclosing medical details.</p>
 Regaining trust in assured identities is essential 
<p>No matter whether it is about secure identification or the proof of individual properties. The reality for all of us is that comprehensive and universally applicable policies and mechanisms do not exist for this very purpose; trust in digital identities has been profoundly destroyed in a time when identity fraud and weak authentication are our daily reality.</p>
<p>Trust in digital identities is difficult to achieve outside of individual silos and islands. In addition to nation states as issuers of digital identity credentials in the form of an electronic ID card or passport, the financial industry in particular, i.e. banks and insurance companies, has already made a strong showing in this regard. The reasons for this commitment on the part of the financial sector are obvious: money is at stake here, and trustworthy identities are the basis for any interaction between customers and institutions. The same applies to other industries, such as telecommunications providers.</p>
 Federating beyond the silo has proven difficult 
<p>Beyond the use in just one specific industry, trustworthy issuers of identity proofs (verifiable credentials) have recently been found, which can then provide identities and their properties for many business processes. However, again depending on the region or country, take-up (and thus usability) often does not reach a critical mass.</p>
<p>Two dimensions are essential: In addition to the highest possible trust in the identities and their properties, it is about their scope and usability. This is an unsolved problem to date, because while the trustworthiness of the identities is a central challenge for the individual identity ecosystems which is also solved in the respective silo, their focus is naturally on their own customers/citizens in the first approximation. Interoperability is not a core business. This massively limits identity reach as the second relevant dimension.</p>
 Putting the pieces together at a global scale 
<p>Concepts, standards and technologies would be available here and now, tried and tested, and we use them every day in online shopping or in our professional environment, but they are always reduced to individual walled gardens.</p>
<p>This is where the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-sakimura-leibbrandt-introducing-gain">Global Assured Identities Network (GAIN)</a> comes in, first publicly announced at EIC 2021 in Munich. More than 150 globally recognized experts in the identity environment have brought together their expertise from a wide variety of fields to elevate trust and reach in identities to a global level. Starting from (but not limited to) the financial industry, which has proven to be able to confidently provide identities for your business models, concepts are defined and tested here to enable interoperability for identities from all participating institutions.</p>
<p>End users obtain identities from an institution (bank, government, telco) that certifies them. By federating these, GAIN provides a reusable, trusted identity that they can use against a variety of relying parties/service providers, i.e., government agencies, but also institutions and commercial entities in a self-determined and controlled manner. In line with the concept of verifiable credentials, only those attributes are used that are required for the purpose of a transaction, i.e., proof of age or simple proof of identity without disclosing other attributes.</p>
<p>The complexity of this network, which is global by definition, is hidden by the fact that GAIN, as a network, knows the respective identity providers for the end users and mediates communication with them. Different architectures are spanned, the varying assurance level of different identities and providers is taken into account, and global interoperability is enabled. A variety of positive outcomes could be achieved, including basic increase of trust in identities, simplified on-boarding of customers and clients for arbitrary services, provision of under-banked communities with resilient identities, e.g. based on telecommunication identities (which have already taken over this role in many regions, but without further interoperability), reduction of fraud, but especially also the increase of a person‘s individual sovereignty in handling his/her identity data in the respective transaction (minimal disclosure).</p>
 Call to action: Proving viability and achieving a critical mass 
<p>The concept is promising, but until a "Login with GAIN" via the identity at my own bank or with my ID card for fast and trustworthy onboarding is available in addition to the "Login with Google/Apple/Facebook" button, a lot still has to happen.</p>
<p>Proof of value and a high level reach are the next steps. Rapid and widespread adoption by the financial industry worldwide, but also beyond, for example by eIDas solution providers or telecom companies, is imperative and essential.</p>
<p>The presentation of the network on the occasion of the EIC therefore also focused on the call for participation in this network, starting with a proof of concept soon. Interested parties are invited to take a look at the <a href="https://www.iif.com/Portals/0/Files/content/Innovation/09_13_2021_gain_digital_trust.pdf">compact white paper</a> as a first reading and introduction. The implementation has already started, interested Identity Information Providers are called to register and to interoperate promptly. Technical, organizational and legal framework conditions are roughly outlined, but in particular also possible business models and benefit aspects are documented. GAIN offers a highly exciting perspective for a global network of assured and trusted identities. The task now is to quickly implement a critical mass in order to prove the real benefits at scale.</p>

<p>Mydex CIC is working with the <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/tag/office-of-the-chief-designer/">Office of the Chief Designer in Scotland</a> and <a href="https://connecting.scot/">Connecting Scotland</a> to find better ways to give people a say in what public services are like to&nbsp;use.</p><p>We want to give people a chance to improve their experience of using these services, and to do so we need to involve them in ways they find easy and satisfying. So we’re using the technology we’ve built, especially our citizen engagement platform Inclued, to help people get involved with projects that interest them and where they want to improve specific services — and for researchers to find, invite and communicate with these interested individuals.</p><p>The technology allows people to gather information about themselves and to keep it safe and secure in their own personal data store. They can let service providers see details about them — for example their age, the area they live in, if they have a disability and so on — without the service provider knowing who they actually&nbsp;are.</p><p>Service providers can then send secure messages to the sorts of people whose input they need to make their services better, asking them if they would like to take&nbsp;part.</p><p>As part of this work, we will also ask people about their motivations for taking part. For example, is it because they have felt particularly frustrated about an experience, because of a general desire to contribute, because it’s interesting, or perhaps because they can earn some extra&nbsp;cash?</p><p>By getting the right insights and improving the way information is shared — in a way which protects people’s privacy and puts them in control — we believe more people will want to get involved in shaping the services they use to improve the quality of these services. At the same time it will cut the cost of finding people who want to take part: especially people whose needs or views don’t fit into the pattern of the majority of ‘mainstream’ service&nbsp;users.</p><p>The initial work for this was funded as part of delivering a <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/connecting-citizens-and-government-for-better-designed-services-9b58205185ce">CivTech sprint challenge</a>, which responded to the published challenge: “How can technology be used to engage citizens in designing Digital Public Services?” This next step brings these tools fully to life and makes them available to user researchers and service designers across the Scottish Government working on public services and the citizens they engage&nbsp;with.</p> What the tools&nbsp;do <p>Specifically, the tools help citizens:</p>  List details about themselves, including their preferences, so that these details are kept private and under their control, but can also be shared with others if the person wants&nbsp;to,  Apply for and connect to services without having to fill in&nbsp;forms,  Re-use information about themselves many times over in different circumstances, so they don’t have to keep repeating themselves when dealing with a different service,  Review projects they have been invited to and request participation in projects that they would like to take part&nbsp;in,  Provide safe and secure messaging between themselves and service providers.  <p>Meanwhile, subscribers can:</p>  Create projects,  Invite citizens to participate,  Streamline and make consistent a lot of routine administration,  recruit citizens based on the criteria needed without citizens needing to reveal these often protected characteristics,  gain an overview of all design projects, including metrics like participants’ feedback,  view a showcase of present and past projects in the same organisation, so they can better maintain and share best practice and past learning.  <p>We are really excited to be contributing to this project, which takes us another step towards our mission of putting citizens at the centre of services that genuinely work for&nbsp;them.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/supporting-citizen-participation-in-the-design-of-public-services-d3a56e6aa97">Supporting citizen participation in the design of public services</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The UK Gambling Commission set out new regulations in May 2019 in an aim to make gambling safer and more fair for users. A key focus of this was around identity verification for online gambling, with new rules enforcing that operators must verify a customers age before they deposit into an account, gamble using their own money or a free bet bonus, or access “free to play” versions of gambling games.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, the commission has encouraged operators to consider using AI-Powered Verification applications. These applications aim to solve the challenges created by these new regulations by streamlining the verification process and making it faster and simpler.</p>
<p>The easiest way to apply these applications to a platform is working with an identity verification partner with experience in gaming. Here are the key factors to keep in mind when looking for an ID Verification partner:</p>
 Due Diligence&nbsp; 
<p>It’s vital to do your due diligence and make sure an identity verification partner is the best choice. This comes in the form of experience: just because a service, like AI-Powered Verification, is new, doesn’t mean the company behind it should be new too.</p>
<p>It’s vital to work with a company that has the experience and can show they know how to deliver a flawless product, as well as have a detailed background working within the market.</p>
 Honesty and Trust 
<p>Honesty and trust are two vital elements when dealing with suppliers, but it can be difficult to find in an undeveloped industry. Currently, there’s no perfect solution to the challenges that come with ID verification, so the best partners are ones that will admit their shortcomings and be transparent with their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>The role of an ID verification partner is to assist you with mitigating risk, as well as outline the limitations of the technology. You should be looking for a provider that is open and not only assists you, but also raises the bar around your compliance responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>
 Security&nbsp; 
<p>Security is a business-critical factor that is sometimes overlooked when discussing advances in technology. However, RagTech sees rapid evolution and, thus, security around protecting data and privacy should be a key focus – a non-negotiable element of a partnership.</p>
<p>It will be vital to discuss the level of security that is offered by an ID verification partner, as it is something that is crucial for your most valuable asset, the customers.&nbsp;</p>
 Support 
<p>Whether a company is a startup or a well established vendor, the key behind their success will be the implementation of an idea, rather than the idea itself. That’s why it’s vital to find a partner that has a solid team behind them, that will deliver a service successfully, as well as share in-depth plans, detailing how they will deliver on their promises.&nbsp;</p>
 Engagement With the Regulators 
<p>When it comes down to it, betting service relies on the regulators. Their acceptance of your service and ID verification applications can make or break your approach to compliance. Your partner should be just as interested in this area as you are and should be constantly providing support with the regulators. If they don’t show a clear interest in this, then you should ask yourself if you are engaging with the correct solution.&nbsp;</p>
 Global Scalability 
<p>As we all know, compliance is the most expensive and complex part of a gaming company’s operation and businesses grow and expand into new markets, the cost and complexity only increases.</p>
<p>This means it’s vital to have an ID verification partner that is able to scale up and address multiple jurisdictions and competing compliance regimes. Working with a partner that is able to do this will minimise growing pains, especially one that is able to apply their solutions globally.&nbsp;</p>
 IDnow Autoident – The AI-Powered ID Verification Solution 
<p>Now that you know what to look for in an ID verification partner, look no further than IDnow.

 Organising #BeyondtheRules at DML — 2/4  Compounding learning and constructing legibility <p>This piece was authored by a member of the Dark Matter Labs team based in the UK as part of the #BeyondtheRules project and, as such, is written in British English and has particular references to contexts in the&nbsp;UK.</p><p>This blog was written in September 2021 and reflects our learning at that&nbsp;time.</p> Our Context <p>In a context of climate breakdown and technological disruption, Dark Matter Labs works to accelerate societal transition towards collective care, shared agency, long-termism and interconnectedness. We focus on the dark matter — the invisible structures responsible for producing the majority of the world around us, from policy and regulation to finance and data, governance and democratic participation, organisational culture and identity.</p><p>Our context as an organisation, and from which the learning that we share here is anchored, is largely defined by&nbsp;being:</p>  Mission-led  Focused on discovery and&nbsp;learning  International with a planetary view  Primarily virtual  Evolving constantly  <p><a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-e59e4f5dd32f">Blog 1</a> in this series shared more information on our context and current structure.</p><p>In this 4-part blog series, we share how we have been building the organisational infrastructure for this work and what we are learning as we go. This blog focuses on how we are organising to navigate complex, emergent&nbsp;work.</p><p>In <a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-e59e4f5dd32f">blog 1</a> we discussed how we are a learning-based organisation — we enter most of our work not knowing the outcome — and sitting with uncertainty, complexity, and emergence is in every part of our fabric. Indeed, our own ‘dark matter’ and the organisational infrastructures that we build to shape how we show up together is also emergent. We are each constantly taking on and shedding roles; alongside, our projects and who works on them regularly shift and change as does the scope and nature of those projects and how they collaborate towards broader missions. Aside from our shared intention, there is little in how we work that is&nbsp;fixed.</p><p>This allows our work to genuinely reflect the complex emergence of our reality and for us each to autonomously follow what we see is needed to fulfil our missions, which is constantly evolving. This way of organising can create significant challenges for people to navigate themselves through the many moving parts of these systems (blog 3 will share more on our system of self-management, which is a needed complement to&nbsp;this).</p><p>We are learning (at times through moments of pain) about the need and means&nbsp;to:</p>  actively and intentionally construct (because it is indeed a social construct and takes work to build) just enough legibility of the system — in a way that updates itself as the system&nbsp;moves  and actively compound learning across that&nbsp;system  <p>These crafts play a role in liberating each of us to do our work incrementally well, enabling a shared wisdom that is beyond what any of us can reach on our&nbsp;own.</p><p>How we do this takes different forms and is constantly under development. Some of these forms we describe&nbsp;below.</p> Compounding learning <p>We use the word ‘compounding’ intentionally to nod to the difference between learning — which can involve somebody learning something and/or sharing that with somebody or many others — and the compounding of learning* — which involves different learning coming together to create a new augmented level of shared understanding as a&nbsp;result.</p><p>Creating the conditions for this type of learning is a craft and one that we recognise to be among the most important for working in complexity and emergence, especially as an international team. In doing this, building a plural peer community of interest and practice, mutual accountability, collective credibility, and shared capabilities unlocks a bigger potential for impact than any of us would be able to individually. More about the theory of that in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/beyondtherules-e3ab44f0dc3">this&nbsp;blog</a>.</p><p>*Distinct from the definition of compound learning described <a href="https://medium.com/personal-growth/compound-learning-the-most-powerful-tool-for-acquiring-skills-faster-123e14f9f9d9">here</a> as used by Warren Buffet. There may be others who speak of this way of understanding compound learning that we are not yet aware of — if you are we would love to hear about&nbsp;it.</p> DM Downloads <p>DM Downloads is a bi-weekly virtual space curated to compound learning across similar or complementary lines of work across the ecosystem.</p><p>The topics are identified by the session curator, who considers the cross-cutting frameworks of DM (practices, missions, deep code innovations etc) and makes a schedule according to how advanced or ready each one is to present new material, how strategic it is to have some conversations based on some upcoming opportunities or developments, as well as their potential for cross-pollination. The schedule is shared, open for comment and suggestions.</p><p>The structure of the Downloads is:</p>  Introduction by the&nbsp;curator  Presentations from people working on this topic (circa 5–7 mins each, held by a time-keeper), sharing what they have been doing and learning in the&nbsp;work  An open discussion for them to share what comes up in hearing each others’ work, and for the wider group to share questions, thoughts and&nbsp;ideas  <p>We write up the key takeaways shared and discussed for a broader audience through our ‘DM Notes’ series on our <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/">provocations page</a> to share them more widely and invite interaction (part of our practice of Working Out Loud — see more on this&nbsp;below).</p><p>The leap in shared understanding of our work is noticeable following the launch of these spaces. This is evident in their attendance (normally at least half the team), the high levels of the team watching (and watching back) the recordings as well as the internal appreciation expressed after each one. DM Downloads are also becoming an essential tool in giving new DM members a quick overview of some practices that might relate to their work in their onboarding.</p> DM Debates <p>DM Debates is a new bi-weekly open forum for discussing and developing some of the core assumptions we hold in our work and as an organisation — whether this isour stance on universal basic income or the philosophical dilemmas of a tree having self-sovereignty.</p><p>The topics are organised by people nominating and voting for topics they’d like to discuss — those with more votes are debated first. The format involves two (self-nominated) people who propose alternative viewpoints to the question, followed by an open (self-facilitated and self-moderated discussion) with 5 points of view per person as a loose guide. The speakers can comment on the discussion at the end and somebody self-nominates to capture the main points and relay them back at the end. One person captures the core points discussed and relays them back in summary at the end of the&nbsp;session.</p><p>Both our Debates and Downloads are org-wide optional spaces for anyone interested to join. They are recorded and shared so that people can also watch them in their own time or read the presentations, according to their preference.</p> Gatherings <p>Nothing can match the impact that gathering together in a relaxed way has on our sense of learning, connection and understanding. Now that we are 55 or so people across 15+ countries the actual logistics of this is huge; a central group plays a role to help consider logistics and structure of how we gather, involving people across DM in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>Within a pandemic and in the context of climate breakdown, we are still working out the degree of face to face / hybrid / virtual that we will need to balance (recognising that these decisions have important implications).</p><p>In August 2021 we held a hybrid gathering where we gathered across 7 geographical clusters local to the team over four days. By that&nbsp;time:</p>  The team had not physically met since December&nbsp;2019  In that time the makeup of the team had changed significantly, we had almost tripled in size and the majority of DM people had not met more than one other DMer in&nbsp;person.  We had run a series of virtual Gatherings which had strived to test the limits of what can be achieved to build cohesion and legibility across the organisation in the virtual space during the first 18 months of the Pandemic.  <p>We knew it was such an important moment for learning how we might do this going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>We approached the challenge of working with different time zones&nbsp;by:</p>  Splitting the time table for everyone between the same synchronous and asynchronous sessions. So for 6 hours every day the team were connected together for all team sessions (Europe Morning, Asia Evening) and the other 18 hours were for each cluster to connect with each other and work together on topics set in the synchronous times from that&nbsp;day.  A central group orchestrated the schedule and logistics, while clusters led their local schedules and activities.  We nominated both Facilitators in each cluster to ensure timekeeping during the synchronous times of day and host content related conversations in asynchronous time and ‘Ministers of fun’ who were responsible for ensuring the team were making enough time to decompress, connect with each other, rest and eat well across the programme.  <p>Things that worked&nbsp;well</p>  Meeting people physically was the highlight for everyone (a feeling of belonging, connection, and a better understanding of DML and the “gorgeous human beings” / brilliant minds that make up the&nbsp;team:)  Quality of the content delivered was high and the subjects we chose were good for the time (The opportunity to learn more about DML as an organisation -history, finance, etc — and community -shared values, aspirations etc)  Overall flow of the gathering, the balance of synchronous and asynchronous time, roles different people played, quality of content in sessions (Mix of online and offline. Time spent together in clusters. Mix of lofty but fiercely practical. Range of voices. Time for conversation and exploration. Ways to capture the pulse of the org. Great&nbsp;hosting)  <p>Things that we can learn and develop going&nbsp;forward</p>  The quantity of content was very high and people felt compressed - in future, presentations move into videos that we watch&nbsp;offline  Overall, participants requested more together time for sharing experience, exploring more personal topics to open space and breakout conversations on the content. In future, more time for open space or chance for people to follow their own&nbsp;energy  Clusters experienced the gathering in quite different ways according to factors like group size. In future, more training / better equipped/briefed local facilitators with more sessions delivered by them in the local context to be responsive to the nuances of each&nbsp;cluster.  <p>We intend to move&nbsp;towards:</p>  As all team physical gatherings become less and less likely we are looking to how do we both drive down the impact of the team convening, running them with minimal to no flights and making them a more regular fixture as a part of our organisation’s rhythm and practice.  This is all part of a flow and rhythm that includes DM Downloads, DM Debates, All team Critical Sessions and Project team site visits/pop up studios where there is an emphasis on working in person, in groups, on work, that has been set free by everything else around&nbsp;it.  Physical gatherings can then be focused on spaces to connect deeply with each other, reflect, deliberate, work together and&nbsp;play  The clusters in Malmö, Sweden; Jeju, South Korea; Reading, UK; Venice,&nbsp;Italy Working Out Loud and Declaring Assumptions <p>According to <a href="https://www.toolshero.com/personal-development/working-out-loud/">this Tools Hero&nbsp;article</a>:</p><blockquote>“the concept of Working Out Loud was first described by Bryce Willians. In 2010 he published the blog post ‘When will we work out loud? Soon!’ on his blog The BrycesWrite. When he came up with the concept, he proposed the following simple formula for&nbsp;WOL:</blockquote><blockquote>Working out loud = observable work + narrating your&nbsp;work</blockquote><p>Later the concept would be expanded upon by John Stepper. Today Stepper advocates the effectiveness of the concept worldwide. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpjNl3Z10uc">TED Talk</a>, he stated that with WOL, he was stimulating a worldwide movement.”</p><p>Similarly, for us working out loud means declaring your work and, in particular, declaring/narrating the assumptions behind the direction that you are taking, so that the wider system&nbsp;can:</p>  See the direction you are going in (and when we are all doing this, sense how the system is moving and&nbsp;fluxing)  Learn from your findings and assumptions and how you act on&nbsp;them  Give you useful comments, feedback or thoughts to help&nbsp;you  <p>We use Slack as our main day-to-day communication channel to assist this&nbsp;process.</p>  Each team member posts a brief daily update in Slack’s org-hq channel on roughly their work of the day (some focus on what they are looking to learn, or questions they are sat&nbsp;with)  We declare wider decisions and their reasons into relevant slack channels, depending on their&nbsp;scope  Example of Working Out Loud in Slack&nbsp;posts<p>Part of the art of this is learning how to work out loud without creating information or task overload or overwhelm. This is nuanced for each person and there are many factors balanced in doing this, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Our hq posts per person are 1 per day only, to keep manageable  Slack channel posts focused on declaring and sharing decisions and assumptions kept to what is needed and posted only where needed (inc using Slack group tags so that messages reach the right&nbsp;people)  More detailed records stored on Notion, optional for people to&nbsp;access  Each team member individually managing their notifications, blocking out their schedule as needed for undisturbed time and practically managing their time and space (with training on prioritisation and time management to support that and tech support for information management)  <p>This area warrants a blog in itself so this just nods to some of the considerations in how we make these critical practices manageable.</p> Constructing Legibility <blockquote>“…in today’s world we find ourselves far from shore where things are uncertain, complex, and dynamic. As we all learn the practice of strategic design by doing, and collectively establish the field, legibility is the key. Trailblazing, here, is about going out of your way to make your path&nbsp;legible.</blockquote><blockquote>That means always leaving a few lanterns floating on the water to share not just where you went, but how you got&nbsp;there.”</blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://helsinkidesignlab.org/pages/posters.html">Helsinki Design&nbsp;Lab</a></blockquote><p>Navigating a dynamic, ever-changing environment and making personal choices that have reference to these different levels of consideration is complex. As the degrees of complexity increase, it has become clear how autonomy in this system — without finding the system navigable — can be debilitating. It can be, for example, particularly debilitating for those who typically work with high responsibility-taking (for example, the people who wrap up all the loose ends, think through the details and thrive in clear logic and clarity).</p><p>We have been developing scaffolding to help us to see the ecosystem of people within DML, their roles, ambitions, ways of working and how these link to our contract, finances and missions, in ways that enables a broad variety of personality types to confidently embrace their autonomy.</p> Roles and responsibilities <p>At DM, a role is not a job title; it is an area of responsibility that serves a purpose. Each of us will regularly change (pick up, hand over, build new) roles so that we can be responsive to situations at hand. Early in 2021, we were starting to feel the impact of not having a legible system for who was holding which roles at any given time and the responsibilities they entailed, which we recognised was bringing a range of risks, including:</p>  *Stepping on each other’s toes*<br>Wait, you’ve already been working on this? Me&nbsp;too.  *Spreading that energy marmalade too thin*<br>Not sure how I got here, but I have way too many responsibilities at the&nbsp;moment  *Things falling between the cracks*<br>Oh, I thought YOU were doing&nbsp;this?  *Unknown Skills Spectrum*<br>How do I find someone with a specific skill or expertise?  *Lost and Stuck*<br>I don’t see clear pathways to grow and develop in the organisation  *Unknown Capacity*<br>How do I estimate the capacity of people? I need help&nbsp;now.  <p>As we now reach over 50 people, creating just enough shared legibility is one of our most important crafts for the DM team to self-navigate this ever-moving decentralized system.</p><p>A group within DML has been working on how we can each codify (in a decentralised way) our roles and responsibilities in a way that reflects its dynamic evolutionary nature. The approach thinks about roles are cards that we hold at any given time (a role played within a mission, a project or a team), some of which we may put down and pick up over time. Each role card has a description of the role and an overview of its responsibilities both to and from other roles (described by the cardholder or a former holder). Alongside this people can declare which cards they hope to put down or wish to pick up in the future, so that those building future projects or building teams for new projects can spot patterns, see who might be interested and can reach out to each other to&nbsp;discuss.</p><p>This role cards system is currently being developed and trialled.</p>Screenshot from a Miroboard where the DM team identified and described their role&nbsp;cardsScreenshot from a Miroboard where the DM team identified responsibilities and accountabilities between their role cards and&nbsp;others’<p>Being able to visualise the current and upcoming capacity of team members is an important aid to this in helping us&nbsp;to:</p>  Spot when people are over-capacity and provide them with care (care is not one person’s role, this is in all of our&nbsp;roles)  Recognise when people may (or may not) have upcoming capacity so that people can navigate whether to invite them to join a piece of&nbsp;work  Get a sense of the patterns that play out and if there is anything we need to be collectively aware of or address in those&nbsp;patterns  <p>This area of work intersects with ‘external rules’ (e.g. regulation) that are part of the systems that we work in.&nbsp;Namely:</p>  Transfer pricing calculations (these are transfers between legal entities that are required to meet international tax law, e.g. where a team member works significantly on a piece of work contracted by a legal entity that they are not paid&nbsp;from)  Project reporting (where a breakdown of personnel cost or time spent is required as part of our contracts)  <p>We seek to collate and fully comply with this information whilst not being driven by it. The current system being trialled involves each DM team member indicating their capacity across their projects per month on their personal Nation page, information which is then drawn through synced or shared databases to create an overview of shared capacity per project and per mission over time. Whilst we recognise that using an FTE and capacity approach is less than ideal, at this stage it fulfils a need for shared information that assists us to navigate our way through the system whilst we work towards an alternative approach in the&nbsp;future.</p> DM missions portfolio <p>Constructing legibility about the missions that we are working towards and the work that we do towards them is another area that we have focused significant energy to this year. This has been covered by a few blogs recently, including<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-e59e4f5dd32f"> blog 1 of this series</a> (section: ‘Led by Planetary Missions’) and this <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/dm-note-5-50e46540dd05">DM Note</a> on Mission Holding at&nbsp;DM.</p> Centers and&nbsp;horizons <p>One of the difficult practical things about working in emergent systems is when to draw a line around an enquiry or the scope of our work. Most of the questions that we explore are interconnected, complex questions and as inquisitive people who want to do things well we have a cultural tendency to overwork as a result — e.g. what we might have been envisioned as a short enquiry becomes an expansive systems map and forum. It is hard to be true to the topics we explore whilst trying to artificially bound them (and indeed is problematic in many ways to do so); and yet, not bounding them can result in overwork by the team and overburdening ourselves in partnerships (and partners perhaps wondering why we keep broadening the&nbsp;remit).</p><p>Recent conversations have included thinking early on about where the horizons are for our work. Recognising that a horizon is not a boundary or an end, only the limit of what we can perceive (and that this horizon shifts depending on where we are), by considering the horizons to a piece of work we can identify how wide we intend to focus attention. Alongside, if we can identify the centres of our enquiries — the questions that sit at the heart of what we are trying to discover — then that horizon can be informed by distance from the centre and help to ground where energy is focused. This is an idea more than a practice, at&nbsp;present.</p> Manuals of&nbsp;Me <p>The iterative dynamic nature of our organising requires us to all have strong skills in self-management, much of which means the ability to build good relationships. Since this is such a critical part of our work we have a part-time team member focused specifically on supporting these team capabilities, running internal training on holding boundaries, building relationships, giving and receiving clean feedback, time management, etc.</p><p>This is complemented by team members building a Manual of Me, outlining how they like to work, what roles they like to play, hours they like to work, things that help us to understand them so that we can all get better at navigating each other. This becomes an incredibly valuable resource at the point of groups newly working together and discovering what it means to work together&nbsp;well.</p>Screenshot of Manuals of Me in our shared&nbsp;Drive<p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/dmls-manual-of-us-d41b1c235869">Read more here</a> on how we think ‘Manuals of We’ can help partners to navigate each other during collaborations and example of one that we made for one of our partnerships.</p> Wielding tech <p>Tech plays a really important role in this area of our work, helping to build efficiency and simplicity in what might otherwise be hugely cumbersome. Our Tech and Tools group does incredible work finding ways that tech can create shortcuts through what already exists (rather than detours, creating extra work). The main platforms that we use currently are:</p>  Notion: as a shared database, project and info management space  Slack: for direct communication, updates and&nbsp;sharing  Google Workspace: for meetings, shared folders, shared documents (presentations, spreadsheets etc), shared calendars and emails (which is mainly for external communication)  Miro: for ideation and sense-making  Alongside Kumu, Adobe, Airtable, Discord, Loom and&nbsp;others  Screenshot from a recent Tech and Tools meeting on tool integrations<p>The tech and tools group learn how to wield these tools and to integrate them in a way that maximises our shared efficiency and supports the wider team to upskill. For example, our shared financial dashboard on Notion draws through information from finance meeting notes (using synching blocks) and forecasting spreadsheets (using integrations) to create an internal dashboard for the whole team to view our financial situation and considerations. The userface presents on the information useful but draws it from existing information in our systems, meaning that there is no additional work required for the finance team to maintain&nbsp;it.</p>Screenshot from recent Tech and Tools presentation discussing some of our key upcoming legibility and learning plans of&nbsp;work<p>In blog 3, we will look at how we are working towards a distributed system of governance through self-management, legal stewardship and other means. It looks at the platform of deep care, security and safety required for&nbsp;this.</p><p>If you would like to receive updates (every few weeks/months) about the #BeyondtheRules project you can do so via <a href="https://dark-matter-labs.typeform.com/to/jpm8rdp1?typeform-source=provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">this short form</a>.

 Ontology’s Chief of Ecosystem Partnerships Presents At The European Identity and Cloud Conference <p>This week, Gloria Wu, our Chief of Ecosystem Partnerships, gave a presentation at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021">European Identity and Cloud Conference</a> on ‘The Rise of An Identity-Native Web 3.0’. Hosted in Germany, the conference brought together leading experts from within the technology and security sectors to discuss some of the latest developments, successes, and issues in the identity and cloud spaces over the last year. Joining virtually, Gloria provided some fascinating insights into the formation of identity in the incoming world of Web 3.0, as well as commentating on how native citizens of Web 3.0 are forging their own identities and reputations. If you missed the event, don’t worry! We have put together a recap blog below, including some of the key&nbsp;points.</p><p>The evolution of human identification and reputation has had many stages. Before modernity, people’s identity was closely related to their reputation and standing within a social group. In the industrial age, this moved on to see people’s identities become influenced by their credentials on paper, therefore becoming closely linked to things outside of themselves in the form of physical verifications about their jobs, houses, tax numbers, nationalities, and much more. The first iteration of the internet allowed users to move away from paper verification and extend their identity into the digital sphere. By gaining easier access to information, their identity was changed by the ability to connect, albeit rather basically, with digital resources and virtual networks.</p><p>In Web 2.0, this was taken a step further — people began to engage more actively on the internet through comment features on websites, chatrooms and social media platforms. Our digital identities grew through increased data exchange, as we created digital footprints of our online selves. Data processing and collection became a highly lucrative resource for companies, with little to no regulation of data harvesting and its uses. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.html">Cambridge Analytica</a> scandal laid bare the dangers of this insatiable data economy which inadvertently gave big tech giants control of millions of users’ information. Indeed, it highlighted the complete lack of privacy and oversight that people have&nbsp;online.</p><p>There are a host of problems associated with identity and reputation in Web 2.0, not least the fact that people have little control over data ownership. On nearly all websites, sensitive data is required for identity verification and reputation is ultimately locked in client servers. Companies use non-transparent algorithms to collect data, leaving people unaware of how companies are using the information they share. The network effect, a phenomenon whereby a product or service gains additional value as more people use it, has led to the rise of the data economy. Companies are incentivized to collect as much information as possible about the people using their services which, of course, leads to privacy and security concerns as centralized systems no longer possess the power to keep user data safe. The fact that data pools in Web 2.0 are also highly fragmented further exacerbates the potential for issues, as there are many separate areas on the web where sensitive information can be breached, edited, or&nbsp;lost.</p><p>Web 3.0, the internet’s third iteration has begun in earnest, and now users can take back control of their digital identities by using more distributed, interoperable, and self sovereign applications. As we move into the next stage, it is essential that we revamp identity and reputation management using Distributed Ledger Technology. Decentralized identity applications built on blockchain, such as Ontology’s <a href="https://ontid.ont.io/">ONT ID</a>, can help users defend their data and privacy. Through these applications, the data owner is able to authorize access to their data. To combat the lack of a standard process to support proper valuation and trading of data, peer-to-peer, cross-platform data marketplaces can be used. Open API ensures compatibility with applications on any infrastructure and reputation ratings can also help to establish trust between&nbsp;peers.</p><p>In the real world, reputation directly influences social capital, authority, status, eligibility and access to opportunities. In the digital world, reputation manifests into profiles, hierarchies, tags, and scores that determine the privileges that are granted to users. Digital reputation scores can be created through the collation of all relevant data related to an individual. These scores can be linked to an individual’s digital identity and stored on-chain, allowing any entity within the digital ecosystem to verify information and assess that individual’s creditworthiness or reputation score. Web 3.0 would stand to benefit greatly from such protocols, which would help to verify an individual’s eligibility to enter and participate in a system in a transparent way.</p><p>Web 3.0 is starting to see the emergence of ‘massive user data’. Within an on-chain context, such data takes the form of transaction data, smart contracts, digital assets and ownership history, and much more. Off chain, it looks like in-app data from games or other apps, reviews and ratings from different platforms, user profile information from social networks, financial data, and KYC, amongst others. Web 3.0 native data, i.e. data that has maximum consistency and a minimal amount of additional components, is starting to come into play, which is helping to inform a new kind of identity and reputation. This is applicable in many different scenarios in Web 3.0. For example, when a user seeks entry to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), they may be required to provide different types of personal data, such as proof of ownership of digital assets or social media verification to prove you are not a bot. This allows individuals to contribute to DAOs, where they can influence decision-making processes. Creditworthiness, which is used in decentralized finance to collateralized assets, also requires native data in order for users to avail of a DAO’s service provisions.</p><p>The question of whether it is better to have one reputation score for everything or multiple reputation scores for different contexts is a topic for debate. The benefits of reputation scores that can use on-chain data to reveal contributions to a certain project in the form of participation in bounty programs, development of product plug-ins, submitted proposals and governance votes are an exciting space to be explored.</p><p>Ontology enables a decentralized network environment that solves key issues of identity security and data integrity. Data sharing and productive collaboration is maximized by assuring that users can trust one another. Ontology helps to facilitate self-sovereign identity and privacy protection, data diversity, algorithmic versatility, and configurable reporting. The groundswell of momentum surrounding this area is evident in the Ontology community where we have reached over 1.5 million ONT ID users, with a diverse community spanning 30+ languages, over 190 partners, and 707 nodes in total. We are excited to be at the forefront of a new revolution for identity in Web 3.0 and are honoured that so many companies and individuals are putting their faith in our solutions to guide them into this exciting new&nbsp;era.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

			 Who are you? 
<p></p>
<p>My name is Cyrille De Ciancio, I’m 33 years old and I live in France near the Luxembourgish border. I started my professional career in Luxembourg as a system engineer in an international bank. After seven years working in Luxembourg, I’ve decided to move to Asia.</p>
<p>I first landed in Hong Kong where I worked for 3 years, then with my family, we decided to move to Bangkok in Thailand where we stayed for a year and a half.</p>
<p>My professional path allowed me to meet and learn how to work with people from all around the world, and it brought me valuable soft skills which are (to me) even more important than the technical ones.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I was in Thailand when I decided to move back to Europe and look for a job. During my research, I saw a DevOps open position on Tokeny’s website and I’ve applied. From the first interview, I had a very good feeling about Tokeny, the team, its culture and its ambitions.</p>
<p>We moved forward with other interviews and a few weeks later I joined the company.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Working at Tokeny brings me all the components I need to be professionally beaming: trust, autonomy, listening… On top of that, there are so many technical challenges which need to be tackled, together with an impressively skilled tech team, the motivation is always at a high level.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Besides new technologies, traveling and discovering new countries, different people and cultures have always been very important to me, I love it. I really like getting deep into the countryside of places I’m visiting.</p>
<p>I also love cooking but honestly I still need more practise 🙂</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p></p>
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My dream is quite simple: I wish a long, happy and healthy life for my family and everyone else I share my life with.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>I would love to live in a world where frontiers do not matter much. A world where we would teach kids how to become happy before teaching them how to become rich.</p>

<p>The Holochain development team is moving to regular weekly releases of the Holochain conductor, HDK, and supporting libraries. These regular releases will bring incremental improvements in stability, performance, and developer ergonomics. This comes at the right time, because Dev Camp 8 is starting on September 28th – less than two weeks! Yes, it’s finally here!</p><p>This week’s release, Holochain v0.0.106, is a small one in terms of developer-facing features, bringing a new admin API endpoint for hApp uninstallation and the first iteration of a ‘web hApp bundle’ format. Along with some low-level features… just small ones, like, you know… sharding (!!!)</p><p>[ EDIT 17 Sept: The changelog has one correction; relaxed chain top ordering isn't available yet. ]</p><p>[ EDIT 20 Sept: I've added two breaking changes to the changelog; app developers take note! ]</p> Dev Camp 8: huge turnout, exciting curriculum <p>Yes, the community-led Dev Camp 8 is finally about to happen. We’ve all been astounded by the response — the organisers have received over 1500 applications from all over the world. That’s seven times more than last Dev Camp! This is a nice problem to have, but it has meant that the organisers have had to figure out how to deal with so many more participants. So they’ve taken the past couple months to strategise with the developer community and Holo organisation to make sure it’s a success for all.</p><p>It also adds some new features, which aren’t required for Dev Camp but are required for a couple of tools that will be used in Dev Camp. These tools are <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher">Launcher</a>, an end-user hApp runner, and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/create">create</a>, the beginning of a new RAD scaffolding tool. In order to support Launcher, the conductor admin API now has an `UninstallApp` endpoint and there’s a <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/973">new web hApp bundle format</a>.</p><p>To me, Launcher, create, and web hApp bundling feel like big news. They aren’t ready for prime time yet, though, so I’ll share more about them later.</p> Still time to register for Dev Camp! <p>Yes, that’s right. Even with the huge number of applications, and even though it starts in only 12 days, you can still join the Dev Camp. It’s free, the curriculum sounds really fun, and it’s got a great crew of leaders, facilitators, teachers, and mentors. It’ll last six weeks (with a break in the middle), with weekly live sessions for Europe time zones and support sessions for Asia-Pacific and the Americas. There’ll also be a Discord server where you can talk with participants and support folks any time you like.</p><p>I’ll write more about the Dev Camp next week, but in the meantime — <a href="https://holochain.org/dev-camp">go and sign up</a>!</p> Holochain v0.0.106 release notes  Sharding has landed (sort of) <p>The sharding code is all written, integrated, and ready to be turned on with a configuration setting. When it’s disabled, a Holochain conductor operates as it always has — in ‘full-sync’ mode, with every node storing a copy of every piece of data. This is how Holochain will be deployed on HoloPorts until we can test sharding further.</p><p>If you want to experiment with sharding, here’s how to turn it on in the conductor config:</p> <code>network:
    # … transport config excluded …
    tuning_params:
        gossip_dynamic_arcs: true
</code> 
<p>And if you’re feeling extra adventurous, there are <a href="https://docs.rs/kitsune_p2p_types/latest/kitsune_p2p_types/config/tuning_params_struct/struct.KitsuneP2pTuningParams.html">other gossip tuning params</a> you can play with too.</p> Web hApp bundles <p>There already is a hApp bundle format, which bundles up all the DNAs necessary for the Holochain side of a full hApp. You can use the <code>hc app</code> command, which takes a <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/0.0.1/holochain_types/app/struct.AppManifestCurrent.html">hApp manifest</a> file and produces a bundle with the extension <code>.happ</code>.</p><p>This new web hApp bundle and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain_types-0.0.6/crates/holochain_types/src/web_app/web_app_manifest/web_app_manifest_v1.rs">manifest format</a> (link to source code; documentation hasn’t been published yet) adds the ability to include a zip file full of web UI assets, along with the rest of the hApp, in a bundle with the extension <code>.webhapp</code>. This will be used as a common format for both Holo hosting and the Launcher.</p> Full changelog   [ EDIT: This feature is included, but a merge issue caused it to be inactive. It'll be reactivated in next week's release. ] Relaxed chain top ordering (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/939">#939</a> and<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/941"> #941</a>): If you’ve been getting <code>HeadMoved</code> errors when making lots of zome calls from your UI, this new feature could be helpful. Rather than having to call that function again if another function has beaten it, it allows you to specify that its batch of writes can be ‘rebased’ on the new chain top. This is an option for any entry logic that doesn’t require strict source chain ordering.  <code>WebAppManifest</code> and <code>hc web-app</code> (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/939">#973</a>): This is the beginning of a bundle format for hApps that contain both a DNA bundle and a web-based UI. This format will be used by both the upcoming Launcher and the Holo Hosting App.  <code>UninstallApp</code> (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/939">#969</a>): This admin API endpoint had already been stubbed out; now it’s functional. It allows hApp managers like the Launcher to completely remove a hApp.  Sharding compiled in (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/943">#943</a>): No longer hidden behind a feature flag, sharding can now be turned on with the conductor configuration parameter <code>network.tuning_params.gossip_dynamic_arcs</code>.  [ EDIT: Added to changelog 20 Sept ] Hashes are no longer serialised to Base64 strings by default; if you depend on this behaviour, add the <code>"encoding"</code> feature flag to the <code>holo_hash</code> dependency in your zome <code>Cargo.toml</code> file:    <code>holo_hash = {version = "0.0.6", features = ["encoding"]}</code>   [ EDIT: Added to changelog 20 Sept ] <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.106/hdk/prelude/struct.Timestamp.html"><code>Timestamp</code> structs have changed</a>. If your zome code or client code directly interacts with <code>Timestamps</code> and their serialised representations, you may need to do some refactoring. Otherwise, you should only need to recompile your zomes against HDK 0.0.106.  [ EDIT: Added to changelog 21 Sept ] <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.106/hdk/time/fn.sys_time.html">sys_time</a></code> now returns a <code>Timestamp</code> rather than a <code>Duration</code>.   Documentation Drive follow-up: new goodies for new devs <p>A couple months ago, community dev <a href="https://github.com/Connoropolous">Connor Turland</a> instigated a Documentation Drive. (And I’m so grateful to him.) Here are three exciting things that came out of that work.</p> Updated Application Architecture <p>Of all the Core Concepts, the one I was least satisfied with was Application Architecture. I felt like it didn’t do a great job of explaining how hApps are put together and run, and Connor agreed. So he rewrote it, I massaged it and added new pictures, and now you can <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/2_application_architecture/">read the updated version</a>. If the Holochain stack never made sense to you before, it probably will now! (Also, it doesn’t talk about donuts anymore. 🍩 Hopefully this <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/2_application_architecture/#agent-centricity">more straightforward description</a> of agent-centricity is easier to understand.)</p> hApp development tutorials <p>There are two getting-started tutorials that show you, in actual code, how to create a hApp. <a href="https://github.com/holochain/happ-client-call-tutorial"><code>happ-client-call-tutorial</code></a>, written by Connor and <a href="https://github.com/jost-s">Jost Schulte</a>, shows you how to connect a UI to a hApp (in both TypeScript and Rust). There's also its companion <a href="https://github.com/holochain/happ-build-tutorial/"><code>happ-build-tutorial</code></a>, written by many in the community, that walks you through the basics of structuring, writing, compiling, and running a hApp.</p><p>[ EDIT: Previously I said Connor was solely responsible for <code>happ-build-tutorial</code>. ]</p> Holochain community wiki <p>A community knowledge repository has been sorely needed for a while. Previously, devs have had to comb through <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/">forum</a> posts, <a href="https://holochain-open-dev.github.io/blog/">Open Dev blog</a> posts, <a href="https://github.com/holochain">GitHub</a> readmes, and <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/tag/dev-pulse/">Dev Pulses</a> to find good quality information. Now there’s a place to put the best of it! The <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki">community wiki</a> already has a number of great guides and howtos, and there’s always room for more contributions. It’s not technically an official resource, but the folks writing articles in there are so skilled that it’s probably more useful than the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org">official dev portal</a> right now 😊</p> Holochain In Action videos <p>Holochain In Action is a community of developers actively building on and learning about Holochain. I’ve <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/a-developer-ecosystem-in-full-bloom/#holochain-in-action-a-community-of-co-learning">mentioned them before</a>, and invited you to <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/about-the-holochain-in-action-category/5448">join the community</a>, but I realised that their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJwIuwkCI5HMSzHJpKys-RQ">weekly session recordings</a> really ought to be shared.</p><p>So let’s start with the most recent one, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2ISltVei38">session 17</a>. It showcases the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJwIuwkCI5HMSzHJpKys-RQ">Elemental Chess</a> hApp and dives into the code, explaining how it implements player profiles and game invitations. If you’re working on a hApp with a social component, especially a game hApp, this would be a good one to watch.</p><p>Wow! That feels like plenty for this week. I have a feeling there will be an equal amount really soon — the developer ecosystem is growing faster than I can keep up with it!</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@lc_photography?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Leon Contreras</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/campfire?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

 Interview Credify’s Director of Engineering Shuichi Nagao 



<p>Vietnam has been an attractive place for innovation and international investment, especially in the technology industry. In this article, we would like to discuss with Shuichi Nagao, Credify’s co-founder and Director of Engineering, what businesses should know about Vietnam’s Information Technology (IT) resources, especially before entering the market.</p>



<p>Before founding Credify, Shuichi had been working as a Fullstack Engineer in the FinTech space, such as payment and blockchain (Ethereum). Since 2019, he has been running Credify mainly in Vietnam. From his diverse experiences, Shuichi can share his knowledge on Vietnam’s IT industry, and how businesses can leverage these resources.</p>







 Can you tell us about yourself and your journey from a full-stack developer to co-founder of Credify? 



<p>I’m Shu, a co-founder, and Director of Engineering. I learned machine learning at the University of Tokyo and in the last year of my university I joined a start-up company that two of my classmates founded, as software engineers. Through working with real products whose page views were like millions per day, I learned web development and iOS development. Eventually, this company was acquired by a big Japanese company for a decent amount of money, which was stunning to me. You know, the two of my classmates became millionaires! More importantly, you could impact/change people’s lives!</p>



<p>I have around 50 classmates, and at least 10 people out of 50, as far as I know, are entrepreneurs or very early-stage members of start-up companies. So I was interested in running my own business at some point, however, back in 2017, I decided to work as a software engineer in a FinTech company because I wanted to deep dive into complex software development to understand how systems work well before doing something for myself.</p>



<p>When I attended a tech conference on Ethereum in Tokyo, I met Makoto Tominaga and got along with him. At that time, I was interested in a different environment to challenge myself and impressed with Makoto’s vision and his experience and we started to work together in time.&nbsp;</p>



 As the co-founder of Credify, why did you choose Vietnam as the primary market? 



<p>Frankly speaking, I didn’t see Vietnam as the first market at the very beginning. Makoto and I came to Vietnam for software development at first, as we got a partner outsourcing company in Saigon. As we had been developing the MVP in Vietnam, we saw opportunities in the Vietnamese market (regulation in Vietnam, particularly around personal information, is not as well established as that in Japan, the economy is growing rapidly, etc.) and then we started to focus on the Vietnamese market. And also, the pandemic prevented us from moving to another country.</p>







 What do you think are the similarities of emerging markets in SouthEast Asia, and particularly Vietnam, regarding their IT resources? 



<p>The number of outsourcing companies is outstanding compared to developed countries. Due to the low cost compared with the developed countries, the emerging economies tend to have many outsourcing businesses, particularly in software development. In the outsourcing IT companies, you would work on different projects with quite limited periods of time (like every quarter) and you would need to strictly follow the requirements provided by clients or business analysts (I didn’t know of this position – Business Analyst – until I had come to Vietnam).</p>



<p>That engineers in the SEA speak English was impressive. I’m from Japan and find a lot of Japanese engineers with very good engineering skills without English speaking skills (writing &amp; reading are mostly fine). I think there is kind of correlations between technical skills and English skills particularly in SEA because they need to use English to learn new technologies, while Japanese, Korean, and Chinese have more information in their mother tongue.</p>



 What are the strengths and weaknesses of Vietnam’s emerging IT sector? 



<p>Vietnam has a significantly growing economy and more and more demands of hiring from IT companies, therefore from a macroeconomic perspective, the Vietnamese talents will keep becoming stronger. Besides, the competitiveness of Vietnamese engineers is strong compared to other countries in SEA with the solid government’s support for STEM education, so leader-class engineers in Vietnam will get good opportunities to work globally.</p>



<p>As a weakness, I would say the mindset. In nature that Vietnam has quite a number of outsourcing software companies, the product-driven mindset is not easy to cultivate. If you are assigned a new product every quarter, it will be difficult to love your product. I believe that great products and services will be created by a team that is passionate about their own products and services. That being said, there are more and more new growing IT startup companies in Vietnam nowadays, which I think will change this situation as engineers can have more opportunities to work for those growing product companies.</p>







 What are the most on-demand IT services, positions &amp; skills? How can Vietnam develop to meet that demand? 



<p>Engineering Manager and Tech Lead are very competitive. If you were to launch a new office in the IT sector in Vietnam (maybe a new company, maybe a subsidiary in Vietnam as a foreign company), you would need a software engineer who can build a product and a team. It goes without saying that this person should have both strong technical skills and management skills, but how can people develop these skills? I find Vietnamese engineers tend to follow the orders and try to complete them as much as possible by the due date (of course, not everybody), however, it is significantly important to understand (and make clear) the business requirements and figure out what exactly to do as a dev team by themselves without those orders. Having this self-starter mindset and ownership will be key.</p>



 What strategy should Vietnamese business use to best leverage this human resource, especially the increasing number of new freshers graduating from university? 



<p>Two things in my opinion; mentorship and branding. Working with top talent will be incredibly important particularly for juniors and freshers to set a role model. In my experience early days as a software engineer, I did pair programming with a great performer sometimes and I often asked senior engineers many questions like how to write testable code and how to design architecture. With regards to branding, good engineers bring more good engineers but finding the first ones is tough. Building a good reputation as to what the tech team does and making output by way of publishing tech blogs or open-source will be effective.</p>



 Finally, what are the qualities/values that Credify looks for in a potential employee developer? 



<p>I do value passion and mindset to grow our products together. Technical skills are important, but I like people who are passionate about what they do and I want to work with those people. I am sure that Credify can provide people with challenging and exciting opportunities.</p>

<p>Abstract — Smart contracts are being introduced to IOTA, which has proposed an interesting take on distributed ledgers by proposing the Tangle. The Tangle promises to provide a more scalable transaction infrastructure with lower fees, potentially overcoming limitations of Ethereum and other blochain-based ledgers. Due to the current alpha state of IOTA smart contracts, the official documentation lags and it is a bit of challenge to get a working setup. To help interested developers and the IOTA community to more quickly try out smart contracts, this article describes how to set up a private IOTA network with the latest state of the software and demonstrates a workable prediction market smart contract developed in&nbsp;Rust.</p> Introduction <p>Smart contracts are codified contracts using rules and algorithms that can automatically trigger and incur electronic transactions of cryptocurrencies like Ether. The expected economic impact of smart contracts is very large as they allow for improving the efficiency of many existing business models and they also allow for completely new business models. For instance payouts of insurance contracts can be automated using smart contracts or autonomous cars could also pay tolls and parking fees automatically.</p><p>While smart contracts are already well known amendments from blockchain approaches like Ethereum, these approaches suffer from shortcomings like low throughput, and high transaction costs. For these reasons, the IOTA foundation had set out to first propose a new and more scalable transaction system based on the so called “Tangle”. Secondly, IOTA version 2.0 is currently under development, and it includes an approach to smart contracts. Smart contracts under IOTA 2.0 are promised to be built on an infrastructure that both scales well, and incurs low transaction costs.</p><p>Before the background of a promising new approach for smart contracts, I started to explore how to set up a private IOTA network for development and how to develop and deploy a smart contract on it. As the IOTA developer documentation is lagging it was quite a challenge to get a working solution. Thus, the main contributions of this article are, (1) a proper description how to set up the network and how to enable smart contracts, and (2) a fully working demonstration smart contract, which implements a simple prediction market in which multiple network participants can predict and bet on a certain outcome of an&nbsp;event.</p><p>The outline of this article is, I give (1) an overview of IOTA and the network’s smart contract integration, (2) a description of how to set up an environment for developing and testing IOTA smart contracts, (3) an implementation of a simple prediction market as a smart contract, (4) some notes and insights on IOTA and smart contracts, and (5) a conclusion.</p> The IOTA Network and Smart Contracts <p>IOTA is about a new kind of public and permissionless distributed ledger for exchanging value and data. The IOTA network has been designed to overcome the main bottlenecks of Blockchain-based distributed ledgers. Due to the organization of transactions (of value) in a chain, there is just one end to append new ones, which makes it slow. Thus, in contrast to the Blockchain-based approaches the distributed ledger of IOTA is organized in a different way. The Blockchain, which is central to Bitcoin or Ethereum for instance, is replaced by the Tangle. The Tangle connects transactions via edges in a directed (and acyclical) graph (see next figure). In contrast to the Blockchain, there are multiple nodes (representing transactions) on which new edges to new nodes, i.e., transactions, can be appended.</p>The Tangle data structure of IOTA’s distributed ledger. Green: validated transactions, White: not yet validated, Grey: new transactions. <a href="https://iota-einsteiger-guide.de/was-ist-iota.html">Source</a> (2021–09–10)<p>Beside the data structure, there are further key differences to classic Blockchain-based approaches. The consent mechanism requires no miners because all users help in validating transactions. Therefore, transactions can be essentially conducted with zero fees. The current IOTA network still requires a central coordinator, defining trusted transaction milestones, which other transactions need to reference to be also trusted. To achieve true decentralization, the planned update to IOTA 2.0 should overcome this limitation.</p><p>The key properties and key promises of <a href="https://www.iota.org/get-started/what-is-iota">IOTA</a> are of&nbsp;being</p>  highly scalable by a new data structure allowing for parallel transactions  requiring few resources and being suitable for devices and&nbsp;sensors  having zero-fee transactions  running fast transactions  finally approving messages within&nbsp;seconds  providing a distributed network, which is robust against&nbsp;attacks  <p>These properties would enable a layer of trust and a very scalable and efficient messaging system for the <a href="https://www.iota.org/get-started/what-is-iota">“machine economy”</a> with a very large amount of devices connected to the Internet. The current version of IOTA on the Mainnet is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOTA_(technology)">1.5</a>, which went live in April 2021. Version 1.5 is seen as an intermediate step in maturing the IOTA technology and proving its usability and practical value. This would form the basis for smart contracts that use the messaging capabilities of the IOTA network. Smart contracts are supposed to be introduced in version 2.0 the latest and might <a href="https://twitter.com/iota/status/1428704497992413185">be even backported to 1.5</a>. At the time of writing, smart contracts are subject to development.</p>IOTA network layers. <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer/blob/develop/documentation/static/img/protocol_specification/layers.png">Source</a> (2021–09–10)<p>The design for IOTA 2.0 foresees different layers (see figure above) that separate the general underlying messaging, transacting, and validating infrastructure from the application layer, which comprises also smart contracts, which would then use layer 1 capabilities to realize their features. A main reason for separating smart contracts into another layer is to not compromise the messaging functionality. Smart contracts run on Wasp nodes on layer 2 in connection with Goshimmer on layer 1, responsible for conducting transactions and messaging (see next&nbsp;figure).</p>GoShimmer for messaging and Wasp nodes for smart contracts in an IOTA 2.0 network. <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp/blob/master/documentation/ISCP%20architecture%20description%20v3.pdf">Source</a> (2021–09–10)<p>Due to the separation of Wasp and Goshimmer, they need a technical capability to connect and interact with each other. Therefore, Goshimmer nodes contain a “txstream” plugin, which needs to be activated for connecting Wasp nodes. Smart contracts are developed in the Rust programming language. <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is known to generate very performant and memory efficient executables while preventing the developer from many classes of errors by a helpful compiler and a well-designed language. To test smart contracts and run unit tests against smart contract functionality, the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/iotaledger/wasp/packages/solo">“solo” environment</a> written in Go can be&nbsp;used.</p> Setup <p>The described setup defines a private IOTA 2.0 network you can run on your laptop. The network hosts a layer 1 Goshimmer node for messaging and a layer 2 Wasp node for running smart contracts. On this basis, the next chapter shows how to develop and deploy a smart contract to this&nbsp;network.</p> Environment <p>I used Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with latest updates and upgrades&nbsp;and</p>  installed git  installed <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">rust</a> 1.53.0 for developing native IOTA smart contracts by<br>curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs |&nbsp;sh  installed wasm-pack 0.10.0 for compiling smart contracts into “WebAssembly” binaries by<br>curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf |&nbsp;sh  <p>Installed dependencies for <a href="https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/INSTALL.md">rocksdb</a> required by Goshimmer as its underlying database&nbsp;engine:</p>  sudo apt-get install libgflags-dev  sudo apt-get install libsnappy-dev  sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev  sudo apt-get install libbz2-dev  sudo apt-get install liblz4-dev  sudo apt-get install libzstd-dev  <p>Cloned and built Goshimmer 0.7.5 from the develop branch (in the version of 2021–08–16) according the following description:</p>  git clone -b develop <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer.git">https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer.git</a>  git checkout tags/v0.7.5  cd goshimmer  go build -tags&nbsp;rocksdb  <p>Prepared Goshimmer for transaction handling<br>Save the <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/prediction-market-smart-contract/blob/main/goshimmer/config.json">config.json file</a> to your Goshimmer directory to</p>  enable the txstream plugin, which allows Goshimmer to communicate with Wasp&nbsp;nodes  disable the portcheck plugin  <p>To check whether Goshimmer synchronizes its time and whether messaging works, open up the dashboard on your local machine by <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8081/dashboard">http://127.0.0.1:8081/dashboard</a>.

I report the design and implementation of a simple prediction market in Rust, how to build and deploy it, and finally how to use&nbsp;it.</p> Design <p>A classic example of realizing a smart contract is given by a prediction market. A prediction market is a virtual electronic market allowing to predict outcomes of future events by placing a monetary bet on a certain outcome. Such events could be sports events, political events, future prices of stocks, or other events with uncertain future outcomes. For instance, the outcome of a political election could be subject to predictions on a prediction market. A simple binary question to be answered by prediction market participants could be “Will candidate/team A win?” — with possible outcomes being “yes” or&nbsp;“no”.</p><p>Our design of a prediction market for demonstration purposes is simple. We omit a book maker and a pricing mechanism. Formally, we do not pose a question with predefined possible outcomes. Instead, market participants can bet basically on any outcome of an event with an arbitrary amount of tokens until the time for predictions is over. Afterwards, the winning outcome is determined and winning bets placed on the correct outcome receive back their share on the overall amount of tokens placed in bets. Assume, in total 700 tokens were bet on “no” and 300 tokens in total were bet on “yes”, and “yes” is the actual outcome. A single bet on “yes” with 100 tokens receives (100/300)*(700+300) = 333 tokens, making a win of 233&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Realizing this design as a smart contract in the IOTA network allows to deploy one contract per question to be answered. The account deploying the contract is in control and has to specify the time until when bets can be placed on outcomes. The actual question to be answered has to be communicated in third party channels. Any network participant can then look up the contract and call a function to place a bet on an outcome by sending some IOTA from their wallet. Finally, after the time for predictions and bets has passed, the deploying account has to call a function to close the prediction market and to provide the actual outcome of the event and correct answer to the question. This triggers the evaluation of all bets with regard to the correct answer. Accounts with the correct answer receive the winning amount of IOTAs in a transaction.</p><p>Note that in a real world and more production-like scenario, one might consider using an <a href="https://blog.iota.org/introducing-iota-oracles/">oracle</a> to provide the outcome of an event. Oracles can stream off-chain data (about events) into the Tangle, so smart contracts can use this data in their evaluations.</p> Implementation <p>Smart contracts for the IOTA network can be implemented in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and then compiled to a <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/what/wasm">WebAssembly</a> file.</p><p>Our demonstration smart contract implemented in Rust can be viewed and cloned from this <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/prediction-market-smart-contract">repository</a>. The smart contract first exposes three functions for (1) initializing a prediction market, (2) placing a bet on an outcome, and (3) closing the prediction market for determining winners. When the contract is loaded, the mentioned functions’ implementations are made publicly available under the first string’s name, e.g., “initmarket”.</p><p>The first function should be called by the account deploying the contract for initialization. Optionally, the function can set an end time for betting using the parameter BETENDUTC, which is a date-and-time string in ISO format, assuming time in UTC. In case the parameter is omitted, bets can be placed at any time until the closemarket function is called (see&nbsp;below).</p><p>The second function allows to place a bet on a certain outcome value of an event, provided as parameter BETVALUE, e.g. “yes”. The amount to bet is the amount of IOTA sent with the function call. Bets must be placed in time before the betenddatetime has passed, which was set on initialization of the market. To save incoming bets for future evaluation to determine winners, I use two structs, defined in the beginning. That is, I define a hash map, mapping a betting account’s id to a Bet struct, which defines the amount of tokens and the outcome value of the bet. These custom structs are used instead of the built-in map offered by the context object of the function because only a proper hash map allows iterating over all keys and elements stored. As custom objects are not accommodated by the state stored in the context of the function, we need to jsonify it to produce a string, which can then be stored in the&nbsp;state.</p><p>The third function closes the prediction market and is to be called by the contract owner. Calls by other accounts will fail. The function can only be run after the specified end time has passed for predictions, and the function to close the market can be called successfully only once. The function requires a BETVALUE parameter, specifying the winning outcome, e.g., “yes”. The function runs through the stored bets, determines winning bets and the amount of IOTA coins they receive, and sends the IOTA to the wallets of the&nbsp;winners.</p> Build <p>To build the smart contract, one can pull the accompanying <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/prediction-market-smart-contract">repository</a> on github with the following structure:</p> * Cargo.toml <br>* src/lib.rs <br>* pkg/ <br>* target/ <p>The full Rust code of the smart contract is contained in a file called lib.rs. The structure and the naming of files follows standard conventions for Rust. To define dependencies of the smart contract code, the <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/prediction-market-smart-contract/blob/main/Cargo.toml">Cargo.toml file</a> reads as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>The most important dependency is wasmlib, which is the IOTA’s smart contract library, allowing to produce smart contracts as compiled WebAssembly files. Furthermore, serde is used for serializing custom state objects to json strings for storage in the smart contract’s state. chrono brings some date and time related functionality required to control the end of a prediction market.</p><p>To build the smart contract, run wasm-pack build in the directory where Cargo.toml resides. The other directories like pkg and target are created automatically in the build process. The compiled WebAssembly file is located in the pkg directory and named predictionmarket_bg.wasm.</p> Preparation <p>We proceed by deploying our simple smart contract compiled as a WebAssembly wasm&nbsp;file.</p><p>Note: please adapt the path to the wasm file if required.</p><p>./wasp-cli chain deploy-contract wasmtime predictionmarket "Prediction Market SC"&nbsp;./prediction-market-smart-contract/pkg/predictionmarket_bg.wasm --chain=predmarketchain --upload-quorum=1 -d --address-index=0</p><p>outputing:</p> uploaded blob to chain -- hash: 6wVabTkRUUGrQzEj8s4yuPC8dfaHGLsoHLXsqvveSw4hPosted on-ledger transaction BChQcWEmMptqRM1z4C9ZffTQXPebg1MMiEYENuAnV7KV containing 1 request:<br>- Request 4RkBSF6BAHgfamyJnXFy4r1YoVU9wvZ9b6uvXUjt2VWAfF5<br>Waiting for tx requests to be processed...<br>Posted off-ledger request 2JdtBzxjP4Bc6Tj2SnZPSctoYDHxuCAvPWJwn6ufMShJ6Lw <p>Now, functions can be called on the contract. First, the same wasp-cli that deployed the contract needs to call the initmarket function. There are two possibilities:</p><p>a) do not specify a specific an end date for the prediction market to simplify testing and development by this call&nbsp;./wasp-cli chain post-request predictionmarket initmarket --chain=predmarketchain</p><p>b) specify a specific end date and time for the prediction market. The iso format is used and UTC is assumed. In this way, all bets must be placed before this time and the market can be only closed after this time. Run&nbsp;./wasp-cli chain post-request predictionmarket initmarket string BETENDUTC string "2021-09-08 23:00" --chain=predmarketchain</p><p>Before placing a bet, we check the wallet’s balance with&nbsp;./wasp-cli balance</p><p>returning</p> Address index 0<br>Address: 1BAgmaSN1RYk5rbbxMK21CZo8t2zQ3EFeMwDPnMhQdQbs<br>Balance:<br>IOTA: 28653<br>------<br>Total: 28653 <p>For the deployed prediction market, we assume two possible outcomes “yes” and “no” on which bets can be submitted. To place a bet with 10 IOTA on “no”, we&nbsp;run</p><p>./wasp-cli chain post-request predictionmarket bet string BETVALUE string no --chain=predmarketchain -t&nbsp;IOTA:10</p><p>and afterwards, by&nbsp;./wasp-cli balance we see the wallet's balance reduced by 10&nbsp;IOTA.</p> Address index 0<br>Address: 1BAgmaSN1RYk5rbbxMK21CZo8t2zQ3EFeMwDPnMhQdQbs<br>Balance:<br>IOTA: 28643<br>------<br>Total: 28643 <p>We now introduce and prepare the setup for four more participants to the prediction market. Each participant requires another wasp wallet. Thus, we create four new subdirectories waspwallet2, waspwallet3, waspwallet4, waspwallet5 and copy wasp-cli and wasp-cli.json to those directories by repeating with regard to these directories</p><p>The last command initializes a new&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>In case the contract’s code is changed, it needs to be re-deployed using the first and main wasp-cli. You also need to re-deploy the chain on which the contract is deployed first. Due to the redeployment of the contract, the copied versions of wasp-cli.json (in waspwallet2 to waspwallet5 directories) miss the new address of the deployed predmarketchain chain. In this case, we need to get it back in there to be able to run bets on the same prediction market from another account. Either you noted the address of the chain when it was created, such&nbsp;as</p> activating chain nZBwoJi5q7KGk8D2cgm16PWrdM6aL2qTdCY27HHjZgrK.. OK. <p>or you perform a cat wasp-cli.json in the directory of your first wasp wallet, giving you some information like this (among other information):</p> {<br>  "chains": {<br>    "predmarketchain": "nZBwoJi5q7KGk8D2cgm16PWrdM6aL2qTdCY27HHjZgrK",<br>  }, <p>Now you need to provide this address of the predmarketchain to the new wasp wallets’ configuration files. To do this, you can run the following command for the new wallets in the respective directories (e.g. in waspwallet2 through waspwallet5 in our example).</p><p>./wasp-cli set chains.predmarketchain nZBwoJi5q7KGk8D2cgm16PWrdM6aL2qTdCY27HHjZgrK</p><p>Please adapt the chain’s actual address nZBwoJi5q7KGk8D2cgm16PWrdM6aL2qTdCY27HHjZgrK to&nbsp;yours.</p><p>Finally, all four new wasp wallets need to be funded. First, find out their address by running (for each new waspwallet subdirectory)</p><p>waspwallet2/wasp-cli address</p><p>Then, provide the funds using cli-wallet (in the directory where it resides on your computer) by&nbsp;running</p><p>./cli-wallet send-funds -amount 40000 -dest-addr 1Ah4cqMPdrDGx6Htapk7NZUxxcYHsP1C3oAugEYHVmACj</p><p>and replacing the address 1Ah4cqMPdrDGx6Htapk7NZUxxcYHsP1C3oAugEYHVmACj with the actual address found by running&nbsp;./wasp-cli balance before in the respective subdirectories (of waspwallet2 to waspwallet5).</p> Simulation of a Prediction Market <p>Now we are ready to place bets in the deployed contract’s prediction market on behalf of these four new participants. So, in the respective subdirectories we run&nbsp;say</p>  cd waspwallet2  ./wasp-cli chain post-request predictionmarket bet string BETVALUE string yes --chain=predmarketchain -t&nbsp;IOTA:100  cd&nbsp;../waspwallet3  ./wasp-cli chain post-request predictionmarket bet string BETVALUE string no --chain=predmarketchain -t&nbsp;IOTA:50  cd&nbsp;../waspwallet4  ./wasp-cli chain post-request predictionmarket bet string BETVALUE string yes --chain=predmarketchain -t&nbsp;IOTA:200  cd&nbsp;../waspwallet5  ./wasp-cli chain post-request predictionmarket bet string BETVALUE string yes --chain=predmarketchain -t&nbsp;IOTA:500  <p>Finally the contract owner (with the first wallet) can close the prediction market by running in the directory of the first&nbsp;wallet</p><p>./wasp-cli chain post-request predictionmarket closemarket string BETVALUE string no --chain=predmarketchain</p><p>In this example, the actual outcome is specified to be “no”. When running this command from a different wasp wallet’s directory, we obtain a log output on the Wasp&nbsp;node</p> You are not authorised to close the prediction market - only contract creator is allowed to close the market. <p>When successfully closing the prediction market, the Wasp node’s log&nbsp;outputs</p> CLOSEMARKET is executed:<br>the winning value is: "no"<br>total amount of bets placed on "no" is 60 IOTA<br>total amount of bets placed on "yes" is 800 IOTA<br>total amount of bets over all values: 860 IOTA<br>1FbCCHv9if3xbnRg3wJ7SY1kBFSdhNFR6Ax6haw6PhYDL placed a bet on "no", which is a WIN<br>bet amount: 10 IOTA; won amount: 143 IOTA; of total amount placed a bet on 860; where total amount per winning value: 60<br>transferring won amount of IOTA to: 1FbCCHv9if3xbnRg3wJ7SY1kBFSdhNFR6Ax6haw6PhYDL<br>1FZtVTCi2GDuQ1oMGZqpT38akLpcMiMv6a8MVKNJYYdsr placed a bet on "yes", which is not a win<br>1F81pGLKLhPb5ANFSGWQ7UPMSnPdahNZaZkgrcyaFXvpu placed a bet on "no", which is a WIN<br>bet amount: 50 IOTA; won amount: 716 IOTA; of total amount placed a bet on 860; where total amount per winning value: 60<br>transferring won amount of IOTA to: 1F81pGLKLhPb5ANFSGWQ7UPMSnPdahNZaZkgrcyaFXvpu<br>17jdFbAhWwF79fBEia6A8AYMTmMYncipaFhDTjsqUbMfp placed a bet on "yes", which is not a win<br>1BAgmaSN1RYk5rbbxMK21CZo8t2zQ3EFeMwDPnMhQdQbs placed a bet on "yes", which is not a win<br>consensus/action.go:338 postTransaction: POSTED TRANSACTION: 4Aw6PzQGkk6MFzPVAXZkz8RGiPocYxuxhA9o7qgeDN7h, number of inputs: 2, outputs: 3<br>EVENT: state was synced to block index #11, approving output: [0]4Aw6PzQGkk6MFzPVAXZkz8RGiPocYxuxhA9o7qgeDN7h<br>STATE TRANSITION TO #11. requests: 1, chain output: [0]4Aw6PzQGkk6MFzPVAXZkz8RGiPocYxuxhA9o7qgeDN7h <p>Revisiting the bets, we had placed the following ones:</p><p>Bets number 1 and 3 were on “no” and the bet was on the actual outcome “no”. So the total amount of IOTA was 860, the bets on “no” were only 60 IOTA in total. The share of bet number 1 is 10/60 and share of bet number 2 is 50/60. So, wasp wallet 1 receives 1/6 of 860 IOTA, i.e, 143 IOTA. And wasp wallet 3 receives 5/6 of 860 IOTA, i.e, 716 IOTA. Note that when transferring funds, a minimum transaction of fee of 1 IOTA is deducted from the amount to be transferred.</p><p>Note that running the closemarket function of the smart contract a second time leads to an error message in the Wasp node’s&nbsp;log:</p> the prediction market was already closed  Limitations <p>There are some limitations of the presented prediction market</p>  Only one contract per chain can be deployed because the bets are not stored per contract identification in the chain’s&nbsp;state  All bets are stored on-chain, so they are&nbsp;public  Each account (given by a wasp wallet) can place only one bet per deployed prediction market&nbsp;contract  The actual question asked by the prediction market and the possible outcomes have to be conveyed informally  Bets are against other market participants — there is no market&nbsp;maker   Insights <p>Along the way of producing this article and experimenting with IOTA smart contracts, many small insights were gained. With the hope that these insights will be helpful, I share them in the following.</p> Transaction Time <p>Running transactions in the described setup on a laptop can take several seconds when waiting for the wasp-cli commands to finish. However, they can be run asynchronously when using the wasp-cli, i.e., commands can return immediately after issuing a command. Of course, transactions can run in parallel. When running scripted wasp-cli requests, one has to take care not to create too much load on the Wasp node because otherwise requests will fail with “time out”-errors. To evaluate transaction times in a production setup on the Devnet or Mainnet, further investigations are required.</p> Transaction Fees <p>In principle fees for transactions and deployments are configurable. However, there are some minimum fees that apply such as for deploying a chain (100 IOTA), deploying a smart contract, and posting state changing requests to a smart contract (1 IOTA). With default minimum fees in mind, transaction costs in the IOTA network should be very low compared to transaction fees in the Ethereum network. Note that chain owners could also increase transaction fees.</p> Production Readiness <p>On a first shot, nothing really worked when trying to set up a private IOTA network based on public documentation. That is, one has to find workable versions of the software, find a proper configuration and parameters, and find working ways for funding wallets and deploying contracts. The IOTA 2.0 software is under development and special notice has to be taken on which versions to run and which version of the different pieces (Wasp, GoShimmer, cli) to combine. The documentation in <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/">IOTA’s repositories</a> is lagging behind the development process. However, the IOTA community is very helpful and can be reached on <a href="https://discord.iota.org/">Discord</a>. So, getting the network up and running depended digging into material on the <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/">github</a> repositories, third party information (e.g., on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyzQwFp8SFUWHhim4PBhV75W3nLxBWZI6">youtube</a>), own experiments, and asking questions on IOTA’s <a href="https://discord.iota.org/">discord</a> server. Once the IOTA private network and the smart contract are up and running, you are ready for testing and experiments. Further steps taken by IOTA to bring the smart contract implementation and IOTA 2.0 to production readiness can be looked up in their&nbsp;<a href="https://roadmap.iota.org/">roadmap</a>.</p> Developing Smart Contracts <p>Using Rust as a language for developing smart contracts might help producing error-free and stable smart contracts because Rust is well-known for its strict and sophisticated compiler which together with the strong typing and the language design eliminates whole classes of errors common in other languages. Also, the compiler provides helpful error messages. Therefore, using <a href="https://www.innoq.com/de/articles/2020/08/smart-contracts-in-rust/">Rust can provide some advantages</a> over the Solidity language, which is usually used for developing Ethereum smart contracts. However, Rust might be unfamiliar for smart contract developers being used to Solidity.</p> Conclusion <p>This article discussed smart contracts as a new and upcoming feature in IOTA 2.0. Because IOTA has a different approach to conduct and store transactions in a more parallel way with fewer resources than Ethereum, a higher scalability and lower fees are promises that come with this approach. Our experimental setup of a private IOTA network and simple prediction market IOTA smart contract shows that it is already possible to use IOTA smart contracts for development and testing. As the process of setting up the IOTA network and running smart contracts was a bit challenging, I believe this article and example code can provide useful input and support for other developers and the community interested in IOTA smart contracts.</p><p>51nodes GmbH based in Stuttgart is a provider of crypto economy solutions. 51nodes supports companies and other organizations in realizing their Blockchain projects. 51nodes offers technical consulting and implementation with a focus on smart contracts, decentralized apps (DApps), integration of blockchain with industry applications, and tokenization of&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://medium.com/@turfa">Majd Turfa</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@jpbu">Jan-Paul Buchwald</a> for their help in the course of developing this article, experiments, and the&nbsp;setup.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/exploring-iota-2-0-smart-contracts-in-a-private-network-developing-a-prediction-market-c2d81988f75e">Exploring IOTA 2.0 Smart Contracts in a Private Network: Developing a Prediction Market</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes">51nodes</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  We missed commemorating our first birthday because we were simply too busy.  
			  
				
				
				 When we launched Indicio in May 2020, a global pandemic was disrupting the way we shared information. Lockdowns triggered a global migration from work to home, and centralized systems fragmented into millions of daily sign ons, access requests, and virtual meetings — many conducted on devices that were poorly protected. The curse of friction and the need to find efficient and effective ways of managing information in these new circumstances were an opportunity to rethink technology, processes, and ingrained habits—and jettison what wasn’t working.<p></p>
<p>Catastrophes have a way of resetting fundamentals, and the fundamental question we worked on was how can we trust digital data? This problem is now endemic to life because all our information is digital. The very efficiency of our communication has us trapped in a highly inefficient existential crisis. And it’s costing us a fortune in mitigation, poor user experience, fraud, and theft. Specifically, we saw four dimensions to the problem.</p>
<p>The first was how do you encode digital information with authenticity? You need to show, definitively, that it came from the source it says it did and that it hasn’t been altered. This is like the “Trinity” of trust. If St. Patrick came back as a technologist, he’d probably use a shamrock to explain how these all go together.</p>
<p>The second dimension is regulatory compliance. Yes, we see COVID health passes being used to effectively burglarize people’s private data but that just isn’t sustainable—or right. You may say, “hey, people don’t care about privacy when convenience is on offer,” but the Venn diagram of people who do care about privacy and those who detest predatory tech companies is large enough to power privacy regulation to infinity and beyond. We need to mitigate that risk—and the cost burden this compliance has created.</p>
<p>The third dimension is security. One trillion dollars. That’s the estimated cost of cyber insecurity. The cost of our collective failing here exhausts adjectives; the pressure to defend against threats is just exhausting. The stats are so grim the new paradigm in security is called “Zero Trust.” You can’t get more nada than zero. What this means is that everything must be verified as authentic and unaltered all the time. Trust nothing, verify everything.</p>
<p>The fourth dimension is resilience. A technology that solves all these problems cannot manifest in a single point of failure whether that `is a single database or a single company.</p>
<p>No matter what way you slice and dice and spin current information systems, none deliver on all these dimensions. In fact, they barely deliver on any. And when they do, they do in ways that increase the risk in adjacent dimensions. Now, think about how many digital and non-digital devices and things the Internet of Things is going to drop into these systems in the next five years.</p>
<p>That’s why we missed our birthday.</p>
<p>We were working with global enterprises to build what we call “Trusted Data Ecosystems” to answer these challenges—and then some.</p>
 How does a Trusted Data Ecosystem solve all these problems? 
<p>First, it uses decentralized blockchain technology to create an authentic digital proof of someone or something or some claim. It uses machine-readable governance to establish who counts as a trusted source for this data within an ecosystem—the rules for trust. It has the software for people to create trusted data, hold and share it, and verify it.</p>
<p>Second, a trusted data ecosystem avoids the need for third parties to store personally identifying information (PII) in order to manage verification. No more personal accounts, passwords, or logins. No more data processing compliance costs and headaches.</p>
<p>Third, if you eliminate the need for databases full of PII, you eliminate them as a security risk. They aren’t colloquially known as “honeypots” for nothing. But just as important, you now have an ecosystem system for authentic verification to meet the demands of Zero Trust. All your network assets can implement rigorous verification in a frictionless way — thanks to machine-readable governance.</p>
<p>Fourth, our trusted data ecosystems are supported by decentralized networks. You can use ours, which now has 23 nodes on five continents, you can use others, or you can have us build you your own private network. Either way, you remove that single-point-of-failure weakness. The open-source base for the technology also means that credentials can be interoperable across systems—vital when you think about using a health test proof issued in one country for travel to another.</p>
<p>On top of all this, we’ve designed our Trusted Data Ecosystems to be easily integratable into existing systems. Technological evolution should be sustainable and not a case of buying new and shinier systems every couple of years, which only creates chaos for your employees and painful costs on your books. We believe that technology should be easy to integrate, easy to update, and easy to interoperate—and an open-source base enables this kind of continuous, sustainable improvement and innovation.</p>
<p>This multidimensional value—authenticity, compliance, integrity, and resilience—coupled with being easy to integrate is what separates the Indicio approach from the rest. Our growth in 16 months—with global enterprise customers and a global decentralized blockchain network supported by 23 companies on five continents is a sign that fundamental change is coming in the way we share information. And it will arrive just in time to navigate the vast expansion of connected devices.</p>
<p>Some tech companies look to the stars; we’re changing the digital universe.</p>

 Part 3: EVM Contract Development Process&nbsp;Demo <p>Last Week, Ontology announced the official deployment of a TestNet supporting EVM and opened the EVM compatible public beta to developers around the world. At the same time, the “<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-evm-testnet-officially-deployed-now-opening-evm-compatible-public-beta-to-developers-6dddc2bdd764">Ontology Security Vulnerability and Threat Intelligence Bounty Programme</a>” was officially launched in cooperation with SlowMist, a well-known code auditing agency. The top reward for reporting a vulnerability is $12,000 in&nbsp;ONG.</p><p>In <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ontology-evm-contract-development-d3dc7183661">Part 2</a>, we introduced the tools for developing and deploying EVM contracts on Ontology, and how to use MetaMask plug-in wallets to manage Ethereum wallets. In this section, we demonstrate the EVM contract development process.</p> 4. EVM Contract Development Process Demonstration <p>Below, we use the Hardhat tool to demonstrate the complete process of developing, deploying, and testing, EVM contracts on the Ontology&nbsp;network.</p> 4.1 Environmental Preparation   Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">nodejs</a>  Install <a href="https://hardhat.org/getting-started/">Hardhat</a>   4.2 Contract&nbsp;Design <p>4.2.1 Contract&nbsp;Logic</p><p>Let’s use a red packet contract as an example, which mainly provides the following functions:</p>  Send Red&nbsp;Packet  Receive Red&nbsp;Packet  <p>Each time a red packet is issued, the value of each red packet and the number of people who can claim it must be specified.</p><p>For example, the value of a red packet is 100 tokens and the number of people who can claim it is 10. That is, there are 10 different addresses to receive a portion of the red packet. We set the amount of each red packet to be equal, that is, each address can receive 10&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>According to the above logic, we can set the following storage structure:</p><p>4.2.2 Defining Contract&nbsp;Events</p><p>In the process of contract execution, we can trace the contract execution process by adding&nbsp;events.</p><p>In this example, we design the following two&nbsp;events:</p>  When sending a red packet, the contract generates the ID of the red packet, which must be pushed to the caller through an&nbsp;event.  When receiving the red packet, you need to push an event to record the red packet ID and the number of tokens received.  <blockquote>event SendRedPacket(uint packetId, uint&nbsp;amount);</blockquote><blockquote>event ReceiveRedPacket(uint packetId, uint&nbsp;amount);</blockquote><p>4.2.3 Define&nbsp;Function</p><p>sendRedPacket</p><p>1) Send red packets. Anyone can call this interface and send a certain amount of tokens to the contract address, so that other addresses can receive red packets from the contract&nbsp;address.</p><p>Note: Before calling this method, you need to authorize the contract address to be able to transfer the token from the user’s address, so you need to call the Approve method of the token&nbsp;first.</p><p>receivePacket</p><p>2) Receive the red packet. Any address can receive red packets by calling this interface. When calling this interface, you need to specify the red packet ID, that is, specify the red packet to be received.</p><p>Please refer to this <a href="https://github.com/ontio/ontology/tree/master/docs/specifications/evm_refernce/contract-demo/hardhatdemo/contracts">link</a> for the complete code of the contract.</p> 4.3 Use Hardhat to compile and test the&nbsp;contract <p>4.3.1 Create Hardhat&nbsp;Project</p><blockquote>mkdir hardhatdemo<br>cd hardhatdemo<br>npm init<br>npm install — save-dev hardhat<br>npx&nbsp;hardhat</blockquote><p>4.3.2 Modify hardhat.config.js file</p><p>Add test network node configuration information</p><p>The corresponding addresses for the specified private keys under the accounts filed need to have ONG from the TestNet to pay the transaction fee. You can receive TestNet ONG&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.ont.io/">here</a>.</p><p>4.3.3 Document preparation</p><p>Put the red packet contract code file in the contracts folder. In order to support the transfer of ERC-20 tokens, we also need EIP20Interface.sol, UniversalERC20.sol, and TokenDemo.sol files, which can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/ontio/ontology/tree/master/docs/specifications/evm_refernce/contract-demo/hardhatdemo">here</a>.</p><p>4.3.4 Add test code under test&nbsp;folder</p><p>4.3.5 Compile&nbsp;contract</p><p>Execute the following commands in the project root directory to compile the&nbsp;contract</p><blockquote>$ npx hardhat compile<br>Compiling 5 files with 0.8.0<br>Compilation finished successfully</blockquote><p>After the command is executed, the following folder will be generated:</p><blockquote>├── artifacts<br>├── cache<br>├── contracts<br>├── hardhat.config.js<br>├── node_modules<br>├── package-lock.json<br>├── package.json<br>├── scripts<br>└──&nbsp;test</blockquote><p>4.3.6 Test&nbsp;contract</p><p>$ npx hardhat&nbsp;test</p><p>The execution results are as&nbsp;follows:</p><blockquote>$ npx hardhat test<br> RedPacket<br> ✓ Token<br> ✓ sendRedPacket (16159ms)</blockquote><blockquote>2 passing&nbsp;(41s)</blockquote><p>The above is a complete demonstration process of Ontology EVM contract development. In Part 4, we introduce a Web3 API reference and teach you how to use Ontology Bridge to implement one-click crossover between Ontology digital assets and Ethereum digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Stay tuned!</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 In the fall of 2020, the Spring team released a new experimental Spring Native project that gave Spring developers hope for faster startup times. Spring Native is all about converting your Spring applications to native executables. It leverages GraalVM to make it happen. This announcement was huge because the new kids on the block, Micronaut and Quarkus, produced native executables by default.

<p>In the fall of 2020, the Spring team released a new experimental Spring Native project that gave Spring developers hope for faster startup times. Spring Native is all about converting your Spring applications to native executables. It leverages GraalVM to make it happen. This announcement was huge because the new kids on the block, Micronaut and Quarkus, produced native executables by default.</p>
 
 
<p>I was really excited about Spring Native when I first heard about it. Its first release (v0.8.3) was on Nov 23, 2020, but I started playing with it in September 2020, probably due to SpringOne. How do I know this? Because that’s when I first tried it, and <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot/issues/192">entered an issue for the Okta Spring Boot starter</a>. I was able to get things working with Spring Security’s OAuth dependencies (instead of the Okta starter) in the waning weeks of 2020.</p>

 Branching out with Spring Native 
 
 
<p>According to VMWare Tanzu’s recent <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/ebooks/the-state-of-spring-2021">State of Spring 2021 report</a>, a lot of people know about Spring Native, but it’s still early.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>I wrote about <a>how to build native Java apps with Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot</a> earlier this summer and included my learnings. Around the same time, I thought to myself, "it’d sure be nice if the Okta Spring Boot starter worked with Spring Native."</p>
 
 
<p>To solve this desire, I scheduled a Twitch stream with <a>Brian Demers</a> and <a href="https://joshlong.com/">Josh Long</a>. We spent 90+ minutes figuring things out. You can watch our struggles, collaborations, and ultimate joy in the <a href="https://youtu.be/8vY-9tXlCW4">video below</a>. I added a detailed table of contents to the video’s description on YouTube, so you can skip around if you like.</p>
 
 

 
 
<p>This stream originally aired on June 22, 2021. Since then, there have been a few Spring Boot releases and several Spring Native releases. And don’t forget, there was another <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1433072410182357000">SpringOne</a>!</p>

<p>Today, I’m happy to announce that we’ve added our learnings to <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot/releases/tag/okta-spring-boot-parent-2.1.1">Okta Spring Boot v2.1.1</a>; now, it only takes a couple of lines to add native support to a Spring Boot application that uses Okta.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>import org.springframework.nativex.hint.NativeHint;
@NativeHint(options = "--enable-https")</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Or, if you’d prefer a full example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.nativex.hint.NativeHint;

@NativeHint(options = "--enable-https")
@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you’d like to see what it takes to migrate my previously mentioned native Java + Spring Boot example from using Spring Security OAuth to the Okta starter, look no further than <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/native-java-examples/pull/5">@oktadev/native-java-examples#5</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>You can also try it out yourself with the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a>. Install it and follow along below for a quick Okta + Spring Native example.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Create a Native Spring Boot App 
 
 
<p>To create a secure Spring Boot app with Okta, run <code>okta start spring-boot</code>. You’ll need to verify your email and set a password as part of this.</p>
 
 






If you already have an Okta account, you can run <code>okta login</code> first.



 
 
<p>This command will download our <a href="https://github.com/okta-samples/okta-spring-boot-sample">Okta Spring Boot sample</a>, register your app on Okta, and configure it by adding your Okta settings to <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Add <code>@NativeHint(options = "--enable-https")</code> to the main <code>Application</code> class as specified above.</p>
 
 
<p>Next, edit your <code>pom.xml</code> and add the Spring Native version and classifier to the <code>&lt;properties&gt;</code> section:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;spring-native.version&gt;0.10.3&lt;/spring-native.version&gt;
&lt;repackage.classifier/&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, replace the <code>&lt;build&gt;</code> section with the XML below:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;build&gt;
    &lt;defaultGoal&gt;spring-boot:run&lt;/defaultGoal&gt;
    &lt;plugins&gt;
        &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;configuration&gt;
                &lt;classifier&gt;${repackage.classifier}&lt;/classifier&gt;
                &lt;image&gt;
                    &lt;builder&gt;paketobuildpacks/builder:tiny&lt;/builder&gt;
                    &lt;env&gt;
                        &lt;BP_NATIVE_IMAGE&gt;true&lt;/BP_NATIVE_IMAGE&gt;
                    &lt;/env&gt;
                &lt;/image&gt;
            &lt;/configuration&gt;
        &lt;/plugin&gt;
        &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.experimental&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-aot-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;version&gt;${spring-native.version}&lt;/version&gt;
            &lt;executions&gt;
                &lt;execution&gt;
                    &lt;id&gt;test-generate&lt;/id&gt;
                    &lt;goals&gt;
                        &lt;goal&gt;test-generate&lt;/goal&gt;
                    &lt;/goals&gt;

                    &lt;/goals&gt;
                &lt;/execution&gt;
            &lt;/executions&gt;
        &lt;/plugin&gt;
    &lt;/plugins&gt;
&lt;/build&gt;
&lt;repositories&gt;
    &lt;repository&gt;
        &lt;id&gt;spring-releases&lt;/id&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;Spring Releases&lt;/name&gt;

    &lt;/repository&gt;
&lt;/repositories&gt;
&lt;pluginRepositories&gt;
    &lt;pluginRepository&gt;

<p>Right after our first <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-decentralised-identity-and-financial-services-webinar-a-recap-f5cecfb8b45c">webinar</a>, we caught up with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephthompson11/">Joseph Thompson</a>, the CEO of <a href="https://www.aid.technology/">AID:Tech</a> to get his thoughts on the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> (SSI) space and its impact on our society over the next few&nbsp;years.</p><p>Here are some questions we asked&nbsp;him.</p> What’s exciting about verifiable credentials? <p>Not many people today understand the importance of taking ownership of their data. But that could change over the next decade, as privacy would be the most important commodity.</p><p>As people travel more, they tend to use their data across borders, and it becomes necessary to be able to use it safely and securely.</p><p>In the EU, we have the eIDAS, which is a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-a-verifiable-credential-based-ssi-implementation-meet-gdpr-compliance-5039d0149ea4">regulation</a> for verifying the identity of individuals online through electronic documents.</p><p>So, I was born and brought up in Ireland and when I go to Italy or Spain or any other country that’s a part of the EU, I don’t have to bring my health data, tax credits, passport, or any other document as my identity, thanks to eIDAS. Imagine the convenience that comes with it! And that’s just from the consumer&nbsp;side.</p><p>As for Enterprises, when their consumers bring in data from other organizations in a secure way, it saves them time and money, besides increasing transparency.</p><p>This means <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a> would make it easy for entities to trust data even on anonymous profiles and it can be massive for economies moving forward because an organization doesn’t necessarily have to know a person, just his or her data for processing. This is possible through verifiable credentials and that’s what makes it so exciting.</p><p>There are undoubtedly a lot of opportunities, provided we can resolve a couple of issues&nbsp;first.</p><p>One issue is there must be many applications for end-users. Having an identity on a network is kind of useless unless there are a ton of applications that can be accessed with that identity. So, we should be watching this space, especially blockchain, decentralized identity, and verifiable credentials for any developments that can be leveraged.</p><p>That said, there’s no doubt that there is a massive upside to <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">using verifiable credentials</a> and it’s only a matter of time before we start leveraging it.</p> What’s the best way to get the word out on verifiable credentials, privacy, and decentralized identity, and their benefits? <p>It’s a lot of marketing, and it becomes easy when you can demonstrate the benefits through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">real-world use&nbsp;cases</a>.</p><p>First of all, the decision to <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/selective-disclosure-share-what-you-want-8ae367655b7b">share your data</a> with someone must be a personal choice that an individual must make based on the benefit of a&nbsp;service.</p><p>Take the example of the microinsurance application that we’re building now. If an individual has a trusted verifiable credential, then the same can be sent to an insurance company. For insurance companies and healthcare organizations, these credentials mitigate their risks because they can determine whether the individual can make the copayments and premiums.</p><p>For individuals, they could decide if they wanted to share their data with an insurance company to get health insurance, and if yes, which company. In other words, the end user would have complete control over their data and could determine where and how it was&nbsp;shared.</p><p>Many people who weren’t convinced first have slowly adopted it due to their personal experiences.</p><p>To create more such experiences, companies in this space have to be more solution-focused. Currently, there’s a lot of focus on the tech side of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/how-to-implement-driving-license-use-case-using-verifiable-credentials-cef928222c92">VC implementation</a>, but this should extend to a solution-centric approach to increase adoption.</p><p>While this is already happening in pockets, there has to be a holistic approach to solving a particular problem through verifiable credentials, and I believe it will happen&nbsp;soon.</p> How do you see VCs and SSI evolving in the next five years or&nbsp;so? <p>A convergence of technologies such as mobile smartphones, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">identity wallets</a>, cryptos, and more would drive the need for trusted identities that can be shared seamlessly across different entities and use-cases.</p><p>It will also present huge opportunities for people to monetize their own data and this can drive adoption as&nbsp;well.</p><p>In all, yes, we can expect more awareness and adoption in five years because of the enormous upsides for both individuals and organizations.</p> So, what do you think are the impediments that can hamper this adoption? <p>Regulations definitely. Currently, we see a lack of clarity among lawmakers, so more awareness about VCs and their benefits could bring in more positive laws that can, in turn, foster innovation.</p> Shifting gears a bit here, what really brought you to SSI and decentralized identity? <p>Well, it all began in 2009 when I ran a marathon for a charity, but the money didn’t reach the intended recipients. I realized there was a lack of transparency in how the funds were collected and used. That was my first tryst with transparency or the lack of&nbsp;it.</p><p>In 2015, I was doing my Master’s degree in Digital Currencies and during this time, it occurred to me that the Google search engine must be converted into a transparency engine. What I mean by that is that there must be a layer of transparency in the information, so people are able to trust it&nbsp;better.</p><p>With such thoughts, I did some pilots in this space, and it soon became clear that this was a need for today’s world from government aid to welfare payments. And that’s how the whole idea was&nbsp;born.</p> Can you share some insights into the social projects you’re working&nbsp;on? <p>We’re working with the Women’s World Banking to distribute microinsurance to women in Uganda and Nigeria. We’re also partnering with the Asian Development Bank, Microsoft, and Save The Children to build verifiable credentials for parents, so they can access financial aid, education, and other benefits, and pass it to their children. We have now completed the pilot phase and we’re scaling it massively with the help of our partners.</p> What is Affinidi’s Role in the work you&nbsp;do? <p>Makes our life a lot easier as we don’t have to build the entire verifiable credentials from the base&nbsp;level!</p><p>Learn more about AID:Tech and Affinidi’s <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/affinidi-partners-with-aid-tech-exploring-new-horizons-in-digital-identity-and-verifiable-661c9e61f7e8">partnership</a>.</p><p>While this brings us to the end of this interview, we have many interesting content and events lined up.

Fintech’s biggest hivemind, <a href="https://www.money2020.com/">Money 20/20</a> is back this year from 21 to 23 of September in Amsterdam.




 




This year the event is back to a in-person event and with an immersive agenda bringing 8 groups of nearly 30 industry speakers, called Think Tanks, to discuss Fintech’s biggest challenges of today.




 “The future is trustless. What do we need instead?” 





 




<a href="https://www.meeco.me/">Meeco</a> will be present, with our CEO and Founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow/">Katryna Dow</a> joining the Think Tank titled<a href="https://europe.money2020.com/whatshappening/agenda#/agenda/event/the-future-is-trustless-what-do-we-need-instead-e102-45023"> “The future is trustless. What do we need instead?”</a> on Tuesday 21, 16:00 – 17:00 CET.




 




<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dgwbirch/">Dave Birch</a> will be moderating. David is an author, advisor and commentator on digital&nbsp;financial services. He’s one of the global top 15 favourite sources of business information (Wired magazine) and one of the top ten most influential voices in banking (Financial Brand); was found to be one of the top ten Twitter accounts followed by innovators. He leads 15Mb Ltd (his advisory practice), is Global&nbsp;Ambassador for&nbsp;Consult Hyperion&nbsp;(the secure electronic transactions consultancy that he helped to found), Non-Executive Chairman of Digiseq Ltd, Ambassador for Jersey for Fintech, a member of the Governing Council of the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation (the London-based think tank) and holds number of&nbsp;board-level advistory roles. He is an Honorary President of EEMA, the European e-ID Association.




 




Joining Katryna in this panel discussion are the following speakers:




 




• <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/felixgerlach/">Felix Gerlach</a>, CPO &amp; Co-founder, Passbase Inc.




 




• <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rdasxy/">Riddhiman Das</a>,  Co-founder &amp; CEO, TripleBlind




 




• <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmalindley/">Emma Lindley</a>,  Co-founder, Women In Identity




 




• <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/louise-maynard-atem-848b2117/">Louise Maynard-Atem</a>, Research Lead,  Women In Identity




 





 




Trust is an outdated concept. We should not need trust to be able to do trade and share. Trust should be an implicit hallmark, not an explicit task. What do we need to develop to remove the need to achieve it? And what do we need instead? We need to build an environment that is safe by default. We need to shift from transactions based on the identification of the counter parties to transactions based on the strongly-authenticated credentials of the counter parties. How do we get there?




 




This and other thought provoking conversations will take place at Money 20/20. Book by Friday the 16th (CET) for early bird prices and save 500€.

We’ve also considered how we might give you more options to <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/did-extensibility-on-the-mattr-platform-14c73c7a798e">expand the utility</a> of these identities over&nbsp;time.</p> An important milestone <p>The W3C working group responsible for Decentralized Identifiers <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/9179">recently published</a> the DID v1.0 specification under “Proposed Recommendation” status. This is a significant milestone as DIDs approach global standardization with the pending approval of the W3C Advisory Committee.</p><p>DIDs are maturing, but so is the environment and context in which they were originally designed. With a complex ecosystem consisting of dozens of different methodologies and new ones emerging on a regular basis, it’s important to balance the potential of this decentralized approach with a realistic approach for defining the real utility and value of each <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID method</a>. For example, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/NOTE-did-rubric-20210826/">DID Method Rubric</a> provides a good frame of reference for comparing different approaches.</p><p>Different types of DIDs can be registered and anchored using unique rules specific to the set of infrastructure where they’re stored. Since DIDs provide provenance for keys which are controlled by DID owners, the rules and systems that govern each kind of DID method have a significant impact on the trust and maintenance model for these identifiers. This is the key thing to remember when choosing a DID method that makes sense for your&nbsp;needs.</p> Our supported DID&nbsp;methods <p>In MATTR VII, by supporting a variety of DID methods — deterministic or key-based DIDs, domain-based DIDs, and ledger-based DIDs — we are able to provide tools which can be customized to fit the needs of individual people and organizations.</p>  Key-based DIDs — Largely static, easy to create, and locally controlled. This makes them a natural choice for applications where there’s a need to manage connections and interactions with users directly.  DIDs anchored to web domains — These have a different trust model, where control over the domain can bootstrap a connection to a DID. This makes a lot of sense for organizations with existing domain names that already transact and do business online, and can extend their brand and reputation to the domain of&nbsp;DIDs.  Ledger-based DIDs — These offer a distributed system of public key infrastructure which is not centrally managed or controlled by a single party. While ledgers differ in their governance and consensus models, they ultimately provide a backbone for anchoring digital addresses in a way which allows them to be discovered and used by other parties. This can be a useful feature where a persistent identifier is needed, such as in online communication and collaboration.  <p>There is no single DID method or type of DID (which at the moment) should be universally applied to every situation. However, by using the strengths of each approach we can allow for a diverse ecosystem of digital identifiers enabling connections between complex networks of people, organizations and machines.</p><p>To date, we’ve provided support for three main DID methods in our platform: <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">DID Key</a>, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">DID Web</a>, and <a href="https://sovrin-foundation.github.io/sovrin/spec/did-method-spec-template.html">DID Sovrin</a>. These align with three of the central types of infrastructure outlined&nbsp;above.</p> Introducing DID&nbsp;ION <p>We’re proud to announce that as of today we’ve added support for <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">DID ION</a>, a DID method which is anchored to IPFS and Bitcoin. We’ve <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree-protocol-reaches-v1-9b565cf92db3">supported the development of the Sidetree protocol</a> that underpins DID ION for some time as it has matured in collaboration with working group members at the Decentralized Identity Foundation.</p><p>With contributions from organizations such as Microsoft, Transmute, and SecureKey, <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree</a> and DID ION have emerged as a scalable and enterprise-ready solution for anchoring DIDs. The <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/decoding-the-sidetree-protocol-18d8bfa39257">core idea</a> behind the Sidetree protocol is to create decentralized identifiers that can run on any distributed ledger system. DID ION is an implementation of that protocol which backs onto the Bitcoin blockchain, one of the largest and most used public ledger networks in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Sidetree possesses some unique advantages not readily present in other DID methods, such as low cost, high throughput, and built-in portability of the identifier. This provides a number of benefits to people and organizations, especially in supporting a large volume of different kinds of connections with the ability to manage and rotate keys as needed. We have added end-to-end capabilities for creating and resolving DIDs on the ION network across our platform and wallet products.</p><p>Although DID ION is just one implementation of the Sidetree protocol, we see promise in other DID methods using Sidetree and will consider adding support for these over time as and when it makes sense. We’ll also continue to develop Sidetree in collaboration with the global standards community to ensure that this protocol and the ION Network have sustainable futures for a long time to&nbsp;come.</p><p>At the same time, the community around DID Sovrin is developing a new kind of interoperability by designing a <a href="https://hackmd.io/@icZC4epNSnqBbYE0hJYseA/S1eUS2BQw">DID method</a> that can work for vast networks of Indy ledgers, rather than focusing on the Sovrin-specific method that’s been used to date. As DID Sovrin gets phased out of adoption, we’re simultaneously deprecating standard support for DID Sovrin within MATTR VII. We’ll be phasing this out shortly with upcoming announcements for customers building on our existing platform.</p><p>If you’ve got any use cases that utilize DID Sovrin or want to discuss extensibility options, please reach out to us on any of our social channels or at info@mattr.global and we’ll be happy to work with&nbsp;you.</p> Looking ahead <p>We believe this a big step forward in providing a better set of choices when it comes to digital identity for our customers. From the start, we have designed our platform with flexibility and extensibility in mind, and will continue to support different DID methods as the market&nbsp;evolves.</p><p>We look forward to seeing how these new tools can be used to solve problems in the real world and will keep working to identify better ways to encourage responsible use of digital identity on the&nbsp;web.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/adding-did-ion-to-mattr-vii-d56bdb7a2fde">Adding DID ION to MATTR VII</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>September 15, 2021</p>
<p>Toronto, Canada</p>
<p>The partnership between Northern Block and kompany provides organizations and users of the NB Orbit platform access to the leading global corporate register network and in turn, audit-proof company information from commercial registers, financial authorities and tax offices around the world.</p>
<p>The purpose of this partnership is to enable trust network operators to increase the authenticity of legal entities that join their ecosystem. This provides the ability to engage in business with peers with confidence, while mitigating fraud risks. Through the instant access to this primary source information, the KYC/KYB process is greatly enhanced by including official information on over 115 million companies across more than 200 countries and jurisdictions.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We see an increasing demand from clients to validate legal entity data at source. So in automating access to original corporate register records, via our partnership with kompany, we are providing an additional layer of KYC &amp; KYB security.”, says Mathieu Glaude, CEO of Northern Block.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before conducting business, companies should perform sufficient due diligence to get to better know the other entity that they’re about to transact with. However, this is easier said than done. For example, in global digital commerce, in many cases companies don’t know or meet the other entity they’re going to transact with. Therefore, enabling companies to verify whether the other party unequivocally meets their policies adds a layer of trust and comfort. Increasing the authenticity of the organizations that get onboarded to trust ecosystems inherently increases the network value and aids companies.</p>
<p>Onboarding in a self-sovereign manner to digital trust ecosystems is different than in federated models. When network operators manage a trust network and an entity connects into the network and begins transacting, it’s important to ensure that you’re getting credentials from the source issuer. This is what kompany provides via its global register network: official data and documents retrieved in real-time form their original source.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Russell E. Perry, CEO and Co-Founder of kompany: “With increasing compliance and AML requirements, the veracity and source of company data have become a central point in combating money laundering and other frauds. We are, therefore, proud to provide Northern Block clients with our unparalleled access to real-time audit-proof company information, ensuring access to company information across multiple jurisdictions and helping their clients achieve improved business efficiency.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Canada is becoming a nation of digital identity. Recently, the Government of Ontario announced their <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontarios-digital-id-technology-and-standards">technology and standard choices</a> for their Digital ID Ecosystem. Digital ID is critical to the economy. The Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) estimates that the potential value that trusted digital identity could bring to the Canadian economy is at least 1 percent of Canada’s GDP, or CAD 20 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Mathieu Glaude adds, “Onboarding small businesses in a frictionless manner must be made easy. We’ve asked small businesses to do so much during Covid; and now that we’re asking them to use new digital tools, we must ensure we don’t create more friction, but instead find ways to add value to their businesses. The first step is ensuring trusted interactions.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Governments are always going to be concerned about national security.</p>



<p>China’s recent&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/china-passes-data-protection-law/">passing</a>&nbsp;of its Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) is an example of a national government recognizing that the amount of personal data collected by non-government online services and mobile apps is at the point where it can be a rich data source for a national security adversary.</p>



<p>The risk focus has moved to private enterprise and the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-the-data-economy-and-why-should-we-care/">internet economy</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">surveillance capitalism</a>&nbsp;sector of that makes national security more challenging. China recognizes this in its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dataprotectionreport.com/2021/08/pipl-a-game-changer-for-companies-in-china/">PIPL</a>, which comes into effect on November 1, 2021. President Biden recognized it in his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/biden-administration-initiatives-national-cybersecurity/">cybersecurity announcements</a>&nbsp;in July.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What this tells us is we’re all moving in the same direction. It’s not only us here at&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/">Anonyome Labs</a>&nbsp;but national governments around the globe that clearly see the national security risks of personal data storage, transfer and processing by private enterprise.</p>



<p>Surveillance capitalism is the root of the problem for every country. We’re fighting the same enemy, just in different wars.</p>



<p>Postscript: We’ll be closely following commentary and analysis of China’s new PIPL. At time of writing the full English translation had not been released. We&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/analyzing-chinas-pipl-and-how-it-compares-to-the-eus-gdpr/">know</a>&nbsp;the PIPL is broad-ranging, comprehensive, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/china-s-new-data-privacy-law-sweeping-and-serious-avoid-high-cost-noncompliance">described</a>&nbsp;as “the world’s harshest data privacy law.” It’s modelled on the&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>&nbsp;but will be stricter in its standards and penalties. The PIPL deals with personal data from national security and public interest perspectives. Together with China’s Data Security Law and Cybersecurity Law, the PIPL forms an overarching data protection&nbsp;<a href="https://fpf.org/blog/chinas-new-comprehensive-data-protection-law-context-stated-objectives-key-provisions/">framework</a>.&nbsp;</p>

We encourage the $OCEAN ecosystem to apply or reapply AND to vote! Thank you to all of the participants, voters, and proposers.</p> OceanDAO Round 10 Announcements and Guidelines  Round 10 Information <p>There is $530,000 USD in grant funding available in Round 10. The max request limit per proposal has now changed. Please find more details&nbsp;below:</p><p>Please Note: The amount requested is in USD, but the amount paid is in OCEAN token. The conversion rate is the market price on the Proposal Submission Deadline (October 5th at midnight GMT). This determines how many OCEAN will be awarded if a proposal is voted to receive a&nbsp;grant.</p><p>A total of $100,000, or approx. 19%, of “Total Round Funding Available” is earmarked for New Projects. Earmarked proposals are eligible for entire “Total Round Funding Available”; returning (general) grants are eligible for the remaining $430,000, or approx.&nbsp;81%.</p><p>As a builder, submit your project proposal on the <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/round-10/69">Round 10 Ocean Port Forum</a>. As a voter, this is where you can see all the expanded proposal details to make an informed vote decision.</p><p>Additionally, you can check out the OceanDAO <a href="https://bit.ly/Round10Proposals">Round 10 Proposal Submission Dashboard</a> to see all the proposals in one place as they are submitted.</p><p>The grant proposals from the <a href="http://vote.oceanprotocol.com">snapshot ballot</a> that meet these criteria are selected to receive their Funding Amount Requested (in OCEAN) to foster positive value creation for the overall Ocean Protocol ecosystem.</p> Project Levels &amp; Funding&nbsp;Tiers <p>To improve funding effectiveness, OceanDAO continues to increase access to funding. After the introduction of the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standing Dashboard</a>, teams have been working to reconcile their grant deliverables, and complete their proposals.</p><p>To continue incentivising completion and outcomes, we are introducing Project Levels, which can be acquired by Teams delivering on their grant promises. Below are the Funding Tiers accessible by projects for OceanDAO Grants Round&nbsp;10.</p>  Teams applying for their first time — $20,000&nbsp;USD  Teams who have completed 1–2 proposals — $20,000&nbsp;USD  Teams who have completed 3+ proposals — $50,000&nbsp;USD  <p>Make sure to update your Project Deliverables to remain in a good standing, and to continue accessing larger grant amounts. Important note: existing Projects will only be able to participate in the Voting process if their project is in a “Completed” or “Funds Returned” standing.</p> Project Standings &gt; 1Team-1Proposal <p>A key focus in OceanDAO is improving ROI Transparency. With the introduction of [<a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standings</a>], each project reconciles their grant deliverables and outcomes with the DAO to access greater funding. This process naturally leads teams towards reconciling their deliverables, and continue building.</p><p>Therefore, the introduction of [Project Standings] enables [1Team-1Proposal] rules to be deprecated.</p><p>This design review originated from various discussions with Ambassadors and the larger OceanDAO community.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p> Introducing DREAM (Dynamic Resource Entitlement and Access Management) 
<p>Paradigm for managing all access of everyone and everything to all resources consistently in a multi-cloud multi-hybrid environment. Policy-based, automated, consuming the current state of services &amp; infrastructure. Shifting from identity &amp; security siloes to a holistic, integrated concept. Start tactically now with CIEM, PAM, etc., but go on to strategic measures.</p>
<p>Managing identities, managing entitlements, and managing access has become way more complex than ever before, in dynamic, multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT environments. In the past, servers and applications were rather static, and entitlements too were static. But this has changed. Entitlements and access in today’s cloud environments are dynamic, just like workloads.</p>
<p>Additionally, most organizations must deal with a multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT. Different clouds, such as Microsoft Azure, AWS, or GCP, are very different in the way they deal with and manage identities, resources, access, and entitlements. With private clouds, managed IT, Edge Computing, and on-premises IT, different approaches on delivering IT are there to be managed, all different in the technology as well as the split between provider and tenant responsibilities.</p>
 Security as Code Can’t Be the Answer 
<p>However, the answer can’t be in security as code, because this would require developers to care for security (and infrastructure management), instead of setting the focus on their specialized skills and letting them work on what they are best in. The answer also can’t be in having specialized solutions for different parts of the IT environment, such as cloud-only approaches. Organizations need a comprehensive approach, covering the breadth and depth of their multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT reality.</p>
<p>DREAM takes this broader approach, beyond just cloud-focused management of entitlements and access, looking at all types of identities, workloads, and all elements of IT. Additionally, DREAM is well-integrated with SODAS and BASIS, delivering a comprehensive set of methods and models for moving to agile delivery of secure services in multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT environments.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 1: DREAM integrates security &amp; identity across all parts of multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT environments, closely aligned and integrated with service development, delivery &amp; operations as well as infrastructure management &amp; operations (KuppingerCole SODAS).</p>
 Cloud-First Approach Will not Lead to a Uniform Environment 
<p>As outlined, most organizations today have a mix of different types of IT. While “cloud first” is a valid strategy, it will not lead to a uniform environment. While the ratio of cloud workloads will (and must) grow over time, it will be multi-cloud and thus not uniform. Edge Computing appeared as a response to the need to shift workloads back closer to the on-premise environment. However, there was a reason for private clouds to appear, as well as for keeping parts of IT on-premises.</p>
<p>In manufacturing and other industries, on-premises IT will never disappear. Multi-cloud, multi-hybrid is the reality, here to stay. It will differ in the ratios of what is done where, but it will not disappear for many organizations, and the shift will be slow (slower than frequently expected) and gradual for most organizations.</p>
<p>This requires, as described in KuppingerCole SODAS (Secure Operations &amp; Development of Agile Services), an integrated approach to development, infrastructure management, operations, and security &amp; identity. DREAM focuses on the Security &amp; Identity layer within that concept and how to manage identities, entitlements, and access uniformly across the entire IT, powered by policy-based automation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 2: DREAM focuses on IAM, including CIEM, Access Governance, and PAM, as well as Cybersecurity and SOAR, and aligns with the other elements of a modern IT stack for delivering agile, secure services.</p>
 Managing Identities and Entitlements with the DREAM Approach 
<p>DREAM is an approach for managing all types of identities, both human and non-human. Human identities span everyone from the consumer to the employee, while non-human identities cover devices, things, services, resources, etc., as well as the complex relationships between the various types of identities.</p>
<p>DREAM focuses on managing entitlements and unifying this management across different environments such as the various public clouds, private clouds, VM (virtual machine) environments, and servers in traditional IT.</p>
<p>Based on a comprehensive , uniform approach, it puts identity and security in one responsibility and a unified technical solution, also enabling consistent governance across the entire IT environment. This also includes supporting modern concepts such as SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) that build on SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), and monitoring what happens in terms of security across all of IT as well as reacting to this.</p>
 DREAM Integrates CIEM, IGA, IAM, and PAM 
<p>DREAM also integrates concepts such as the evolving concept of CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management), IGA (Identity Governance &amp; Administration) as part of IAM (Identity &amp; Access Management), and PAM (Privileged Access Management) for supporting every identity, every entitlement, and the access across the entire breadth and depth of IT.</p>
<p>This requires utilizing information about the state of services, applications, resources, identities, etc. It builds on virtual repositories that gather and expose that information so that it can be analyzed – this is where AI &amp; ML come into play – and policy-based automation of the entire management of identities and security then build on these repositories.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 3: The key actions to take in delivering to the DREAM model.</p>
<p>To move forward with DREAM, the first step is – if not already done – the de-siloing of IT. Don’t treat cloud differently from on-premises or private clouds. Don’t split responsibilities. Workloads might run here or there, they will shift. For application and service delivers, you need a unified approach. You need it even more for comprehensive, strong security and efficient management of identities and access, and, last but not least, for (access) governance, complying with regulations, and mitigating risks. This initial step also requires a portfolio assessment and gap analysis, to understand what you have, what you need in addition, and what you should best retire.</p>
<p>From there, based on a vision involving the KuppingerCole models for Identity Fabrics and Security Fabrics, you need to define the target architecture, a roadmap that evolves over time, the guardrails, and the policies and processes.</p>
 Running DREAM Environments 
<p>Roll-out should be tactical and phased, focusing on fixing the critical challenges first. This might include opting for a specialized CIEM solution first (even while most already go well beyond cloud only, and beyond infrastructure entitlements only) to fix the pressing challenges of managing entitlements and access in the dynamic, volatile cloud environments.</p>
<p>But all should be done with the vision and target architecture in mind, not as tactical, isolated, non-integrated activities. DREAM will evolve continually. For more efficient management, and again being part of unification as described in KuppingerCole BASIS, this also involves shifting delivery of traditional workloads to a service model – making your traditional IT work as if it were another cloud.</p>
<p>In running DREAM environments, policy-based automation is at the core. It is about shifting to well-defined policies (proposed and optimized by AI and ML) that work on the dynamic data, instead of manual administration. This limits errors and increases speed in responding to permanent changes in the agile IT of today. It is also the foundation for governance and consistent security operations, and automated response across the IT environments.</p>
<p>Guiding principles for DREAM:</p>
 
 Business requests IT Services 
 Unified view on IT Services – one IT, across multi-hybrid, multi-cloud environments 
 Policy-based automation instead of manual administration or coding 
 Development is agile, consuming identity &amp; security APIs, delivering status/requirements back to central repositories, and to the operations management to be ready supporting new and changing applications and services 
 Automation of identity, security and infrastructure setup &amp; management 
 
<p>Our recommendation is to think beyond solutions that cover just multi-cloud, but integrate across multi-cloud multi-hybrid IT. Focus also on integration with the IAM and PAM (Privileged Access Management) infrastructure you have in place. Look at the overarching DevSecOps (<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/devsecops-sodas-secure-operations-development-of-agile-services">KuppingerCole SODAS</a>) model; and the model for agile service delivery in a modern, multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT (<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/it-for-the-digital-age-introducing-basis-business-driven-agile-secure-it-as-a-service">KuppingerCole BASIS</a>) for a comprehensive approach.</p>

We’ve all heard the refrain….no-one cares about privacy anymore. I confess, that sometimes I feel the same way, particularly when I see my own family members oblivious to what they are sharing. I’ve even done it myself. Then I realise that it’s not that they don’t care about data privacy, it’s just they don’t have any agency to do anything about it.




 




I recently gave a talk at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021">Kuppinger Cole European Identity Conference 2021</a> so had cause to dig into this question afresh. If the newspaper and magazine headlines are anything to go by then data privacy is still very much a live issue.




 





  





 




But what about real people? Surely there must be some examples that would help. I looked at two recent events that could act as a litmus test of public sentiment. The first was Apple’s decision as part of its update to iOS 14.5 that allowed users, for the first time, to control whether or not to allow apps to track their data.




 





  





 




Pretty convincing data but maybe it was skewed towards Apple users. Maybe if I looked at something more serious like helping to fight the Covid pandemic, I’d see a completely different picture?




 





  





 




According to the latest Edelman Trust Barometer, even fighting a Global pandemic is not sufficient reason to share data. The willingness to share data to Governments to help contain Covid has actually decreased over the last 12 months. Perhaps not surprising given how some Governments have not been too adept in handling privacy concerns<a>[1]</a>.&nbsp; Finally, I was convinced by some latest research by KPMG – <a href="https://advisory.kpmg.us/articles/2021/bridging-the-trust-chasm.html">Corporate Data Responsibility</a> – in August 2021. The research was conducted in the US but I suspect can be translated across the world. One set of statistics stood out:




 





  





 




The compelling data and research suggest that my original question now needs to be reframed. People most certainly do care about their data privacy. The question now is: how are organisations going to bridge this data privacy chasm?




 




This a real opportunity for organisations to step up and take a lead. An opportunity for organisations to action rebuilding trust and becoming data sustainable for the future. There are some immediate steps every organisation should start with:




 




• Analyse your own ethics around data collection and use. Consider implementing a code of data ethics.




 




•  Be transparent and explicit around data collection and use and do it in a way that is upfront, easy and clear for everyone to understand.




 




•  Consider using privacy enhancing technologies to anonymise data or make use of synthetic data.




 




•  Give people access and control over their data empowering them to gain value and equity by sharing.




 




People openly admit they don’t know how to protect their personal data and they are rightly peeved that organisations aren’t doing much to help.




 




Take the lead now in establishing corporate data responsibility.




 




<a href="https://www.meeco.me/">Meeco</a> can help provide the infrastructure you need to bridge the data privacy chasm.

<p>AERGONAUTS And KLAYswap: The Great Listing: What Does This Mean For AERGONAUTS?</p><p>AERGO, one of the largest hybrid blockchains based out of South Korea, is going to be listed on KLAYswap, a decentralized crypto asset finance protocol that enables users to provide liquidity and garner rewards. KLAYswap is a complete and automated on-chain swap protocol that operates and leverages on-chain liquidity pools. Liquidity is guaranteed through automated market making mechanisms. KLAYswap enables on-chain swap services for any KLAY or KCT-type token cryptocurrency to become a liquid provider and earn passive income from transaction fee commissions. For AERGOnauts, this enables AERGO token holders to participate in a passive income paradigm simply by utilizing the KLAYswap platform. Now how does this on-chain swap work, it is enabled through a specific innovation, known as the Orbit&nbsp;Bridge.</p><p>On KLAYswap, ERC-20 tokens can be transferred throughout the Klaytn ecosystem via a technological innovation known as the Orbit Bridge, a transparent and immutable bridge built on Orbit Chain which in return offers yield farming with assets that were previously disconnected and unable to communicate with one another before the inception of such an innovation. KLAYswap is built on one of the most prominent and secure blockchain protocols within the realm of cryptocurrency, the Klaytn ecosystem, which was created by Kakao. Kakao is one of the most publicly traded Fin-Tech companies in South Korea and has a market capitalization of approximately 30 billion dollars. KakaoTalk is utilized by over 90% of the South Korean populace and KakaoTaxi is the most widely used transportation service throughout the country. AERGO, with a massive foothold within South Korea, has been successfully able to partner with Klaytn and through this partnership, AERGO will have increased liquidity, immutability and the ability for investors to garner passive income by participating in liquidity pools on the&nbsp;network.</p>AERGO And KLAYswap: The Specifics Of The&nbsp;Event<p>The AERGO Listing: What This Means For AERGONAUTS and The Klay Community: The Great&nbsp;Airdrop</p><p>AERGO is one of the largest blockchains within South Korea, with an extremely development team that has been actively been working with KLAYswap and Orbit Bridge. Today, we’re excited to announce that AERGO will be listed on KLAYswap and an airdrop event will occur as a result of this enhancement of liquidity on KLAYswap! The KAERGO-KLAY LP will airdrop over 300,000 KAERGO tokens to all liquidity providers of the KAERGO-KLAY LP. Wallets that provide liquidity to the KAERGO-KLAY pools will be distributed KAERGO on the basis of the share ratio of that specific wallet. AERGONAUTS will notice that KAERGO is linked to the Orbit Bridge chain that enhances interoperability and communication between chains that have been integrated into the platform; this includes AERGO. KAERGO is the Klaytn version of AERGO, the native token of the AERGO platform that has been bridged over to the Klaytn ecosystem through the utilization of Orbit&nbsp;Bridge.</p><p>Participation In The Airdrop: Active Community Involvement: How And When To Connect To&nbsp;KLAYswap</p>AERGO Community Members, No Matter The Size Of Your Holdings: Can Participate In This Airdrop Based On The Instructions Below<p>The way for community members to participate in the airdrop is as follows. It is necessary to provide liquidity to the KAERGO-KLAY liquidity pool to receive the airdrop during the event period. To provide liquidity to the KAERGO-KLAY pool, you must have one of those two assets and both can be converted to Klaytn Network assets using the Orbit Bridge. The airdrop event will start on September 16th and end on October 15th and will drop 300,000 Aergo Tokens. Below is a guide to assist you with providing liquidity on the KLAYswap protocol.</p><p>Provide Liquidity To The KAERGO-KLAY Pool</p><p>This liquidity measure will depend on the coins you have in your wallet, you may choose KAERGO-KLAY as options.

<p>This summer, we’ve been iterating through an article intended to talk
about the success that Blockchain Commons has had working with the Wyoming
legislature to help to define a first-in-the-country legal definition
of digital identity.</p>

<p>The Digital Identity Working Group for the Wyoming Select Committee on
Blockchain meets again next week, on September 21-22, 2021. I will be
providing testimony there at 2pm MST. As a result, we’ve decided to
release the current draft of this article on digital identity and how
Wyoming has defined it using Principal Authority, with the goal of
helping to shape the agenda for digital identity for the next year,
both in Wyoming and elsewhere.</p>

<p>—Christopher Allen</p>

 

<p>In 2016, I wrote <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">“The Path to Self-Sovereign
Identity”</a>
to talk about the historic evolution from centralized identity to
user-centric identity and to define the next step: a self-sovereign
digital identity that was controlled by the user, not some third party.
In it I also offered <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/self-sovereign-identity-principles.md">10 Self-Sovereign Identity
Principles</a>
which have been widely accepted by the decentralized identity community.</p>

<p>Self-sovereign identity has matured and grown considerably since, as I
chronicled in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/self-sovereign-identity-five-years-on">“Self-Sovereign Identity: Five Years
On”</a>.
There are now specifications, products, and entire companies supporting
the concept. However, recent legal efforts to define self-sovereign
identity may be just as important for catapulting it into the mass
market.</p>

 Defining Identity 

<p>Defining identity is by no means easy. That core topic could encompass a
paper much longer than this. The following are some various definitions
of identity drawn from the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot10-buenosaires/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/glossary-primer.md">RWOT
Glossary</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Identifier: A label that refers to an entity and can be used to establish or maintain an identity. For example, a name or UID.</p>

  <p>Identity: A conceptual construct that enables the differentiation between distinct entities that are individually considered to be unique, but which may possess class or group characteristics. An identity gives these entities the ability to interact as peers in collaborative or competitive ways. It is not the entity that it represents.</p>

  <p>Identity, Digital: A digital representation of an entity, managed by digital tools, over which that entity has personal or delegated control.</p>

  <p>Identity, Functional: How we recognize, remember and respond to specific people and things.</p>

  <p>SSI: Self-sovereign identity. A decentralized digital identity that does not depend on any centralized authority and whose information is portable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Digital identity is just one aspect of a complex, interconnected web of
different digital models. It’s not the same thing as identification
(where you prove you are a distinct entity with unique characteristics),
authentication (where you prove you were the same entity as before), or
personal data (which is information related to an identified or
identifiable entity).</p>

<p>Those other elements all need to be considered, but it’s digital
identity, and now self-sovereign identity, that gives us the linchpin to
do so.</p>

 Turning Digital Identity into Law 

<p>For self-sovereign identity to truly achieve international success, I
feel that it needs to not just be embraced by the technological sector,
but also to have a basis in law. In recent years, I’ve been progressing
toward that goal through work with various state and national
legislatures.</p>

<p>Collaborating with the Wyoming legislature has borne the first fruit.
This year they passed
<a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0039">SF0039</a> on digital
identity, which the Governor signed into law and which went into effect
on July 1, 2021. It defines digital identity as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(xviii) “Personal digital identity” means the intangible digital
representation of, by and for a natural person, over which he has
principal authority and through which he intentionally communicates or
acts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So where’s the self-sovereign identity in that?</p>

<p>As with much legislation, it’s all about the careful selection of words.</p>

 Defining Principal Authority 

<p>To understand how Principal Authority relates to self-sovereign identity
requires insight into what Principal Authority is. The concept comes out
of English Common law. It appears in most Commonwealth countries but has
also found its way into the laws of other countries, including the
United States. It’s primarily used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency">Laws of
Agency</a>, an area of
commercial law where an agent is empowered to take on certain tasks.</p>

<p>As the name would suggest, Principal Authority first requires a
Principal: a person or entity. It then requires that entity have
Authority: some power. Principal Authority is thus the power derived
from a person or entity, which they can use or which they can delegate
out to others. When applied to digital identity, Principal Authority
says that a Principal has Authority over his identity — which is a clear
restatement of self-sovereign principles.</p>

<p>In fact, the recognition of a Principal is itself a statement of the
first of the principles of self-sovereign identity: existence. It
asserts that digital identity is always a representation of an actual
entity, who predates any digital representation, and who is also the
first and foremost beneficiary of that representation.</p>

<p>However, in drawing on the Laws of Agency, the concepts of Principal and
Principal Authority go beyond that. Because the person at the heart of
an identity has the ultimate power to control the self-sovereign digital
representation that they’ve created (and/or that they use), this means
that any others who exert Principal Authority over that identity data
are doing so only as agents of the Principal.</p>

<p>By focusing on Agency, the concept of Principal Authority also ensures
that the Principal always has the ability to revoke their delegation to
the agents whom they have temporarily offered Authority regarding their
identity. This is a requirement for other self-sovereign principles such
as portability, and it’s a real necessity in the digital world, where
we might need to delete personal data or to cancel Terms &amp; Conditions
that we signed without real, informed consent.</p>

<p>Altogether, this new definition of Principal Authority adds a lot of
nuance to self-sovereign identity, and much of that comes thanks to the
implicit incorporation of Agency.</p>

 Defining Control 

<p>In saying that a Principal has the ultimate authority to control their
digital identity, care also needs to be taken to define what that
control means. It means that a Principal has (or can delegate) the
Principal Authority to identify as that identity; to authenticate as
that identity; and to know the contents of the data held by that
identity.</p>

<p>However, any digital identity also exists as part of a larger ecosystem,
and the Principal does not have control over the larger ecosystem. They
cannot control how other entities rate, rank, or note the reputation
of their identity; and they cannot control comments, flags, or other
notes that other entities might attach to their identity.</p>

<p>Further, a Principal cannot necessarily prevent other entities from
creating new digital identities related to them, which may or may not
link to an existing identity. (Though states are increasingly
recognizing the limits of voluntary disclosure of information, digital
identity laws will ultimately never prevent a police station from
creating their own identity record related to a criminal, or a civic
authority from creating government-related identity records.)</p>

<p>In other words, self-sovereign identity, and the establishment of
Principal Authority over it, lays down boundaries for what the Principal
controls — boundaries that are much wider than those established for
digital identities controlled by third parties. However, those
boundaries still exist.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, control of a digital identity means that the Principal
can expect to maintain the continuity of that identity for as long as
they see fit, but in doing so must accept the battle scars inflicted by
interactions in a larger ecosystem that are implicit to the identity
itself.</p>

 Agents &amp; Their Duty 

<p>The ability to delegate Principal Authority, as revealed by the Laws of
Agency, may be as crucial to self-sovereign identity as the concept of a
Principal itself. It allows the empowerment of agents by a Principal —
who might be physical agents or, in the increasingly digital world,
virtual agents. But, it also institutes the core requirement that those
agents be working for the good of the Principal when they are exerting
Principal Authority over the identity holder’s identity data.</p>

<p>This concept of “duty” is crucial to the Laws of Agency. Duty requires
that an Agent only use their delegated Principal Authority as the
Principal requests, in a way that benefits the Principal, and with care
and due diligence, while frequently reporting back what they’ve done.</p>

<p>This is a notable change from the way that digital identities have been
treated traditionally. Compare that to banks, who represent you in
financial transactions, and then sell your spending data; compare that
to Facebook, who collects as much personally identifiable data and other
information as you’re willing to give them, then sells that to
advertisers; or compare it to Google, who infers personally identifiable
and demographic data based on the information you input into their tools
and the choices you make. In large part, you don’t even know what these
identity representatives and data holders are doing. In the world before
<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">Europe’s GDPR</a> or <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California’s
CCPA</a>, you had little input into their
actions. Even now, with those early and rough attempts to protect
digital self-sovereignty, you’re typically opting-out, not opting-in —
which is barely agency at all —&nbsp;and you’re still not protected against
people who are self-serving nor those who are inferring information from
scattered pieces of data.</p>

<p>That’s because any duties currently required of the entities to whom you
grant agency over your data are quite minimal. Maybe there’s a duty of
privacy, maybe there’s a duty of safety, but in general they don’t need
to work in your best interest. That’s why we need to ensure that new
definitions of digital identity, particularly self-sovereign identity,
follow the Laws of Agency in ways that our current systems do not.</p>

<p>This sort of agent agreement needs to be part of delegation. To date,
this has been true to a limited extent with federation protocols such as
SAML and Oauth, but that needs to be extended to every person. Wyoming’s
digital-identity law is the first example of legislation that focuses on
Agency in this way, and that’s much of its power.</p>

<p>However, this isn’t a simple issue. Even with Agency-focused
legislation, we need to determine a source for duties. This article will
try to outline some of them, using not just the traditional duties of
agents, but also the self-sovereign principles themselves. However, it’s
a mere starting point, with a stronger legal foundation required.</p>

 Principal Authority &amp; The State 

<p>Before defining duties, it’s important to note one other interesting
element of Principal Authority and its foundation in Agency: it focuses
not just on a single person’s authority, but also on their ability to
delegate to and require duties from other entities. In other words, it’s
a peer-to-peer relationship; this relationship works within the context
of a state who recognizes the concept of Principal Authority, respects
its ability to enable Agency, and enforces its established duties.</p>

<p>However, though the state is involved, this peer-to-peer relationship
still lies in stark contrast to traditional property law, where property
is always in some way beholden to the state: the state might be the
original source for property, they might be able to reclaim it by
eminent domain, and they might be able to seize it through asset
forfeiture. Those ideas all run counter to the idea of self-sovereignty
— which is yet another reason that we choose to focus on the Agency of
Principal Authority, not property law, as the core legal metaphor for
self-sovereign identity.</p>

 Restating the Self-Sovereign Principles 

<p>The use of Principal Authority to empower self-sovereign identity
provides a legal foothold for many of my original 10 principles.</p>

<p>What follows is a restatement of the self-sovereign principles that
reorganizes the original ten as rights and duties that are suggested by
customs, expectations, and best practices, but which need to be better
codified to become true duties. It also proposes five additional duties
that could come from customs implicit in the Laws of Agency.</p>

<p>Together, these ideas may allow us to both better understand how to turn
the self-sovereign principles into concrete usage and also to more
easily translate them into duties bound by legislation.</p>

 The Rights of Self-Sovereign Authority 

<p>Some principles of self-sovereign identity are implicit in the idea of
a Principal.</p>

 
   Existence. The definition of Principal requires that there be a real entity at an identity’s heart. 
   Control. The definition of Principal Authority says that the Principal always retains control of an identity, within specifically defined boundaries, no matter who is holding it at a particular time. 
   Persistence. Because of their uncontested Principal Authority, a Principal may decide to have an identity last for as long as they see fit. 
   Consent. Anything that happens within the defined boundaries of the digital identity is implicitly with the consent of the Principal, who may delegate or revoke Principal Authority at any time. 
 

<p>Self-sovereign rights recognize that an identity exists to benefit its
Principal. These core principles likely derive explicitly from a
definition of digital identity such as that created by the Wyoming
legislature.</p>

 The Duties of Self-Sovereign Identity 

<p>The remaining principles of self-sovereign identity can be stated as
duties owed to a Principal by an agent who has been granted Principal
Authority over an identity for certain purposes.</p>

 
   Access. An agent must provide the Principal with access to data related to their digital identity. 
   Transparency. An agent must be open about how they will administer a digital identity. 
   Portability. An agent must make a digital identity portable upon the request of the Principal. 
   Interoperability. An agent must use standard, interoperable protocols when making an identity portable, and should also use those interoperable protocols when interacting with other identity systems. 
   Minimization. An agent must minimize the data collected, stored, transmitted, and shared regarding an identity so that it only includes data that is strictly necessary in the context of a request made by the Principal. 
   Protection. An agent must place the protection of the identity above their own needs or desires. 
 

<p>Identity duties says that agents will tell you how they’re using your
identity, use it in the most minimalist way possible, and make it easy
for you to reclaim the identity. However, legislation may be required to
turn these best practices into duties bound by law.</p>

 The Duties of Self-Sovereign Agents 

<p>The idea of Principal Authority itself suggests additional duties that
were not included on the original list of principles of self-sovereign
identity, but which are generally defined in the Laws of Agency to be
due from agents to Principals.</p>

 
   Specificity. An Agent will use Principal Authority to serve specific tasks as instructed by the Principal, or as required by Custom, and do nothing more with an identity. 
   Responsibility. An agent will serve those tasks with reasonable care and skill, with due diligence, and without further delegation. 
   Representation. An agent will act in the best interests of the Principal, without secret profit, and will not take on other responsibilities that might conflict with that. 
   Fidelity. An agent will serve those tasks in good faith. 
   Disclosure. An agent will maintain accounts and report their actions back to the Principal. 
 

<p>Agent duties say that agents will be trustworthy in their use of your
identity. These duties are more likely to implicitly be a part of any
legislation that was built atop the Laws of Agency.</p>

 Taking the Next Steps 

<p>Wyoming’s definition of personal digital identity helps us to lay more
foundation for self-sovereign identity, but it’s still just a starting
point.</p>

<p>There’s more to do.</p>

 Laws of Custom 

<p>To start with, the Laws of Agency are largely built on Laws of Custom,
which are as likely to be common law as any formally codified
legislation. When creating new laws related to self-sovereign identity,
we’ll be creating new Laws of Customs for the digital frontier, an area
that’s so fresh that the tradition of customs has been limited.</p>

<p>This creates real challenges, as we must decide what customs we want to
create and then we must develop them from common law to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customary_law">legal
customs</a> to (eventually)
codified duties. We can integrate these with the Laws of Agency, and we
can figure out how that interrelates with old common laws such as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_(law)">Use Laws</a>. We may even need
special courts to set these common laws and achieve remedies, such as
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Chancery">Court of
Chancery</a>.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, there’s a lot of work to be done here; recognizing the
existence of a Principal and the use of delegatable Principal Authority
bound by the Laws of Agency is just a starting place. New customs, even
though understood as best practices, will not automatically become legal
duties.</p>

 Open Questions 

<p>Beyond that, I’m not a lawyer. There may be other legal elements that
can support our definition of digital identity. Are there additional
duties that we could bring in? Are there fiduciary or agency laws that
we could leverage? Are there other legal models of interest we can draw
from, such as the UNCITRAL Model Law of Electronic Commerce approach,
which says that “The actions, promises, rights and obligations of a
person shall not be denied legal validity on the sole ground they are
effectuated through their digital identity”? These possibilities need to
be studied, preferably with the help of legal experts.</p>

<p>Even once we’ve fully defined digital identity, we still must consider
how digital identity may need to be more carefully protected. Are there
ways we can give specific protection to private keys used for signatures
and to express authority? Can we protect against the theft of private
keys that might allow impersonation or false witness? Can we prevent the
misuse of digital biometric or genetic information? Can we protect
against other “crimes of authority”?</p>

<p>There’s also a flipside: digital identity should give us some new
advantages not found in traditional identity. For example, there have
always been problems with individuals with low market power being at a
disadvantage when negotiating with larger parties. Can new digital
identity laws help start to resolve that imbalance?</p>

 Final Notes 

<p>One of the most important steps going forward will be to continue
working with the Digital Identity subcommittee in the Wyoming
legislature. However, I’d also welcome discussions with other states and
nations, to ensure that we have great definitions of digital identity
that support self-sovereign identity everywhere.</p>

<p>If this is important to you too, consider <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">supporting Blockchain
Commons</a> to make this a
reality.</p>

 

 Offering Some Thanks 

<p>This article was written by Christopher Allen with Shannon Appelcline.
Thanks to commentators who made time to talk to us about it, including
Joe Andrieu, Dazza Greenwood, and Clare Sullivan. (Our conclusions are
ours; they may or may not agree with them.)</p>

<p>Many thanks to Wyoming State Senator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Rothfuss">Chris
Rothfuss</a> who invited me
to join the Wyoming Digital Identity subcommittee and to the others
members of the Digital Identity subcommittee in the Wyoming legislature,
including Brittany Kaiser, Carla Reyes, Diedrich Henning, Scott David,
and once more Clare Sullivan and Dazza Greenwood. Thanks to their hard
work, Wyoming now offers the first definitions of personal digital
identity in the United States, laying the foundation for these
additional ideas.</p>

  <p>The reason to use biometrics as a form of identity is because they are unique, unchanging and are the one direct and unequivocal link to an individual. But what if these identifiers are compromised? This is not a hypothetical scenario as the U.S. Office of Personnel Management breach sadly taught us several years ago. For years, this has been a conundrum in the world of biometrics - to store the data in a centralized system that has to be protected or choose device-based biometrics that are not linked to a vetted physical identity. In this never-ending loop of having to choose between privacy and security, we as a society have ended up with neither. This is about to change.<br><br>There are multiple forces now converging, that are driving serious attention and urgency to solve this problem as never before - continued, massive data breaches, skyrocketing use of biometrics and the emergence of far-reaching privacy and data protection laws that put the onus on protecting personal data on the private sector.<br><br>Owning personal data, and especially biometrics, has become a hot potato. Noone wants to hold it, but it is necessary for doing business. Consumers on the other hand are asking for more control. As a result, we are seeing new frameworks emerge, frameworks that go beyond blockchain and take into account the need for holistic, decentralized identity management that binds a rooted identity to a trusted authentication key that cannot be stolen, lost or circumvented by fraudsters operating under assumed identities with stolen PII.<br><br>Join us as we take you through a journey of what these new frameworks look like and the new possibilities that emerge when there is no binary choice to be made between privacy and security. It will finally be possible to have both.</p>

<p>Enterprise hiring in the time of Covid is putting greater emphasis on supporting remote on boarding of new employees. This creates new challenges for the IAM team as it is no longer self evident that new contractors and employees to show up at a physical helpdesk, provide ID and pick up their new accounts. How do you organize the remote onboarding and are there technologies and approaches that are used in digital customer onboarding and KYC processes that can be leveraged to also handle employee onboarding?<br> <br> Another important aspect is that remote working has become the norm and securing the remote connections is critical. A big part of that effort is to implement MFA at scale but in this situation how do you handle the roll out of the MFA when the users are not present in the office?</p>




<p>How do you support remote onboarding at scale?<br> How do you roll out MFA to a 100 000 people organisation?<br> What is the future for remote onboarding of contractors and employees?</p>

  <p>Hybrid IT environments are full of secrets, like tokens, passwords, certificates and encryption keys that open access to mission-critical information. The emergence of concepts like Zero Trust authentication, Just-in-Time access and Zero Standing Privileges suggests that these access secrets don’t need to be permanent. Instead they can be created on the fly and made to expire automatically, paving way for the future where secrets or passwords no longer need to be managed and vaulted at all.</p>
<p>SSH.COM's CTO, Miikka Sainio, explores how reducing the number of permanent secrets enterprises manage in dynamic environments improves security, operational velocity cost-efficiency. He also discusses why managing and vaulting secrets is still a necessary phase in many cases when companies adopt modern and future-proof methods.</p>

<p>Access Management is a crucial capability in the IT infrastructure of any Enterprise. But it is even further crucial, when the whole application landscape is integrated, i.e., more than 1,800 applications used by millions of users. Back in 2017 we modernized the existing access infrastructure and set up ForgeRock as its successor on-premises in our data center. With rising demands regarding availability, scalability, and support for market-specific customizations, as well as more products and applications are going to the cloud, it became increasingly clear that project will have to cloudify its infrastructure and application stack. The future setup should follow modern paradigms like GitOps, Everything as Code and making use of highly automated processes based on Service Layers, all whilst keeping the integrated applications up and running and migrating the product stack to the AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud.</p>
<p>Key Takeaways:</p>




<p>- How does a target architecture look like<br> - What challenges will appear when it comes to the migration<br> - How to ensure the migration to the cloud, whilst minimizing the effect for all integrated applications</p>

Each pico also has persistent identity and availability for a cloud-native developer experience. Picos are DIDComm-enabled agents supporting SSI. Consequently, picos are capable of running specialized application protocols for any given workflow in a secure, cryptographic environment. The architecture of picos makes them independent of the runtime they executed on, holding out hope of a decentralized SSI agency. This talk introduces picos, demonstrates their DIDComm capabilities, and presents a roadmap for building a decentralized SSI agency, independent of any particular organization.</p>

  <p>As organizations expand their cloud footprint to accelerate innovation and digital transformation, increased security risks pose an imminent and elevated threat to their growing cloud presence. The market is overwhelmed with numerous security technologies, approaches and frameworks for securing an organization’s cloud adoption journey, but security leaders and architects must meticulously assess the security risks associated with their cloud usage, migration patterns and digital interactions with customers, employees and partners to suite their business requirements and cloud security priorities.</p>
<p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) remains one of the key security disciplines to support digital transformation and cloud adoption objectives, by not only providing a secure identity and access foundation for the user, device and cloud-service types but also by offering additional cloud-specific security provisions that include cloud access management, cloud entitlement management, cloud privileged access and cloud access governance to its evolving technology portfolio.</p>
<p>In this session, we will discuss the important security tenets of an organization's cloud adoption program and how effective IAM architecture and planning can help navigate CISOs and security leaders through their cloud adoption journey.</p>

  <p>The harm that the misuse of AI/ML can have is obvious, from the ProPublica Recidivism piece from 2016 to the latest discovery of bias in facial recognition classifiers by Joy Buolamwini.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The need for tools to use AI/ML ethically is concentrated in two particular areas: transparency and fairness. Transparency involves knowing why an ML system came to the conclusion that it did—something that is essential if we are to identity bias. In some forms of ML, this is difficult. We’ll cover two tools to assist with transparency: LIME and SHAP. We’ll highlight where each of these tools performs well and poorly, and provide recommendations for utilizing them in unison where appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once transparency is established, we’ll pause to evaluate potential sources of bias that would affect the fairness of a particular algorithm. Here the number of tools available is far-reaching. We’ll start with an explanation of bias metrics, explaining the roles that true/false positives and true/false negatives play in calculating various accuracy metrics. The basics of fairness established, then we will explore various tools used against a few, publicly available sample ML implementations. Tools in this review will include: Aequitas, AIF360, Audit-AI, FairML, Fairness Comparison, Fairness Measures, FairTest, Themis™, and Themis-ML. We’ll compare these tools, providing recommendations on their usage and profiling their strengths and weaknesses.</p>

 DIDComm is the messaging protocol implemented in Hyperledger Aries that provides utility for DID-based relationships. Many may think DIDComm is just a way to exchange credentials, but it's more than that. DIDComm is a protocol layer capable of supporting specialized application protocols for any given workflow. Because of its general nature and inherent support for self-sovereign relationships, DIDComm provides a basis for a self-sovereign internet, a secure internet overlay, that is much more private, enabling, and flexible than the one we've built using Web 2.0 technologies. This talk introduces Autonomic Identity Architectures, describes DIDComm, discusses its protocological nature, and presents use cases in the Internet of Things.&nbsp;

  <p>Denmark is among the most digitaized countries in the world and as the digitarization strategy moves forward, it is necessary to improve and enhance the nation's overall cyberprotection. In 2019, the Government appointed a new 20-member national Cybersecurity Council for the period of two years. The council’s role is to advise the government on new initiatives that can support both the private and public sectors by improving resillience and better cyberprotection; contribute to knowledge sharing, advisories and guidance on the strategic level; and look into the need for cyber security competences and suggest measures to further develop these, both among private citizens and employees, as well as within education and research.</p>
<p>In this session, you will get a view into the midway status of the work of the Council, and will learn which initiatives work and which need more effort. The Council has been advising the healthcare authorities on the Danish COVID-19 app, and has been discussing the SolarWinds hack and the upcoming vaccination passport.</p>

It’s 2021, so why are passwords still persisting? The session will answer that question, and detail the progress that has been made towards standardizing strong authentication and the opportunity for companies to start on a journey past passwords.<br> <br> Join Andrew Shikiar, executive director of FIDO Alliance, as we look the past year from the FIDO standards lens, including:<br> -- The impacts of Covid-19 on digital transformation plans and securing remote workforces &amp; where strong authentication has fit in <br> -- Progress global organizations have made toward going truly passwordless <br> -- Considerations for strong authentication when seeking compliance with regulation such as PSD2 SCA<br> -- What other areas, such as identity verification, that need to be strengthened to better secure the web</p>




<p>-- Attendees will understand how a global pandemic affected companies' digital transformation plans, including strong authentication projects</p>
<p>Key Takaways:&nbsp;</p>
<p><br> -- Attendees will learn the status of efforts to standardize strong authentication, and where support stands today<br> -- Attendees will be able to analyze their strong authentication options for complying with regulation like PSD2 SCA<br> -- Attendees will be able to explain how identity verification and authentication relate, and efforts in motion to better secure both areas</p>

I collected requirements, draw process models, and did detailed analysis. I also defined minimum viable scope of the project and drove the team to reach the goal. Finally, I did acceptance testing. I can share key activities for business analyst throughout different phases of the project.<br> Analysis<br> * Get descriptions or describe yourself HR-processes, which are related to identity area. <br> * Get descriptions/explanations of data feeds from HR-systems.<br> * Describe your needs to HR-system development team, such as future employment changes, deputies etc in advance. <br> * Trust but verify: ask for example files /data. Perform data analysis to makes sure, that previous descriptions and processes are valid.<br> * Just acknowledge that “roll-out” of new processes is not one day activity, this can last for multiple months and must be treated and described as a separate process.<br> <br> Development<br> * Help developers with clarifying tiny details from stakeholders<br> * Document the details<br> * Control the scope and drive team to do correct prioritization<br> * Discuss alternative solutions to implement same business need<br> <br> Testing<br> * Rehearse migration<br> * Rehearse roll-out<br> * If testing resource is limited – verify major business cases. Prolong pilot period to see rare business cases in production.<br> <br> Roll-out<br> * Define different scopes and roll-out in smaller scopes (to keep incidents queue managed)<br> * Start roll-out from the process, that has smaller impact on acting employees (In our case we decided to start roll-out with leaver)<br> * Set up regular meetings with major stakeholders to inform them about changes in the processes. Good if you managed to agree on convenient communication channels (such as chat in Teams) between operational teams to be able to resolve incidents quickly.<br> <br> Pilot<br> * Verify not only concrete cases, but also analyze the data.<br> * Agree on convenient way of communicating issues/bugs/questions to developers.<br> * Resolve incidents and fix bugs as quickly as possible, so that operating units don’t feel alone with software/data issues.</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Key&nbsp;takeaways:</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>* Everything is possible but<br> * Define viable minimum<br> * Management team must be involved and work for your project. Your project must be a priority for all stakeholders / involved parties <br> * Start roll-out from the end<br> * Find a way to analyze your data to make sure, that everything is ok</p>

  <p>To date, Digital Identity Trust Frameworks have generally been light touch regarding the specification of fraud controls, relying on the theoretical protection a Digital ID offers through more robust authentication. It is true that improvements in authentication methods, such as soft tokens and biometrics, mean the ID theft vector of phishing for a user’s password may be removed. However, ID fraudsters will continue to use stolen ID information to create an ID in the victim’s name. They will continue to create synthetic IDs. They will also continue to try and take over victim’s accounts, using online account recovery and voice helpdesk channels to replace a strong authentication method with one that the fraudster controls.<br><br>In recognition of this ongoing threat from fraudsters, the Open Identity Exchange (OIX) has produced a comprehensive Guide to Fraud Controls for Digital ID Ecosystems.<br><br>The guide covers the processes and channels that need to be considered from a fraud risk point of view. It identifies the different types of fraud controls that should be applied in each channel, including ecosystem wide syndicated fraud controls, such as shared signals. The process of dealing with a suspected fraud is examined: how should these be prioritised, what investigation process should be followed, and how should victims be informed. Finally, it covers legal considerations when implementing fraud controls, in particular when sharing information and collaborating across the ecosystem to act as a joined-up defence against fraud attack.<br><br>This presentation / panel session will provide discuss these topics and how the guide can help those implementing Digital ID and provide the audience a chance to speak about their own fraud challenges with the authors and how the recommendations in the guide might be applied to help</p>

 What if we took the traditional way of thinking of Identity Governance and reversed it completely? Putting together a successful IGA program has commonly been a long haul,    A headache,    A mess,    A budget destroyer,    And an expectation disappointer.    There is a new way. Some call us crazy and some say its impossible. However, those who have experienced the new way call us visionaries.

<p>What if we took the traditional way of thinking of Identity Governance and reversed it completely? Putting together a successful IGA program has commonly been a long haul,<br> <br> A headache,<br> <br> A mess,<br> <br> A budget destroyer,<br> <br> And an expectation disappointer.<br> <br> There is a new way. Some call us crazy and some say its impossible. However, those who have experienced the new way call us visionaries. We have been presenting a modern ideology and process for IGA that drastically reduces the time to value, the total cost of ownership, and the economic impact of an Identity Governance Solution. <br> <br> This panel will focus on strategic order of operations, calculating the economic return of the modern approach, how to optimize AI/ML in Identity Governance, and the ways simplicity expediates the path to stronger compliance and security postures.</p>

  <p>Cloud computing has become commonplace in recent years, it is almost inevitable for small to medium sized companies to leverage cloud services largely if not fully. However, it is not easy to run cloud enablement project in bigger and yet most importantly traditional companies, where there are hundreds of legacy applications, which expect data to be closer to the computing units, and which are dependent on bandwidth and reliable network availability. In this presentation, I am going to address cloud migration requirements, usual challenges, and lessons learnt and best practices from project management, security and service management point of view.</p>

  <p>As a byproduct of the current activity across industry, government, and regulatory sectors, digital identity leaders face unprecedented opportunities- and challenges.</p>
<p>Covid has accelerated the global imperative to establish a strong and safe global digital economy that is enabled by a secure, interoperable,&nbsp; digital identity ecosystem. &nbsp; One of the most daunting challenges is how, where and when to start.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reality is that the target global ecosystem will be years in the making despite the widely held view that better identity is crucial to achieving a trusted digital-first marketplace.&nbsp; The fact is that the target state is the quintessential “it takes a village” challenge.&nbsp; It is this speaker’s strongly held view that the leaders who move the market now will be best positioned to substantively shape the government, regulatory and legal frameworks that might otherwise hamper ecosystem growth.</p>
<p>The focus of this session is to speak to the market movers in the audience and provide food-for-thought in devising a strategy to move forward.&nbsp; The ‘right’ strategy will attract global relying parties, identity service providers and the digitally-enabled consumer audience writ large (‘the village.’)&nbsp; The global ecosystem will take time to evolve but the time to build the foundation is now.</p>

   Self-sovereign identity&nbsp;has been a hot topic at EIC since 2016. We've seen it rapidly go from concept to reality, with a massive increase in global interest from car manufacturers to banks to healthcare. We've seen innovative pilot projects, new software and exciting new privacy innovations.&nbsp; 
 
 But what happens when advanced new technology and protocols come into contact with the real world? In this talk, Andy will describe how SSI underpins the IATA Travel Pass ecosystem. He'll cover some of the implementation challenges, the do's and don'ts, and describe how the technology is just one small cog in the machine that comprises airlines, airports, testing laboratories and governments around the world.&nbsp; 
 
 As IATA's technology partner, Evernym has been at the centre of the storm of global travel pass innovation, and Andy will give you a look under the covers of what a global SSI rollout looks like.

As we leave more and more digital footprints in the world of Internet, these information are giving birth to our digital profiles, raising issues of privacy protection, monetization of data, identity theft and more. While in this presentation, we revisit the manifestation and formation of identity in the incoming world of Web 3.0, and discover how the native citizens of Web 3.0 are forming their own identities and reputations with native behavior data that are distributed, interoperable, and self-sovereign.</p>

  <p>In a 2018 study by Onus &amp; Ponemon on data risk in the third-party ecosystem, more than 75% of companies surveyed said they believe third-party cybersecurity incidents are increasing. Those companies were right to believe that. <br> <br> As our world becomes more digitized, and thus more interconnected, it becomes increasingly more difficult to safeguard organizations from cybercrime. Tack on to that challenge a global pandemic that all but forced organizations to become “perimeter-less,” if they weren’t already, and the potential access points for bad actors through third-party access increases exponentially. <br> <br> The problem is two-fold. <br> <br> The landscape of third-party users is vast and continues to grow. From third-party non-employees like vendors, contractors and affiliates to non-human third parties like IoT devices, service accounts and bots, more organizations are engaging third parties to assist with their business operations and help them to innovate, grow faster, improve profitability, and ultimately create greater customer value – faster. On average, companies share confidential and sensitive information with more than 580 third parties and in many cases, an organization's third-party workers can actually outnumber their regular, full-time workforce. <br> <br> Yet, despite the increased use of third-party workers in business, most organizations lack the proper third-party risk culture, processes, and technologies to protect themselves against the long list of third parties with access to their sensitive data and systems. Organizations have these systems in place to manage their full-time employees but lack the same level of rigor to manage these higher-risk third-parties. As a result, many third-party users are provided with more access than needed for their roles, and most disturbingly, that access is frequently not terminated when the third party no longer needs it. <br> <br> Without the right third-party identity lifecycle management procedures in place, businesses unwittingly expand their attack surface, unnecessarily put sensitive information at risk, and create additional access points for hackers.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-panel-third-party-identity-risk-management"></a>

				  Indicio Named Finalist in IDC’s Inaugural Best in Future of Digital Infrastructure North America Awards&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Seattle WA – September 14, 2021 – Indicio today announced it has been named a finalist in the inaugural <a href="https://www.idc.com/promo/future-of-x/digital-infrastructure/awards">IDC Future Enterprise, Best in Future of Digital Infrastructure North America Awards</a> in the Ubiquitous Deployment category. The new awards were designed to highlight companies that demonstrate innovation and excellence in using cloud-centric computing to enable digital infrastructure resiliency, ensure consistent and ubiquitous workload placement and cost optimization across hybrid or multiple clouds, and take full advantage of autonomous operations.</p>
<p>The Indicio Network is the world’s only professionally-managed, enterprise-grade Hyperledger Indy-based network for decentralized identity. Indicio facilitates a consortium of 23 diverse, forward-thinking companies on five continents that are driving the use of decentralized identity to improve privacy and security in fintech, healthcare, travel, and the Internet of Things (IOT). Node Operators include GlobalID, Liquid Avatar, IdRamp, Bonifii, BizSecure, Entrustient, Blockspaces, Lorica Identity, and Networks Synergy. Learn<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/21-industry-leaders-from-5-continents-join-indicio-network-consortium-to-drive-global-adoption-of-decentralized-identity-301325690.html"> more </a>about the Indicio Node Operator Consortium membership.</p>
<p>“Being named a finalist in the IDC Future of Enterprise awards recognizes not just the accomplishments of Indicio’s dedicated professionals who designed and built the network, but of everything our network’s Node Operator community has done to support its establishment and maturity in such a short period of time,” said Heather Dahl, CEO, and co-founder of Indicio.tech. “We created this network to enable businesses use the power of decentralized identity to create Trusted Data Networks. These transform the way we authenticate, share, and verify data in a secure, privacy-preserving way so that information from people and connected things can be trusted. We’re seeing our Node Operators apply this technology to an extraordinary range of use cases—and they’re able to do that because they have a professionally supported enterprise-grade decentralized network to build on.”</p>
<p>Finalists joining Indicio in the Ubiquitous Deployment category are <a href="https://www.toyotafinancial.com/us/en.html">Toyota Financial Services</a> for their Digital Infrastructure Transformation and <a href="https://software.af.mil/team/cloud-one/">US Air Force Cloud One</a>. These organizations were recognized for their help to improve business agility and resiliency using outcome-driven infrastructure governance and portability enabled by subscription-based infrastructure consumption strategies and shared cloud management control planes. These initiatives often allow internal IT staff to offload infrastructure maintenance and support across widely dispersed locations by shifting to remote and intelligent vendor support and continuous technology refresh agreements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We were overwhelmed by the number of thoughtful and strategic initiatives submitted and congratulate all the finalists named in our inaugural IDC Future Enterprise Best in Future of Digital Infrastructure North American Awards program,” said Mary Johnston Turner, Research Vice President for the Future of Digital Infrastructure – Agenda research efforts at IDC. “The finalists have effectively used digital infrastructure across on-prem, edge and public cloud platforms to transform their most important business processes and to launch new digital business innovations. They are to be congratulated for their vision and industry leadership!”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio Node Operators are responsible for supporting a copy of the Indicio ledger on the Indicio Network as well as guiding &nbsp;strategy and ecosystem development. The number and business and geographic diversity of Node Operators is the foundation of its stability and resilience. Indicio supports the network with dedicated engineering staff and field-leading monitoring tools.

<p>PYMNTS talked with Finicity CEO Steve Smith about open banking, open finance, data aggregation, where we’re headed with technologies and standards and how consumer-permissioned data is the future of lending.</p>
<p>Innovation is largely occurring differently in each fintech segment so the usefulness of a broad <a href="http://finicity.com/open-banking">open banking platform</a> to provide relevant, quality data across investing, budgeting and mortgage is becoming more and more important.</p>
<p>“We’re entering an age in which – through open banking – consumers are increasingly comfortable sharing their personal financial data with third parties. And amid that “gold rush,” a slew of companies have popped up (mostly fintechs), promising to upend financial services, though they tend to focus on segments of financial life – investing, let’s say, or mortgages, or high-yield savings accounts.”</p>

You can<a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-176-defi-needs-self-sovereign-identity-be42c290bfc7"> check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>ICYMI: <a href="https://bonifii.com/2021/09/bonifii-joins-indicio-network-node-operator-consortium/">Bonifii joins Indicio Network Node Operator Consortium — Bonifii</a></p><p>This week:</p>  The SEC threatens to sue&nbsp;Coinbase  What people are&nbsp;saying  This week in&nbsp;crypto  Stuff happens   1. The SEC threatens to sue&nbsp;Coinbase Brian Armstrong, Photo: TechCrunch Disrupt<p>Rosalyn Layton over at Forbes has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2021/09/12/its-time-to-end-the-secs-clarity-charade-on-crypto/?sh=37e8e2dc25fa">a great overview of the SEC v. Coinbase situation</a>. The brief overview looks something like&nbsp;this:</p>  Regarding the sales of crypto as securities: “There’s actually a lot of clarity on that front,” Gary Gensler <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03">said at Aspen in early&nbsp;August</a>.  A month later, Gensler <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fb126d79-2e60-4002-8aba-b08887fca609">told the FT</a>: “Talk to us, come in,” he said. “There are a lot of platforms that are in operation today that would do better engaging and instead there is a bit of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. begging for forgiveness rather than asking for permission.”  <p>And here’s what happened when Coinbase and Brian Armstrong took Gensler’s advice and actively engaged with the SEC on one of their upcoming products, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2021/09/12/its-time-to-end-the-secs-clarity-charade-on-crypto/?sh=37e8e2dc25fa">according to&nbsp;Layton</a>:</p><blockquote>They approached the SEC for guidance on their product. Armstrong says the SEC responded with subpoenas for records and depositions, demanded a list of all their clients who had expressed interest in the product, and finally issued Coinbase a Wells notice — a warning of impending enforcement action. Armstrong said that by May of this year, the SEC was the only office in Washington refusing to meet with him at&nbsp;all.</blockquote><blockquote>“They are refusing to offer any opinion in writing to the industry on what should be allowed and why, and instead are engaging in intimidation tactics behind closed doors,” Armstrong tweeted. “Meanwhile, plenty of other crypto companies continue to offer a lend feature, but Coinbase is somehow not allowed&nbsp;to.”</blockquote><p>Now, there are plenty of arguments that the product Coinbase is looking to offer might very well be classified as a security — <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-09-08/lending-bitcoins-is-tricky">check out Matt Levine’s solid overview</a>.</p><p>That might be the weakest link in Armstrong’s tweetstorm, but it’s also not the primary point here. The SEC’s strategy of regulation by enforcement stifles innovation, hurts investors, and perhaps most egregiously, picks winners and losers — all while further muddying the regulatory landscape. Here’s Layton&nbsp;again:</p><blockquote>Without Congressional oversight, a regulator can run roughshod over the law. Why was Ethereum blessed while its rival Ripple was sued? Why does Coinbase get a Wells notice while crypto lenders like Aave, built on the Ethereum platform, get a pass? Jesse Powell, CEO of Coinbase’s rival, Kraken, tweeted a response to Armstrong that “regulators are beating down good actors because it’s convenient” and asked: “Who is behind the effort to drive domestic businesses and consumers offshore?” Angry XRP holders point to Clayton and Hinman’s business ties to Ethereum before and after their SEC tenures. Powell implies that established financial actors welcome regulatory chaos to protect their revenue of transaction fees if it deters crypto’s disruption of traditional business&nbsp;models.</blockquote><p>One option for Coinbase? Fight&nbsp;back.</p><p>As GlobaliD co-founder and CEO Greg Kidd has <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-why-innovation-sometimes-requires-legal-action-92ba26eb2a81">argued in the past</a>, sometimes you have to litigate to innovate. (That happens to be the theme of his talk at <a href="https://us.money2020.com/speaker/greg-kidd-s103-58562">this year’s Money2020 conference in Vegas next&nbsp;month</a>.)</p><p>The SEC is incentivized not to overcommit and pick off easy targets to fill their coffers. (That’s their business model.) And they’ll want to grab as much land as possible. But Ripple and Coinbase have the resources and the will to fight back and find regulatory clarity through the legal&nbsp;process.</p><p>Eventually, it will be up to Congress to provide the country with regulatory clarity for crypto. Until then, get ready for more litigation.</p> 2. What people are&nbsp;saying <p><a href="https://twitter.com/davidortiz/status/1435642074284666891?s=12">Brian Armstrong</a>:</p><blockquote>Look….we’re committed to following the law. Sometimes the law is unclear. So if the SEC wants to publish guidance, we are also happy to follow that (it’s nice if you actually enforce it evenly across the industry equally&nbsp;btw).</blockquote><blockquote>But in this case they are refusing to offer any opinion in writing to the industry on what should be allowed and why, and instead are engaging in intimidation tactics behind closed doors. Whatever their theory is here, it feels like a reach/land grab vs other regulators.</blockquote><blockquote>Meanwhile, plenty of other crypto companies continue to offer a lend feature, but Coinbase is somehow not allowed&nbsp;to.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>If you don’t want this activity, then simply publish your position, in writing, and enforce it evenly across the industry.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-capital-2669d1b8-4017-4cad-a333-48fbc5df177f.html">Felix Salmon</a>:</p><blockquote>Why it matters: Coinbase, the first major crypto company to get SEC approval to go public on a U.S. stock exchange, is about as regulator-friendly as crypto companies get — it has positioned itself as being far more in compliance with U.S. regulatory strictures than overseas rivals like Binance or&nbsp;FTX.</blockquote><blockquote>This week’s news shows that the industry still has a long way to go before it truly comes to terms with the U.S. regulatory environment.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>The other side: “The SEC doesn’t have the obligation (or the resources) to issue guidance about things that should be obvious to a baby securities lawyer,” <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamLevitin/status/1435652290627653636">tweets</a> Georgetown Law professor Adam Levitin. “It’s really astounding that Coinbase thinks it’s entitled to anything&nbsp;more.”</blockquote><blockquote>The bottom line: Coinbase’s comparative advantage was supposed to be that it stands comfortably in America’s regulatory good graces. But now Armstrong seems to be jealous of other crypto companies that offer similar products without SEC approval, and is picking fights with regulators.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-09-08/lending-bitcoins-is-tricky">Matt Levine</a>:</p><blockquote>A Bitcoin lending program — in which (1) a bunch of people pool their Bitcoins, (2) some manager or smart contract lends those Bitcoins to borrowers who pay interest, and (3) some or all of the interest is paid back to the people in the pool — is pretty straightforwardly an investment contract and thus a security.</blockquote><blockquote>I have been saying this for months, though that’s only because the SEC has also been saying it for months. But I admit that the SEC hasn’t been saying it in a particularly clear way. There’s not an SEC press release saying “FYI crypto lending programs are obviously securities.” And I gather that there are a lot of crypto lending programs — they’re a staple feature of decentralized finance platforms — and roughly none of them are registered with the SEC. The SEC and state regulators have brought enforcement actions against a few of them — we’ve talked about BitConnect and BlockFi and Blockchain Credit Partners — but I suppose each of those is distinctive in its own way, and there are about a zillion others that haven’t been sued by the SEC. 1 So you could reasonably look around and be like “oh sure we can pool people’s Bitcoins and lend them and pass along the interest, that’s not a security that should involve the SEC.” You’d be wrong, but I get where you’re coming&nbsp;from.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>Look, I get it. From the perspective of Coinbase, and of its customers, and frankly of most normal people interested in&nbsp;crypto:</blockquote>  People would like to lend their Bitcoins.  It doesn’t feel like a security.  It’s kind of annoying and archaic that a 1946 Supreme Court case says that it&nbsp;is?  <blockquote>But look at it from the SEC’s perspective:</blockquote>  The SEC really doesn’t like&nbsp;crypto.  The SEC is a regulatory agency that has a general tendency to want to do more regulating.  Popular tokens like Bitcoin and Ether are not securities and so not subject to SEC regulation, which leaves the SEC feeling&nbsp;antsy.  But crypto lending programs are pretty clearly securities subject to SEC regulation.  So for the SEC to say “crypto lending programs are securities and need to be regulated” serves the dual purposes of (1) expanding SEC jurisdiction over crypto and (2) stopping those programs.  Also it’s pretty clearly justified by a 1946 Supreme Court&nbsp;case.  None of that is at all satisfying, I suspect, but it is&nbsp;true.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>A paradigm for aligning Development, Delivery, Infrastructure Setup &amp; Management, and Operations in a seamless manner, with identity &amp; security always at the forefront. Policy-based, automated, and with well-segregated but aligned responsibilities.</p>
<p>DevOps, an integrated approach for development and operations of software and services, and DevSecOps, adding a security angle, have been around for close to a decade. While DevOps became an established principle, combining agile software development and the subsequent operations, DevSecOps – despite being intensively discussed – is seldom implemented and enforced in practice.</p>
<p>This leads to a variety of challenges, such as:</p>
 
 Security as an afterthought, leading to sub-optimal implementation of security and delaying the delivery of software 
 Identity as an afterthought, leading to islands of identities instead of integrated identity, and identity-related risks such as weak authentication, but also bearing the risk of inadequate customer experience on the onboarding and access journey 
 Violation of the requirements, such as in GDPR, to deliver privacy-by-design and security-by-design, as well as gaps in security-by-default, caused, e.g., by coding settings instead of relying on identity and security services 
 Lack of consistent, stable Security API layers and Identity API layers that consume standardized services from Security Fabrics and Identity Fabrics, leading to extensive effort for continuous redevelopment and re-coding of security and identity instead of just consumption of standardized services 
 Security-as-code as a misconception, meaning that developers are involved in coding security instead of utilizing APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to consume security and identity services 
 Infrastructure security is defined in code, which is error-prone, hard to manage and virtually impossible to incorporate in comprehensive Access Governance, and which requires developers to spend time on tasks that are not within their primary focus 
 Lack of segregation of duties between development, infrastructure, operations, security, and identity 
 
 What Is SODAS 
<p>SODAS (Secure Operation &amp; Development of Agile Services) is a concept that addresses these shortcomings and can be used as a foundation to achieve the benefits of:</p>
 
 Fast, agile software development 
 Efficient, automated infrastructure setup and software/service deployment 
 Secure, efficient operations in multi-cloud, multi-hybrid environments 
 Delivering secure software on time 
 Consistently enforcing the principles of privacy-by-design, security-by-design, and security-by-default 
 
<p>A major principle within SODAS is to strengthen the skills of employees by focusing on these, instead of requiring, e.g., developers to deal with infrastructure specifics, or security experts coding security instead of just declaring policies. Segregation of skills and specialization help in evolving the workforce even in an age of a skills shortage. It also helps in having clearly-defined accountabilities and responsibilities, leading to a more efficient, but well integrated IT organization.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 1: The three pillars of the SODAS approach, spanning agile development, automated setup and management of infrastructure and operations, underpinned by consistent identity and security services.</p>
 The 3 Pillars of SODAS 
<p>SODAS consists of three pillars and a foundation, which is Security and Identity. It extends the DevOps and DevSecOps paradigm by requiring a closer integration with Infrastructure Management, specifically by adding Security and Identity in a manner that is ubiquitous to the entire process from development to operations, but at the same time well-segregated and delivered as a service to developers. This reduces developers‘ workload and allows them to consume security and identity services, instead of continually recreating these.</p>
<p>For Development, there is little change. It must be business-driven, (following the overarching <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/it-for-the-digital-age-introducing-basis-business-driven-agile-secure-it-as-a-service">BASIS model defined by KuppingerCole</a>), it must be agile, and it must follow modern design and architecture principles, such as building on microservices architectures.</p>
<p>For efficient DevOps and supporting complex multi-cloud, multi-hybrid environments that are the reality for most organizations today, infrastructure for running the services must be provisioned and configured. Infrastructure must also grow with the business needs, requiring elasticity and scalability, which – depending on the runtime environment – is a given or must be managed by the organization. Infrastructure is also not just compute and storage, but also network. Following the principles of BASIS, which also apply to SODAS, this is provided by policy-based automation, utilizing information gathered about both the infrastructure and the requirements of the new services that shall be deployed. This requires integration of information from development, infrastructure, and other areas into (virtual) repositories, building on a common semantic, so that policy-based automation – commonly supported by AI/ML – can be applied.</p>
 Policy-Based Automation, Unified Across the Multi-Cloud, Multi-Hybrid Environments 
<p>Operations then also build on this approach of policy-based automation, unified across the multi-cloud, multi-hybrid environments. Clouds already differ vastly in the way they are managed. Additionally, between a public cloud and on-premises IT, the required level of management differs vastly due to the differences in provider responsibilities versus tenant responsibilities. However, a unified layer for policy-based automation enables organizations to abstract these differences and thus simplify operations.</p>
<p>This all is underpinned by the Security and Identity layer, building on modern Security Fabrics and Identity Fabrics, delivering a consistent and comprehensive set of security and identity services via consistent API layers that remain stable even when the underlying architecture changes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 2: Key technologies involved in SODAS, integrating development, operations, and security by policy-based automation.</p>
<p>This all builds on the set of technologies described in the BASIS concept. For Development and Operations, DevOps Tools, but also IT Operations Management for the operations part, are essential. IT Operations Management is another vital element for the infrastructure setup and operations. Allowing the flexible shift of workloads from one environment to the other in a complex multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT is essential, and supported by this approach. The inherent limitations found frequently in DevOps and being caused by the vast differences even in operating the major public clouds, focusing on a single defined target environment for operations are overcome by SODAS.</p>
 The Role of Enterprise Service Management 
<p>Enterprise Service Management is another essential element, for allowing a business to express its demand, and for managing all the assets and services in a consistent and coherent manner. All these elements pay into the virtual repository that provides a unified perspective across services and the environment to execute these, making the formerly unknown and dynamic known. These repositories are accessed by policies and automation solutions primarily via APIs.</p>
<p>Last not least, cybersecurity and IAM (Identity &amp; Access Management), delivered via Identity Fabrics and Security Fabrics, are the foundation for delivering the identity and security services via a defined, comprehensive, and stable set of APIs. This all is well-integrated, last not least via the repository and the policy-based automation, backed by AI and ML.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 3: The key actions to take in delivering to the SODAS model.</p>
<p>To move from today’s DevOps towards an approach that delivers on the promise of DevSecOps and that is made to support the full range of a multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT environment, SODAS can be implemented in four stages, following the: plan – build – deliver – run approach.</p>
<p>Planning is about optimizing the organization, with a clear segregation of responsibilities, but also by defining interfaces and setting up cross-divisional processes. This is about focusing, not to be mixed up with building new silos. Silos are not connected; silos are not integrated. The concept of SODAS is about focus and about leveraging the skills and specialization of the workforce in an optimized manner, supported by integration at the organizational and technical layer, and powered by policy-based automation.</p>
 Tooling Beyond the DevOps Tools Chain 
<p>To make this work, it requires the setup of the tooling, beyond the DevOps tools chain. It also requires modernizing the DevOps tools chain so that infrastructure and operations management are segregated via defined interfaces. This also allows for managing security and identity managed externally (and being consumed via APIs), controlling the DevOps tools chain. It requires working on the Identity Fabric and Security Fabric. It requires ESM and building the (very dynamic, always current) Asset Repository. And it requires policy-based automation. This is a journey, not a big bang. But every organization will already have several elements in place for building their SODAS model.</p>
<p>This then needs to be delivered by gathering data, by defining policies, by setting up automation, and by defining the identity and security services, the APIs, libraries, and widgets that make consumption of complex identity and security seamless to the developers.</p>
<p>Guiding principles for SODAS:</p>
 
 Business requests IT Services 
 Unified view on IT Services – one IT, across multi-hybrid, multi-cloud environments 
 Policy-based automation instead of manual administration or coding 
 Development is agile, consuming identity &amp; security APIs, delivering status/requirements back to DevOps tools as well as IT Operations Management 
 Automation of identity, security, and infrastructure setup &amp; management 
 
<p>Our recommendation is to revisit the DevOps and DevSecOps approaches in place in the organization according to SODAS to improve security and time-to-value in delivering Digital Services.</p>

 Part 2: Development Environment Tools and How to Use MetaMask to Manage&nbsp;Keys <p>Last Week, Ontology announced the official deployment of a TestNet supporting EVM and opened the EVM compatible public beta to developers around the world. At the same time, the “<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-evm-testnet-officially-deployed-now-opening-evm-compatible-public-beta-to-developers-6dddc2bdd764">Ontology Security Vulnerability and Threat Intelligence Bounty Programme</a>” was officially launched in cooperation with SlowMist, a well-known code auditing agency. The top reward for reporting a vulnerability is $12,000 in&nbsp;ONG.</p><p>In order to encourage community developers to quickly and easily familiarize themselves with the Ontology EVM development environment, we specially prepared a “Handbook for Dummies”, which explains the essentials of Ontology EVM contract development.</p><p>In <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ontology-evm-contract-development-part-1-network-details-2095f6e141e5">Part 1</a>, we introduced the ChainID, RPC URL, browser address and other configuration information related to the Ontology EVM. Developers can configure MetaMask wallets to the Ontology network based on the above information. In this section, we introduce the tools for developing and deploying EVM contracts on Ontology, and how to use MetaMask plug-in wallets to manage Ethereum&nbsp;wallets.</p> 2. Introduction to Development Environment Tools <p>Since the EVM contract is developed in the <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&amp;runs=200&amp;evmVersion=null&amp;version=soljson-v0.8.1+commit.df193b15.js">Solidity</a> language, we have detailed how to build the Remix, Truffle and Hardhat development environment, and enter a series of work such as contract development, compilation, deployment, and debugging. In addition, developers can also directly reuse the existing Ethereum contract framework to develop and deploy EVM contracts on Ontology.</p> 2.1 Remix Development Environment <p><a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&amp;runs=200&amp;evmVersion=null&amp;version=soljson-v0.8.1+commit.df193b15.js">Remix IDE</a> is an open source Solidity contract integrated development environment that supports users in contract development, compilation, deployment, and debugging. Please see this <a href="https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">link</a> for the official English version of Remix&nbsp;IDE.</p><p>Below we use a Hello World contract example to show how to use&nbsp;Remix.</p><p>2.1.1 Install Development Environment</p><p>To use Remix for the first time, you need to find and add the Solidity Compiler and Deploy and Run Transactions modules to the compiler in PLUGIN&nbsp;MANAGER.</p><p>Next, select the Solidity environment, create a new file and name it HelloWorld.sol. Then, copy the <a href="https://github.com/ontio/ontology/blob/master/docs/specifications/evm_refernce/contract-demo/helloworlddemo/helloworld.sol">Hello World contract code</a> that has been written to this&nbsp;file.</p><p>2.1.2 Compile&nbsp;Contract</p><p>Click the Solidity Compiler button, select the compiler version as 0.5.10, and start compiling HelloWorld.sol.</p><p>2.1.3 Deployment Contract</p><p>After compilation, the contract can be deployed to the Ontology network. The following will take the TestNet as an example. Before deploying the contract, you need to connect the MetaMask wallet to the Ontology network (refer to the technical viewpoint of the previous issue), and receive the test ONG as a handling fee on the Ontology <a href="https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Faucet&nbsp;address</a>.</p><p>Then, select “Injected Web3” in the Remix environment, and finally click “Deploy” to complete the contract deployment.</p><p>2.1.4 Call&nbsp;Contract</p><p>After the contract is deployed, the developer can call the methods in the contract. When deploying the Hello World contract in the example, the Hello string will be stored in the contract. We can call the message method of the contract to query this string, as shown&nbsp;below:</p> 2.2 Truffle Development Environment <p>Truffle is a framework used to assist in the development, testing and management of Ethereum smart contracts.

				  Le vote décentralisé  
			   
				
				
				  Une nouvelle manière de voter à la fois simple – sécurisée – confidentielle et innovante  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Une entreprise peut souhaiter consulter ses collaborateurs, clients ou partenaires pour de multiples raisons, en les sollicitant lors de son assemblée générale, pour obtenir d’eux un retour sur un événement donné ou pour n’importe quel autre type de prise de décision collective.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Elle doit alors choisir un processus de vote efficace parmi le vote traditionnel ou des mécanismes de vote électronique existant.</p>
<p>Unikname propose un nouveau type de vote électronique décentralisé complètement sécurisé, 100% confidentiel et très facile d’utilisation. Grâce à la technologie de<a href="https://www.unikname.network"> la blockchain Unikname Network</a> et aux propriétés de vérifiabilité de ses service providers, Unikname Quorum permet d’atteindre un haut niveau de confiance.</p> 
			  
			   
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Introduction aux systèmes de vote  
			   
				
				
				  Le vote traditionnel  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Le vote traditionnel, sous forme de bulletin papier, est simple dans la théorie, mais compliqué et coûteux dans son organisation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pour mettre en place un tel processus, les participants doivent se déplacer, et pour qu’il y ait suffisamment de confiance dans ce scrutin, un certain nombre d’observateurs doivent surveiller le déroulement des différentes étapes. L’expérience de vote est alors fastidieuse pour les votants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>De son côté, l’organisation doit mobiliser un nombre important de personnel afin d’assurer le bon déroulement du scrutin. Les bulletins doivent être préparés et distribués en amont et l’accès au scrutin doit être contrôlé. À la clôture du vote, l’organisation doit encore s’atteler aux étapes de dépouillement et de publication des résultats, le tout sous la surveillance d’observateurs, garants de la conformité du processus.</p>
<p>Le temps du dépouillement est proportionnel au nombre de votants et/ou au nombre de personnel participant au dépouillement. Il y a donc un délai non négligeable entre la clôture du scrutin et la publication des résultats.</p>
<p>Une telle organisation permet de garantir un haut niveau de transparence et de confidentialité mais elle est très coûteuse pour une entreprise.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Le vote électronique  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Depuis une vingtaine d’années, de nombreux algorithmes et protocoles de vote électronique ont fait leur apparition, promettant de réduire les coûts et les délais. Cependant, il existe des réticences à déployer ces solutions en raison de<a href="https://dl.gi.de/handle/20.500.12116/29131"> problèmes de confiance</a>. Depuis leur première mise en place <a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/publications/theses/diss/2013/TCD-SCSS-DISSERTATION-2013-045.pdf">au début des années 1990 en Belgique</a>, beaucoup de failles de sécurité ont été remontées, notamment sur le non-respect de la confidentialité des votes, ou de l’aspect invérifiable des résultats.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Si certains organismes ou même certains pays (<a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/publications/theses/diss/2013/TCD-SCSS-DISSERTATION-2013-045.pdf">comme l’Estonie</a>) utilisent fréquemment des systèmes de vote électronique, <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/PSNR20.pdf">ces processus ne font toujours pas consensus.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pour le cas du vote en entreprise, en plus de la problématique de la confiance et de la sécurité, les professionnels font face à un obstacle supplémentaire : la multiplicité de plateformes. Utiliser une plateforme dédiée au vote électronique oblige ses utilisateurs à prendre en main une énième application, à gérer un énième identifiant, à s’authentifier selon un processus spécifique… Finalement ce qui est gagné en temps est perdu en complexité.</p>
<p>L’idéal serait donc une solution pleinement intégrée dans le système d’informations de l’entreprise, fortement sécurisée et respectueuse de la vie privée de ses utilisateurs. Ne serait-ce pas là toutes les valeurs de la Plateforme SSI Unikname 😉 ?</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Le vote décentralisé avec Unikname Quorum  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>L’organisation d’un vote traditionnel repose sur quatre acteurs ou entités principales : le commissaire chargé de déclarer le scrutin et de constituer la liste électorale, les assesseurs responsables de l’administration du déroulement, l’urne permettant l’anonymisation des bulletins et les décompteurs organisant le dépouillement. Il y a également des observateurs invités à vérifier que chacun remplit bien son rôle.</p>
<p>Sur Unikname Network, ces différents rôles de commissaire, d’administrateur, de service d’anonymisation et de dépouilleur sont tenus par des service providers dédiés. Les Service Providers sont des petits programmes développés par la société Unikname ou ses partenaires s’exécutant sur le réseau Unikname Network. Ces programmes sont open-source, ce qui permet à n’importe qui de devenir observateur d’un vote en vérifiant que les service providers remplissent correctement leurs missions. Ils sont représentés sur le réseau par leur propre <a href="https://www.unikname.com/identifiant-decentralise-unikname/">UniknameID</a>, l’identifiant décentralisé Unikname, qui leur permet de signer des opérations, de s’authentifier ou encore d’enregistrer des transactions dans la blockchain.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Le commissaire, l’administrateur, le service d’anonymisation et de dépouilleur interviennent chacun leur tour dans les différentes étapes du vote pour garantir les exigences suivantes :</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 
					 = 
					 
						
						 <p>L’Exactitude – Un vote ne peut pas être modifié, supprimé, ni fabriqué artificiellement</p> 
					 
				  
			   
				
				
				 
					 = 
					 
						
						 <p>La Vérifiabilité – Les votants peuvent vérifier que leur vote est comptabilisé</p> 
					 
				  
			   
				
				
				 
					 = 
					 
						
						 <p>La Confidentialité – Personne qui ne peut pas connaître le vote d’un participant</p> 
					 
				  
			   
				
				
				 
					 = 
					 
						
						 <p>L’Exclusivité – Seuls les membres de la liste électorale peuvent voter et ils ne le peuvent qu’une seule fois</p> 
					 
				  
			   
				
				
				 
					 = 
					 
						
						 <p>La Non interférence – Aucun résultat ne peut être publié avant la fin du scrutin</p> 
					 
				  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Le déroulement du vote  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Le vote décentralisé avec Unikname Quorum s’organise en trois étapes : l’enregistrement, le processus de vote et le dépouillement. À chacune de ces étapes, des informations permettant la transparence du scrutin et la vérification des exigences ci-dessus sont écrites dans la blockchain par les Service Providers. Des SSI credits sont échangés entre les différentes parties pour permettre l’accès aux différents services de<a href="https://www.unikname.com/plateforme-unikname/"> la Plateforme SSI Unikname</a>, comme par exemple les services d’écritures.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  L’enregistrement  
			   
				
				
				 <p>L’organisateur du scrutin contacte le commissaire pour préparer avec lui la liste électorale et les conditions de vote en échange de SSI credits. L’ensemble des crédits sont envoyés au commissaire qui va se charger de les répartir parmi les Service Providers concernés. Ainsi les participants pourront interagir avec eux sans avoir à manipuler de SSI credits.</p>
<p>Les informations seront écrites anonymement dans la blockchain par le commissaire et sous le contrôle de l’organisateur. Ainsi, les règles ne pourront pas être modifiées par la suite.</p> 
			   
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 L’organisateur prend ensuite contact avec les participants pour les inviter à participer au scrutin. 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Le processus de vote  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Pour voter, les participants vont d’abord s’authentifier auprès de l’administrateur pour que celui-ci vérifie qu’ils sont bien inscrits sur la liste électorale et qu’ils n’ont pas encore voté. Grâce à des mécanismes d’anonymisation, cette vérification peut se faire sans que les votants n’aient à partager leur UniknameID avec l’administrateur.</p> 
			   
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Une fois les vérifications effectuées, l’administrateur signe une autorisation qui permet aux participants d’envoyer leur bulletin au service d’anonymisation. Ce dernier enregistre alors une transaction de vote, sous le contrôle du votant, pour prouver que ce dernier a bien participé au scrutin. Ensuite, le service d’anonymisation applique des algorithmes permettant de casser les liens entre un participant et son vote, puis conserve tous les bulletins jusqu’à la clôture du scrutin.</p> 
			   
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Naturellement, le vote d’un participant est chiffré localement directement dans son appareil et les échanges entre les différentes parties se font sous un protocole de type end-to-end encryption. À partir du moment où le bulletin a quitté l’appareil du votant, aucune entité n’a la possibilité d’en connaître le contenu avant le dépouillement.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Le décompte des votes et la publication des résultats  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Lorsque le scrutin touche à sa fin, le dépouilleur reçoit l’ensemble des bulletins anonymisés. Il est le seul Service Provider capable de les déchiffrer, mais il n’est pas capable de faire de lien entre les votes et les votants.</p> 
			   
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Il va alors construire <a href="https://forum.unikname.com/t/an-introduction-to-merkle-trees/747">un arbre de Merkle</a> dont les feuilles sont l’ensemble des votes, ce qui permet à chaque participant de vérifier que son vote est comptabilisé. Le résultat publié est incontestable. La racine de l’arbre est écrite par le dépouilleur dans la blockchain Unikname Network afin de garder une trace du résultat et pour que l’issue du vote ne puisse pas être modifiée par la suite.</p> 
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Un système de vote intégré  
			  
			  
				
				
			   
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Comme pour les autres modules Unikname, Unikname Quorum est conçu pour s’intégrer facilement dans le système d’information d’une entreprise, via une application dédiée ou directement dans un processus déjà déployé.<br>Pour mettre en place un système de vote, organisateurs et participants n’ont besoin que de leur UniknameID, le même leur permettant aussi de <a href="https://www.unikname.com/unikname-connect/">s’authentifier</a> ou <a href="https://www.unikname.com/confidential-exchange-and-sensitive-data-sharing-a-major-issue-for-businesses/">d’échanger des données sensibles</a>.</p>
<p>Grâce à son architecture décentralisée, Unikname Quorum est une solution de vote avec une haute disponibilité, peu coûteuse et aussi facile à déployer qu’à utiliser. Les professionnels peuvent se re-concentrer sur le contenu de leurs assemblées générales ou l’organisation des événements à évaluer, l’organisation des scrutins devient une formalité.</p>

The Public Sector Profile (not to be confused with the DIACC PCTF which shares the same name but has a different aim) is globally recognized.&nbsp; 
 
<p>QUESTIONS!</p>
 
 Questions started at about [46:30] &nbsp;– though some questions came earlier. We covered:
 
 “I don’t trust organizations and corporations” – where we point out the “decentralize the world” approach goes to far. 
 Phoning home – (hint: no it doesn’t need to phone home) 
 Where are Holders Authorized? (hint: <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/bubbas-wallet/">Knowing if you can trust Bubba’s Wallet</a> may be more important…) 
 Canadian Digitial Identities are emerging – can startups leverage this?&nbsp; 
 Explain the Role of Government in ecosystems.&nbsp; 
 “Can a third party discover who I trust from a trust registry?” 
 How will interoperability work between trust registries?

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>A paradigm for unified delivery of IT services to the business demand, based on automated, policy-based management, and supported by the unification of heterogeneous multi-cloud multi-hybrid IT environments following a services-based approach.</p>
<p>Businesses need to reinvent themselves continually in the Digital Age. Every business is a Digital Business today, that needs <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/cio-advice-how-to-make-your-digital-business-fly">to deliver and improve Digital Services that differentiate it</a> from the competition. This requires an IT that is built to deliver to the business demand in an agile, yet secure and well-controlled manner.</p>
<p>This will work only when reducing the inherent complexity of today’s multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT, which is here to stay. Part of reducing that complexity is the gradual shift to the cloud, following “cloud-first” strategies. But the recent advent of Edge Computing has demonstrated that parts of IT never will run in the cloud. Beyond that, there is not a single cloud, but many clouds, resulting in a multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT.</p>
<p></p>
 Reduce Complexity by Unification and Automation 
<p>The complexity must be reduced by unification, wherever feasible, and by shifting to automated, policy-based management of IT across the “runtime” environments. The starting point is to focus on agile development, delivery, operations, and security of Digital Services, with a clear service focus. Services and the underlying resources are known, as are the users. Focusing on access of everyone (the users) and everything to these services and resources, is best achieved by treating everything as a service, and procuring, delivering, managing, and securing services in a consistent manner across all environments.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 1: The four main stages of the BASIS approach to plan, build, deliver and run Digital Services in an agile yet secure manner.</p>
<p>BASIS is a concept for delivering IT to meet the demand of the business in an agile, secure way, and with a unified perspective across all IT, be it on-premises, on the edge, or in some cloud. Services are treated in a unified manager, with policy-based automation being applied uniformly across the various environments, and across services.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Plan, Build, Deliver, and Run – The Essence of BASIS 
<p>The starting point for BASIS is a plan – build – deliver –&nbsp; run approach. It starts with the business demand and a &nbsp;re-defined IT strategy focused on efficient and agile delivery of IT services to business demands on time, and the IT organization that supports this. For the IT organization, the most important change is that there is no distinction between cloud and on-premises, as it is found in many organizations today, and that the focus is on development, delivery, operations of services, and security.</p>
<p>Build covers both the procurement and development of services, to which deployment model suits best. Cloud first strategies are a recommendation, but the reality is that, e.g., in hospitals or manufacturing, many services will continue to run on-premises. Additionally, software development takes a central role, with software being essential for differentiation of businesses in the Digital Age.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Application Delivery Necessitates Identity Management and Security Measures 
<p>These services need to be delivered, requiring the right setup of the infrastructure, e.g., Kubernetes instances in a public cloud or virtual machines in a private cloud environment, requiring delivery of the applications and services themselves, and the setup of adequate Identity Management and Security for all resources that come with these services and that are consumed by these services.</p>
<p>Once deployed, efficient execution of these services is required, from the cloud or the hybrid IT, thus still potentially involving Data Center operations, as Hybrid Cloud Operations from the edge to the public cloud. It requires Application Management and, last but not least, the IAM (Identity &amp; Access Management) and Cybersecurity to operate these Digital Services securely.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 2: Key technologies involved in BASIS, integrating development, operations, and security by policy-based automation.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Building a BASIS Approach 
<p>It is apparent that not all parts of a multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT environment are alike. Not everything in a multi-cloud, multi-hybrid environment can or should be managed in the same manner, starting with different provider and tenant responsibilities. However, what always is under tenant control, can be treated in a uniform manner, especially when internal IT or MSPs also deliver according to the service paradigm known from the cloud, with clearly defined tenant and provider responsibilities.</p>
<p>The essential building blocks for the BASIS approach on agile, secure IT and Digital Service delivery are:</p>
 
 Enterprise Service Management for business service requests, managing services across the entire IT, and providing insight into the assets that must be managed and secured. 
 DevOps for delivering services following agile software development paradigms, including automated testing and delivery into the operations environment of choice. 
 These environments must be managed, across the entire multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT environment. The depth and breadth of management required differs. In a public cloud, less management is required, but even there, several services must be managed and monitored. 
 Policy Management &amp; Enforcement is a central component, as the foundation for automating the management of service delivery. 
 Identity &amp; Access Management as well as Cybersecurity are essential for delivering services securely and managing everyone and everything that has access to services and the underlying resources. 
 
<p>All this must be well-integrated, being backed by access to information about the current state of IT across the multi-cloud, multi-hybrid environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 3: The key actions to take in delivering to the BASIS model.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Guiding Principles for BASIS 
<p>IT leaders must take various actions in each area to implement the BASIS approach for the agile delivery of IT services in a secure manner:</p>
 
 Plan: The main focus is to shift IT consequently to a business service delivery organization, driven by business demand. This requires alignment of development, operations across the multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT environment, Identity &amp; Access Management for the Digital Identities of everything and everyone, and Cybersecurity. Responsibilities as well as interfaces between the various areas must be well-defined. 
 Build: These interfaces include, at a technical level, Identity &amp; Security API layers that allow developers to easily and efficiently consume identity and security services for the Digital Services they are creating. It also requires interfaces to all current IT states, across the entire multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT, as well as to service requests and the state of IT services. Only when the applications, services, identities, and other elements are known and their state is accessible, a unified management can be applied. 
 Deliver: Delivery starts with policies that form the foundation for automation. Policies are rather easy to describe. However, with a growing number of policies, support by technology, including AI/ML, will be required for proposing, analyzing and optimizing policies. Policies are best described at generic levels and then – by technology – translated into the concrete policies and measures for the various parts of the IT environment. 
 Run: This starts with the enforcement of a consistent service request &amp; delivery process and implementing and enforcing the policy-based automation approach. Last but not least, the identity and security models must be implemented and enforced, for consistent control of all the resources in today’s complex, heterogeneous IT environments. 
 
<p>Guiding principles for BASIS:</p>
 
 Business requests IT Services, business demanding new or modified IT services, or initiates change 
 Unified view on IT Services services as foundation – one IT, across the entire multi-hybrid, multi-cloud environments 
 Policy-based automation instead of manual administration or coding 
 Development is agile, consuming identity &amp; security services via APIs, returning status/requirements as feedback, and as input to operations 
 Automation of identity, security and infrastructure setup &amp; management 
 
<p>Our recommendation is to revisit the IT organization according to BASIS, for delivering Digital Services successfully and at the speed of the business.</p>

  <p>The pandemic has dramatically changed how we work, shop, meet and learn. Simple username and password credentials can no longer be part of this new world. They have become every user’s and every IT departments’ nightmare. Connected IoT things are for the first time outnumbering non IoT connections such as Tablet, Phones and PCs and many emerging business models will drive more revenue through IoT-enabled services than the products through which they’re delivered. Applying zero trust thinking to all identities including connected things and not just employees and their PCs is therefore a concept organisations will need look into to ensure adequate security measures for their employees and things.</p>
<p>In this session we’ll talk about:</p>
 
 Current challenges of managing IoT devices 
 How identity of things automate and improve user experience 
 The role of IAM in Zero Trust

<p>After applying an agile way of working for the last three years the Rabobank Identity &amp; Access Management service has gone through a transformation. The increased autonomy of teams, using backlogs with prioritized epics, applying agile rituals in order to create space for growth in applying agile principles, all of these have affected how IAM services are developed and delivered. Where the arena is uncertain and customers have a somewhat-defined request the agile, iterative approach works. Yet where the arena is regulatory governed and compliance driven an agile approach works less. The impact of incidents in a 24x7 security service immediately reflects itself on the development of the service when a devops team is used. The strain between waterfall project management and this agile approach is not instrumental but conceptual. Aligning expectations with the wider organization is a challenge in itself. This presentation will demonstrate the pros and cons of agile on IAM.</p>

<p>Companies across the globe are undergoing digital transformation. The main challenge with this approach is the ability to securely manage access for on-premise, cloud and SaaS applications. Entitlement Management across this hybrid landscape requires management of cloud assets, IAM profiles, groups, roles and entitlements in support of Identity Lifecycle Management, Access Management, and Access Governance. <br> <br> Workloads have been running in the cloud since the last decade or so. AWS, GCP and Azure have replaced traditional data centers and companies continue to migrate their production workloads to cloud at blistering pace. So, what changed? Firstly, we are starting to realize that this cloud infrastructure model necessitates a different type of identity and access management solutions as native solutions don’t cover multi-cloud IaaS model and traditional IGA solutions fall short in their scope. Secondly, business goals and priorities are driving engineering teams to work on initiatives without formal approval and oversight. With IaaS it is easy to spin up an instance, assign various resources. As organizations aren’t centrally controlling these spin offs, any vulnerabilities in this growing shadow IT is a target for hackers.<br> <br> SecurEnds enables entitlement management across hybrid cloud assets for security and compliance.</p>




<p>1. Provide visibility over hybrid-cloud assets<br> Discover all identities, service accounts, IAM users, roles and policies within single or hybrid cloud the IaaS infrastructure.<br> See the granular permissions held by IAM Users, Roles and Service Accounts. This is important to define least privilege policies.<br> 2. Provide governance over hybrid-cloud assets<br> Enforce least privilege policies across all cloud identities to avoid privilege creep. <br> Routine audits of configurations across cloud environments helps with policy enforcement and compliance.<br> 3: Provide remediation over hybrid-cloud assets<br> Post identity review kick off automation to rectify privileges</p>

  <p>IAM programs in organizations have a reputation for difficulty and high failure rates.&nbsp;Through education and later through experience, professionals learn that communication is the most critical success factor in all human undertakings. We may have cutting-edge technology, generous budgets, and a competent team and still fail our project miserably.&nbsp;High-quality communication about IAM with our stakeholders is insufficient to succeed, but it is a necessary condition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what is the building block of communication? Words and concepts.</p>
<p>Improving the IAM vocabulary's accuracy is the idea behind the TOME (The Open-Measure Encyclopedia) project - an open-source encyclopedia specialized in IAM, authored by volunteer IAM professionals for their peers. Its goal is to become the industry reference dictionary. It is free of charge and licensed under Creative Commons to facilitate its widespread adoption. It is rooted in science with a solid methodology and pervasive references to stand on the shoulders of giants.</p>
<p>In this session, I will present and define a series of IAM concepts, both frequently used and rare but often misunderstood</p>

<p>Traditional IAM models have focused on users, policies, and roles, which met the needs of web applications in years past but as application development has evolved to APIs, an innovative approach to identity management is required. It is no longer just users, roles, and permissions. APIs must be integrated into the identity and access management framework to ensure adequate governance and security. <br> <br> Within an API there is a requestor (often on behalf of a user), a service (API), and the data that is being passed. All these entities in the transaction require unique identity and authorization; without identity, compliance and enforcement mandates cannot be met effectively and without authorization, there is a free-for-all on your APIs reminiscent of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. <br> <br> In this session, we will look at how rapid digitalization (first and third-party APIs + multi-or hybrid-cloud environments) has complicated security efforts, the role of API integration in data governance, and how companies can best navigate the heightened cyber-threat environment we find ourselves in today.</p>




<p>- Why API security requires more than traffic policy management and course-grained enforcement. <br> - Why APIs need to be integrated into the identity and access management framework to ensure adequate governance and security. <br> - How companies can reduce the burden on developers to allow for a proactive approach to API security instead of reactive.</p>

  <p>Self-Sovereign Identity – or SSI in brief – is now a major thing. Germany has become one of the world’s key SSI accelerators. Countless people and organizations – small and large – are getting excited and actively involved. Now de facto driving forces are: 1. SSI Pilots by the German Federal Chancellery as first demonstrations of the Digital Identity Ecosystem. 2. IDunion – a solution-oriented research project co-funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy in the cluster of showcases in Secure Digital Identity. This presentation provides a brief SSI introduction and an update on these two major German SSI initiatives.</p>

  <p>The paradox of simplicity is that making things simpler is hard work. - Bill Jensen</p>
<p>&nbsp;Building strong passwordless authentication from scratch can be very time-consuming. Integrating the necessary infrastructure into a typical password-centric identity code base increases code complexity exponentially. Taking into consideration that well-known user flows have to be changed and enhanced with new authentication options may also pose significant challenges for developers. They have to get it right - and make it as simple as possible for the end user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In this talk, we highlight possible pitfalls and necessary considerations when implementing passwordless FIDO and WebAuthn protocols. You will recognize how a cloud-native approach can simplify the integration of passwordless authentication and smoothen the requirements for developers and product owners of any online service. You’ll also learn how to gradually migrate existing users to the new authentication methods in a frictionless manner.</p>
<p>Join us to explore three possible abstraction layers we’ve identified to take the complexity away when dealing with FIDO and passwordless multi-factor authentication. Ranging from utilizing a managed FIDO API and SDKs up to a fully-fledged passwordless-native identity provider that can be integrated with OpenID Connect. We also will share some secrets on useful extensions of the FIDO standards we’ve identified when building our passwordless user experiences.</p>

<p>Balancing usability and security is a well-known challenge in the field of identity. With increasing threats to personal and critical business data posed by nation-states and other bad actors, organizations are moving to a default posture of Zero Trust with more and more technology vendors and service providers delivering solutions in the form of complex monitoring and policies designed to keep the bad guys out. Knowledge workers, including an increasing population of frontline workers, require and expect seamless collaboration and productivity without barriers that waste time and require technical expertise. And businesses of all sizes are looking for solutions that can be operated by managers and program owners who are not necessarily identity and security experts. At the same time, individuals are drowning in a sea of passwords and clamoring to maintain their privacy and preventing compromise in their personal lives. With more signals, potentially come more annoyances, and with more annoyances come to the proliferation of unsafe practices. As vendors and enterprises dedicated to secure and seamless identity, it is our responsibility to invest in a more secure future while remaining dedicated to solutions that guarantee higher security but are even easier and more delightful to use than today's conventional solutions. FIDO2 and the move towards passwordless solutions are getting more adoption, but still carry with them some experience challenges in onboarding and recovery. Innovations like distributed identity show promise in decentralizing ownership of personal data and putting control back in the hands of end-users but are in very early days. EIC represents the industry and our commitment to creating trustworthy frameworks that protect organizations and people.</p>
<p>Join a panel of experts to share their thoughts on how we can continue on a pace of innovation in zero-trust while maintaining trust and usability for everyday people in a digital world.</p>




<p>- innovation requires investment across security, privacy, and usability<br> <br> - abstracting complexity from both end-users and operators is more important than ever<br> <br> - vendors and enterprises owe it to their users to consider everyday user experience a vital part of creating a secure environment</p>

  <p>The onslaught of account takeover attacks from insecure passwords is driving the rapid adoption of passwordless solutions.&nbsp; While the risk reduction benefits are substantial, eliminating passwords is just the first step on the path to fundamentally strong authentication.&nbsp; In the “new normal” era of work from anywhere, and rapidly increasing cloud adoption, organizations are moving to a new risk-based authentication model.&nbsp; Advanced organizations are validating users, their devices, and inspecting the security posture of the device for each login.&nbsp; Strong and continuous authentication is a fundamental building block of Zero Trust. Learn how you can make it happen without making the user experience miserable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Discussion topics include:</p>
 
 New cybersecurity and identity management requirements in the post COVID era 
 Traditional MFA vs Passwordless - avoiding the “security vs. painful user experience” tradeoff 
 Device trust and the confluence of cybersecurity and identity management 
 Continuous risk-based authentication&nbsp; 
 
<p>Takeaways:</p>
 
 Account takeovers and other attacks have increased as a result of distributed working - adopting a solution that removes passwords removes most of the risk 
 MFA has evolved beyond the traditional “password + SMS + pin” approach 
 CISO’s and IT no longer have to trade increased security for user convenience 
 Modern devices allow organizations to leverage the Secure Enclave / Trusted Platform Module for increased security 
 Continuous, risk-based authentication is a key factor in identity and access management

Identity protocols and features got caught in the crossfire, however, forcing identity software vendors and developers to hastily introduce changes to restore functionality that browser changes broke. Is this the new normal? What will we do when a change will break an identity feature beyond repair?</p>
<p>This session will review the main browser changes that have affected identity over the last few years – Chrome’s SameSite and Safari’s ITP2 in particular, interpreting them as part of a larger trend and attempting to predict what the future will look like for identity customers and practitioners.</p>

Unfortunately, in many cases these initiatives are not adequately executed and, as a result, do not meet expectations.</p>
<p>In this session we will look at 5 pillars of an IoT deployment: the Device pillar ensures we select the appropriate sensors and actuators, the Control pillar guides our decisions on controller functionality, the Communications pillar ensures we consider which options fit our required functionality and budget, the IT pillar determines the level of integration between our IT and OT environments, and the Security pillar guides our protection strategy.</p>
<p>A holistic approach is a success-indicator for our IoT projects.</p>

The Assume Breach mindset, a key aspect of a Zero Trust, shifts the risk posture to that of applying defense against the concept that the perimeter has already been breached.</p>
<p>In this session, we run through the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures used in recent breaches and highlight the commonality across them; identity compromise and privilege elevation. This analysis will highlight the importance of taking an assume breach mindset to defense and that Identity becomes central to this strategy. Further, we will then position recommendations on how to protect against Credential Theft, Lateral Movement, and Privileged Escalation across hybrid and cloud environments</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-moss-zero-trust-identity-centric-security"></a>

  <p>Research from 2020 has shown a phonemonal growth in the access management market.</p>
<p>The pandemic, for all its impact, has enabled organisations to re-evaluate their working strategies and practices. But at what cost? Cybercrime on corporate applications has risen exponentially from the dispersed workforce and rapid cloud adoption has left organisations vulnerable to ransomware, malicious activity and internal subterfuge.</p>
<p>Danna Bethlehem, Director Product Marketing Authentication at Thales discusses how organisations can accelerate their business with the right approach to their IAM strategy. For 2021 and beyond, enterprises need to leave survival mode behind and adopt a drive to thrive.</p>
<p>Drawing on recently released research into the EMEA IAM market, she will highlight:</p>
 
 How demands of the corporate workforce for dispersed working is bringing IAM security concerns to the fore 
 How the next generational approach to IAM can enable forward thinking organisations to thrive 
 How enterprises can build an effective IAM strategy to drive their growth

  <p>Many companies from diverse industries increasingly rely on AI for strengthening their efficiency by automating jobs. Many of these advanced automation tools, however, currently become standard applications. Consequently, an isolated use of these tools will not enable companies to gain a competitive advantage. This presentation builds on an intelligence-based view of firm performance and the ‘Integrated Intelligence’ approach, which highlights the need to integrate AI with specific human expertise to outperform competitors and to transform a firm’s intelligence architecture. It further discusses the leadership implications for general managers and offers a systematic framework for generating growth and innovation beyond automation and efficiency. The ‘I3 – Integrated Intelligence Incubator’ provides executives with a toolset for developing appropriate strategic initiatives for intelligence-based future competition.</p>

<p>As more and more organizations go multi-cloud, the question arises how to integrate existing and compliance-proven enterprise IAM processes with the upcoming requirements of managing identity in the clouds.<br>In this talk we will present two different approaches on how an organization can manage multi-cloud identities and access. The models are based on real life examples we have found to work out for organizations we work with. What we learn with these examples is that there is a wide spectrum between agility and control. Each organization has to find their own balance in this playing field and design a solution that is valuable to them and their team.</p>

<p>I considered myself quite an experienced programmer and having some expertise in Identity management when I was hired by Swedbank to work as full time Identity engineer. Besides projects, I had assignment to describe an architecture of the IAM as a service from my manager. Honestly, I had no clue about how to envision it. I tried to assemble standards and squeeze something out from practices and papers. But these were not really all my ideas and I did not feel much confident. But something started to happen in few last years when we had a very hard time implementing our IAM project (believe or not, it was successful). We had to answer hundred times to questions "why", "what" and "how". And finally the blueprint of the architecture of IAM as a service appeared from the mist. It is not one and only, because same size does not fit for all. Still, I do not agree that there are indefinite number of possible solutions. I think similar enterprises and engineers may find this presentation useful to draw their own blueprints.</p>




<p>IAM projects start usually from implementing baseline IAM processes - joiners, leavers, movers. Because this is what is usually most needed. But then you will get asked for more - identity data, events, other services. This is what makes up IAM as a service.</p>

<p>I today's digital world (post EU DMA, DSA, DGA regulation proposals (now tabled in EU Parliament for legislative approval by 2023), GAIAx birth in Europe and eprivacy new regulations adoption, the hard line separation between personal and non personal data is blurring and companies have yet understood what this means for them. While they thought that only personal data needed to be consented, now it's all the data that need the consent log prof for each digital identity they get associated to. Europeans have also created a new "notion" of cloud (GaiaX). A cloud where data can circulate freely, can be shared and mutualised (upon consent). This will have implications. Huge implications as GaiaX carries the option to "import/acquire" data also originated from other entities (including from outside Europe). The transfer mechanism will only be possible upon user express consent, voluntarily. User will need to be incentivised to agree to share. Since transfer can only be performed by users, and with consent, that will in fact open up to a secondary data market which sees the consent log representing a "transaction event'. Hence privacy will exit the framework compliance to enter the framework of "strategy and business development'. The contextual "data" hunt can begin (vs big data paradigm which fades aways). The de-monopolisation of consumer data, too.</p>

   Traditional identity and access management solutions built so far on the trust for selected identity providers and their adoption from an ecosystem of identity owners and identity verifiers. The decentralized identity paradigm is disrupting these ecosystems and required&nbsp;more democratic collaboration and competition&nbsp;among a number of&nbsp;identity and credential issuers, identity owners, and verifiers selecting and using them. This requires not only to design and implement new technologies but also to identify new business opportunities and business models. Collaboration, experimentation,&nbsp;and evaluation are the road to adoption, and the EU collaborative H2020 research and innovation framework offers the opportunity&nbsp;to de-risk such collaborations, in favor of innovation. 
 
 This talk will present the activities and lessons from three EU collaborations, CityExhcange, ENSURESEC and ORCHRESTRA, generating innovation with the adoption of decentralized identities for individuals, things, and organizations among complex&nbsp;stakeholders ecosystems in the smart energy, e-commerce, and smart transport domains.

 Guardianship is a condition of life in human societies. When we are young we may be looked after by parents until we become adults. When we are adults we on occasions need others to look after us, and sometimes we may need increasing levels of care as we age.

<p>Guardianship is a condition of life in human societies. When we are young we may be looked after by parents until we become adults. When we are adults we on occasions need others to look after us, and sometimes we may need increasing levels of care as we age.<br>In our physical world, we may recognise a guardianship role between parents and children and within families, and we may have more or less sophisticated laws to recognise instances where someone needs to take care of another for medical, financial or other needs.<br>While the concept of Guardianship is reasonably well developed and understood in our physical lives, it is scarcely considered in our digital lives. Very few (if any) considerations are made for the possibility that someone may need another to look after their affairs online. Without this consideration, we resort to poor approaches such as where a Guardian needs to "log in" as the dependent, without the visibility of the service provider, or has to prove their Guardianship status to a service provider who is physically remote and often in a different legal jurisdiction.<br>In late 2019, the Sovrin Task Force on Guardianship wrote a white paper on Guardianship considering these issues against two specific use cases: a child refugee and an adult living with dementia. A Working Group was established at the beginning of 2020 to develop these ideas further within the context of Trust over IP and has produced two key documents: an Implementation Guide to Guardianship using Verifiable Credentials, and a Technical Requirements document for Guardianship using Verifiable Credentials.<br>I would like to present these new pieces of work and, hopefully, engage in a discussion on guardianship in the digital world.<br>**Please note that this work was created by a team working with the not-for-profit Sovrin Organisation and is provided on a Creative Commons BY SA 4.0 Licence**</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Doing IT right is the premise for delivering time-to-value in the Digital Journey. Success requires an agile IT for delivering secure Digital Services on time.</p>
<p>Virtually all organizations have become digital at least to a certain extent in the past three decades since the World Wide Web (already an old-fashioned term) took off. But we are still on that journey. There is a good reason not to name this Digital Transformation, but Digital Journey. It is not about transforming from the analog to the digital state, but an ongoing journey.</p>
<p>This journey is driven by ever-changing business models, rapid innovation of products and services, as well as a shift from product business to service business, and last but not least, new entrants in the competition. Business must compete harder than ever before to be successful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 1: Digital Services: Software as a differentiator. Success in the Digital Age builds on competitive differentiation through Digital Services &amp; Digital Experience.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Making Digital Services a Differentiator 
<p>Differentiation in the Digital Business is based on Digital Services. The phrase “every business is a software business” never has been truer than today. Software is ubiquitous. It forms the backend of digital services, it forms the frontend via apps, it is in connected things, and it is in microchips of connected vehicles. Software is everywhere. The intellectual property of businesses is melded into software. The USP (Unique Selling Proposition) of companies results from delivering better digital services. This is what differentiates them in today's competitive environment.</p>
<p>However, Digital Services are not only about translating business into Digital Services, and thus software development. It is also about delivery, operating, and last but not least, securing these services. The link between security, Digital Services, and Digital Experience (DX) is Digital Identity. Only if delivery, operations, and security are built for agility and rapid, reliant, and resilient delivery of services, and only if the Digital Identity approach is built for the needs of today’s hyperconnected business, will organizations be able to deliver the Digital Experience that differentiates them from their competitors and makes them successful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 2: Even greenfield IT consists of many components that must be delivered, managed, and secured. And even greenfield IT will become brownfield IT that has to cope with legacy.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Conceal Heterogeneity through Standardization and Unification 
<p>While some startups can build on a greenfield IT, reality is that even this quickly becomes a mix of new and established (or “legacy”) elements, and is based on multiple clouds. For most organizations, though, it is about a complex mix of IT, both in the backend and with respect to all the devices that are used to access services. However, the latter are out of control of the business because Digital Experience is about supporting what the customers and consumers are using to access the Digital Services.</p>
<p>And, regardless of greenfield or brownfield approaches on IT: Digital Services consist of many elements, from backend applications, storage and data to the services themselves, the apps used, the software that is baked into microchips, and so on.</p>
<p>The reality of the IT of the vast majority of organizations is multi-cloud, multi-hybrid, with many different deployment models. Some can just build on multi-cloud, but even new organizations end up with more complexity when it comes to manufacturing, where on-premises IT and Edge Computing are needed. Thus, organizations must prepare their IT to deliver to the business on demand and on time, while accepting the heterogeneity of today’s IT. Heterogeneity will not easily disappear. Thus, it is about making it work better, by reducing complexity and by concealing heterogeneity through standardization and unification.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 3: IT must serve to the needs of agility and security while keeping cost under control and delivering to the control &amp; compliance needs of organizations.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Keeping an Eye on the Costs 
<p>Agility in delivering to business demand is just one element of what a good, modern IT must deliver. As always, cost must be kept under control. Succeeding in the Digital Business will always require delivering the Digital Services at a reasonable and competitive cost. Control &amp; compliance requirements are more important than ever before, with ever-increasing regulatory pressure. Last, but not least, security and resilience are essential to the success.</p>
<p>Digital Businesses are at risk of cyber-attacks as well as failure in delivery. Failing in cybersecurity can destroy a Digital Business. When everything is based on Digital Services, when every business is a software business, then cybersecurity is more important than ever before.</p>
<p>The challenge is delivering on the various needs in an efficient, reliable manner across development, delivery, operations, security, and identity. This will not work with point solutions, because everything is integrated in the digital business. It will also not work when relying on manual administration in many of the areas. Manual work is expensive and error-prone. Using approaches like "everything as code" won't work. There are too few people who can code, and coding is both expensive and error-prone, as we all experience regularly in bugs, updates, and patches.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 4: Policy-based automation is the foundation for successfully running the complex IT environments of today and serving the demand of the Digital Business.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Automation Is Key 
<p>The solution lies in automation based on policies, supported by intelligent solutions utilizing what AI (Artificial Intelligence), ML (Machine Learning), and other techniques can deliver. This requires collecting information about everything in IT, from services, backend applications, devices, and apps to all the various types of users to the underlying infrastructure, regardless of where this is located across the multi-cloud multi-hybrid IT universe of the organization.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 5: Management of IT must focus on what can be well-managed. Identities and services are where organizations can get a grip on. In the end, it is about someone or something accessing services. This is where IT unification starts.</p>
<p>When looking at automation, it requires infrastructure automation. It requires efficient development with automated testing and delivery into production. However, from a management perspective, the potential for unification and standardization across a heterogeneous, complex IT environment, is in focusing on the areas that organizations have under control: Identities and services or, in broader terminology, the resources that support and form the Digital Service.</p>
<p>Access happens from humans, devices, things, or services to other services. Identities can be managed and must be managed. Applications, their data, and the services and infrastructure delivering this are under control. It is way harder to get a grip on all the devices – just think about BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) approaches or all the different devices used by customers and consumers. Even harder, is control of the network in a hyper-connected world where Work from Home (WfH) is the new normal. Thus, Identity and Access Management (IAM) as well as a consistent, automated, efficient management of the IT services, is where the focus of modern IT must be.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 6: Digital Business: Technology impact on agility. Digital Identity, Cybersecurity and Agile Development &amp; Operations as key enablers.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Managing Digital Identities Is Essential to Gain a Competitive Edge 
<p>The technology impact becomes visible when mapping the impact of technologies to support organizations in changing to the needs in their Digital Journey. Managing Digital Identities of everyone, specifically the consumers and customers, but also the relationships to devices and connected things, for example, is essential to win in the dynamic competition of the Digital Age.</p>
<p>The technologies with the highest relevance are: Digital Identity Management, Cybersecurity – to secure the Digital Business – and Agile Development &amp; Operations for developing and delivering the Digital Services.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 7: Eight fundamentals for successfully developing, delivering and securing the Digital Services that make Digital Business succeed.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Eight Fundamentals of Digital Business Success 
<p>Success in the Digital Business is based on eight fundamentals:</p>
 
 Business demand drives IT, which exists &nbsp;to support the business – and IT has never been as important as it is today, where every business is some sort of a software business. 
 Multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT is the new normal. “Cloud first” is a meaningful paradigm, but Edge Computing demonstrates that not everything will run in the cloud, not to speak of a single cloud. 
 Built on policy-based automation. Policy-based automation is the key to managing complex, heterogeneous environments. Doing this right, requires the use of AI &amp; ML to help in creating and optimizing policies. 
 Gather the status of everything. Policy-based automation also requires data about everything. The identities, the infrastructure, the code and structure of applications, APIs, and so on. This must be gathered into repositories that then can be utilized by policies. 
 Identities &amp; resources in core focus. Someone or something (with an identity) is accessing services and the resources in the background. Which device is used, which network is used: This is hard to control. But identities and resources are known and can be well-managed. 
 Unified view of resources – everything as a service. This leads to a perspective where, ideally, everything is treated as a service, regardless of whether deployed from the cloud or on-premises. Identities are accessing resources – this is where unification can start. 
 Agile development, integrated delivery &amp; operations. Rapid delivery of Digital Services to the business demand requires agile development that integrates with delivery and operations (and, last but not least, security). Again: This will work across all layers only when being based on policy-based automation. 
 Automate security across everything: Identities &amp; resources. The automation of security must start where organizations have control. They have that control over identities and resources. Control is way harder to win over devices and networks. Thus: Focus on identities and resources for a unified, efficient management of IT. 
 
<p>It is time to revisit the way we do IT, and to improve it.</p>

			 How Fractionalization of NFTs Enables Co-Ownership<br>
 
<p>For months, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are making headlines in the blockchain space. NFTs are supposed to be unique and they usually represent an asset. Most of the time, the asset is digital and embedded in the token, but problems have come to the fore. Firstly, there is no proof that assets have not been duplicated before their tokenization, or that other NFTs will not represent the same asset. Secondly, how can users verify that the NFT creator is the asset owner?</p>
 <p>CREDIT: Elliptic</p> 
<p>Last month a collector bought a fake Banksy NFT for £244,000. The image, which features a figure smoking in front of industrial chimneys, supposedly commenting on climate change, was a hoax from a scammer. It is one example among many others.</p>
<p>With NFTs, the source and owner of the asset is simply not trackable. On platforms such as OpenSea (now valued at $1.5 billion), the authenticity is reliant on the seller saying they are who they say they are. Sounds a bit light in terms of customer protection from my personal opinion. Considering this, it is easy for me to see the use of NFTs for collectibles, but it is harder to see the benefits for real world asset tokenization.</p>
<p>Some NFTs are now becoming very valuable and start to struggle to find liquidity. Therefore, there is a new trend to fractionalize NFTs to enable co-ownership and make them more accessible. In some ways, fractionalizing NFTs is coming back to a use case of standard tokens, except the need to guarantee the ownership of the underlying asset. Moreover, in the traditional world, co-ownership is usually made possible with financial securities to protect owners and apply laws (taxes, inheritance, etc.). How could this be done on the blockchain?</p>
<p>NFTs are unique and indivisible by nature, so how can we fractionalize these assets? We can “wrap” up a NFT into a permissioned token with the&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-91xf0c2m94QWIot1fhg6czY2yr2DX6p-RCh_U_qXBMbGo9ZyZfi-ipIkriPBvVwOEHGMc3">T-REX protocol (ERC3643)</a>: a unique token smart contract is deployed (representing the asset) by a verified issuer (the asset owner or its custodian). The shares of the asset would be represented by the tokens generated via the smart contract. The asset is now divisible as much as decided by the issuer. The cap table of owners is transparent, automatically updated, and the ownership of these shares is guaranteed by digital identities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the same way, and as long as the custodian of the asset can be trusted, it is possible to “wrap” crypto, stablecoins, fiat, real world assets and securities in permissioned tokens. It guarantees the ownership of the underlying asset, and&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/digital-identity-the-key-for-security-token-custody/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-91xf0c2m94QWIot1fhg6czY2yr2DX6p-RCh_U_qXBMbGo9ZyZfi-ipIkriPBvVwOEHGMc3">makes the tokens recoverable in case of loss of wallets</a>.</p>

   Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a form of identity where users have complete control over their data and how it is shared with others. Verifiable Credentials (VCs), on the other hand, are a W3C standard for implementing SSI.  There are three parties involved in a VC — issuer, holder, and verifier, and together they form what’s called the trust triangle.  The entire process begins when the issuer

As a part of this process, an issuer also can revoke a VC, as circumstances of the holder may&nbsp;change.</p><p>For example, a holder may no longer be a student of a university/college, hence his/her student VC must be revoked. The same applies when a holder is no longer an employee or when a government ID such as a driver’s license, visa, or passport has&nbsp;expired.</p><p>Now that you know why VCs need to be revoked, let’s drill down to the implementation.</p> Status of a&nbsp;VC <p>The status of a VC is checked by the verifier to ensure that it is still valid. From an implementation standpoint, W3C’s specification has a property called the credentialStatus property that contains information about the current status of a&nbsp;VC.</p><p>The credentialStatus property of a VC must&nbsp;include,</p>  id — a&nbsp;URL  type — describes the status of a credential. The value of this property is used to determine the current status of a&nbsp;VC  <p>The actual implementation varies greatly and could even include a link to an external document that contains the credential’s validity.</p><p>Here’s an <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-csl2017/">implementation example</a></p> {    "id": "http://dmv.example.gov/credentials/3732",    "type": ["Credential", "ProofOfAgeCredential"],    "issuer": "https://dmv.example.gov/issuers/14",    "issued": "2010-01-01T19:73:24Z",    "claim": {      "id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21",      "ageOver": 21    },    "credentialStatus": {      "id": "https://dmv.example.gov/status/24,      "type": "CredentialStatusList2017"    },    "proof": { ... }  } <p>The above example is a list-based credential revocation, which means, the status of many VCs is contained in a single&nbsp;list.</p><p>Here’s how this list&nbsp;looks.</p> {    "id": "https://dmv.example.gov/status/24,    "description": "Status of sample DMV credentials."    "verifiableCredential": [{       "claim": {          "id": "http://dmv.example.gov/credentials/3732",          "currentStatus": "Revoked",          "statusReason": "Disciplinary action"      },      "issuer": "http://dmv.example.gov/",      "issued": "2017-12-05T14:27:42Z",      "proof": { ... }     }, {    "claim": {      "id": "http://dmv.example.gov/credentials/2363",      "currentStatus": "Suspended",      "statusReason": "Investigation"    },    "issuer": "http://dmv.example.gov/",    "issued": "2017-12-04T14:27:42Z",    "proof": { ... }    },  // ... more status info here ...  }],    "proof": { ... }  } <p>Finally, you have to provide the protocol, which is HTTP&nbsp;GET.</p> GET /status/24 HTTP/1.1  Host: dmv.example.gov  Content-Type: application/ld+json  Content-Length: 1062  Accept: application/ld+json, application/json, text/plain, */* <p>Thus, this is an example of how you can implement VC Revocation.</p><p>Moving on, let’s see Affinidi’s implementation of the&nbsp;same.</p> Affinidi’s VC Revocation APIs <p>Affinidi has implemented a list-based credential revocation, and its general flow is depicted in the below&nbsp;diagram.</p><p>The specific APIs that handle VC Revocation in Affinidi’s stack&nbsp;are:</p>  CreateDidAuthRequest  Revocation list 2020 Credential (issuerDid)  BuildRevocationList2020  RevokeCredential  PublicRevocationListCredential  <p>Let’s take a look at the functionality of each of these APIs including their sample requests and responses.</p> CreateDidAuthRequest <p>In the <a href="https://revocation-api.prod.affinity-project.org/api/v1/did-auth/create-did-auth-request">CreateDidAuthRequest</a> API, the client sends a request to the server that it wants to get authenticated. The server creates a request and the client creates a response for that request using auth. This uses HTTP&nbsp;POST.</p><p>Here’s a sample of the&nbsp;request.</p> {    “audienceDid”: “string”  } <p>And the response is the “string”&nbsp;itself.</p> RevocationList2020Credential (issuerDid) <p>This API is required to check if the VC was revoked. This uses the HTTP GET protocol.</p><p>The response to this HTTP request looks like&nbsp;this.</p> {    “id”: “string”,    “@context”: [      “string”    ],    “type”: [      “string”    ],    “issuer”: “string”,    “issuanceDate”: “string”,    “credentialSubject”: {      “id”: “string”,      “type”: “string”,      “encodedList”: “string”    },    “proof”: {      “type”: “string”,      “created”: “2019–08–24T14:15:22Z”,      “proofPurpose”: “string”,      “verificationMethod”: “string”,      “jws”: “string”,      “nonce”: “string”,      “signatureValue”: “string”,      “creator”: “string”    }  }  BuildRevocationList2020 <p>As the name suggests, this API builds the revocation list and uses the HTTP POST protocol.</p><p>The request must include the credentialID and the subjectDID.</p> {    “credentialId”: “string”,    “subjectDid”: “string”  } <p>The response will be like&nbsp;this.</p> {    “credentialStatus”: {      “id”: “string”,      “type”: “string”,      “revocationListIndex”: “string”,      “revocationListCredential”: “string”    },    “revocationListCredential”: {}  }  RevokeCredential <p>This API sets the revoke status based on the id and updates the reason for revocation as well. It also uses the HTTP POST protocol.</p><p>The request will contain two parameters, as&nbsp;follows.</p> {    “id”: “string”,    “revocationReason”: “string”  } <p>The response will&nbsp;be,</p> {    “revocationListCredential”: “string”  }  PublicRevocationListCredential <p>This API is required to be a separate endpoint at the flow, to have this service generic and revocation service to not know the issuer’s private key (so issuer signing revocationListVC on his side, and then using this endpoint to publish&nbsp;it.</p><p>Thus moving forward Verifiers will be able to use it to verify/check the status of revocable VCs related to this revocationList VC).</p><p>Here’s a sample of the&nbsp;request.</p> {    “id”: “string”,    “@context”: [      “string”    ],    “type”: [      “string”    ],    “issuer”: “string”,    “issuanceDate”: “string”,    “credentialSubject”: {      “id”: “string”,      “type”: “string”,      “encodedList”: “string”    },    “proof”: {      “type”: “string”,      “created”: “2019–08–24T14:15:22Z”,      “proofPurpose”: “string”,      “verificationMethod”: “string”,      “jws”: “string”,      “nonce”: “string”,      “signatureValue”: “string”,      “creator”: “string”    }  } <p>And the response will be like&nbsp;this.</p> {    “id”: “string”,    “@context”: [      “string”    ],    “type”: [      “string”    ],    “issuer”: “string”,    “issuanceDate”: “string”,    “credentialSubject”: {      “id”: “string”,      “type”: “string”,      “encodedList”: “string”    },    “proof”: {      “type”: “string”,      “created”: “2019–08–24T14:15:22Z”,      “proofPurpose”: “string”,      “verificationMethod”: “string”,      “jws”: “string”,      “nonce”: “string”,      “signatureValue”: “string”,      “creator”: “string”    }  } <p>Thus, this is how you can revoke VCs using Affinidi’s stack. As you can discern, these APIs handle the bulk of the functionality and all that you have to do is use them in your application.</p><p>If you have any further questions on using these APIs, reach out to us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a> or <a href="mailto:developers@affinidi.com">email&nbsp;us</a>.</p><p>Also, read through our <a href="http://academy.affinidi.com">blog posts</a>, join our <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v">mailing list</a>, and follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a></p><p>The information materials contained in this article are for general information and educational purposes only.

<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021">EIC2021</a> – the headline <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/">KuppingerCole </a>event kicks off Monday 13 September in Munich – with in person attendance!




 




<a href="https://www.meeco.me/">Meeco</a> is delighted to be attending and presenting. This is a very welcome opportunity to reconnect with colleagues from around the globe and sit side by side in this hybrid event.  The European Identity and Cloud Conference returns fully digital, reacting to the global pandemic.




 




KuppingerCole has used the experience of the past eighteen months in virtual conferencing throughout to offer a safe and hygienic event experience – on-site, virtual, and hybrid.




 




This year, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow/">Katryna Dow</a>, our CEO &amp; Founder attend in person, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/smithjase/">Jason Smith</a>, our Chief Commercial Officer will beam in virtually for his presentation.




 




Both Katryna and Jason are presenting on Tuesday 14 September; Katryna in the Consumer Identity and Digital Transformation, and Jason in the Privacy and Consent Management tracks. Following is an outline of their sessions.<br>




 





 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4626">The Next Frontier: Why Decentralised Identity is only Base Camp</a> 





 




Over the past decade significant advancements have been made towards decentralised, self-sovereign and tokenised identity. Now that we can tokenise a unique value, what is the new value we can enable?




 




The emerging post-pandemic world is already calling for a new type of ‘digital’ normal. We are at the beginning of a new design and architectural phase. Personal data linked to identity, fueled by AI will sit at the centre of everything.




 




If we get this right, we may enable citizens, students, patients, passengers and consumers to more equitably join the value chains fuelled by data and identity, which in turn could lead to greater trust, personalisation and a more prosperous society.




 




However, this will require new commercial models, enforceable regulation and the digital tools to transform our connected society.&nbsp;This session will focus on the work ahead to connect services, service providers to our semantic world.




 




<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4626">Tuesday, September 14, 2021 12:00—12:20 CET</a>




 





  





 <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4652/2">Data Privacy</a> 




Do people really care about data privacy?




 




The pandemic has forced more of us into digital channels and with that has come an over sharing of personal data. It’s become too easy to upload an app and straight away put your name, email address, payment details in, without actually understanding fully where and with whom that information may be shared and why it’s being used.




 




Is this a cost that people are prepared to pay?




 




Latest research suggests a growing data privacy chasm between people and business. How can business bridge this chasm?




 




<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4652/2">Tuesday, September 14, 2021 15:50—16:10 CET</a>




 




It’s not too late to get your last-minute ticket!

  <p>Is your IGA strategy keeping up with modern threats? Novel attack methods are revealed daily, compliance requirements never stop evolving, and how and where we work has forever escaped the traditional office. As a result, organizations require more flexibility than ever to protect what matters most. You shouldn’t have to compromise functionality nor security levels because your IT resources and people operate on-premises, in the cloud or in a hybrid environment. The point is that you don’t need to.</p>
<p>Don’t miss this 20-minute keynote address by One Identity’s Rima Pawar, VP of Product Management, as she discusses the secret fears of many CISOs and other senior IT leadership and how an identity-centric security strategy can mitigate modern threats and help IT executives sleep at night. Topics will include best practices to extend security beyond the traditional perimeter; how to take an identity-centric approach to security; as well as hear how your peers are pursuing Zero Trust strategies.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-pawar-cloud-identity-centric-security"></a>

  <p>Digital ID and Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) research finds that three-quarters of Canadians feel that it’s important to have a secure, trusted, and privacy-enhancing digital ID to safely and securely make transactions online. As federal governments focus on post-pandemic recovery, investing in digital ID makes strong economic sense, especially for small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). For SMEs, the impact of digital identity could be used to improve processes that are difficult today. </p>
<p>This is especially true in situations where businesses need to provide proof of identity to another business. Considering SMEs account for approximately 30 percent of Canada’s overall GDP ($450 billion), if we assume that the average SME could be just one percent more efficient with access to trusted digital identity, this results in a potential $4.5 billion of added value to SMEs and reinvestments in the Canadian economy. This presentation will provide a detailed overview of research performed over the course of 2 years to quantify public perception and demand for secure, interoperable, digital identity that works across the whole of the economy.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-brennan-demand-for-digital-id"></a>

  <p>Everything is famously code today—cars are computers with wheels, appliances have Internet access, smart doors and houses are controlled from mobile phone apps. With all this code around, security is more of a challenge than ever. A central pillar of security is identity management: the technology that protects logins and controls access. This, too, is becoming code to work with all the other code. Libraries for developers are essential, including ID controls in mobile and Web applications for initial sign on, single sign-on, federated sign-on, biometric authentication systems, and controlling access to sensitive data. And code itself is becoming code: automation systems for producing code, deploying code, updating code, configuring resources and access controls. IAM code has to be wherever it’s needed, when it’s needed, and automated, just like any other code. The better we do this, the more secure we all are with our ubiquitous computers.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-newcomer-rise-of-developer-iam"></a>

  <p>Blue is the world’s most popular color.</p>
<p>But this was not always the case. Originally, it was little used in art and clothing, and in turn, had little symbolic cultural value. In the course of a few key decades, however, blue overcame obstacles of sourcing and production, and its popularity exploded—rising to represent some of the highest values of society.&nbsp; Subsequently, a wave of innovation democratized the color, placing it in the hands of “normal people” and cementing its cultural legacy.</p>
<p>Identity finds itself on a similar path. After a period of relative obscurity, identity has begun its rise over the past decade—but the journey is just beginning. Like blue, it faces challenges to its ascendancy—both practical and ethical. We’ll extract lessons from the trajectory of the world’s most popular hue and seek to apply them to the arc of identity.</p>
<p>The color of the world is changing once more.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-kiser-identity-is-the-new-blue"></a>

  <p>As we emerge from the first wave of digital transformation, most organizations have embraced multi-cloud and hybrid environments. Companies increasingly use digital technologies to transform the actual products and services they sell to their customers, while modern service and app architectures drive adoption of containers and micro-services. These trends pose new challenges and opportunities for security. The number of machine-to-machine interactions is growing, as is the need to establish trust in real time across many distributed systems. In this thought-provoking session, Joy Chik will explore trends that are making identity even more central to modern security.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-chik-identity-evolving-cloud-security"></a>

However, we are almost never in a greenfield position: we must interoperate with legacy systems and the demands of the business drive towards different and competing solutions for different problems.
