 Bot detection is essential for identifying nonhuman traffic on websites, mobile apps, and APIs, protecting against threats like account takeovers, transaction abuse, and denial of service attacks. With the bot detection market expected to grow from $667 million in 2023 to $3.6 billion by 2033, at an 18.3% CAGR, the demand for such technologies is rapidly increasing. This growth is driven by the anticipated rise in beneficial bots, such as AI agents and search engine crawlers, and harmful bots, which can cause significant disruptions and fraud. To address these challenges, leading providers are developing advanced solutions beyond traditional firewalls, incorporating behavioral analysis and device risk signals to identify and block malicious bots more effectively. 



 







 Evolving Threats and Modern Defenses Against Bots 



<p>The bot detection solutions market is evolving rapidly to address the growing sophistication of bots and the expansion of threat vectors. Vendors leveraging behavioral signals are well-positioned to dominate a market facing complex challenges from advanced bot activities and diverse threats. As fraudsters employ artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to launch sophisticated bot attacks, solution providers are countering with passive detection methods that emphasize user experience while effectively identifying bots. According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.imperva.com/resources/resource-library/reports/bad-bot-report/">Imperva Bad Bot Report</a>, about two-thirds of bots in 2022 were highly sophisticated malicious bots, the highest level ever recorded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Modern defenses include behavioral biometrics and device signals, moving from traditional firewalls and CAPTCHAs to more subtle, low-friction detection techniques like analyzing mouse movements and keystroke dynamics. The scope of bot detection has broadened from focusing mainly on account takeovers and transaction abuse to addressing emerging threats like programmatic ad fraud, social media fraud, and asset theft in gaming. With the rise of beneficial AI agents, distinguishing between helpful and harmful bots has become paramount, highlighting the importance of sophisticated bot detection solutions that can navigate the nuanced landscape of modern cyber threats.</p>



 The Importance of Bot Detection Across Use Cases 



<p>Bot detection serves multiple use cases, including thwarting and identifying account takeovers, web scraping, transaction abuse, programmatic ad fraud, and denial of service (DoS) attacks, such as:</p>



 
 Account Takeover Protection 



 Web Scraping Detection 



 Transaction Abuse Prevention 



 Programmatic Ad Fraud Detection 



 Denial of Service (DoS) Prevention

 The Urgent Need for Bot Detection 



<p>Businesses across various sectors, particularly the advertising industry, are becoming acutely aware of the financial losses attributed to malicious bot activities.&nbsp;Advertisers’ growing concerns over the legitimacy of website impressions have driven publishers towards adopting bot detection technologies, highlighting a pivotal shift towards ensuring the integrity of digital advertising practices.&nbsp;This awareness has led to an escalated demand for sophisticated bot detection solutions to safeguard against escalating financial threats. The evolution of bots, marked by their sophistication and the diversification of threat vectors beyond traditional attacks like denial of service (DoS) and account takeovers, has made them a tool for exploitation in more complex fraud schemes. Consequently, the necessity for accurate and authentic web traffic metrics has never been more critical. Advertisers’ growing concerns over the legitimacy of website impressions have driven publishers towards adopting bot detection technologies, highlighting a pivotal shift towards ensuring the integrity of digital advertising practices.</p>



 
 96% of Organizations Faced Financial Losses Due to Bots:&nbsp;Leading to company-wide mandates to reduce the risk of bot attacks such as account takeovers and transaction abuse.&nbsp; 
 



 
 $84 Billion in Digital Advertising Fraud: In 2023, digital advertising fraud amounted to $84 billion and is projected to escalate to $172 billion by 2028 due to rising bot activity. 
 



 
 69% Increase in CTV Bot Fraud: In 2022, bot fraud in Connected TV (CTV) surged, leading to inflated video ad impressions. This rise is part of broader trends in emerging fraud vectors, including programmatic ad fraud and AI-generated fraud on social media. 



 Estimated 68% of Twitter Users are Bots:&nbsp;This highlights concerns over first-party fraud risk and misinformation spread, urging social media companies to implement robust bot mitigation strategies. 



 57% of Marketing Campaign Spending on Digital Channels in 2022: With rapid growth expected, advertisers are emphasizing the need for bot detection to ensure traffic legitimacy. 



 Publishers Moving to First-Party Ad Strategies:&nbsp;Due to Chrome’s cookie deprecation, there’s a heightened responsibility to ensure metrics represent genuine user data. 
 



 How Bot Detection Works 



<p>Upon the arrival of website traffic, a web application firewall serves as the first line of defense as traffic progresses through the login flow – detection analysis is informed by passive signals such as mouse and keystroke dynamics.&nbsp;</p>

 Empowering Korea’s Central and Local Governments: Driving Blockchain Innovation in Government Infrastructure <p>Cities worldwide are competing to become hubs for blockchain innovation, and the City of Daegu, South Korea, is among those taking proactive steps to position itself as a leading blockchain city.</p><p>Daegu is spearheading efforts to advance the ABB (Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Big Data) sector, recognized as the key driver of future growth. With a focus on bolstering blockchain technology, Daegu has established a Blockchain Technology Innovation Support Center. The center, launched in December 2023 through a public initiative by the Ministry of Science and ICT, is dedicated to nurturing projects.</p><p>Daegu Embarks on Aergo Blockchain Mainnet</p><p>Venturing into blockchain technology, <a href="https://plus.hankyung.com/apps/newsinside.view?aid=2023112750785&amp;category=&amp;sns=y">Daegu has established public blockchain networks based on Aergo and Avalanche</a>. The goal is to integrate diverse blockchain services onto a single city-level infrastructure, paving the way for the city’s evolution into a comprehensive blockchain city. Setting itself apart from other municipalities, Daegu is prioritizing the creation of blockchain-powered services including:<br>- Non-Fungible Tokens(NFTs), <br>- Security Token Offerings(STOs), and <br>- Decentralized Identity Verification(DID)</p><p>In line with this initiative, Aergo Foundation and the City of Daegu are actively fostering the development of Proof-of-Concept cases including intelligent mobility supply chains, electronic prescriptions, and herbal product authenticity certification.</p><p>Rising Trend of Central and Local Governments Embracing Blockchain</p><p>Daegu leads the charge as an increasing number of local governments explore integrating blockchain technology into public services. Municipal authorities are actively exploring blockchain’s potential for administrative tasks like document authentication, public records maintenance, and voting systems. By embracing blockchain, local governments aim to enhance transparency, streamline bureaucratic processes, and elevate the effectiveness of governmental functions.</p><p>Leveraging the experiences from past cases, the Aergo Foundation and its key partners, including Blocko and CCCV, are spearheading efforts to develop more comprehensive and competitive use cases based on the Aergo mainnet. Furthermore, the Aergo Foundation has been actively participating in Korea’s government-led Blockchain Trust Framework(K-BTF). This case further reinforces Aergo’s commitment to establishing a presence in the public blockchain service sector. More details regarding K-BTF will be released&nbsp;soon.</p><p>Previous Aergo and Blocko Cases with the Korean Central and Local Governments</p>  Blockchain Voting: Gyeonggi-do, one of the largest provinces of Korea, implemented a blockchain-based voting system to collect resident input on community projects, resulting in a successful vote with 9,000 participants casting their votes through both online and offline channels. With the increasing interest in blockchain-based voting, we anticipate witnessing the development of more cases in this&nbsp;area.  Blockchain-based real estate administration system(land registry): Blocko implemented a blockchain solution for land registry in South Korea. The system enabled financial bodies to use government data by sharing it on a ledger across Jeju Province. Major Korean banks including Shinhan Financial Group, Korea Exchange Bank, and Korea Development Bank participated in the initiative. The banks conducted all real estate transactions based on the blockchain.  Blockchain-based micropayment: Korea’s central bank, the Bank of Korea, explored blockchain-based micropayment settlement infrastructure. Blocko provided a blockchain system for transaction validation, participant authentication, and wallet management by creating transaction processes and mobile implementations centered around the micropayment solution. The project aimed to assess the efficiency of microtransaction settlements on distributed networks in expediting transaction outputs and reducing&nbsp;costs.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/empowering-koreas-central-and-local-governments-driving-blockchain-innovation-in-government-91730fd4cd7b">Empowering Korea’s Central and Local Governments: Driving Blockchain Innovation in Government…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Hundreds of keynotes and sessions in six tracks are awaiting you. While the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/agenda">agenda</a> is already far developed, there still will be some additions. Anyway, time to have a look at the agenda. I did and selected ten favorite sessions from that long list.</p>
<p>In the morning of June 4th, one of the pre-conference sessions is the EIC2024 Decentralized ID Deployment Bootcamp. The first part of it is about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5479/1">Decentralized ID Basics, Trends &amp; Adoption: Strategic Insights Sprint for Executives</a>. Run by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3037">Dominik Beron</a>, CEO of walt.id, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/1568">Drs. Jacoba C. Sieders</a>, independent consultant, and me, we will look at where decentralized identity stands and how we expect this to evolve. The session will provide you with the understanding about everything you need to know about decentralized identity for the many other conference sessions around this topic, including eIDAS 2.0 and the EUDI wallet. A great start to the conference and a good reason for travelling in early.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of June 4th, you must not miss the keynote of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3419">Dr. Moriz Heuberger</a>, Advisor to the German Federal Ministry of the Interior and Community, on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5490">eIDAS 2.0 in Germany: Progress, Impact, Challenges</a>. With the European Parliament just recently voting for eIDAS 2.0, it is now about making it a reality.</p>
<p>Another highlight session on this subject is the panel on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5510/1">Latest on eIDAS Legislation and What it Means for People, Business and Government</a>. Here, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3462">Dr. Rob Brand</a> from the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy, Dr. Moritz Heuberger, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3453">Vedran Lalic</a>, Head of Office at European Parliament, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3243">Viky Manaila</a>, Trust Services Director at Intesi Group, will look at the eIDAS regulations and its impact.</p>
<p>Another important theme at EIC is what I have named “AIdentity”, the intersection of AI and Identity. One of the sessions you should attend is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5686/1">Redefining Human Identity in the AI Era: From Digital Evolution to AI Integration</a>. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/775">Dr. Scott David</a> will lead a panel including <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/368">Joe Andrieu</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/709">Joni Brennan</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3447">Wenjing Chu</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3515">Lynn Parker Dupree</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3507">Anil John</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/2786">Nick Mothershaw</a>, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/626">Drummond Reed</a>. AIdentity is one of the big challenges to address, with digital doubles (or twins) acting on our behalf.</p>
<p>One more session around Decentralized Identity you must not miss is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5590/1">The Wallets we Want</a>. There will be wallets. But will this be the wallets we (the consumers) want? Listen to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/2874">Daniel Goldscheider</a> from the OpenWallet Foundation, Anil John, Technical Director of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3241">Paolo de Rosa</a>, Policy Officer at the European Commission, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3556">Dr. Pramod Varma</a>, CTO of the EkStep Foundation and former Chief Architect of Aadhaar.</p>
<p>The intersection of traditional CIAM and future decentralized identity will be the topic of the panel Panel: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5602/3">Decentralized Identity for Onboarding and CIAM</a>. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/1582">Daniel Buchner</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3513">Nick Lambert</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3129">Rob Otto,</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3554">Nick Price</a> will look at how CIAM can benefit from decentralized identity.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/1005">Martin Sandren</a>, IAM Product Lead at IKEA, will talk on June 6th about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5608/2">Passkeys in the Enterprise</a>. This is a talk from practice about passkeys, a means for authenticating to services that is becoming increasingly popular.</p>
<p>Another brilliant speaker is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3401">Emilie van der Lande</a>. She will talk about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5614/1">AI's Shadow Realm: Navigating the Ethical Abyss</a>. Her talk is about the multifaceted ethical, social and technical challenges that emerge as AI systems become increasingly integral to our daily lives.</p>
<p>As many know, I’m an advocate of policy-based access control (PBAC), authorization, and just-in-time access. In the panel <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5615/2">Why Authorization Standardization is Imperative</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/924">Allan Foster</a>, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/675">David Brossard</a>, and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/589">Gerry Gebel</a> will talk about standardization for authorization and how to finally deliver on the promise that XACML once held.</p>
<p>While EIC 2024 is at the forefront of the global Identity Management evolution, you will also find a lot of down-to-earth topics on the agenda. One I want to highlight is <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5699/2">Best Practices for Resynchronizing AD and Entra ID After Forest Recovery</a>. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024/speakers/3542">Jorge de Almeida Pinto</a> will talk about this. In an age of ever-increasing cyberattacks, we must prepare for disaster. Thus, we must improve our recovery skills.</p>
<p>EIC 2024, as always, stands for both though leadership and best practices. Have a look at the agenda and don’t miss the prime discount – book latest on March 8th to benefit from the special price. EIC, as always, will be a fully hybrid event. If you ever can’t join in Berlin or not for the full four days, you still can join EIC and enjoy the great sessions and speakers.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p> There is no such thing as Privacy 
<p>In 1999, the then CEO of Sun Microsystem Scott McNealy famously said, "<a href="https://www.wired.com/1999/01/sun-on-privacy-get-over-it/">You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it</a>."&nbsp; In 2008, the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7174760.stm">TV presenter Jeremy Clarkson published his bank account details</a> after rubbishing the furore over the loss of 25 million people's personal details on two computer discs and subsequently lost money.&nbsp; Now we have reams of data protection regulations and laws, but was Scott McNealy, right?</p>
 
 
 
<p><a></a></p>
 
 
 
<p>Figure 1:&nbsp;An image generated by AI - Is this the future of privacy on the internet?</p>
 
 
 
 What is Privacy? 
<p>Different groups of people and societies consider different aspects of their life to be private. For example, while there has been concern that teenagers don’t appreciate the privacy implications of what they post on social media, a <a href="https://www.dhi.ac.uk/san/waysofbeing/data/communities-murphy-marwick-2014.pdf">UK study</a> found “…[they] are less disturbed by abstract invasions of privacy by government agencies and corporations than the very real and ever-present experience of trying to negotiate privacy in light of nosy parents.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;In Europe, the notion of privacy developed to counter the way governments had used personal data to identify and oppress individuals during the first half of the twentieth century. This led to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights - “<a href="https://fra.europa.eu/en/law-reference/european-convention-human-rights-article-8-0#:~:text=1%20Everyone%20has%20the%20right,his%20home%20and%20his%20correspondence.">Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence</a>.”</p>
<p>This legislation was conceived when only governments had the resources to collect and process data about large numbers of people and punched cards were state-of-the-art data processing technology.<a></a></p>
 GDPR, Schrems II and EU-US Data Privacy Framework 
<p>EU data protection has evolved over time. In 1995 <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A31995L0046">EU Directive (EC/95/46)</a> was enacted to enable the free flow of personal information between member states. In 2018 this was superseded by the <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679">EU General Data Protection Regulation</a>.&nbsp; In 2020 a law student, Maximilian Schrems, brought a case against Facebook objecting to Facebook transferring his personal data to the US. The so called <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/ATAG/2020/652073/EPRS_ATA(2020)652073_EN.pdf">Schrems II judgement</a> invalidated the the EU-US Data Protection Shield and led to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework which was <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/eu-us-data-transfers_en">approved by the European Commission on 10th July 2023</a>.</p>
<p>This long running saga revolved around access by the US Government to personal data of EU residents and whether the safeguards around the use of this data were equivalent in the US to those in the EU.&nbsp; So, it was really all about government access.</p>
<p>These regulations have obliged organizations and cloud service providers to adopt complex technical and legal measures to protect the personal data that they hold.</p>
<p>Properly protecting this data is a good thing but does it ensure privacy?&nbsp; Is it any more effective than the toilet brush in Figure 1?</p>
 Data is the New Capital<a></a> 
<p>The last twenty years have seen a massive explosion in the amount of data that can be collected, stored, and processed.&nbsp; Digital technology and the internet have made this possible and cloud services have made this affordable.&nbsp; Data analytics, Machine Learning and AI, in turn, have made this data extremely valuable.&nbsp; Data is the new capital.</p>
<p>Data has always been a valuable asset. The Rothschild’s family fortune was initially made by arranging to be the first to know the outcome of the battle of Waterloo.&nbsp; Analysis of deaths and disease in the 18th and 19th centuries underpinned financial services such as life insurance and annuities.</p>
<p>Although social media is often cited as the cause of the data explosion, its roots can be traced earlier.</p>
<p>In 1989 a husband-and-wife team set up a <a href="https://www.dunnhumby.com/united-kingdom/">data analytics company</a> in their home in Chiswick in London. Their approach involved understanding how to retain customers by analyzing their shopping behavior—what they referred to as being&nbsp;“voyeurs of the shopping basket.” &nbsp;&nbsp;This led to the development of customer loyalty cards.</p>
<p>The data collected by these cards provide the retailer with a deep insight into the buying habits of their customers. This data helps them to optimize the products stocked in individual stores, to identify premium customers, and, <a href="https://www.predictiveanalyticsworld.com/machinelearningtimes/target-really-predict-teens-pregnancy-inside-story/3566/">it is claimed</a>, even work out when a customer is pregnant.</p>
<p>At the start of the COVID pandemic, UK supermarkets used this data to identify and offer support to vulnerable customers before the government.</p>
<p>The person using these cards agrees to provide intimate details of their lives in return for some loyalty benefits. For retail customers, these details include dietary habits, indicators of their health problems through the purchase of off-the-shelf medication and their sexual activity.&nbsp; For hospitality cards, the data provides insights into the card holder’s travel, location, preferences, and companions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, people can choose to reveal their personal information in return for some rewards and data protection laws obliging the organizations that collect this data to protect it and limit how it is used.</p>
 Anonymity 
<p>While people knowingly disclose some personal data there is also a large amount of data about them that they may not be aware of. &nbsp;For example, the internet contains millions of images of peoples’ faces uploaded to social media, published on news websites, and other open sources.&nbsp; This includes people who may not have been the main subject of a photo but who were in the background.&nbsp; This data can be used by AI facial recognition technology to identify individuals from data that they did not even know existed.&nbsp; Is this fair and if so, how should we use this data?</p>
<p>The firm <a href="https://www.clearview.ai/">Clearview AI</a> has developed a facial recognition system that they claim can help law enforcement to identify suspects, witnesses, and victims.&nbsp; They also claim this technology has helped find child predators, rescue victims, and track down the suspects involved in the Capitol Riots.</p>
<p>These are laudable aims but not every country’s data privacy laws support this approach. In 2022, the UK Information Commissioners Office (ICO) fined Clearview AI £7.5M for allegedly unlawfully storing facial images.&nbsp; In November 2023, this fine was overturned in a <a href="https://assets.caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukftt/grc/2023/819/ukftt_grc_2023_819.pdf">judgement by the First Tier Tribunal</a>.&nbsp; The ICO is now <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/media-centre/news-and-blogs/2023/11/information-commissioner-seeks-permission-to-appeal-clearview-ai-inc-ruling/">seeking permission to appeal</a> this judgement.&nbsp; There are <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2023/decision-austrian-sa-against-clearview-ai-infringements-articles-5-6-9-27_en">similar disputes within the EU</a>.</p>
<p>The Light of Other Days, a&nbsp;2000 science fiction novel&nbsp;written by&nbsp;Stephen Baxter, based on a synopsis by&nbsp;Arthur C. Clarke examines the impact on society of a quantum-based technology that allowed anyone to see and hear what was happening anywhere and at any time. This shattered all normal concepts of privacy. When people realized that they can be observed and can observe others without their knowledge it profoundly changed their behavior. While this allowed the perpetrators of crimes to be correctly identified and politicians’ plots to be uncovered, it altered society in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>Today, the internet contains a vast amount of publicly available data about everyone as well as a history of everything they wrote and liked on social media – how will this change us?</p>

<p>Scotland’s The Herald recently ran an article talking about how technology could be used to genuinely improve health and care services. It <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/24140446.prof-george-crooks-dhi-spearheading-hi-tech-solutions-nhs/">quotes Professor George Crooks</a>, head of Scotland’s Digital and Health Care Innovation Centre, saying it is time for a digital revolution which will empower both patients and free up clinical staff to direct their efforts to where it is most&nbsp;needed.</p><blockquote>It may sound like science fiction, but Prof Crooks foresees a future where citizens are empowered to make decisions through having detailed knowledge of their own health needs, gathered by constant collection of data which flows into the hands of medical professionals digitally.</blockquote><blockquote>The ongoing health needs of individual Scots would be recorded in a data cloud accessible to themselves and those who need it, providing scope for targeted care on a round-the-clock basis.</blockquote><blockquote>Even details such as whether there are pets that need taken care of should someone need to go into hospital would be recorded, along with data which could even predict when care might be needed before a problem manifests in such a way that the health need becomes&nbsp;urgent.</blockquote><blockquote>The success of this programme, and the ethos behind it, is what Prof Crooks would like to see happen NHS Scotland as the digital revolution takes&nbsp;hold.</blockquote><p>Professor Crooks said: “Scotland’s medical model of care, that has served us very well for the past 150 years, is no longer fit for purpose in the 21st Century. We must move away from our existing approach to one where we listen to, activate, and empower our citizens to make better informed health and wellbeing choices supported by resources in their communities.</p><p>“The only way that can happen is through the appropriate use of digital technologies allied to an understanding of the lived experience of people in Scotland, using our expertise to co-design with them, and tailoring services to meet their personal and local circumstances. That’s the crux of the knowledge, skills and experience DHI has acquired over the past 10&nbsp;years.”</p><p>We, Mydex CIC, are proud to say we have been working with DHI over the past eight years to build the personal data infrastructure needed to make such an approach work. This infrastructure is now being used in an increasing number of projects.</p><p>The NHS faces relentless operational, front line and demographic challenges, compounded by increasing financial constraints. For example, the combined financial deficit in Scotland’s NHS Health Boards and Health &amp; Social Care Partnerships now approaching one billion pounds for 2024–2025. Yet service providers in the third, public and independent sectors still have to find a way to deliver the best possible&nbsp;service.</p><p>It’s possible for them to work together on this, to develop a common vision and delivery plan for the future that is inclusive, building human rights and operational efficiencies into how it works. The person centred data infrastructure that is now available helps achieve&nbsp;this.</p><p>Our next blogs explore in detail how this infrastructure works.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-positive-vision-for-health-af66990ca7e9">A Positive Vision for Health</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — February 21st to March&nbsp;4th <p>Welcome to the latest Veriscope Regulatory Recap. In this edition, we dive into Taiwan’s upcoming digital asset regulations, Russia’s FATF assessment, the US’s legislative push on crypto reporting, and the UK’s steps towards regulating stablecoins and staking services. Join us as we navigate these global shifts in the crypto regulatory landscape.</p> Global Crypto Regulatory Shifts <p>Around the globe, countries are revisiting their regulatory stances on cryptocurrencies, marking a period of significant adaptation in response to the digital asset market’s expansion.</p><p>In Taiwan, the Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) is preparing to present new digital asset regulations by September 2024, focusing on investor protection and market integrity. This move is part of Taiwan’s broader effort to address the challenges and opportunities presented by the integration of digital assets into the traditional financial ecosystem.</p><p>Another major development over the last two weeks came from Russia, as its standing with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has shifted due to perceived gaps in crypto oversight. Reportedly, the FATF’s assessment points to the need for clearer guidelines and definitions within Russia’s regulatory framework to monitor and control digital financial transactions effectively.</p><p>In North America, the United States is witnessing legislative efforts aimed at refining the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and related services. Recent proposals challenge existing guidance on financial institutions’ reporting of crypto assets and seek to bolster the Secret Service’s capabilities in investigating crypto-related cybercrimes.</p><p>Meanwhile, the UK is advancing towards implementing cryptocurrency regulations, with a focus on stablecoins and staking services.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/shyftnetwork/status/1761086134405255416?s=20">Image Source</a>)<p>These developments highlight a global trend towards recalibrating regulatory frameworks to better accommodate the unique aspects of digital assets. As countries grapple with the complexities of crypto regulation, the outcomes of these efforts will likely shape the future of digital&nbsp;finance.</p> Taiwan Sets September Deadline for Comprehensive Crypto Regulation <p>Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission is gearing up to introduce a draft of new digital asset regulations in September 2024, marking a significant step towards regulating the burgeoning digital asset market. The draft, as outlined by FSC Chairman Huang Tien-mu, aims to bolster market regulation and investor safety amidst concerns over the potential for fraud within the digital currency&nbsp;space.</p><p>The proposed legislation, including the Virtual Asset Management Bill introduced in October, seeks to enhance customer protection and industry oversight, imposing stiff penalties for non-compliance.</p><p>Speaking of its possible impact on Taiwan’s crypto ecosystem, clearer regulations may attract more institutional investors, fostering a safer and more stable investment environment. On the downside, stringent measures and the potential for heavy fines could dampen innovation, especially among startups and smaller entities struggling with compliance costs.</p> US House Committee Challenges SEC&nbsp;Guidance <p>The US House Financial Services Committee has shown majority support to repeal the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which mandates financial institutions to list customers’ crypto assets on their balance sheets. This guidance, criticized for potentially inflating balance sheets and hindering banks from engaging in digital asset custody, faces opposition for its implications on the sector’s operational dynamics.</p><p>Critics argue that SAB 121 limits traditional financial institutions’ participation in the burgeoning crypto market, especially in the context of the SEC’s approval for spot Bitcoin ETFs, predominantly custodied by non-bank entities. On the flip side, proponents of the guidance advocate for its role in clarifying custody responsibilities amid the volatile crypto landscape.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-crypto-travel-rule-compliance-in-japan">A Guide to Crypto Travel Rule Compliance in&nbsp;Japan</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-philippines">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in the Philippines</a></p><p>VASPs need a Travel Rule Solution to comply with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>We have all been witnessing the transformative power of generative artificial intelligence (AI), with the promise to reshape all aspects of human society and commerce while companies simultaneously grapple with acute business imperatives. In 2024, companies confront significant disruption, requiring them to redefine labor productivity to prevent unrealized revenue, safeguard the software supply chain from attacks, and embed sustainability into operations to maintain competitiveness.<br><br>AI is at a turning point, driving exponential advancements in an organization’s prosperity and growth. Generative AI (gen AI) introduces transformative innovation to all aspects of a business; from the front to the back office, through ongoing technology modernization, and into new product and service development.<br><br>While many organizations have implemented AI, the need to keep a competitive edge and foster business growth demands new approaches: simultaneously evolving AI strategies, showcasing their value, enhancing risk postures and adopting new engineering capabilities. This requires a holistic enterprise transformation. We refer to this transformation as becoming an AI+ enterprise.</p>



 Become an AI+ enterprise 



<p>An AI+ enterprise innovates with AI as the primary focus, understands that AI is fundamental to the entire business, and recognizes that AI impacts all aspects of the business: product innovation, business operations, technical operations, as well as people and culture.&nbsp;</p>



Figure 1: Transforming into an AI+ enterprise is at the core of what our team at IBM does



<p>An AI+ enterprise integrates AI as a first-class function across the business. They understand that if one area of the business adopts AI while others lag or resist it (due to valid concerns), this exacerbates issues like Shadow AI, making it challenging to implement a holistic strategy.</p>



 Benefits of being an AI+ enterprise 



<p>The vast business opportunity with AI, forecasted by Gartner to bring USD 3 to 4 trillion in economic benefits to the global economy across industries, prompts companies to recognize the investment required to use AI effectively, and are demanding a dramatic return on investment (ROI) before investing in an AI use case.</p>



<p>By becoming an AI+ enterprise, clients can realize the ROI not only for the AI use case but also for improving the related business and technical capabilities required to deliver AI use cases into production at scale.</p>



Figure 2: ROI potential by transforming into an AI+ enterprise



<p>Organizations with high data maturity that embed an AI+ transformation model into the enterprise fabric and culture can generate up to 2.6 times higher ROI.</p>



<p>IBM has developed AI+ Enterprise Transformation to equip clients with the business and technical strategy, architectures, roadmaps and hands-on experience to become an AI+ enterprise.</p>



 AI+ Enterprise Transformation 



<p>With IBM’s depth in AI and hybrid cloud, we have discovered that companies becoming an AI+ enterprise leads to faster realization of business results. What’s exciting is that many clients we work with are already excelling in AI, and by adopting AI+ Enterprise Transformation, they uncover activities that accelerate their business growth through running AI in production at scale.</p>



Figure 3: AI+ enterprise domain overview



<p>Figure 3 summarizes AI+ Enterprise Transformation, highlighting the multiple domains across the organization that an AI+ enterprise needs to address to bring AI to production at scale:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Key use cases that enhance business performance 



 Responsible AI technology to implement these use cases 



 A well-designed data foundation to fuel AI initiatives 



 Application innovation to deliver AI experiences, and application modernization to handle AI requests 



 Hybrid cloud platform, including integrations, to run AI, data and applications as required 



 Building pipelines for continuous updates, enhancements and fixes of apps, data and AI, with deployment protection through scanning and guardrails 



 Day-2 operations using AI to predict (and repair) failures before they happen, fostering a culture where employees embrace AI’s value instead of fearing replacement. 



 Security, governance, risk and compliance mechanisms are essential not only for governing AI but also for managing the IT estate running AI, providing evidence for regulatory compliance. 
 



 Start with the use cases 



<p>The most important step for an AI+ enterprise is identifying transformative use cases. After experimenting with various options, the enterprise selects high-value use cases that show faster ROI. It then delivers them into production across the IT landscape, laying the groundwork for additional use cases and fostering ongoing innovation.</p>



<p>Figure 4 illustrates the AI+ use case funnel that an AI+ enterprise adopts to systematically and rigorously transform use cases into broad-reaching AI enterprise solutions that deliver high ROI, aligned across delivery, operations, security and governance. &nbsp;</p>



Figure 4: AI+ use case funnel to deliver AI solutions to production at scale



 Harness the right AI technology 



<p>After identifying use cases, the next step for an AI+ enterprise is choosing the appropriate AI technology and architecture. Often, this decision is made too quickly. It should be approached thoughtfully to help ensure suitability.</p>



<p>Consider the following:</p>



 
 Do you need a public foundation model? 



 Should you build your own? If so, where will it run? 



 Should you use a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) model by pairing your data with a public foundation model? 



 Do you use gen AI out of the box? How can you master prompt engineering? When should you prompt-tune or fine-tune? 



 Which approach requires on-premises GPUs? 



 Where do you harness gen AI vs. predictive AI vs. AI orchestration? For instance, when automating password change requests, do you need a 175 billion parameter public foundation model, a fine-tuned smaller model, or AI orchestration to call APIs? 
 



<p>As you pinpoint your AI technology, your decision impacts the other domains of AI+ Enterprise Transformation. For more insights, keep reading.</p>



 Deliver a strong data foundation 



<p>AI relies fundamentally on data. An AI+ enterprise ensures that the data used for AI is trustworthy, transparent, and has clear lineage and efficacy. Otherwise, the risks become too significant. We have all seen examples of companies delivering AI built on weak data foundations, leading to undesirable outcomes. These outcomes typically fall into one of three categories, none of which are desirable:</p>



 
 Not useful: Customers remain unimpressed with your results. For example, stale data, hallucinations and more. 



 Embarrassing: Offensive output emerges based on the data used in AI. For example, hate, abuse, profanity and bias. 



 Financial/criminal: Violations of existing and emerging data and AI regulations. For example, copyright laws, the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence act, Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), data sovereignty laws and more. 
 



<p>An AI+ enterprise empowers architects to confidently source, prepare, transform, protect and deliver data to the required locations for AI.&nbsp;</p>



 Innovate and modernize applications 



<p>Innovating with new AI-based applications to deliver outstanding experiences is essential. It’s also crucial to modernize existing applications that interact with AI. if an AI-powered human resources assistant offers to perform actions for employees, it is vital to ensure that the application being called can handle increased traffic. Frequently, these actions involve calling APIs to legacy applications running on architectures unfit for handling the sudden demands of the AI assistant. This often leads to a disappointing experience due to slow response times.</p>



<p>An AI+ enterprise excels in delivering innovative AI applications to its customers and modernizing existing applications to meet the new demands AI presents.</p>



 Hybrid cloud platform 



<p>Once AI, data and applications are understood, the discussion naturally shifts to “Where do we run this solution?” In our experience, the answer depends on many factors, which can change over time, requiring a flexible platform.</p>



<p>Adopting an open technologies-based hybrid cloud platform enables an AI+ enterprise to make informed decisions without limiting its business.</p>



Figure 5: AI+ enterprise hybrid cloud architecture



<p>As shown in figure 5, a hybrid cloud architecture enhances the entire business in various ways:</p>



 
 Flexibility in where to train and tune large models 



 Flexibility in where to train and tune smaller models 



 Where to perform inferencing on-premises, in private clouds or even on edge devices 



 Applications using RAG architectures experience less latency when running close to the models 



 Data sovereignty laws limit data relocation, so having the ability to move AI and applications to the data is essential 



 Creating an AI+ fabric that provides interconnectivity across the IT and business landscape 
 



 Continuously build and enhance apps, data and AI 



<p>When AI, data and applications run across a well-designed hybrid cloud platform, an AI+ enterprise builds pipelines and toolchains to continuously enhance and deliver with full automation. For example:</p>



 
 Platform pipelines provision and update infrastructure and the software running on them using Terraform and Ansible 



 Application pipelines integrate and deliver code updates for both innovative applications delivering AI experiences and modernized applications being acted upon by AI digital workers 



 Data pipelines process incoming data to help ensure that the data sources used by AI are current and valid 



 AI pipelines pull in data, retrain and augment as needed based on metrics such as drift and accuracy 
 



<p>An AI+ enterprise knows how to continually enhance applications, data and AI models throughout their lifecycle, helping to ensure that only trusted and approved AI functions go live.</p>



 Operations 



<p>Incidents occur, even in an AI-first world. However, an AI+ enterprise uses AI not only to delight customers but also to solve IT problems. With the right tools, an AI+ enterprise can significantly increase employee productivity. Examples include:</p>



 
 Detecting and correcting when an application is being constrained and automating capacity increases 



 Providing visibility and insight across the enterprise to enable higher levels of automation and achieve predictive maintenance 



 Reducing security threats by closing security gaps before they arise. For example, by using compliance control scanning of terraform templates to fail provisioning if controls are not met. 
 



<p>An AI+ enterprise also recognizes that alongside the necessary tools, fostering a culture that embraces AI and trains talent is crucial. This culture encourages experimentation and expertise growth. It requires people trained to harness, evaluate, and accelerate AI, rather than fearing it.</p>



 Secure and govern AI on the hybrid cloud platform 



<p>To deploy AI, particularly gen AI, at scale in production, organizations must establish a secure and governed environment. The scale and impact of next-generation AI emphasize the importance of governance and risk controls. An AI+ enterprise mitigates potential harm by implementing robust measures to secure, monitor and explain AI models, as well as monitoring governance, risk and compliance controls across the hybrid cloud environment.</p>



<p>Pairing existing cloud governance with new AI governance controls is essential, requiring continual focus to comply with emerging regulatory changes, such as NIST AI Risk Management Framework, the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence act, ISO/IEC 42001 AI Management, and ISO/IEC 23894 AI Risk Management.</p>

<p>If you’re in the technology sector (or really, if you’re involved in any business that relies on digital technology at all), you’ve likely heard the buzz around 5G. The latest high-speed cellular network standard is poised to transform wireless connectivity as we know it and usher in a new age of digital transformation.</p>



<p>Like any new technology, however, it’s wise to take a step back and consider the pros and cons before diving in. In this article, we’re going to look at some of the advantages and disadvantages of 5G networks so you can make an informed decision for your business.</p>



 What is 5G? 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/5g">5G (fifth-generation mobile technology)</a> is the new standard for cellular networks. First released by mobile phone companies in 2019, it relies on radio frequencies for data transmission like its predecessors 3G, 4G and 4G LTE networks. However, improvements in latency and bandwidth give 5G certain advantages like lightning-fast download and upload speeds, improved connectivity, and greater reliability. &nbsp;</p>



 Why is 5G important? 



<p>In the four years since it burst onto the market, 5G has been widely touted as a disruptive technology, capable of transformation on a similar scale to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things&nbsp;(IoT)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">machine learning (ML)</a>. As mobile broadband technology expands, the amount of data generated every day is increasing exponentially to the point where 3G and 4G network infrastructures simply can’t handle it. Enter 5G, with its speedy download and upload times and wider bandwidths capable of handling much larger volumes of data.</p>



 Advantages of 5G technology 



<p>In addition to faster speeds and upload/download times, there are several other important differences between 5G and 3G/4G networks worth noting:</p>



 Smaller physical footprint 



<p>5G uses smaller transmitters than its predecessors, allowing for them to be placed discretely on buildings, inside trees or in other out-of-the-way places. The cells (or “small cells”) that wireless networks&nbsp;rely on for connectivity are also smaller in 5G networks and require less power to run.</p>



 Reduced error rates 



<p>5G’s adaptive Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)—a schematic for sending data from&nbsp;WiFi&nbsp;devices—is better than the MCS used in 4G and 3G. The result is that the Block Error Rate (BER), which is used for measuring the frequencies of errors in a network, is extremely low. On a 5G network, when the BER increases to a certain level, the transmitter lowers the connection speed until the error rate drops. Essentially, 5G networks trade speed for accuracy in&nbsp;real-time so their BER is always near zero. &nbsp;</p>



 Better bandwidth 



<p>5G networks can utilize a much broader range of bandwidths than previous networks. By expanding the spectrum of resources it can utilize from sub-3 GHz to 100 GHz and even higher, 5G’s range can include both lower and higher frequencies. This expands the network’s overall capacity and throughput by allowing it to function across a much wider spectrum of bandwidths, increasing the number of devices it can support at a time.</p>



 Lower latencies 



<p>5G’s low latency (the amount of time it takes data to travel from one point to another on a network) enables the speeds that make activities like downloading a file or interacting with the cloud 10x faster than on a 4G or 3G network. While&nbsp;4G networks deliver latencies of around 200&nbsp;milliseconds,&nbsp;5G networks routinely deliver them as low as a single&nbsp;millisecond.</p>



 Disadvantages of 5G 



<p>Like any emerging technology, there are as many reasons for caution with 5G as for excitement. Let’s take a look at some of the concerns preventing both consumers and enterprises from wholeheartedly embracing it. &nbsp;</p>



 Cybersecurity 



<p>While 5G’s algorithms are even more comprehensive than its predecessors, users are still vulnerable to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cyber-attacks">cyberattacks</a>. One area of concern is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/encryption">encryption</a>. While apps on 5G networks are encrypted, the 5G NR standard doesn’t have end-to-end encryption, leaving it open to certain kinds of attacks. &nbsp;</p>



 Network slicing 



<p>While network slicing is a popular feature of 5G networks, it’s also an area for vigilance. When creating a virtual network for a specific functionality, 5G software is exposed to hackers, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/malware">malware</a> and other potential breaches. Once a breach has occurred, malware or spyware has the potential to spread throughout a carrier’s infrastructure or networked devices, causing problems across whole enterprises. &nbsp;</p>



 Infrastructure 



<p>To move services and functionality onto a 5G network, businesses must weigh the cost and time needed to upgrade their equipment so it’s 5G compatible. This can be both time-consuming and expensive. Typically, an enterprise that has relied on 3G or 4G networks for some time has already made a large investment in their equipment. Replacing it and upskilling workers so they can deploy and maintain the new infrastructure presents a significant obstacle.</p>



 Gaps in coverage 



<p>With the rollout of 5G technology worldwide, many large urban areas now have 5G coverage. However, it’s important to note that 5G still isn’t everywhere and won’t be for a long time. Many remote areas, for example, don’t have a 5G connection or only offer limited coverage. Before companies upgrade to 5G they should take a look at where they plan on using it—especially if they operate in rural areas—to ensure they will have 5G coverage.</p>



 Penetration 



<p>The high-frequency radio waves that 5G signals travel on are easily blocked by common objects such as buildings and/or trees so ensuring seamless routes for the waves to travel can be a problem. Factories and offices present unique challenges that have caused some businesses to redesign facilities in a way that is more 5G network-friendly.</p>



 How does 5G technology work? 



<p>5G networks are divided into geographical sections known as cells. Within these cells, wireless devices like smartphones, tablets and computers connect to the internet or phone network by sending radio waves between a base station and an antennae. The underlying technology of a 5G network is the same as that of a 3G or 4G network, but its download speeds are much faster. Some 5G networks’ download speeds can reach as high as 10 gigabits per second (Gbps) if only a few devices are on the network.</p>



<p>As 5G technology reaches more and more customers and the number of applications that support it continues to grow, its popularity with telecommunications companies and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) is also expected to increase. In North America, for example, the most popular ISPs for home internet—Verizon, Google and AT&amp;T—have already adopted it and <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1133823/north-america-5g-subscriptions/">more than 200 million homes subscribe to it</a> (links resides outside ibm.com).</p>



<p>Three key functionalities set 5G technology apart: </p>



 
 Cellular standards 



 Network slicing  



 Private networks 
 



<p>Here’s a closer look at each of those areas, why they are unique to 5G and how they help the technology function.</p>



 New cellular standard 



<p>The 5G NR (New Radio) standard for cellular networks is the new radio access technology (RAT) specification built specifically for 5G mobile networks. In 2018, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3FPP) set out to develop a new global standard for mobile networks to guide the development of devices and applications on 5G networks. Today, cellular networks and manufacturers wishing to power or design 5G devices simply have to follow the 5G NR standard to be in compliance—increasing the ease and likelihood of 5G expansion. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en/reports-and-papers/mobility-report/dataforecasts/network-coverage#:~:text=The%20build%2Dout%20of%205G,around%2085%20percent%20in%202029.">a recent report by&nbsp;Ericsson</a>&nbsp;(link resides outside ibm.com), 45% of networks worldwide were 5G compatible by the end of 2023, with that number forecasted to rise to 85% by the end of the decade.</p>



 Network slicing 



<p>On a 5G network, operators can deploy several independent virtual networks on the same infrastructure, powering numerous <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/telecom-cloud-network-slicing-enterprise-5g-opportunities/">business applications</a> and enabling users to do even more complex tasks remotely than they can today. For example, enterprises that want to divide up wireless functionality by use case or business model can form a “collection” on a 5G network. Collections give users on that network a more reliable, consistent experience on the mobile device of their choice than would have been possible in previous generations of wireless technology.</p>



 Private networks 



<p>5G technology allows users to create a private network with enhanced personalization features, such as secure access, improved quality control and added mobility. Because of these features, private 5G is fast becoming popular with global enterprises who want all the power and features of 5G but with added security layers for their business. Private&nbsp;5G networks&nbsp;let companies manage multiple devices, services and applications in a highly private, secure and efficient environment—more than any public network.&nbsp;</p>



 5G use cases 



<p>Now that we have a fuller picture of the pros and cons to consider when it comes to 5G and how the new technology works, let’s take a look at how it’s being applied in the real world.</p>



 
 Autonomous vehicles: Until 5G came along, fully autonomous cars couldn’t operate independently using the 3G and 4G networks available to them because the speed at which they needed to transmit and receive information wasn’t supported. 5G’s lightning-fast capabilities open up the possibility that in the near future, self-driving cars will be as ubiquitous as taxis and delivery trucks on roads everywhere. 



 Smart factories: With AI and ML, factories everywhere are already becoming smarter and more efficient. 5G will make even more leaps possible in the future, enabling the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/automation">automation</a> of more tasks, deployment of cameras and drones to do jobs that previously required a person, and the connection of thousands of smart devices to the internet. It’s dizzying to think of all the potential applications of 5G in the factory setting. This is one area where it is most likely to have a highly disruptive and transformative impact, potentially changing everything from the way fuel usage is measured and optimized, to the design of equipment lifecycles, to how goods are delivered to customers. 



 Smart cities: With 5G, urban areas will be able to accomplish everyday tasks like waste and air quality management far more efficiently than ever before. By deploying new <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of T</a>hings (IoT) devices connected to the Internet via 5G networks, cities can manage activities like traffic control, electricity management, waste disposal and even law enforcement with far more control than in the past. 



 Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR): Virtual reality&nbsp;(digital environments that shut out the real world) and&nbsp;augmented reality&nbsp;(digital content that augments the real world) both rely heavily on&nbsp;5G technology to function and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/ar-vr-workplace">have numerous business applications</a>. For example, mobile phones&nbsp;and smart glasses using virtual and&nbsp;augmented reality&nbsp;technology that runs on 5G networks are already adding digital overlays, live views and other capabilities to stockroom employees, delivery drivers, maintenance workers and more. 



 Edge computing: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/edge-computing">Edge computing</a> refers to a distributed computing framework that brings enterprise applications closer to data sources. Naturally, any technology that relies on the movement of large volumes of data in a wireless environment is going to be enhanced by 5G. In&nbsp;edge computing, 5G specifically brings computation and data storage closer to where data is generated on the network, enabling greater control, lowering costs, and speeding the delivery of insights. According to a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/what-edge-computing-means-for-infrastructure-and-operations-leaders">Gartner whitepaper</a>&nbsp;(link resides outside ibm.com), by 2025, 75% of enterprise data will be processed through&nbsp;edge computing,&nbsp;compared to only 10% today.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p> Setting the stage 
<p>On February 29, 2024, the European Union (EU) Parliament <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20240223IPR18095/meps-back-plans-for-an-eu-wide-digital-wallet">voted </a>in favor of amendments to the eIDAS regulation, marking a significant milestone on the road to a unified standard for European digital identity services. The regulation, which is expected to enter into force by the end of March upon publication in the Official Journal of the EU, will trigger a series of implementation steps. The countdown begins with a six-month period to finalize the technical specifications of the EU Digital ID Wallet, followed by adjustments based on legal file and experiences in large scale pilots. By 2026, all EU member states are mandated to provide digital wallets to every resident, accessible at no cost for acquisition and usage.</p>
<p>Under the new regulation, citizens and businesses could potentially leverage digital wallets to link various personal attributes securely, including driving licenses, diplomas, and national ID cards. Section 5 of the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework">Architecture Reference Framework</a> lists the current mandatory, optional, and possible additional attributes that are included in the eIDAS framework.</p>
<p>The implementation of eIDAS promises a secure, privacy-friendly means for individuals to prove their identity and electronically sign documents, fostering access to public and private services across the EU. The removal of virtual borders facilitated by eIDAS is anticipated to deepen the Digital Single Market and foster further integration within the EU. However, the true measure of success lies in ensuring that these principles extend beyond the borders of the EU.</p>
 Bridging boundaries 
<p>Achieving interoperability at various levels is essential, including integration with internal organizational systems and compatibility with other verified identity solutions. To gain widespread adoption, the wallet must provide user-friendliness and work seamlessly across international boundaries. Embracing interoperability as a guiding principle is not merely a matter of compliance but a strategic imperative for organizations aiming to thrive in an increasingly interconnected digital world.</p>
<p>Moreover, digital identity issuance and applicability should not be limited to a single organization or use case. If a user possesses a verified digital identity, they should have the ability to utilize it across various purposes, with diverse service providers spanning different industries, and even with public institutions. Consequently, solutions need to be adaptable and scalable, offering flexibility to accommodate varying levels of assurance for each use case or process, while also being scalable to meet the evolving demands of interoperability and security.</p>
<p>At EIC 2023, several presentations focused on digital identity in the context of eIDAS and the EU Digital Identity Wallet. These included presentations that considered how digital wallets can be used in the private sector in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eudi-wallet-eic-2023">EUDI Wallet - Critical Success factors for Digital Single Market and Private Sector Use</a>; how organizations can take advantage of the latest developments in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-identity-wallets-eic2023">eIDAS 2.0 &amp; Digital Identity Wallet Readiness: What Your Organization Needs to Know About Digital Identity Wallets</a>; and the potential challenges and use cases in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-identity-wallets-eic2023">eIDAS 2.0 &amp; EU Digital Identity Wallet</a>.</p>
 Maximizing business potential 
<p>In my previous blog post, I delved into some of the challenges posed by the eIDAS regulation and the EU Digital ID Wallet. However, in this post, we will shift our focus to explore the potential business advantages. Moving beyond the regulatory landscape, the business implications of digital identities extend far beyond traditional Identity and Access Management (IAM) frameworks. These digital identities serve as enablers for cross-organizational use, offering <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80803/reusable-verified-identity">reusable</a>, decentralized approaches that improve and expand business processes. In addition, as discussed in this <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80858/how-enterprises-will-learn-to-love-decentralized-ids-the-roles-of-distributed-and-sovereign-identiti#heading4">Advisory Note</a>, enterprises have already reached a point where centralized identity management is neither desirable nor possible because existing centralized approaches to identity, authentication, interoperability, and security don't fit and won't scale with emerging technologies.</p>
<p>To ensure adoption and integration within enterprises, the following areas will be addressed by the EU Digital Identity Wallet:</p>
 
 Identity Verification (KYC):&nbsp;The EU Wallet will offer robust identity verification capabilities to streamline Know Your Customer (KYC) processes for organizations. By leveraging secure and efficient verification methods, enterprises can enhance the security and reliability of customer identity verification. 
 Strong User Authentication: Enterprises mandated to implement strong user authentication measures will benefit from the EU Wallet's advanced authentication features. 
 Integration with Major Platforms: The EU Wallet will support authentication on major online platforms, including social networks, search engines, and e-commerce marketplaces. By enabling interoperability with these gatekeeper platforms, enterprises can ensure widespread acceptance of the EU Wallet among users. 
 
<p>Therefore, as organizations navigate the implications of eIDAS and the EU Digital Identity Wallet, it's imperative to recognize not only the challenges but also the vast array of business opportunities presented. The wallet serves as a central repository for proof of identity and other attributes, streamlining numerous business use cases and offering users unparalleled convenience. In addition, integrating digital wallets with existing IAM systems can streamline onboarding processes for remote workers, saving time and money while increasing security. For partner collaboration, digital identity wallets provide secure access to shared resources and data, promoting trust while ensuring privacy and compliance.</p>
<p>Regardless of their size or industry, enterprises can benefit significantly from adopting digital identity wallet solutions. By embracing these technologies and tailoring their implementation strategies to their specific needs and challenges, businesses can unlock new opportunities for growth, innovation, and user satisfaction in today's digital economy.</p>
<p>Find out what identity, cloud, and security industry experts, thought leaders, practitioners, and peers are thinking and doing by joining us at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">EIC 2024</a> taking place in Berlin and online from 4-7 June.  We will be discussing the latest developments and the role that digital identities play in the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/mtracks/169">enterprise </a>space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Global Impact: How will the EU Digital Identity Wallet affect non-EU residents or businesses operating outside the EU?</p>
<br>The European Digital Identity Wallet should apply to the EU's nearly 450 million residents, but experts say its impact could be felt far beyond that because of the EU's leadership role in creating regulations and policies that serve as a global standard.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Security Concerns: What are the key security challenges, and how does the regulation address them to ensure the protection of user data?</p>
<br>Given that the EU Digital Identity Wallet requires the storage of documents, cryptographic keys, and other sensitive information on mobile platforms, it is vulnerable to various risks, including loss, hardware malfunction, and unauthorized access by hackers and thieves. Protecting the integrity and confidentiality of digital wallet data is critical and requires robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and ensure controlled access for authorized users. Nevertheless, its legal backing and the EU's commitment to neutrality, security and user privacy sets the EU Digital Identity Wallet apart from corporate digital wallets.</blockquote>

<p>The Australian parliament is working on the government’s <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_LEGislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=s1404&amp;utm_source=stilgherrian&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-weekly-cybers-7">Digital ID Bill 2023</a>. After passing the lower house, the Bill has been considered by a senate committee <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/DigitalIDBills2023?utm_source=stilgherrian&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-weekly-cybers-7">inquiry</a>, which included hearing a day’s worth of expert testimony.&nbsp; The committee’s report has now been <a href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Economics/DigitalIDBills2023/Report?utm_source=stilgherrian&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the-weekly-cybers-7">tabled</a>.</p>
<p>The committee recommended that the senate approve the Bill, but as usual, a number of opposition politicians wrote dissenting reports.</p>
<p>Two sorts of objections are worth correcting because they reflect serious misunderstandings of the Digital ID Bill and of the whole field of digital identity.</p>
 The Digital ID Bill has no new ID 
<p>The Coalition Senators’ Dissenting Report at paragraph 1.16 alleges:</p>
<p>“It seems that [the government] has decided on a more syndicated model that centralises Digital ID in government hands, disregarding the Murray Review’s warnings. By departing from a truly federated approach to Digital ID, Labor is risking the integrity of the entire premise of such a framework.”</p>
<p>I will come back to the Murray Review shortly. For now, I only want to stress that the Digital ID Bill is not a “syndicated” model of digital identities. It is not any sort of model of digital identity.</p>
<p>The Digital ID Bill introduces no new IDs whatsoever. The whole point of the legislation is to conserve existing IDs and make them more reliable in digital form.</p>
 Federated identity has been tried and tried 
<p>The Coalition Senators are much attached to federated identity. They call out the 2014 <a href="https://treasury.gov.au/publication/c2014-fsi-final-report">Murray Inquiry into the Financial System</a> which recommended a public-private federation of trusted digital identities. And they’re obviously proud of the public sector Trusted Digital Identity Framework (TDIF) launched in 2018.</p>
<p>Yet the dissenting report doesn’t mention the private sector trust framework effort.</p>
<p>Following Murray, the government worked on TDIF while the Australian Payments Council took on a parallel financial services trust framework called TrustID. After many years work, the TrustID working group was unable to reach consensus on use cases for banking digital identities, and the framework was quietly dropped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my view, more attention should be given to the impasse on TrustID use cases when digital identity is thought to be so urgent. That’s quite a paradox!&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact is that federated identity has been tried over and over in Australia, and in comparable economies, and it has <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/what-will-we-learn-from-the-market-failure-of-digital-identity/">proven to be a market failure</a>. Many commercial Identity Providers have launched in Australia but not one has built a sustainable business. As for TDIF, it’s solitary measure of success is the rush of identity service providers seeking accreditation in anticipation of business expected to come.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We should listen to the market. The idea of free market federated identity provision, reusable across banking and government, has proven plainly not to be viable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems to me the government has heeded 15 years of experience of a stagnant digital identity market. With its fresh new Bill, the Australian&nbsp;government has progressed beyond the past idealism of reusable “digital identity”. The <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/digital-id-and-digital-identity/">Digital ID Bill doesn’t use the term anymore</a>, and instead focuses on digitising the many trusted IDs we already have, so they are more reliable online.</p>

   Multi-factor authentication (MFA) has evolved since the 1980s and now requires two out of three options: something you have, are, or know. However, phishing poses a significant threat to MFA's security, emphasizing the need for better options. Biometrics, app-based authenticators, and FIDO-based authenticators offer more secure alternatives. FIDO2 stands out as it includes phishing resistance in i

<p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) has been used by computer administrators since at least the 1980s. Regular people started using it in the mid-1990s when banking systems began to roll this out. It was pretty clunky; those key fobs were not small! And since I mentioned MFA as one road to greater security in my <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/02/25/navigating-the-passwordless-future-enhancing-digital-security/">recent post</a> on passwordless technologies, I thought a quick refresher might be in order.</p>



 Today’s MFA 



<p>MFA looks much different than it did thirty years ago. MFA requires at least two out of these three options:</p>



 
 something you have 



 something you are 



 something you know 
 



<p>In practice, that has taken the form of everything from an SMS message to an iris scanner and more. As it turns out, not all MFA options have stood the test of time when it comes to better security. Depending on what you’re protecting, you might need to get more discerning when it comes to what techniques you use for MFA.</p>



 The Phishing Threat to MFA 



<p>Phishing is the biggest threat to MFA’s ability to solve all the world’s authentication problems. One definition of phishing is:</p>



<p>A technique for attempting to acquire sensitive data, such as bank account numbers, through a fraudulent solicitation in email or on a website, in which the perpetrator masquerades as a legitimate business or reputable person. (<a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/phishing#">U.S. NIST Glossary</a>)</p>



<p>Phishing is when someone tricks you into clicking on a link that either takes you to or is part of a website that looks a LOT like a legit thing. It will likely pass your username and password on to the actual site and put up a page to collect the code received via SMS or email. At that point, the hacker (or, more to the point, their program) usually has 10-15 minutes to use the username, password, and code to get into the site and do things. Most likely, they’ll change your settings so the account has a different recovery email, a new phone number, and a new password.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jerks.</p>



 Better Options 



<p>So, what else is there if there are better ideas than an SMS message or, heavens forbid, an email? The answers fall into three categories: biometrics, app-based authenticators, and FIDO-based authenticators. Which one you choose depends on the criticality assigned to what’s being protected.&nbsp;</p>



 Biometrics 



<p>Biometrics cover the “something you are” option of MFA. These can be anything from fingerprints, facial recognition, iris recognition, and voice recognition. This was a relatively reliable option, though <a href="https://ovic.vic.gov.au/privacy/resources-for-organisations/biometrics-and-privacy-issues-and-challenges/">accessibility issues</a> are a problem. However, with the age of AI and deep fakes dawning, not all biometric options are equally secure. According to <a href="https://cybersecurity-magazine.com/can-deepfakes-beat-biometric-security/">Cybersecurity Magazine</a>, facial recognition is at the most risk, though voice recognition is not far behind. Fingerprints are better off, but not without their own challenges.</p>



<p>There are ways to make biometric recognition more robust. The evolution of attack and response, however, means attack mitigation is always a moving target.</p>



 App-based Authenticators 



<p>Another option that will fill the “something you have” option is an app-based authenticator. There are several out there, like <a href="https://authy.com/">Authy</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;pcampaignid=web_share">Google Authenticator</a>. Many of these apps use something called TOTP. This Time-based One Time Password functionality generates a number that changes, as you might guess from the name, over some (short) period of time. Several password managers (you <a href="https://security.georgetown.edu/csam-2020/benefits-of-password-managers/">use a password manager</a>, right?), like <a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a>, include a TOTP code, too. (I admit, I’m not sure about storing my password with my second factor, but that’s just me.)</p>



<p>If you are using a TOTP-based authenticator, then you need to be on top of getting that code out of the app and into the authentication screen. I often delay responding to the MFA challenge if it looks like my authenticator app only has under 10 seconds left for that number.</p>



 FIDO2-based MFA 



<p>Now for the <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/gold%20standard">gold standard</a> of authenticators: FIDO2! This MFA option puts <a href="https://www.sans.org/blog/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa/">phishing resistance</a> as part of its core design. Go, team!</p>



<p>The <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specifications-overview/">FIDO Alliance</a> is the source of the FIDO2 family of specifications, including WebAuthn. FIDO2-compliant authenticators can use dedicated hardware tokens or mobile devices (like your phone). To use that token or the key stored on your mobile device, though, you need a biometric or a PIN. Combined with a traditional password step, this takes us from two-factor authentication (2FA) to multi-factor authentication.</p>



 Passkeys 



<p>If you read my <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/02/25/navigating-the-passwordless-future-enhancing-digital-security/">last post</a> about passwordless authentication, you may be thinking that FIDO2-based MFA and passkeys sound similar. And, in fact, you would not be wrong! In many cases, you can just use a passkey and have 2FA, which is enough for many situations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passkeys are not perfect; there are <a href="https://youtu.be/mxGczv1-XlE?si=YBrrRvPRcb-bVXM6">new threat models</a> that implementors need to consider before they roll out support for passkeys willy-nilly. However, they are still arguably better than passwords.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>I believe some form of MFA is better than none. That said, I also worry that it lulls people into a false sense of security. How risky is it for you personally if your account is hacked? How risky is it for your organization if your systems are compromised? What data will be exposed? If you don’t have time to understand those gory details, the only real option is to require a stronger form of MFA so you don’t have to worry about that. There are always plenty of other things to worry about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And if you are an end-user, you may not have a choice of the quality of the MFA you get to use. In that case, something is better than nothing! If you work for a company with an IT department and the need for people to log in remotely (including your customers), then you really need to make MFA a priority. And when you do, make sure you do it properly with a phishing-resistant option.</p>

 Breaking Down Barriers: Integrated Wallets for Tokenized Securities 
 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in February 2024.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>Navigating the complexities of blockchain wallets has been a significant hurdle for traditional investors. The wallet barrier not only discourages investors from embracing digital securities but also presents compliance constraints, in some jurisdictions, for issuers who provide custodian wallet options.</p>
<p>To achieve critical mass, we must simplify the experience for end users by hiding these complexities. Integrated wallets are specifically designed to do that, especially the non-custodial ones.</p>
<p>What are integrated wallets?</p>
<p>Integrated wallets are digital wallets that are seamlessly embedded into a tokenization platform. It provides multiple benefits as listed below:</p>
 
 Hassle-free experience:&nbsp;Automatic creation of wallets, providing a seamless experience for non-blockchain investors. 
 Easy for traditional investors:&nbsp;Web banking-like transaction confirmation processes using passwords or biometric authentication. 
 All-in-one platform:&nbsp;No external navigation is needed, everything is integrated within the platform. 
 Flexible wallet support:&nbsp;Issuers can seamlessly support integrated custodial or non-custodial wallets, as we expand our integration with all wallet providers. 
 
<p>How does an integrated wallet work?</p>
<p>Onboarded investors effortlessly claim their automatically issued integrated wallet by creating a security key (e.g., biometric authentication) following simple instructions. Confirming operations and transactions becomes seamless through their security key (e.g., Touch ID).</p>
<p>(Example of an investor making a secure transfer, try it&nbsp;<a href="https://app.supademo.com/demo/2OTSYiuc60cQyiVm1kF6_?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8RSM935qbQPDjmO7XFVYj2feCu5DLoyNtOaft0EbQH1iMEymobRVTevBmWCPwvcWI2TOrH">here)</a></p>

<p></p>
 The Future of Personal AI<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#the-future-of-personal-ai" title="Direct link to The Future of Personal AI">​</a> 
<p>For many years, artificial intelligence primarily piqued the interest of academic researchers and enthusiasts within niche technological sectors such as robotics. Although respected, AI presented little practical application for the average person. That changed in June 2020 with the debut of a Large Language Model (LLM) called GPT-3. GPT-3 inspired organizations and individuals to use AI to accelerate their workflows, from coding and blogging to planning itineraries. Today, the potential of AI is so immense that Simon Westh Henriksen, the CTO of Kin, believes personal AI will be one of the most valuable digital assets we own in the future. Simon and his team built Kin. They describe it as "your personal AI assistant for your private life." The intended persona for Kin is a mix between a life coach and a close friend.</p>
 My First Impressions of Kin<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#my-first-impressions-of-kin" title="Direct link to My First Impressions of Kin">​</a> 
<p>For the last three years, I've deemed ChatGPT my bestie, so when I heard about Kin, I immediately downloaded the beta on my phone. My initial impression was that there was a sense of familiarity because the user interface and interaction were reminiscent of other LLM-powered chatbots such as ChatGPT and Gemini. However, there were some key differences between Kin and traditional chatbots – it focuses on privacy and personalization.</p>
 Privacy-First Artificial Intelligence<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#privacy-first-artificial-intelligence" title="Direct link to Privacy-First Artificial Intelligence">​</a> 
<p>With traditional Generative AI Chatbots, your data lives on the company's servers for telemetry purposes (and more). In contrast, Simon explained that Kin doesn't have backend servers, and users' data stays exclusively with the user. This is possible because of Web5's <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-web-nodes">Decentralized Web Nodes (DWN)</a>. DWNs provide users with a local and personal data store. Now, you can ask an AI personal questions without worrying if someone else can also read it.</p>
 Personalized for You<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#personalized-for-you" title="Direct link to Personalized for You">​</a> 
<p>Unlike traditional Generative AI Chatbots, Kin retains the context of your conversations to provide personalized and relevant responses. As users engage with Kin, the platform analyzes these interactions to extract facts about the user, constructing a semantic memory. This process involves graphing and mapping details such as your name, relationships, interests, etc.</p>
<p>Simon explained the technological process behind this functionality: "It takes in this new knowledge that we have recognized from the chat, or what we think is new knowledge. And then we query this graph that already exists, and we kind of take a subgraph, the relevant subgraph, that might be related to that thing. Then we give it to the LLM, to the model, and it outputs graph operations. So that's something like add node, add edge, remove node, remove edge, and then we apply those to the graph. And in that way, the memory evolves as you speak and interact with Kin."</p>
 The Future of Kin<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/future-of-personal-ai#the-future-of-kin" title="Direct link to The Future of Kin">​</a> 
<p>The team at Kin is working on enhancing the platform's memory beyond facts of the user by introducing episodic memory. Episodic memory tracks events in users' lives and anchors them to a timeline to give AI an idea of how a user's life evolves.</p>
<p>They also plan to implement natural voice interfaces and personalized reminders.</p>

<p>Simon envisions a future where Kin takes full advantage of Web5's data ownership and cryptographic verification capabilities. He provided a futuristic example: After a year of personalized interaction, Kin could use <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/verifiable-credentials">Verifiable Credentials</a> to serve as a digital assistant with verified authority on the user's behalf. Kin could share preferences with third parties like e-commerce websites with the user's permission.</p>
<p>"This is where owning and controlling your data suddenly becomes extremely valuable," Simon proclaims. Data ownership is not just about keeping your data private but having control over who you share your data with.</p>

<p>Container management has come a long way. For decades, managing containerized environments was a relatively simple affair. The modern idea of a computer container originally appeared back in the 1970s, with the concept first being used to help define application code on Unix systems.</p>



<p>Modern <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/containerization">containerization technology</a> has moved on steadily from those early beginnings, and when companies run <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/containers">containers</a> now, they’re getting a lot more utility for their investment. From small startups to large, established businesses, container frameworks have proven exceedingly capable of generating stable <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/workflow">workflows</a> with optimized runtimes and continuous delivery.</p>



 What is a container? 



<p>Containers are executable units of software where application code is packaged with its libraries and dependencies. They are packaged in standardized ways so that the code can be run anywhere, including desktop, traditional IT or the cloud.</p>



<p>This is done through a form of operating system (OS) virtualization in which features of the OS kernel (e.g., Linux namespaces and cgroups, Windows silos and job objects) can be leveraged to isolate processes and control the amount of CPU, memory and disk that those processes can access.</p>



 Containers and Docker 



<p>Container technology fundamentally changed in 2013 with Docker’s introduction and has continued unabated into this decade, steadily gaining in popularity and user acceptance. Clearly, there was a strong but unmet marketplace demand for containerization software of this type, as evidenced by Docker’s rapid success and now overwhelming market superiority.</p>



<p>One 2021 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/VG8KRPRM">IBM survey</a> revealed that 61% of respondents indicated they had used containers in at least 50% of the new applications they had built during the last 2 years. An even larger group of respondents (64%) reported expecting to use containers for at least 50% of the apps they would build over the next 2 years.</p>



<p>Containers are all about distributing and protecting data and running apps. Therefore, it makes perfect sense that IT industries are the primary users of containerization software, with the <a href="https://6sense.com/tech/containerization">following industries ranking as the top three beneficiaries</a> (link resides outside ibm.com):</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning">Machine learning</a> 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/software-development">Software development</a> 



 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">Artificial intelligence (AI)</a> 
 



 Docker and Kubernetes 



<p>The containerized applications market is presently dominated by two entities:</p>



 Docker 



<p>The most commonly used containerization platform is Docker. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/docker">Docker</a> containers were originally built around the Docker Engine in 2013 and run according to an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/api">application programming interface (API)</a>. Docker is actually a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/paas">Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)</a> and its main benefit is its flexibility. Docker can take any application and its associated dependencies and turn it into a virtual container, which can then be run on any Windows, macOS or Linux-running computer. The system uses Docker images, which are read-only templates that are used for building containers, and Dockerfiles, which are text files that accompany and explain Docker images. Docker images and other container images require a space in which to run. This is managed by the container runtime—a software solution interacting with the OS to make the necessary room to run container images.</p>



 Kubernetes 



<p>The most popular <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/container-orchestration">container orchestration</a> platform is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/kubernetes">Kubernetes</a>, which was created by Google in 2014 and is still popular for the robust way it automates the deployment of software, enables scalability and supports container management. Further, Kubernetes is an open-source system and encourages the avid participation of contributors (who oversee the project now), with each software provider putting its own spin on Kubernetes. For example, with some services, users can not only create Kubernetes clusters but also deploy scalable web apps and analyze logs.</p>



<p>At present, Docker and Kubernetes are by far the most popularly used tools dealing with computer containers. According to recent <a href="https://6sense.com/tech/containerization">containerization projections</a> for 2024 (link resides outside ibm.com), Dockers now controls a massive 82.8% of this market, while Kubernetes checks in with an 11.52% market share.</p>



<p>To learn more about how Kubernetes and Docker relate, check out “<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/kubernetes-vs-docker/">Kubernetes vs. Docker: Why Not Both?</a>”</p>



 Container use cases 



<p>There’s no shortage of relatable use cases involving containers because they are becoming increasingly prominent, especially in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-computing">cloud computing</a> environments or ecosystems. Many organizations are even considering containers as a replacement for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/virtual-machines">virtual machines (VMs)</a> as their choice of a general-purpose, cloud computing platform for their applications and workloads. But within that very broad scope, there are key use cases where <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/cloud-native">cloud-native</a> containers are especially relevant:</p>



 
 Microservices: Containers are small, lightweight and portable, which makes them the ideal choice for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/microservices">microservices</a> architectures, where containerized applications are constructed of many, loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller services. A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hypervisors">hypervisor</a> is used to oversee microservice operations when more than one virtual machine is being used on a computer. 



 DevOps: The combination of microservices as an architecture and containers as a platform is a strong pairing and a common foundation for many teams that embrace <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/devops">DevOps</a> and development environments as the way they choose to handle software development. 



 Hybrid multicloud: Because you can run containers consistently anywhere—across laptops, on-premises and in cloud environments—they’re an ideal underlying infrastructure and architecture for cloud providers, as well as any hybrid cloud&nbsp;and any <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/hybrid-cloud">hybrid cloud</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multicloud">multicloud</a>&nbsp;scenarios in which organizations find themselves operating across a mix of multiple <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/public-cloud">public clouds</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/private-cloud">private clouds</a> in combination with an on-premises <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-centers">data center</a>. 



 Serverless: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/serverless">Serverless</a> frees up cloud-native developers who are working on creating apps from having to think about server demands and constraints, which are kept in the background. A major advantage of the serverless method is that it promotes the necessary mental focus that a developer needs while building apps, without overwhelming the developer with myriad details. 
 



 Related use cases and solutions 



<p>Containers, containerization or container orchestration also factor into the following related solutions:</p>



 
 Application modernizing and migration: One of the most common approaches to&nbsp;application modernization&nbsp;is to first optimize and containerize applications in preparation for&nbsp;eventual migration to a cloud architecture. This process should occur before the creation of the application code, which is the source code that contains all instructions for this application. 



 Separate containers: Separate containers have come into popular use because they assist users of microservices so well. As their name indicates, separate containers are primarily used to help keep microservices better organized by allowing users to keep different aspects of a “crowded” container within multiple, partitioned containers. Separate containers are also seen as increasing efficiency of operations by making necessary updates quick and easy. 



 Multi-tenancy: <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/multi-tenant">Multi-tenancy</a> is its own architecture system, structured around a system of users (called tenants) who are all operating a single application within a shared environment. Although some customization options may be available in a multi-tenancy system, those options are purposefully limited to keep the system simple and easy to operate. Containers work well in managing multi-tenancy deployments because multiple apps can be run on a single host. 
 



 Container types 



<p>There are two basic types of containers, and each serves a different group of container technologies:</p>



 System containers 



<p>Also known as “operating system containers,” system containers let you run many different processes simultaneously. System containers are ideal for managing traditional apps and handling monolithic applications that are designed to perform a single function, as expressed through one logical executable file. These containers are also equipped for hosting the architecture, configurations and tools necessary for running VMs. As a default measure, system containers prohibit layered filesystems.</p>



<p>Container technologies served: BSD Jails, Linux VServer, LXC, OpenVZ, Solaris Zones</p>



 Application containers 



<p>Application containers aren’t nearly as multi-talented as system containers, which can execute multiple processes concurrently. Application containers even carry that name because they are intended to serve one application by carrying out one and only one executable action. Application containers exist to package and operate a single service, and they do not support layered filesystems.</p>



<p>Container technologies served: Docker, Rocket</p>



 IBM and containers 



<p>Containerization requires some extra effort and equipping, but pays dividends. Container orchestration tools can facilitate an easier container experience for your production environments—no matter where your products are in their respective lifecycles.</p>



<p>With container services from IBM, built on open-source technologies like Kubernetes, you can facilitate and accelerate your journey to the cloud in a fast, safe and productive way.</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Deepfake cyberattacks, phishing, and social engineering have all received a turbo boost in recent months due to the proliferation of easily accessed AI tools. Cybercriminals are some of the most creative individuals in the world. They spend their days conjuring up different ways to bypass security systems, not filling out spreadsheets and reports.&nbsp;</p>  
<p>In this article, we discuss how hackers are leveraging AI tools to bypass traditional identity security controls at an unprecedented pace, and just why generative AI attacks are so successful. We also look at how these attacks can be defeated using identity assurance controls that take a deterministic approach to securing identities, rather than relying on probabilistic methods that contain inherent levels of uncertainty. By implementing these modern controls, organizations can significantly reduce their risk of identity fraud for both their workforce as well as customers.&nbsp;</p> 
 Common Generative AI Attacks  
<p>Hackers use out of the box as well as specifically trained large language models (LLMs), often created by nation state hackers (China, Russia, North Korea), to execute cyberattacks with frightening accuracy. Here are some of the attacks that get a significant boost from AI.</p> 
 Phishing  
<p>Prior to AI, we used to frequently delineate between “phishing” and “spear phishing,” where attacks were tailored to a specific individual. By using LLMs, hackers are now able to tailor just about every single phishing message to a specific target to get a much higher success rate. For decades now the industry has trained employees to spot telltale signs of phishing by looking for grammatical and spelling errors. Today, phishing messages created by LLMs are in the local language, contain local context, and are largely indistinguishable from the legitimate messages users get every single day. A <a href="https://slashnext.com/state-of-phishing-2023/">recent study</a> found a 1,265% rise in phishing, largely due to the usage of AI tools.&nbsp;</p> 
 Impersonation (Deepfake Cyberattacks)  
<p>Identity theft is at an all time high due to the ability of AI to impersonate an individual across all communication channels including voice, text and video. In recent weeks, a scammer used a series of<a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/02/05/deepfake-video-conference-call/"> video deepfakes to extract more than $25M from an organization</a>. Hackers can create personas based on individuals in minutes, merely by looking at samples of their writing, publicly available videos, and social media posts. Just a few years ago, creating a deepfake video required significant resources. Today, freely available apps can do the job fairly well, with accuracy improving by leaps and bounds daily.&nbsp;</p> 
 Social Engineering&nbsp;  
<p>Before AI, social engineering attacks were highly manual in nature and oftentimes had low success rates. We’ve all received scam calls and many of us can easily spot them when the caller has no knowledge of our details and speaks with an unfamiliar accent. By using AI, hackers are able to create chatbots and voice conversation systems that mimic the tone, cadence, and contextual nuances of a specific target audience. LLMs also are able to use reinforcement learning so that they get better with every single conversation that occurs. These improved algorithms can then be used to target large numbers of users simultaneously, rather than being bottlenecked by human interactions.&nbsp;</p> 
 Why Generative AI Attacks Are Successful  
<p>Hackers love AI tools because they make them more efficient than ever. There are a few key reasons why AI-assisted attacks are seeing so much success today:&nbsp;</p> 
 Speed and Scalability  
<p>AI can process and analyze data and conversations at speeds that outpace any human by orders of magnitude. This ability enables these tools to launch widespread attacks in a very short amount of time.&nbsp;</p> 
 Adaptability  
<p>AI systems can adapt their strategies based on the responses from the target’s defenses. If users have been trained to look for specific red flags, these tools can adapt and respond accordingly within seconds. As a result, defense systems that rely on blocking known attack patterns are trivial for an AI attack to bypass quickly.&nbsp;</p> 
 Efficiency in Targeting  
<p>AI can analyze data from various sources to identify the most valuable targets to maximize its success. When AI identifies a series of patterns or signals, it can quickly train itself to focus on targets with the most likelihood for success. Most importantly, it can correlate with other AI systems who “soften the target,” to then outflank victim organizations' security controls. For example, one AI tool can target an organization with a DDOS attack and, when the victim is busy responding, another AI tool can execute a highly contextualized phishing campaign that references the DDOS attack to maximize its success rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 Leveraging Big Data  
<p>AI systems are able to integrate with countless data sources both public and private in order to maximize their impact. Attackers leveraging AI can refine strategies within seconds based on real-time events in ways never possible before. Social media, previous breach data available on the dark web, and leaked credentials can all be processed instantaneously to create new and more sophisticated attacks with a high likelihood of success.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 Why Probabilistic Identity Security Controls Fail Against an AI Attack  
<p>The vast majority of identity security controls are failing today. To understand why this is the case, we have to understand the probabilistic nature of their implementations.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Probabilistic security controls operate on the basis of likelihood. They use various criteria to determine the probability that something is safe or a potential security threat. By contrast, deterministic security controls identify an outcome with a binary level of precision. They can determine with a high degree of certainty if something is true or false, safe or a threat.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>With this in mind, let’s look at some of the primary methods the industry uses today to prove that someone is who they say they are.&nbsp;</p> 
 Phishable Authentication Factors  
<p>Passwords, one time passwords (OTP) delivered via SMS or app, and push notifications are the primary methods organizations use to verify users today into their systems. AI creates significant accuracy in brute force password spraying attacks by being able to predict passwords. It also strengthens phishing and social engineering to trick users into providing OTP codes or accepting push notifications at a high rate. These controls are probabilistic as they cannot determine with certainty that the entity seeking access is the legitimate credential holder, and can be intercepted, replayed and phished.&nbsp;</p> 
 KBA-Based Identity Verification  
<p>AI systems’ ability to ingest massive amounts of data extremely quickly and in real time enables them to learn about their targets and easily answer questions such as their mother's maiden name and the street they grew up on. By combining this with phishing and social engineering capabilities, these AI-assisted hackers can quickly execute identity theft and gain access to employee and customer accounts. Knowledge-based security methods are also probabilistic by nature and can be easily intercepted, replayed, and phished from users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 Human-Verified Documents  
<p>Many businesses have moved from KBA to online or in-person document verification in order to reduce identity fraud. However, attackers can use widely available AI tools to create fake documents such as passports and driver licenses that are able to trick most systems. The image below is a fake passport generated by AI that was able to <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/ai-generated-fake-ids-pass-crypto-exchange-kyc-onlyfake">bypass the identity verification system of a cryptocurrency exchange</a>.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p>Image Source: <a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-the-underground-site-where-ai-neural-networks-churns-out-fake-ids-onlyfake/">404 Media</a></p> 
<p>Both human and machine-based verification controls of documents are probabilistic in nature because they have to account for differences in documents with regard to image quality and the sheer number of variations of the documents themselves. They can only determine the likelihood that a document is legitimate.</p> 
 Five Identity Controls to Defend Against AI Attacks  
 1. Focus on Deterministic Controls  
<p>In recent years, deterministic controls to secure identities have started to enter the market by way of open standards and innovative technology companies. Unlike most probabilistic controls, deterministic identity technology plays a crucial role in countering AI-assisted cyber attacks because they can provide a binary certainty; a definitive yes or no that eliminates the gaps exploited by AI-assisted attacks.</p> 
 2. Strong Authentication Protocols  
<p>Cryptographic Techniques: FIDO and similar protocols, such as the traditional smartcard, use public-key cryptography for authentication. During the registration process, the user’s device creates a new public-private key pair. The private key is kept secret on the device, while the public key is registered with the online service. Authentication involves proving possession of the private key without it ever leaving the user's device, making it extremely difficult for attackers (AI-assisted or not) to steal or replicate.</p> 
<p>Biometric Verification: FIDO, for example, supports local <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-biometric-authentication">biometric verification</a> (like fingerprint sensors, facial recognition, etc.), which are difficult for AI to fake because the biometric data is not transmitted over the network. Instead, the device confirms the match and then uses cryptographic keys to authenticate the user to the service.</p> 
<p></p> 
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/what-is-phishing-resistant-mfa">Phishing Resistance</a>: FIDO authentication is bound to the original website's URL, making it resistant to phishing attacks. Even if AI is used to create highly convincing phishing sites, the authentication process checks the URL to ensure it matches the registered service’s URL, preventing the credentials from being used to authenticate a fraudulent site.</p> 
<p>Local Storage of Credentials: Since the cryptographic credentials in FIDO are stored locally on the user's device and never shared with the server or across the network, AI-assisted attacks that rely on intercepting or deducing credentials remotely are rendered ineffective.</p> 
 3. Layered IDV to Prevent Deepfake Cyber Attacks  
<p>Deepfakes are getting more sophisticated on a daily basis. While liveness detection is a positive step forward, it’s only a matter of time before it’s defeated by the rapid pace of innovation in AI. Multi-layered identity verification offers a deterministic way to prove people’s identities to defend against deepfake cyber attacks. Instead of relying purely on voice or video feeds, you combine a series of factors such as location, behavior, document verification and face recognition so that you can be certain that an identity is genuine.</p> 
 4. AI-Assisted Identity Risk Mitigation  
<p>While deterministic security controls are essential, they cannot fully protect against unknown and emerging threats. Modern probabilistic identity security controls take advantage of the same AI assistance as attackers. Real-time risk assessment and adaptive security controls are a critical tool for organizations to manage evolving identity risks. By ingesting risk signals from a wide variety of sources, you can bring high fidelity to probabilistic controls.</p> 
 5. A Collaborative Identity Security Stack&nbsp;  
<p>It’s no secret that many identity security solutions tackle very specific challenges, operating in isolated spheres. Generative AI attacks find and exploit the gaps between these fragmented identity security processes. Open standards like FIDO and Open Policy Agent (OPA), were developed, in part, to ensure compatibility between security tools and processes. A more unified identity security approach, with solutions that communicate and collaborate across the identity lifecycle, greatly decreases the success rates of generative AI attacks.</p> 
 HYPR’s Anti-AI Strategy  
<p>HYPR was founded to put in place a deterministic way of proving that people are who they say they are. As a result, we were one of the first commercially successful implementations of the FIDO standards. Since then, our platform has expanded to prevent automation and scaling of identity-related attacks.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The HYPR Identity Assurance platform combines strong passwordless authentication, continuous risk mitigation and comprehensive identity verification so that you can be certain that a person is who they claim to be throughout the identity lifecycle.</p> 
<p>HYPR Authenticate is our category-leading <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">passwordless MFA</a> solution, which is built on top of the FIDO standards and fully eliminates breachable credentials from your authentication and verification processes.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">HYPR Adapt</a> is an identity fabric, which integrates&nbsp;real-time risk assessment and mitigation, leveraging high-fidelity risk signals from numerous sources, including external environments, endpoints and other cybersecurity products.</p> 
<p>HYPR Affirm, our comprehensive product for <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-affirm-identity-verification">identity verification</a>, provides a deterministic way to prove that an identity is legitimate and belongs to the person asserting it. HYPR Affirm combines a series of factors such as location, behavior, document verification, AI-powered chat, video, facial recognition and other cutting-edge technologies.</p>

They translate business needs into solution requirements and propose ways to optimize business operations.&nbsp;</p>



 The next leap: Beyond low-code platforms&nbsp; 



<p>While the rise of low-code platforms has marked a significant evolution in bridging business requirements with IT implementation, the current market trend is veering toward more intuitive, AI-driven solutions. Foundation models urge businesses to look beyond conventional limitations, with their inherent ability to understand, generate and process human-like text, allowing non-technical professionals to interact and build applications by using natural language, marking a shift from conventional programming. By transcending the constraints of low-code platforms, businesses can build more robust, tailored solutions that align closely with their evolving digital strategies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deploying LLMs effectively, like any tool, requires professionals to understand their capabilities and potential biases. Blending creativity and domain-specific expertise with AI’s computational prowess helps ensure technologically sound and contextually relevant solutions.&nbsp;</p>



 From digital assistants to AI assistants 



<p>The narrative surrounding digital assistants is evolving. While computer-aided instructions or computer-assisted instructions represented a previous breakthrough, AI platforms like watsonx are elevating the concept. Instead of mere assistants, these AI-based automation platforms act as collaborators, offering insights, handling routine tasks with precision and accuracy, and enhancing decision-making processes for knowledge workers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The distinction between traditional robotic process automation (RPA) robots and AI-driven digital collaborators is paramount. The latter not only automates but also comprehends, reasons and learns, providing richer, more dynamic interactions. More importantly, they enable systems and tools to conform to the needs of the users, responding intelligently to users’ natural language requests. &nbsp;</p>



 IBM’s vision: watsonx, watsonx Orchestrate, foundation models and beyond&nbsp; 



<p>IBM strategically innovates by venturing into the world of foundation models with watsonx, demonstrating their dedication to revolutionizing businesses through AI.

 Stakers can claim DF78 rewards. DF79 runs Feb 29 — Mar 7,&nbsp;2024  1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in Predictoor). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Here are DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Data Farming Round 78 (DF78) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am February 22, 2024 and ended 12:01 am February 29. You can claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF79 is live today, February 29. It concludes on March 7. 150K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><blockquote>Heads up: for DF80 (starts Mar 14), OCEAN rewards will double to 300,000 OCEAN/week. This breaks down as follows. Passive DF &amp; Active DF each get 150K OCEAN/week. Within Active DF, Volume DF gets 112.5K OCEAN/week and Predictoor DF gets 37.5K OCEAN/week. ROSE rewards continue at 20K ROSE/week.</blockquote><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF79   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF79 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean, DF and Predictoor <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

Introduction <p><a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> was founded to level the playing field for AI and data. In previous years, the Ocean core team built a core tech stack with broad applicability in AI x crypto. In 2023, we tested hypotheses towards growing traction. From that, the three brightest spots are Ocean Predictoor, Ocean Compute-to-Data (C2D), and Ocean Enterprise. For 2024, we focus on&nbsp;these.</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. Sections 2, 3, and 4 elaborate on goals for Predictoor, C2D, and Ocean Enterprise respectively. Section 5 covers ongoing work: Data Challenges, Data Farming, and ecosystem support. Section 6 concludes.</p> 2. Goal: Accelerate Ocean Predictoor  2.1 Predictoor Background <p>In <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai/">Ocean Predictoor</a>, people run AI-powered prediction bots or trading bots on crypto price feeds to earn $. The “earn $” part is key, because it fosters&nbsp;usage.</p><p>Predictoor involves two groups of&nbsp;people:</p>  Predictoors: data scientists who use AI models to predict what the price of ETH, BTC, etc will be 5 (or 60) minutes into the future. The scientists run bots that submit these predictions onto the chain every 5 minutes. Predictoors earn $ based on sales of the feeds, including sales from Ocean’s Data Farming incentives program.  Traders: run bots that input predictoors’ aggregated predictions, to use as alpha in trading. It’s another edge for making $ while&nbsp;trading.  <p>Predictoor is built using the Ocean stack. And, it runs on<a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/"> Oasis Sapphire</a>; we’ve <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/success-in-ai-powered-prediction-bots-leads-to-ocean-oasis-partnership-e4e9f697c99a?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------">partnered</a> with the Oasis&nbsp;team.</p><p>Predictoor Traction. Predictoor has highly promising traction: starting from zero volume on mainnet launch in October 2023, volume has grown to &gt; $15M / day. [Source: <a href="https://dappradar.com/dapp/ocean-predictoor?range-ha=all">DappRadar</a>].</p><p>Predictoor is rocking! So we’re doubling down on it in&nbsp;2024.</p> 2.2 Predictoor Plans&nbsp;2024 <p>With this context in mind, here are Predictoor goals for 2024. We’ll work to get users making serious $, then we’ll scale&nbsp;up.</p><p>Goal 1: Users making serious $. Right now, Predictoor’s growth is based on predictoors making good $. We want both predictoors and traders making serious $. So, the key trick is for traders to make serious $; then they’ll spend $ to buy feeds; which leads to serious $ for predictoors. We’re doing this by dog-fooding: working to make serious $ trading with Predictoor feeds. Everything else&nbsp;follows.</p><p>Here are the sub-steps of goal&nbsp;1:</p>  1.1 Make $ trading: internal. Conduct experiments iteratively until we make $ trading in some combination of {trading venue &amp; pair, prediction strategy, trading strategy, other}. Results are highly promising, and getting better weekly. Simultaneously, build a first-class data pipeline and analytics dapp, to better answer the question “how much $ am I making” and drill-down questions. The dapp will start with predictoor bots, then expand to trading&nbsp;bots.  1.2 Make $ trading: external. Update Predictoor product so that community can follow the make $ strategy from (1). Eg add feeds, change prediction bot, change trading bot. If needed, have new smart contracts. Continually improve data pipeline and analytics dapp.  1.3 Make more $ predicting: external. Each feed is currently priced 1 OCEAN/day, which under-values the feed compared to $ being made by traders, and therefore means lost $ opportunity for predictoors. A better pricing approach will address this. We will explore possible approaches (e.g. auctions), and roll out the best one in the Predictoor product.  <p>At this point, the Predictoor product architecture enables predictoors and traders to make serious $ on any given feed, or combination of&nbsp;feeds.</p><p>Goal 2: Scale up. Here are sub-steps:</p>  2.1 Reduce trading friction via TG bots &amp; more. Coming into this step, both predictoors and traders onboard via READMEs to run Python bots. For predictoors this is generally fine, since they need to change code to improve modeling or trading strategies if they want an edge. However for traders, we can make it easier to run bots with “good default” strategies. This in turn increases sales volume. Therefore the goal of this step is to make it easier for traders to run bots. A key strategy will be to leverage Telegram (TG)&nbsp;bots.  2.2 Grow # feeds in DeFi. Once predictoors and traders are making serious $, we will significantly expand the number of feeds within DeFi: more tokens, more exchanges, more time scales, signals beyond just close price, and more. E.g. from 20 to 20,000 feeds. This will increase the $ made by traders and by predictoors.  2.3 Grow to new verticals. As that starts to hit diminishing returns, we will expand beyond DeFi: weather, climate, energy, real estate, logistics, agriculture, food prices, gas prices, and more. One possible starting point is prediction weather prediction for a couple cities; then expand city by city; then to every square km on&nbsp;earth.  <p>Goal 1 is for “0→1” to get product-market fit, and goal 2 “1→n” for scale-up.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1732321049847456123">Stretch goal</a>: world model on ground-truth physics. We’ll train a single AI model across all feeds. This model will continually ingest the physics of the world to predict its next state. Truly a *world model*. We’ll also give it all the training data that current LLMs take. The net result: a model with vastly more data than current LLMs, and ground-truth physics in all that additional data. <a href="https://www.explainablestartup.com/2017/06/why-prediction-is-the-essence-of-intelligence.html">Prediction is intelligence</a>. This is Predictoor’s endgame.</p><p>It’s a big vision! Goals 1 and 2 alone will occupy us for all of 2024 and much of 2025. The stretch goal will&nbsp;follow.</p> 3. Goal: Launch C2D Springboard  3.1 Core Stack Background <p>At the core of the Ocean tech stack are <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/learn/data-nfts-and-data-tokens/">datatokens</a> and <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/learn/compute-to-data/">Compute-to-Data (C2D)</a>. Datatokens enables token-gating of AI models, predictions, and more. They enable data wallets, data exchanges, and data DAOs. C2D is pragmatic and useful privacy approach, complementary to other privacy approaches.</p><p>C2D Details. Let’s drill into C2D&nbsp;further.</p>  Why C2D. Private data is valuable: using private data can improve research and business outcomes. But concerns over privacy and control make it hard to&nbsp;access.  What is C2D. Compute-to-Data (C2D) grants access to run compute against the data, on the same premises of the data. Only the results are visible to the consumer. The data never leaves the premises. Decentralized blockchain technology does the handshaking.  C2D Benefits. Ocean C2D enables people to sell private data while preserving privacy, as an opportunity for companies to monetize their data assets. C2D can also be used for data sharing in science or technology contexts, with lower liability risk, because the data doesn’t&nbsp;move.  Left: C2D Conceptual Flow. Right:&nbsp;C2D2!<p>Internal discussions. In Ocean core team, we’ve long understood the unique selling points of C2D. It’s why we built it in the first place, way back in 2019! Over the years, we’ve had continuous interest in using it, such as our collaboration with <a href="https://acentrik.io/">Acentrik</a> (a part of Daimler). However, we saw that we hadn’t fully leveraged its potential, as we’d invested our time on other features.</p><p>Besides C2D, we’ve see many friction points in using the&nbsp;stack.</p><p>Community feedback. Over the past several months, we interviewed community members for feedback, especially to gain insights on how to best enhance the core stack. Some feedback has already translated to completed actions such as improving <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean docs</a>. The two main themes from the community were: (a) clear demand to make C2D great, and (b) developer experience is still high friction.</p> 3.2 C2D &amp; Core Stack Plans&nbsp;2024 <p>The community feedback was consistent with our own discussions, and helped us to confirm what mattered. This in turn informs our plans for 2024. Thus, here are C2D / tech stack goals for 2024, culminating in a C2D springboard.</p><p>Goal 1. Unified backend. From community feedback we learned that deploying and maintaining the various Ocean components (Aquarius, Provider, Subgraph, C2D) is too complex. In 2024, we will simplify this process by merging all of them into a single, more manageable component. This upgrade means easier installation with just one command and a user-friendly admin dashboard, set for release in Q2 of&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Goal 2. C2D.2. The current C2D, while powerful, has friction in creating and deploying algorithms. So we’re integrating C2D into the newly-unified backend to simplify its use. This means straightforward installation and maintenance, along with easier ways for users to write and deploy algorithms and ML models. This update will be launched in Q3 of&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Goal 3. Build a “C2D springboard” to further empower our Ocean community. This platform will make it easy to showcase the capabilities of your AI algorithms for specific use cases, reminiscent of Ocean Market, but heavily tuned to C2D workflows. The product is set to launch in Q4 of&nbsp;2024.</p><p>As we roll out these updates, we’ll continue to leverage Ocean’s Data Challenges to catalyze development of AI algorithms for&nbsp;each.</p> 4. Goal: Roll Out Ocean Enterprise <p>Ever since the release of Ocean v4 (spring 2022), there has been growing interest in the businesses community about Ocean’s capabilities, especially Data NFTs, datatokens and Compute-to-Data (C2D).</p><p>Traditional businesses operate in highly regulated environments, where strict compliance to industry regulation such as <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>, <a href="https://www.eu-data-act.com/">EU Data Act</a>, and <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica">MiCA</a> have a major impact on operations and product development. Ensuring compliance can hinder innovative solutions from going into production.</p><p>Starting this year, a new endeavor called Ocean Enterprise will launch. It will help businesses take Ocean-powered solutions into production. Ocean Enterprise comprises both a group of collaborators and a tech&nbsp;stack.</p>  The collaborators are a diverse group of organizations spanning eight countries and seven industries. This group has already established the Ocean Enterprise Collective to gather requirements, design and develop a tech&nbsp;stack  The tech stack is an enterprise-ready, compliant version of Ocean. It will be based on the existing Ocean stack. It will incorporate additional new enterprise-specific features to allow businesses to securely collaborate, share and monetise their data in a fully compliant manner. The first release will be later this&nbsp;year.  <p>Work on the new Ocean Enterprise version began quietly several months ago. Stay tuned: more details will be announced in the following months&nbsp;👀.</p> 5. Ongoing <p>In addition to the core initiatives above, we will continue with ongoing efforts in Data Challenges, Data Farming, and ecosystem support. This section elaborates.</p> 5.1 Data Challenges <p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/earn/data-challenges/">Ocean Data Challenges</a> are competitions for data scientists to build predictive models, do analytics, or otherwise.</p><p>We’ve been running them since 2022. We will continue them in 2024, though as mentioned above, now tuned towards&nbsp;C2D.</p> 5.2 Data Farming&nbsp;(DF) <p><a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">DF</a> is Ocean’s incentives program. Typical APYs are&nbsp;5–20%.</p><p>DF currently emits 150,000 OCEAN weekly rewards. As the schedule outlines, rewards will double to 300,000 OCEAN weekly in mid-March 2024, and double again to 600,000 OCEAN weekly in mid-September 2004.</p>  50% of weekly DF rewards are for Passive DF, i.e. locking&nbsp;OCEAN.  The other 50% for Active DF, where users have to engage more actively for rewards, such as running prediction bots.  <p>As with previous years, for 2024, Passive DF will remain unchanged, and the specific activities within Active DF may&nbsp;evolve.</p> 5.3 Ecosystem support <p>Ocean has a lively<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/explore/ecosystem"> ecosystem</a> of dapps grown over years, built by enthusiastic developers. The Ocean ecosystem also contains many data scientists and OCEAN holders who do predictions, data challenges, Data Farming, and more. Furthermore, Ocean has an excellent<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/explore/community"> community of ambassadors</a>.</p><p>For 2024, the core team will continue to support the Ocean ecosystem &amp; Ocean Ambassadors.</p>Some <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/explore/ecosystem/">featured dapps</a> from Ocean’s ecosystem. 6. Conclusion <p>In 2024, we will double down on Predictoor’s exponential growth, launch a “C2D springboard”, and roll out Ocean Enterprise. We will continue to run Ocean Data Challenges, Data Farming, and support our lively ecosystem.</p><p>This product update stands for our roadmap to making Ocean Protocol more accessible, efficient and powerful — all in the name in traction.</p> Notes <p>[1] This step only comes now, because we first needed to establish an architecture where both predictoors and traders can conceptually make serious $. If we did this UX work earlier, we’d have spend time optimizing a UX that any step of goal 1 might have become obsolete.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>Fission has been working with the IPFS ecosystem since we started. Content addressing is a fundamentally useful innovation that opens new use cases and approaches that are difficult or impossible without.</p><p>This year, the community and the organizations involved are changing in significant ways. Protocol Labs is nucleating a number of the engineering, open source, and operational teams into separate startups, engineering collectives, and foundations.</p><p>For IPFS projects and tooling, we must re-evaluate how we work together from code to commons.</p> What is IPFS Mainnet? <p>Mainnet is a term used to describe the default or "main" network that default settings connect to. This has mostly been "assumed" for the IPFS network, and not really highlighted for anyone other than protocol experts. The technical name for Mainnet is Amino, and there's a <a href="https://blog.ipfs.tech/2023-09-amino-refactoring/">blog post from September 2023</a> that goes into some more details and changes happening.</p><p>Diving deeper into Mainnet, there are a variety of <a href="https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/public-utilities/">public utilities that are described in more detail in the IPFS docs</a>. One of the most notable is the IPFS.io public gateway, that serve up content-addressed data through an HTTP gateway that every browser can access.</p><p>This was run by Protocol Labs, and will now be a responsibility of the emerging IPFS Foundation, who in turn are relying on the new <a href="https://ipshipyard.com/">IP Shipyard organization</a> to do the technical work to host and maintain the gateway.</p><p>There are a number of other <a href="https://ipfs.github.io/public-gateway-checker/">public IPFS Mainnet gateways</a>, including the gateway we've been running at Fission for many years:</p>While Fission's gateway is listed, we only serve up content that is synched to our servers by published apps and WNFS file systems<p>You'll note from the list that there are a number of commercial providers of IPFS services, like Cloudflare, Pinata, and Web3 Storage. As well as their "public" gateways, many of these organizations also sell services hosting dedicated gateways.</p><p>The way that IPFS works, all the nodes / gateways / desktops etc connect together and store pieces of data, "addressed" by the data itself. Unlike with a single web server being down and no one else having the "authority" to have the data at a location like <code>example.com/somedata.pdf</code>, IPFS nodes ask each other for all of the blocks that make up a content address, and the receiver can then verify that the data is correct.</p><p>IPFS Mainnet is the giant global network that uses the default bootstrap list, the default Distributed Hash Table (DHT) that helps locate content on the network, and all of the public and dedicated gateways that connect to it.</p> Alternate Networks <p>Using a different list of bootstrap nodes and other configuration settings, you can choose to not connect to IPFS Mainnet. Here are two examples of projects that made this choice:</p><p><a href="https://source.network/">Source Network</a> uses IPFS to synch and serve data across their ecosystem – we had them on for a <a href="https://fission.codes/blog/fission-tech-talks-sourcery-with-decentralized-databases/">Fission Tech Talk</a> a while back – but doesn't connect to Mainnet by default.</p><p><a href="https://tryquiet.org/">Quiet</a> is a chat app that uses IPFS to synch and connect devices, but on a network that is private to the connected devices.</p><p>Performance, privacy, or other considerations are all reasons that you might not want to use Mainnet, while still relying on the same codebases and technology stack.</p> Everywhere Computer and IPFS <p>Fission's primary product is the <a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Everywhere Computer</a>. This is the platform we're building on top of the open protocol InterPlanetary Virtual Machine (IPVM) that we developed alongside a number of collaborators in the UCAN and IPVM working groups.</p><p>The Everywhere Computer lets you run compute everywhere. This is accomplished by supporting WebAssembly functions that are published to IPFS, and by fetching and storing data that needs to be computed to and from IPFS. Separately, we use libp2p, the peer-to-peer networking layer that IPFS also runs on, to connect all of the compute providers, and to share receipts of results and other data across the network.</p><p>Simplistically, you could say IPVM and the Everywhere Computer add compute to IPFS.</p><p>Note that we didn't say "IPFS Mainnet" there. We heavily use content addressing in the design of the system, so that we can do things like cache functions on compute nodes, cache results across the network to skip computation all together, and many of the other optimizations you can do from edge devices to servers when you're using content addressing rather than location addressing.</p><p>The design of the Everywhere Computer will introduce the concept of Subnets. These will be default settings, permissions, optimized functions, and other configuration options that let anyone compose groups of computers to support different ecosystems and applications.</p><p>However, our default public beta subnet (cool name and logo forthcoming!) will connect to IPFS Mainnet. The public commons that the IPFS Mainnet represents is something that we've always been excited about and supported, and we're excited to add content-addressed compute with the Everywhere Computer.</p>You can watch a demo and overview of the Everywhere Computer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6n2dhjmYes&amp;t=10s">from our late Feb 2024 presentation</a><p>Across both public gateways and commercial providers, developers will be able to fetch data, run it through an IPVM compatible function, and then store the results back on IPFS Mainnet.</p><p><a href="https://everywhere.computer/">Sign up for the Everywhere Computer beta</a> if you'd like to be involved.</p> Gathering the Commons <p>Along with IP Shipyard, we're hosting an event today in Denver to share the news about IPFS Mainnet support, and start gathering the commons of people and organizations that are interested in supporting and improving this public global network.</p><p>Here are some questions to think about IPFS as Commons:</p><p>As an ecosystem, app or project that relies on the IPFS technology stack (whether it connects to Mainnet or you run a private network), what do you need and how do you want to provide support in return?</p><p>As a commercial provider, let's talk about inter-connecting our nodes and jointly running a more efficient network. If you rely on Kubo, go-libp2p, js-libp2p that are maintained by the IP Shipyard team, or other open source code bases, how do you plan on supporting them? What features and functions would you want to prioritize and fund, or contribute engineering resources to help implement?</p><p>As an individual using IPFS from your desktop or through various apps, how do you want such an open network to function, and what should it prioritize?</p><p>There are a number of legal challenges, takedown requests, and content moderation topics that come up across public gateways. Should IPFS Mainnet supporters join forces to decide on how to handle some of these concerns across the commons network?</p><blockquote>This year, the IPFS and extended ecosystem is graduating to a more commons based approached, with many separate companies, foundations, and funding partners.<br><br>At ETH Denver we want to introduce the changes, and invite people to take part in supporting and governing large public commons projects like the <a href="http://ipfs.io/">ipfs.io</a> public gateway, and the Kubo IPFS node codebase.<br>​<br>We will have a presentation by Adin Schmahmann from IP Shipyard, IPFS Core Maintainer, to introduce <a href="https://ipshipyard.com/new-chapter">IP Shipyard’s New Chapter</a> and other existing and upcoming initiatives.<br><br>We will follow with a discussion of IPFS as Commons, welcoming IPFS operators, dapp builders, blockchain ecosystems, and others interested in the future of the IPFS commons. This will be a facilitated discussion and Q&amp;A, hosted by Boris Mann, Founder of Fission.</blockquote><p>If you're in Denver, you've still got time to join us for the <a href="https://lu.ma/6suk3oa5">IPFS Mainnet event today, Wed Feb 28th, 4pm MST</a>, otherwise we'll be sharing presentation slides and other follow up notes <a href="https://discuss.ipfs.tech/t/ipfs-mainnet-at-ethdenver/17620">on the IPFS Discussion Forum</a>.</p>

<p>As more countries, companies and individuals seek energy sources beyond fossil fuels, interest in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/renewable-energy">renewable energy</a> continues to rise.</p>



<p>In fact, world-wide capacity for energy from solar, wind and other renewable sources increased by <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/renewables-2023">50% in 2023</a>. More than 110 countries at the United Nations’ COP28 climate change conference agreed to triple that capacity by 2030, and global investment in clean energy transition hit a record high of <a href="https://about.bnef.com/energy-transition-investment/">USD 1.8 trillion in 2023</a>.</p>



<p>But with all of this new capacity, how are renewable energy resources really being used? Here, we will look at examples and applications of renewable energy across a variety of industries, its impact on energy systems and the energy technologies that will drive its use in the future.</p>



 What is renewable energy? 



<p>Renewable energy, sometimes called green energy, refers to energy generated from natural resources such as sun, wind, rain, geothermal heat and ocean tides. While fossil fuels—including non-renewable energy sources such as oil, coal and natural gas—are finite resources, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/renewable-energy-types/">renewable resources</a> are replenished over time and considered inexhaustible (that is, they are not in danger of being depleted or used up entirely.) These power sources generally have a lower impact on the environment than fossil fuels, which released carbon dioxide and other harmful <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/greenhouse-gas-emissions">greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs)</a> that contribute to global warming and are widely considered to be the main driver of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/climate-change">climate change</a>.</p>



<p>Types of renewable energy sources include:</p>



 
 Solar: Sunlight is converted into electricity and heat in two ways. The most common method of producing solar energy, photovoltaics (PV), collects sunlight via solar panels and converts it to electricity. For larger-scale uses, the concentrating solar-thermal power (CSP) method uses mirrors to collect sunlight for fluid-filled receivers, which generate thermal energy for power. 



 Wind: Individual wind turbines and large-scale wind farms harness kinetic energy from the air for electricity generation. Wind power can be generated by turbines on land, as well as offshore wind farms over water. 



 Hydro: Water-generated hydroelectric power is produced using tidal power, bodies of water and dams to move electricity-creating turbines. <a href="https://www.hydropower.org/iha/discover-facts-about-hydropower">Some 60% of all renewable electricity</a> comes from hydropower sources, making it the largest contributor to renewable electricity worldwide. 



 Geothermal: Hot steam and hydrocarbon vapor from geothermal reservoirs within the Earth can be harnessed for energy production. Geothermal heat pumps (GHPs) are used to heat, cool and provide hot water to homes and offices. 
 



<p>Biomass is sometimes considered a source of renewable energy. The term biomass energy refers to the conversion of organic materials and byproducts (including organic matter like wood or waste) into either electrical energy or biofuels such as ethanol or biodiesel. However, producing these forms of bioenergy can contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation; as a result, some do not consider them completely renewable sources of energy. Additionally, while nuclear power is often considered a “clean” energy source due to its low carbon emissions, it is not renewable; nuclear energy requires uranium, which is a finite resource.</p>



 Countries leading the way 



<p>Governments around the world are taking strides to increase production and use of alternative energy to meet energy consumption demands. Reducing dependence on fossil fuels and diversifying the energy mix can help countries lower their carbon footprints and contribute to international efforts to limit global warming, thus protecting ecosystems and biodiversity. It also appeals to those trying to boost their energy security and independence, as renewable sources are locally available and less impacted by price volatility &nbsp;and geopolitical tensions. Additionally, many governments see renewable energy as a way to improve their economies through job creation and investment, and public health by reducing air pollution.</p>



 
 Iceland: Known for its unique geothermal landscapes, Iceland is a world leader in harnessing geothermal energy. <a href="https://www.government.is/topics/business-and-industry/energy/">More than 85%</a> of Iceland’s electricity comes from local renewable resources, including hydropower and geothermal power. 



 Portugal: The country was one of the first in Europe to pledge <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/carbon-neutral">carbon neutrality</a> <a href="https://www.iea.org/news/portugal-s-energy-policies-set-a-clear-pathway-towards-2050-carbon-neutrality-according-to-new-iea-review">by 2050</a>. Portugal set a record last year for most consecutive days powered solely by renewable energy—<a href="https://www.ren.pt/en-gb/media/news/renewable-energy-production-sets-new-records#:~:text=Renewable%20energy%20production%20in%20Portugal,consumption%20needs%20across%20the%20country.">for 149 straight hours</a>, or more than six days, energy generated from renewable sources exceeded the country’s consumption needs. 



 Uruguay: Uruguay has made massive investments in wind and solar power and now gets nearly <a href="https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/uruguay-renewable-energy-equipment">98% of its electricity from renewables</a>. The country’s decarbonization efforts and swift transition to renewable energy was prompted by rising fuel prices in the early 2000s. 
 



 Smart cities of the future 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-city">Cities, towns and other communities</a> are also evaluating their environmental impact and incorporating renewables into their energy-generation plans. Local programs are using renewable sources of energy to offset electricity costs and provide greater reliability. Through decentralized energy systems, microgrids and smart grids, communities are diversifying their options for sourcing electricity and monitoring systems for more efficient use. These systems can be especially useful during natural disasters, cyberattacks or other events that may disrupt the power supply in a region.</p>



<p>Some cities are requiring new construction to include energy-efficient green buildings or offering incentives to prompt older buildings to modernize for renewable capacity.&nbsp;Others are working renewables into municipal infrastructure by installing solar-powered streetlights or purchasing electric school buses and other vehicles.</p>



 How businesses are harnessing renewable energy 



<p>Companies and organizations seeking more sustainable energy sources have a number of ways to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/renewable-energy-procurement-options/">procure renewable energy</a>. They can invest in and install their own equipment, from solar panels to wind turbines, for on-site generation. Many utilities offer the option for companies to purchase green power by paying a premium for electricity generated from renewable sources. Other companies use power purchase agreements (PPAs), or long-term agreements with renewable electricity producers, such as solar power plants or wind farms. These offer cost savings for the purchaser and stability for the provider.</p>



<p>They’re using that renewable energy for a wide variety of things, including:</p>



<p>Powering operations: In manufacturing, wind energy and solar power are fueling warehouses and factories. In the agriculture sector, innovations such as solar-powered irrigation systems are reducing reliance on fossil fuels and decreasing operating costs. And as growing use of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence (AI)</a> and other new technologies increase demand for energy-intensive data centers, major tech companies are using renewable power sources to limit their environmental impact.</p>



<p>Optimizing energy efficiency: Companies are also investing in technologies to optimize their energy use and further reduce their carbon emissions. By integrating <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/optimizing-energy-production-with-the-latest-smart-grid-technologies/">smart grids</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/internet-of-things">Internet of Things (IoT)</a> devices, businesses can better manage their energy use.</p>



<p>Building sustainable supply chains: Companies are looking beyond their own operations to their <a href="https://www.ibm.com/resources/business-operations/supply-chain-sustainability">supply chains</a>, recognizing that they can make a significant impact on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/scope-3-emissions">Scope 3 emissions</a>. They are increasingly requiring their suppliers to use renewable energy and adopt energy-efficient practices.</p>



<p>Meeting compliance and sustainability reporting requirements: Using renewable energy can help businesses meet mandatory reporting requirements and contribute to local and international goals in the fight against climate change.</p>



<p>Enhancing brand reputation: More and more consumers prefer to support businesses that prioritize sustainability and offer green products. By harnessing renewable energy, companies can position themselves as leaders in their industry and attract environmentally conscious customers.</p>



<p>Creating new income streams: Businesses that generate more renewable energy than they consume can sell the surplus back to the grid through feed-in tariffs or net metering arrangements. They can also earn <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/renewable-energy-procurement-options/">Renewable Energy Certificates</a> (RECs) for the power they generate. Some are adopting an “Energy as a Service” (EaaS) model, opening up opportunities to manage energy systems and efficiency for other companies.</p>



 What the future holds 



<p>Going forward, innovations in renewable energy storage and grid integration will open new doors for ways to make use of green power, while artificial intelligence and machine learning aid in optimizing energy use. Countries, corporations, communities and even individuals are showing that integrating renewable power into business operations can drive both sustainability and innovation—and pave the way for a more sustainable future.

<p>According to the most recent PYMNTS Intelligence report, more than 40% of financial institutions (FIs) are seeing increasing volumes of fraud and financial crime. This puts credit unions between a rock and a hard place: friction vs security.</p>



<p>Quick catch-up: Traditional KYC methods often lead to tedious, friction-filled processes such as:</p>



 
 Manual processing 



 Relying on third parties 



 Physical branch visits 



 Delays in account access 



 The list can go on and on. 
 



<p>But this process is now obsolete thanks to reusable credentials.</p>



<p>Why it matters: With reusable credentials, credit unions only need to verify a member once. By applying cutting-edge technology, reusable credentials not only take friction out of your operations, but makes every touch point more secure than ever before.</p>



<p><a href="https://go.sudoplatform.com/rs/971-PEA-288/images/KYC%20eBook%202b.pdf?version=0">See how reusable credentials can revolutionize credit union operations in our new eBook, “KYC: A New Age of Less Fraud and Friction”.</a></p>



<p>The big picture: Say goodbye to “What is your mother’s maiden name?” With reusable credentials, credit unions will revolutionize their operations and create an incredible member experience with seamless interactions in every channel.</p>



 Dive deeper 







<p>Beyond credit union KYC: the ongoing friction struggle</p>



<p>Friction is an ongoing challenge for credit unions at every touch point. There can be different login or verification experiences at every channel.</p>



<p>The core issue that causes most of the friction in your operations is the temporary nature of current credit union KYC and identity verification. While the initial KYC process validates a member’s identity for account opening, this verification is a one-time use and cannot be reused. For members to have day-to-day interactions with their credit union they’ll have to repeatedly verify their identity. Not to mention that the current methods can be reproduced by bad actors.</p>



<p>Security questions can be easily guessed through social engineering, tellers may struggle to differentiate between fake and real IDs, and SMS-based verifications are often indistinguishable from phishing.</p>



<p>The current credit union KYC process not only causes delays in member service and satisfaction but also burdens employees in the fight against fraud, potentially leading to financial losses.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Give your members the experience of “pre-check”</p>



<p>Drawing inspiration from the success of TSA Pre-check&nbsp; in travel, Anonyome Labs’ solution introduces credentials that are persistent, irrefutable, and customer-controlled. By applying this concept to credit unions, the result is an elevated member experience where KYC becomes a persistent validation process.</p>



<p>&nbsp;With reusable credentials, credit unions only need to verify a member once, ensuring seamless and secure interactions from account sign-up to every subsequent touchpoint. This innovative technology eliminates the need for repetitive verifications, reducing friction in member interactions, and enhancing overall security. (All without disrupting existing solutions, processes, or member experiences.)</p>



<p></p>



<p>Tellers can focus on member experience instead of fake IDs</p>



<p>Only <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/PYMNTS-FIs-Revamping-Technologies-to-Fight-Financial-Crimes-December-2023.pdf">30% of financial institutions</a> plan on taking feedback from their employees or their customers’ needs when selecting solutions partners.</p>



<p>Reusable credentials will transform your member and employee experience. Employees, especially those in critical roles such as call centers and tellers, will be empowered to be more effective&nbsp;for the overall security and satisfaction of credit union members.</p>



<p>Tellers and employees often&nbsp; bear the responsibility of verifying member identities, a task full of pressure and potential security risks. With reusable credentials, the burden is significantly lifted, as the need for repetitive verifications.</p>



<p>Call center employees can shift their focus from identity validation to enhancing the member experience, fostering quicker response times and more efficient interactions. Similarly, tellers are no longer in high-stress situations like having to distinguish between genuine and forged IDs.</p>



<p>Providing usable credentials cultivates a positive atmosphere for both employees and credit union members.</p>







<p>Credit union KYC innovation is easy</p>



<p>Credit unions are losing members due to a lack of innovation. A <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/study/credit-union-innovation-real-time-payments-fintechs/">PYMNTS Intelligence</a> research study found:</p>



 
 27% of credit union members say they would consider changing financial institutions (FIs) to access new products or more innovative solutions. 



 This willingness to switch has increased to 27%, up from 17% since 2018. 



 The share of CU members willing to switch to more innovative solutions is very close to the number of non-CU members willing to do the same, 29%. 
 



<p>Between member’s preferences and the continual increase in fraud, it is vital for credit unions to implement new technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Partnering with a technology provider, like Anonyome Labs, makes adding cutting-edge technology to your existing operations not only doable, but seamless. <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Our technology</a> includes everything you need to build reusable credentials into your existing apps and systems. No need to rip and replace what’s been working for years.</p>



<p></p>



 FAQ: Reusable credentials and decentralized identity&nbsp; 



How do reusable credentials work?&nbsp;




<p>1. Initial identity verification: When a member joins a credit union or starts an account, a decentralized identity (DI) system verifies their identity using robust authentication methods.<br></p>







<p>2. Creation of reusable credentials: Once the member’s identity is verified, the DI system generates reusable credentials. These credentials are encrypted – making them tamper-proof and secure.<br></p>







<p>3. Ownership and control: Unlike traditional identity systems where organizations manage and store user data, decentralized identity gives ownership and control to the individual. For credit unions, this means the member owns their credentials and they are stored securely on their device, including the ability to store and present credentials from within your app and interfaces.<br></p>







<p>4. Verification at touchpoints: For every interaction with the credit union, whether it’s logging into an app, contacting the call center, or visiting a branch, the member can present their reusable credentials. These credentials serve as irrefutable proof of their identity without the need for repetitive verification processes.</p>



 




How can reusable credentials help credit unions?




 
 Enhanced security: Reusable credentials enhance security by reducing the reliance on traditional methods prone to fraud. For example, traditional security measures, such as security questions that can be exploited through social engineering or SMS-based verifications that are susceptible to phishing, are replaced by reusable credentials.<br> 
 







 
 Frictionless member experience: Reusable credentials ensure a seamless and frictionless experience for credit union members. Once verified, members enjoy a continuous and secure interaction across various touchpoints without the need for repeated identity checks.<br> 
 







 
 Privacy protection: Since members control their reusable credentials, they have the flexibility to share only the necessary information at each interaction. This is a privacy-centered approach that gives individuals greater control over their personal data.  
 



<p>Reusable credentials redefine the way identity is managed, placing control in the hands of members and ensuring a secure, convenient, and privacy-focused experience across various credit union touchpoints.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://go.sudoplatform.com/rs/971-PEA-288/images/KYC%20eBook%202b.pdf?version=0">See how reusable credentials can affect credit union operations here.</a></p>



 




What is decentralized identity?




<p>Decentralized identity (DI) is a shift in the way identity is managed. It is moving away from centralized systems controlled by organizations to a model where individuals have greater control over their own identity information.</p>



<p>A decentralized identity looks like this:</p>



 
 Reusable credentials: Identity credentials, once verified, can become reusable and portable across various services and applications. Users can present their credentials without the need for repeated identity verification, streamlining interactions and reducing friction.<br> 



 Tamper-proof technology: Decentralized identity uses technology, such as blockchain, to record and verify identity information. This technology ensures that the data is secure, tamper-proof, and resistant to single points of failure.<br> 



 Secure communication: By its very nature, decentralized identity provides perpetual, irrefutable, and secure communication across all channels, with built-in, ultra-secure and immediate authentication and identity validation. <br> 



 Reduced identity fraud: By giving individuals control over their identity and leveraging advanced security technology, DI can drastically reduce the risk of identity fraud.<br> 



 Privacy by design: Privacy is a fundamental principle of DI. Users have control over what information they share. This approach contrasts with centralized systems where users often give over control of their data.<br> 



 User control: Individuals own and control their identity information. Unlike traditional systems where large organizations store and manage user data, decentralized identity empowers individuals to own and manage their digital identities. Protecting both individuals and organizations. 
 



<p>Decentralized identity has the power to reshape how individuals interact with digital services, ensuring greater privacy, security, and user control over their identity. As the technology continues to evolve, DI solutions are becoming increasingly relevant across various industries, including finance, healthcare, and beyond.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drpaulashley/">Dr. Paul Ashley,</a> who’s spent over 25 years in the privacy and security space, says this about DI: “There’s been a decade of work before the projects the world is looking at now. I have rarely ever seen a technology that has been so thoughtfully designed as this from a security and privacy point of view.”</p>



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://privacyfiles.com/?p=447">Listen to the Privacy Files podcast episode where Dr. Paul Ashley explains decentralized identity to get the full picture</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 




How can reusable credentials prevent fraud?
 
 Cryptographic security: Reusable credentials use advanced tech (cryptography) to secure information. This makes credentials tamper-proof which reduces the risk of fraudsters attempting to manipulate or replicate identity information.<br> 



 Irrefutable proof of identity: Once a user’s identity is verified and made into a reusable credential, it is irrefutable proof of their identity. Traditional methods, such as security questions or SMS verifications, are more susceptible to social engineering or phishing.&nbsp;<br> 



 Reduced weak security points: Traditional KYC methods often include the exchange of sensitive information, creating potential attack points for fraudsters. Reusable credentials limit the places where fraudulent activities can occur.<br> 



 Decentralized ownership: With decentralized identity, users own and control their reusable credentials. This decentralization minimizes the risk of large-scale data breaches, as there’s no single data center storing a vast amount of sensitive user information. 
 



 




How can reusable credentials decrease friction?
 
 Seamless interactions: Reusable credentials streamline user interactions across various touchpoints, eliminating the need for repetitive identity verification. Once a user’s identity is verified and a reusable credential is established, subsequent interactions, whether online, in-app, or in-person, become seamless. This reduces friction and enhances the overall member experience.<br> 



 Single verification point: With reusable credentials, the need for repeated identity checks is gone. Users can verify their identity once, and the credentials can be used at different touchpoints without the necessity for additional verifications.<br> 



 Privacy and consent control: Users have control over what information is shared with service providers. They can selectively disclose only the necessary information for a particular interaction. This privacy-centric approach minimizes the amount of data exchanged, contributing to a smoother, more privacy-respecting user experience. 
 



 




Are reusable credentials being used in other industries?
<p>Reusable credentials are gaining traction and being explored in various industries beyond finance. Here are some examples:</p>



 
 Healthcare: In the healthcare sector, reusable credentials can play a vital role in securely managing patient identities, medical records, and access permissions. Patients could have portable credentials for verifying their identity during medical visits, and healthcare providers can access relevant information securely.<br> 



 Government services: Governments are exploring DI and reusable credentials for services such as issuing digital IDs, driver’s licenses, and other official documents. This approach can enhance security, reduce identity fraud, and provide citizens with more control over their personal information.<br> 



 Education: In the education sector, reusable credentials can be used for academic certifications and transcripts. Students could have a secure and portable credential that verifies their education, which they can present to employers or other educational institutions.<br> 



 Farming and mining: Regulated industries, such as farming and mining, require members to comply with established regulations and to perform compliance reporting to government agencies. Reusable credentials can be used in these two industries when submitting reports to government agencies or receiving certifications – even across wildly disparate certifying bodies and reporting organizations.<br> 



 Supply chain and logistics: Reusable credentials can be applied in supply chain and logistics for secure tracking of products and verifying the authenticity of goods. This can help prevent counterfeiting and ensuring the integrity of the supply chain.<br> 



 Travel and hospitality: The travel industry is exploring the use of reusable credentials for seamless and secure identity verification at airports, hotels, car rentals, and other travel-related services. This could simplify the check-in process and enhance the overall travel experience.<br> 



 Retail and e-commerce: Reusable credentials can enhance the security of online transactions in retail and e-commerce by providing users with a secure and portable identity for authentication. This can help reduce fraud in online purchases.<br> 



 Human resources and employment: For employment-related processes, reusable credentials can be used for verifiable employment history, certifications, and qualifications and even background checks. This can streamline the hiring process and provide employers with confidence in the candidate’s credentials. 
 




<p></p>



<p>Reusable credential technology is promising; widespread adoption across industries is still evolving. Various pilot programs, initiatives, and collaborations are underway to explore the potential of decentralized identity and reusable credentials in solving identity-related challenges, improving security, and better user experiences across industries.</p>

This is the culmination of a long path that began, for Mattereum, back in 2017, but for me, much&nbsp;earlier.</p><p>Nine years ago (almost to the day!) I started as launch coordinator for Ethereum, and I set out the big vision for it in Ethereum’s launch document <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/by-the-end-of-this-article-youre-going-to-understand-blockchains-in-general-and-ethereum-a-next-e11df6a1d7cf">Programmable Blockchains In Context</a>. It was nothing less than a new vision for the blockchain, a vision based around smart contracts. Bitcoin’s launch in 2009 is conventionally seen as the inflection point, the moment when everything changed, the moment when the blockchain became the future. I am not so sure, we’d definitely never seen anything like that before, but Bitcoin was weird money, and decided to stay as weird money, even though the prospect of the blockchain being able to do everything could be seen by the far-sighted from the start — Satoshi got it, it’s there in the original <a href="https://bitcoinwhitepaper.co/">Bitcoin whitepaper</a> — “Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect&nbsp;buyers”.</p><p>So, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j23HnORQXvs">Ethereum</a> happened. The key thing that you could do with Ethereum that you could not do with Bitcoin was smart contracts; you could use the blockchain as a computer to execute digital contracts that would allow it to do almost anything. This loosed the true potential of the blockchain on the world — the ability to create new kinds of property, beyond money itself. It is perhaps this that was the true inflection point. In a <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/what-does-ether-100-mean-bb58522f781e">piece I wrote</a> when ETH hit $100 I described its origins as “a bunch of funny-looking villains pull together this remarkable piece of technology which, at the time, we thought was going to change the world”, and well, it kind of did, but maybe not how we envisaged it.</p><p>As I write this ETH has just hit $3500, the NFT craze, which needed Ethereum to function, has come and gone making a whole lot of people a bunch of money, then, just as quickly, losing it for them again. There have been scandals, frauds and rug pulls, and the entire reputation of the blockchain, particularly Ethereum, <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/be-realistic-demand-the-incorruptible-fa15d6401b0e">stank like a month-old kipper</a> for a while. But those of us with the long view know about the <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/at-the-turning-point-how-crypto-interacts-with-real-world-assets-b4bf3c4b217c">Perez Cycle</a>. This describes how world-changing innovations undergo a steep innovation curve, create unsustainable bubbles, which burst, ruin a lot of people, become radioactively untouchable for a while, then have the sound, workable elements picked up by mature actors and built into solid, useful and profitable long term businesses. We saw it in the dotcom boom, we saw it in 1929 with the stock market, and even with the railway boom way back in the mid-19th century. Out of these came web 2.0, the modern financial system, and most countries’ transport infrastructure. And so it is with Ethereum. What we have seen so far may not have embodied the vision we had for Ethereum, but that vision was not&nbsp;lost.</p><p>I have kept that vision in sight and sat tight. Mostly, the Mattereum team are old, at least compared to other blockchain people, and have seen the Perez Cycle before; one of our team ran a top level domain in the early 2000s and I lived through the dotcom crunch. While bull markets turn to bear markets and back, and crypto winters come and go, we have had our eyes on long-term mature use cases. We have spent the time doing the hard, complicated, slow work that builds the machinery to make Ethereum everything it was supposed to be so that it has a long-term future.</p><p>If you wonder why the blockchain has not got greater traction, why it has just been the locus of fads, fancies and scams, it is because it hasn’t had a mechanism to connect it to the real world. It’s been like an engine revving in isolation, it needs the gearbox to connect it to the wheels so that it has grip on the road and the traction to actually get somewhere. Mattereum has been building that gearbox, the thing that gives the Ethereum blockchain a way of grasping the physical world by firmly and legally connecting it to RWA. That way it can achieve what it was always meant to do. The reason I left the Ethereum Foundation was that I saw that this is what was needing to be done and it was becoming increasingly clear that they were not going to do it, so I needed to. Now I have, through Mattereum.</p><p>But what is it exactly that I have done? What was it that took six years and millions of dollars of investment? Mattereum has built the digital and legal infrastructure that enables the sale and lease of physical property and other assets through smart contracts using Ethereum. To do this we have created the Mattereum Asset Passport (MAP), which is a detailed product description of physical assets backed by legal warranties bundled together using smart contracts on the blockchain. With our partners at Swarm, we can now tokenize any asset a lawyer can recognise and fractionalize it too, and any asset or fraction of an asset comes with the Mattereum protections. This means that when you buy a real world asset token that has a MAP on Ethereum, you have unambiguous legal ownership of the linked physical asset. If you buy a token representing a gold bar, it enables you to turn up at the vault where the gold bar is stored and say “that specific gold bar there is mine” and have your claim accepted.</p><p>This is major — it is a potentially world-changing innovation.</p><p>Moreover, a MAP provides guarantees that the real world asset it describes is as claimed. If you buy a piece of real estate with a MAP that has been guaranteed to be in a certain condition and you turn up to find the roof leaks and the drains are blocked, you have the right to make a claim and be compensated. It is not just Mattereum that makes these promises, it is independent guarantors, and legal claims against them can be made in 172 jurisdictions worldwide — Mattereum’s legal infrastructure is built on UK common law provisions for digital commerce and is enforceable in 172 jurisdictions under international law. We help create a doubt-free environment for trade. We’ve started with gold, real estate, luxury goods, art, antiques, and other items where authenticity is particularly important, but ultimately our system could be used for everything. There are huge implications for this that I’ve explored in more depth <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">elsewhere</a>.</p><p>It’s easy to claim to put physical, real world stuff on chain, but it’s hard to prove that the stuff is real to a buyer on the other side of the world, and it’s even harder if that buyer is an AI (the Mattereum system also has important implications for enabling AI to connect to the physical world). Without the ability to prove that stuff is real, there’s no way to keep scammers out, and RWA scams will make the old NFT scams look trivial. Allow the scams to thrive and the long term viability of Ethereum as a global platform for trade will be doomed. Mattereum’s system squashes scammers like&nbsp;bugs.</p><p>If you buy things like stock in major companies, say Facebook or Tesla, due diligence is built in, but for most other things, like real estate, you have to do that work for yourself before you buy, and it’s expensive. Diligence is the hard problem in almost all financial transactions.</p><p>Mattereum solves this; it is essentially a diligence facilitation company for Ethereum. Any transaction done on Ethereum for an asset with a MAP has the diligence done automatically.</p><p>We can do this for Mattereum customers, but we can also do it for other companies in the RWA space. Making it work took time and money (a lot of both); other companies putting RWAs on the blockchain don’t have to repeat that work, we can provide our system to them as a service, giving them a shortcut to secure and reliable tokenization and fractionalization.</p><p>Mattereum has built upon successive waves of innovation on the blockchain that have peaked and then crashed, building as more and more people get involved. At each step there are ten times the number of people involved than were in the previous wave, and each time that happens the story changes radically. Eventually the innovation reaches escape velocity and goes stratospheric, and, I believe, this is where we are&nbsp;now.</p><p>Our system has the potential to be the rails on which the future of commerce runs. Serious TradFi people are getting it; <a href="https://x.com/radarhits/status/1746155031265489197?s=46&amp;t=kMmiWeWpV1U1zyPrnuPkAA">Larry Fink from BlackRock Capital </a>has come out in favour of a tokenized future, saying that their great new horizon is tokenization of every real world financial asset, and Mark Yusko, founder of Morgan Creek Capital Management, has followed him, <a href="https://twitter.com/EstateProtocol/status/1751673693141361095">saying</a> “everything of value in the world will eventually be a token”. The City of London, too, gets it, the world’s leading financial centre. The Lord Mayor, who heads the City, has set up his <a href="https://www.mainelli.org/?page_id=3704">Smart Economy Networks</a> project, which has tokenized assets as a major plank and actually names Mattereum as a key company in the network. Before all this, Sir Geoffrey Vos, the Master of the Rolls, head of the UK’s civil justice system, involved Mattereum in the development of the UK’s <a href="https://share-eu1.hsforms.com/1ZYEqf0C5RyKJ-hw8HuIDLwg7g8s?__hstc=210657930.bd681f8e55dc4f22c4da469838e87c56.1708433139509.1708433139509.1708433139509.1&amp;__hssc=210657930.1.1708433139509&amp;__hsfp=3782222774">Digital Dispute Resolution Rules</a> (DDRR) as he <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Speech-MR-to-Smarter-Contracts-Report-Launch-Lawtech-UK-UKJT-Blockchain-Smart-Contracts.pdf">is a firm believer in the blockchain</a> as the future of commerce, and sees the opportunities offered by Mattereum’s innovations. Mattereum has gone on to be the first company to use the DDRR in their&nbsp;work.</p><p>Over the past ten years we’ve gone from a single lone hero talking about building smart contracts into Bitcoin (Vitalik’s <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/mastercoin-a-second-generation-protocol-on-the-bitcoin-blockchain-1383603310">MasterCoin</a>) to the leaders of TradFi insisting that blockchains, tokenization and similar are the future of&nbsp;finance.</p><p>We nailed this. Too early to know if we won or not, but back in 2015, the Ethereum team wrote the rulebook for the future of finance and many other things. Now Mattereum is delivering on&nbsp;it.</p><p>In the end it’s about the&nbsp;money.</p><p>How much&nbsp;money?</p><p>All of it: how much information is left offline these days in unscanned paper books and undigitized music? A few percent. What we are doing is like that, but with money and assets. We have the potential to be bigger than Visa; I had long conversations about Mattereum with Dee Hock, Visa’s founder, and he did not think this was ridiculous.</p><p>Ethereum is now hitting Early Adopters where institutions with real use cases stop trying to fit the technology into their existing technology stack, and start moving their assets on to Ethereum’s technology stack, Mattereum is here to guarantee that this works. This is the beginning of “TradFi” and “DeFi” merging into, well, just&nbsp;“Fi”.</p><p>This is a once in a century transformation, like when music went digital. That doesn’t happen&nbsp;twice.</p><p>We held back on issuing a token until now, until we were sure we were being lifted by an unstoppable rising tide, and the legal, licensing and regulatory environment were ready. We could have leapt onboard with one during the ICO goldrush with everyone else, but our strategic mindset said “wait”, and we were not wrong. With the mature use case for the blockchain that we were planning for now being understood by the serious players, now is the time, so the decision was taken to launch MATR, a token offering discounts on Mattereum’s products and services..</p><p>Mattereum’s purpose is to provide a legal structure for RWA operations on the blockchain so that when users buy a tokenized asset such as real estate or gold, the purchaser of the token unambiguously owns the connected physical asset, or a fraction of the physical asset if it has been fractionalized as well. As a result, it was particularly important for any token associated with the Mattereum Group to be constructed in a legally sound way that provides the protections for purchasers that many other tokens fail to do. Without such protections other token buyers are vulnerable to rug-pulls and other sharp (and illegal) practices. To do this, Mattereum’s chosen path was to incorporate a subsidiary in Germany (Mattereum GmbH) which could mint and sell the MATR token through Swarm, a fully regulated and licensed German exchange operating under the same regulations and to the same standards as TradFi banking institutions in Germany and so providing customers with equivalent protections.</p><p>This was not, perhaps, the simplest route, but it was the one that gave MATR the absolutely best protection. We believe we are the first group to issue a token through an exchange regulated under the same rules as banks, but we hope this paves the way for more people to do things the same way. It involved more lawyers and negotiation than other routes, but it works, and now we’ve done it we can help others do it too, adding assistance with token issue processes to Mattereum’s portfolio.</p><p>The <a href="https://mattereum.de/token-whitepaper/?utm_source=Medium&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=MATR-launch-2024-02-29">Mattereum Discount Token White Paper</a> gives the exact formal details of how the MATR token works, but essentially it offers a discount on Mattereum fees for transactions with real world assets on chain, such as Onboarding Fees and Certifier Fees. Each token used reduces the fee by 1% and given that, in turn, onboarding fees are 1% of the assets’ selling price, for the kind of assets we’ll be onboarding, the discount received for using a token could be substantial. Let’s just have a look at how that would play out in a real transaction:</p><p>If a client wishes to onboard a $1m asset, the onboarding fee would be $10,000. If they use MATR tokens to reduce this fee, each token reduces the onboarding fee by 1% (subject to a maximum discount of USD $10,000), and a user can burn up to 50 tokens per asset. So for that $1m asset this means that burning the maximum of 50 tokens would result in a 50% reduction in the onboarding fee, or $5000. For that transaction each token would represent a cost saving of $100, and they are currently on sale* at $0.65 per token (going up in increments to $2.00 until the sale ends on 4 July — details are in the white&nbsp;paper).</p> We think this will be&nbsp;popular.

<p>At the end of 2023, a survey conducted by the IBM® Institute for Business Value (IBV) found that respondents believe government leaders often overestimate the public’s trust in them. They also found that, while the public is still wary about new technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), most people are in favor of government adoption of generative AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IBV surveyed a diverse group of more than 13,000 adults across nine countries including the US, Canada, the UK, Australia and Japan. All respondents had at least a basic understanding of AI and generative AI.</p>



<p>The survey was designed to gain an understanding of individual perspectives on generative AI and its use by companies and governments, along with their expectations and intent in using this technology at work and in their personal lives. Respondents answered questions about their levels of trust in governments and their views on governments adopting and leveraging generative AI to deliver government services.</p>



<p>These findings reveal the complex nature of public trust in institutions and provide key insights for government decision-makers as they adopt generative AI on a global scale.</p>



 An overestimation of public trust: Discrepancies in perception 



<p>Trust is one of the main pillars of public institutions. According to Cristina Caballe Fuguet, Global Government Leader at IBM Consulting, “Trust is at the core of the government’s ability to perform their duties effectively. Citizens’ trust in governments, from local representatives to the highest posts in the national government, depends on multiple elements, including the delivery of public services.”<br><br>Trust is essential as governments take the lead on critical issues like climate change, public health and the safe and ethical integration of emerging technologies into societies. The current digital age demands more integrity, openness, trust and security as key pillars to building trust.</p>



<p>According to another <a href="https://www.businessofgovernment.org/report/future-shocks-roadmap">recent study</a> by the IBV, the IBM Institute for the Business of Government and the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA), most government leaders understand building trust requires focus and commitment to collaboration, transparency and competence in execution. However, the most recent IBV research indicates trust in governments among constituents is in decline.</p>



<p>Respondents indicate their trust in federal and central governments has declined most since the start of the pandemic, with 39% of respondents indicating that their level of trust in their country’s government organizations is very low or extremely low, compared to 29% prior to the pandemic.</p>



<p>This contrasts with the perceptions of surveyed government leaders in the same study, as they indicate they are confident they have established and effectively grown trust in their organizations among constituents since the COVID-19 pandemic. This discrepancy in the perception of trust indicates that government leaders must find a way to better understand their constituents and reconcile their views on how the public sector institutions are performing with how they are perceived by constituents.</p>



<p>The study also found that building trust in AI-powered tools and citizen services will be a challenge for governments. Nearly half of respondents indicate that they trust more traditional human-assisted services, and only about 1 in 5 indicate they trust AI-powered services more.</p>



 Open and transparent AI implementation is the key to trust 



<p>This year, <a href="https://time.com/6550920/world-elections-2024/">more than 60 countries</a> and the EU (representing almost half of the population of the world) will head to the polls to elect their representatives. Governments&nbsp;leaders face myriad challenges, including ensuring that technologies work for—and not against—democratic principles, institutions and societies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to David Zaharchuck, Research Director, Thought Leadership for the IBV, “Ensuring the safe and ethical integration of AI into our societies and the global economy will be one of the greatest challenges and opportunities for governments over the next quarter century.”<br><br>Most surveyed individuals indicate they have concerns about the potential negative impacts of generative AI. This shows that most of the public is still wrapping their mind around this technology and how it can be designed and deployed by organizations in a trusted a responsible way, adhering to strict security and regulatory requirements.</p>



<p>The IBV study revealed that people still have a level of concern when it comes to the adoption of this emerging technology and the impact that it can have on issues like decision-making, privacy and data security or job security.</p>



<p>Despite their general lack of trust in the government and in emerging technologies, most surveyed individuals agree with government use of generative AI for customer service and believe the rate of adoption for generative AI by governments is appropriate. Less than 30% of those surveyed believe the pace of adoption in the public and private sectors is too fast. Most believe it is just right, and some even think it is too slow.</p>



<p>When it comes to specific use cases of generative AI, survey respondents have mixed views about using generative AI for various citizen services; however, a majority agree with governments using generative AI for customer service, tax and legal advisory services, and for educational purposes.</p>



<p>These finding show that citizens see the value in governments leveraging AI and generative AI. However, trust is an issue. If citizens don’t trust governments now, they certainly won’t if governments make mistakes as they adopt AI. Implementing generative AI in an open and transparent ways enables governments to build trust and capability at the same time.<br><br>According to Casey Wreth, Global Government Industry Leader at IBM Technology, “The future of generative AI in the public sector is promising, but the technology brings new complexities and risks that must be proactively addressed. Government leaders need to implement AI governance to manage risks, support their compliance programs and most importantly gain public trust on its wider use.”</p>



 Integrated AI governance helps ensure trustworthy AI 



<p>“As the adoption of generative AI continues to increase this year, it’s vital that citizens have access to transparent and explainable AI workflows that bring light to the black box of what’s generated using AI with tools like <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-governance?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700076341632652&amp;p5=e&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA8YyuBhBSEiwA5R3-Eyx6FYV7X0dDYV4gryNDiSrMxj036f3bpXA8b--RKlz0cX47kVqEfBoC4AIQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">watsonx.governance™</a>. In this way, governments can be stewards of the responsible implementation of this groundbreaking technology,” says Wreth.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/watsonx?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700076341632478&amp;p5=e&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw6KunBhDxARIsAKFUGs8UPvG6yjVBf59Xv_mfwxww7py7ifT_JDr6wifywtjKCH8Ai4xMTmAaApgIEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">IBM watsonx™</a>, an integrated AI, data and governance platform, embodies five fundamental pillars to help ensure trustworthy AI: fairness, privacy, explainability, transparency&nbsp;and robustness.</p>



<p>This platform offers a seamless, efficient and responsible approach to AI development across various environments. More specifically, the recent launch of&nbsp;<a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2023-11-14-IBM-Unveils-watsonx-governance-to-Help-Businesses-Governments-Govern-and-Build-Trust-in-Generative-AI">IBM watsonx.governance</a>&nbsp;helps public sector teams automate and address these areas, enabling them to direct, manage and monitor their organization’s AI activities.</p>



<p>In essence, this tool opens the black box about where and how any AI model gets the information for its outputs, similar to the function of a <a href="https://fedscoop.com/ibm-envisions-government-private-sector-uses-for-new-ai-nutrition-label-tool/">nutrition label</a>, facilitating government transparency. This tool also facilitates clear processes so organizations can proactively detect and mitigate risks while supporting their compliance programs for internal AI policies and industry standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the public sector continues to embrace AI and automation to solve problems and improve efficiency, it is crucial to maintain trust and transparency in any AI solution. Governments must comprehend and manage the full AI lifecycle effectively, and leaders should be able to easily explain what data was used to train and fine-tune models, as well as how the models reached their outcomes. Proactively adopting responsible AI practices is an opportunity for all of us to improve, and it is an opportunity for governments to lead with transparency as they harness AI for good.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Managed DNS is where a third-party hosts and optimizes your DNS resolution architecture to provide the fastest, most secure, most reliable experience.</p>



<p>Perhaps the easiest way to explain it is by looking at the opposite scenario: what if you&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;have a managed DNS service in place?</p>



<p>Every query in the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/dns">Domain Name System (DNS)</a> follows the same logic to resolve IP addresses. If the DNS records for sites aren’t found in the local cache, DNS will progressively query a series of servers until it finds the right answer from the authoritative DNS server associated with that domain.</p>



<p>If you’re running a website without a&nbsp;managed DNS solution, that means you’re directly responsible for answering every authoritative DNS query from around the world. It’s certainly possible to manage your own authoritative DNS, but there are some risks.</p>



 
 Availability: DNS traffic patterns vary widely and are often unpredictable. If you’re directly answering all queries for your domain, you will need enough capacity to handle sudden spikes in volume. That usually requires sophisticated load balancing and failover systems. 



 Security: Managing your own DNS means that when a&nbsp;direct denial of service (DDoS)&nbsp;attack hits, you must be able to answer all of those queries. If you don’t have the capacity, then your site goes down. To <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/ddos-protection">mitigate the effects of DDoS attacks</a>, your DNS infrastructure needs the ability to absorb any queries that come in. 



 Performance: DNS queries can come from anywhere around the world. To provide the type of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/application-performance-optimization">site performance every user expects</a>, you have to deliver answers within just a few milliseconds. Since internet queries can only travel so fast, delivering “standard” site performance requires a worldwide network of servers (called “points of presence”). These networks deliver answers to DNS queries at scale— a significant investment for most companies. 



 Cost: It’s possible to deliver DNS on your own with enough availability, security and performance to get the job done. Yet for most organizations, it’s not worth doing on their own. Building a global network of data centers with enough capacity, security and resilience to meet the requirements of today’s internet requires a significant investment in both equipment and people. 
 



 Table stakes: What every managed DNS offering provides 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/managed-dns">Managed DNS providers</a>&nbsp;deliver the highly available, secure system organizations need to provide peak performance at a fraction of the cost of building a DNS resolution network on your own.</p>



<p>Since the early 2000s, managed DNS providers have provided a standardized offering for organizations that don’t want to host their own authoritative DNS. Smaller organizations often purchased a basic managed DNS service through the domain registration process, while larger organizations sought out premium providers with more specific domain expertise.</p>



<p>Today, it’s a given that any premium&nbsp;managed DNS service offering&nbsp;will provide 100% uptime through a worldwide anycast DNS network. These systems are <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/network-resilience-uptime">resilient and redundant</a>, with strong DNS failover architectures to keep sites up and running. Every managed DNS platform provides control panels, dashboards and metrics so you can analyze performance over time and improve resilience by removing broken endpoints.</p>



<p>The pricing of premium managed DNS offerings is also fairly standardized and straightforward across providers. For the most part, it’s based on usage, allowing customers to pay only for what they use rather than for capacity.</p>



 The next evolution of managed DNS 



<p>Managed DNS continues to evolve, adding advanced functionality on top of the basic value of an always-on, performance-driven DNS offering. Here are a few additional features that anyone considering a managed DNS offering should consider. Some of these features are for advanced users, but as time goes on, they’re bound to become more commonplace.</p>



<p>Traffic management: Managed DNS now goes beyond basic load balancing to optimize performance, control costs and provide an optimal application experience. IBM® NS1 Connect®’s powerful <a>Filter Chain</a><a>[GG1]</a>&nbsp; technology&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/addons/dns-traffic-steering">optimizes DNS routing decisions</a>&nbsp;based on specific use cases.</p>



<p>Infrastructure as code: Today’s networks are driven by DevOps, edge computingand serverless architectures, which require an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/api">API-first approach</a> to infrastructure. NS1 turns DNS into an enabler of these systems (rather than a blocker) through REST APIs with pre-configured architectures that are easy to use. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/integrations">Integration with tools like Terraform</a> makes connecting to existing systems even easier.<br><br>Dedicated DNS: Some organizations want to go the extra mile to ensure that their DNS is protected against wide-scale outages while still outsourcing their external DNS. NS1 offers a physically and logically separate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/addons/dedicated-dns">dedicated DNS</a>&nbsp;service for these customers, giving them an extra layer of redundant protection.</p>



<p>Data-driven: Real-time analytics dramatically improve the performance and responsiveness of today’s managed DNS offerings.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/addons/dns-traffic-steering">NS1 Connect offers advanced traffic steering capabilities</a> that use application data to determine the best routing for a specific point in time and specific application types. The result: significantly lower latency.</p>



<p>Performance in China: Delivering high-quality application experiences to users in the Chinese mainland presents unique challenges. To overcome the DNS latency impacts associated with the unique architecture of the Chinese internet, NS1 offers a specialized&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/addons/dns-for-china">managed DNS service for customers in mainland China</a>.</p>

   The difference between a&nbsp;CNAME&nbsp;record and an&nbsp;ALIAS&nbsp;record is not in the result, but in how they resolve the target DNS record when queried.

<p>The chief difference between a&nbsp;CNAME&nbsp;record and an&nbsp;ALIAS&nbsp;record is not in the result—both point to another&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/dns-record-types/">DNS record</a>—but in how they resolve the target DNS record when queried. As a result of this difference, one is safe to use at the zone apex (for example, naked domain such as example.com), while the other is not.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the CNAME record type. It simply points a DNS name, like www.example.com, at another DNS name, like lb.example.net.&nbsp; This tells the resolver to look up the answer at the reference name for all DNS types (for example, A, AAAA, MX, NS, SOA, and others). This introduces a performance penalty, since at least one additional DNS lookup must be performed to resolve the target (lb.example.net). In the case of neither record ever having been queried before by your recursive resolver, it’s even more expensive timewise, as the full DNS hierarchy may be traversed for both records:</p>



 
 You as the DNS client (or stub resolver) query your recursive resolver for www.example.com. 



 Your recursive resolver queries the root name server for www.example.com. 



 The root name server refers your recursive resolver to the .com Top-Level Domain (TLD) authoritative server. 



 Your recursive resolver queries the .com TLD authoritative server for www.example.com. 



 The .com TLD authoritative server refers your recursive server to the authoritative servers for example.com. 



 Your recursive resolver queries the authoritative servers for www.example.com and receives lb.example.net as the answer. 



 Your recursive resolver caches the answer and returns it to you. 



 You now issue a second query to your recursive resolver for lb.example.net. 



 Your recursive resolver queries the root name server for lb.example.net. 



 The root name server refers your recursive resolver to the .net Top-Level Domain (TLD) authoritative server. 



 Your recursive resolver queries the .net TLD authoritative server for lb.example.net. 



 The .net TLD authoritative server refers your recursive server to the authoritative servers for example.net. 



 Your recursive resolver queries the authoritative servers for lb.example.net and receives an IP address as the answer. 



 Your recursive resolver caches the answer and returns it to you. 
 



<p>Each of these steps consumes at least several milliseconds, often more, depending on network conditions. This can add up to a considerable amount of time that you spend waiting for the final, actionable answer of an IP address.</p>



<p>In the case of an ALIAS record, all the same actions are taken as with the CNAME, except the authoritative server for example.com performs steps six through thirteen for you and returns the final answer as both an IPv4 and IPv6 address. This offers two advantages and one significant drawback:</p>



 Advantages 



 Faster final answer resolution speed 



<p>In most cases, the authoritative servers for example.com will have the answer cached and thus can return the answer very quickly.</p>



<p>The alias response will be A and AAAA records.&nbsp;Since an ALIAS record returns the answer that comprises one or more IP addresses, it can be used anywhere an A or AAAA record can be used—including the zone apex. This makes it more flexible than a&nbsp;CNAME, which cannot be used at the zone apex.&nbsp; The flexibility of the Alias record is needed when your site is posted on some of the most popular CDNs that require the use of CNAME records if you want your users to be able to access it via the naked domain such as example.com.</p>



 Disadvantages 



 Geotargeting information is lost 



<p>Since it is the authoritative server for example.com that is issuing the queries for lb.example.net, then any intelligent routing functionality on the lb.example.net record will act upon the location of the authoritative server, not on your location. The&nbsp;EDNS0&nbsp;edns-client-subnet option does not apply here. This means that you may be potentially mis-routed: for example, if you are in New York and the authoritative server for example.com is in California, then lb.example.com will believe you to be in California and will return an answer that is distinctly sub-optimal for you in New York.&nbsp; However, if you are using a DNS provider with worldwide pops, then it is likely that the authoritative DNS server will be located in your region, thus mitigating this issue.</p>



<p>One important thing to note is that NS1 collapses CNAME records, provided that they all fall within the NS1 system. NS1’s nameservers are authoritative for both the CNAME and the target record. Collapsing simply means that the NS1 nameserver will return the full chain of records, from CNAME to final answer, in a single response. This eliminates all the additional lookup steps and allows you to use CNAME records, even in a nested configuration, without any performance penalty.</p>



<p>And even better, NS1 supports a unique record type called a Linked Record. This is basically a symbolic link within our platform that acts as an ALIAS record might, except with sub-microsecond resolution speed. To use a Linked Record, simply create the target record as you usually would (it can be of any type) and then create a second record to point to it and select the Linked Record option. Note that Linked Records can cross domain (zone) boundaries and even account boundaries within NS1 and offer a powerful way to organize and optimize your DNS record structure.</p>

<p>NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, have sparked a revolution in the ownership and exchange of unique digital assets. This innovation has birthed a burgeoning market where creators and collectors can engage in buying, selling, and trading. However, traditional NFTs, often referred to as “collectible NFTs,” are heavily influenced by market conditions, leading to volatility in values and, more importantly, volatility in interest.</p><p>In response, we propose the concept of “utility NFTs,” which offer a more practical and versatile approach. Unlike collectible NFTs, utility NFTs are issued and managed by enterprises or organizations for their customers and users, serving as a means of interaction. In this article, the first of a series showcasing Aergo’s future strategies and initiatives, we’ll unveil our roadmap for the rest of the year, packed with some significant updates.</p><p>Collectible vs Functional</p><p>Initially, many collectible NFTs primarily revolved around speculative trading. Although they can be widely accepted and utilized in dynamic sectors including gaming, the liquidity dynamics within NFT marketplaces tend to align with market conditions, posing challenges for enterprises seeking to integrate them directly into their services or products. Moreover, collectible NFTs are commonly associated with artistic and creative endeavors such as visual art, music, theater, and literature, further complicating efforts to sustain long-term value.</p><p>In contrast, utility NFTs position themselves with a real-world business component. The most distinguishable use case is probably in identification, where uniquely issued tokens offer a secure and reliable means of verifying individuals’ identities. They serve as a digital representation of one’s identity for premium membership and a gateway for accessing exclusive content, including the metaverse and other Web3 platforms.</p><p>Why Aergo Focuses on the&nbsp;Segment?</p><p>It is important to lure individual users through a user-friendly environment and B2C marketing for the organic growth of a platform. However, we have shifted our focus more towards the enterprise side of the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Enterprise-led NFT segment offers a unique opportunity as it automatically brings in loyal users and fosters a strong foundation for long-term collaboration and mutual growth. Additionally, enterprise involvement often lends credibility and stability to the NFT ecosystem.</p>Enterprise-led NFT Growth Trajectories<p>One example of Aergo’s enterprise-led NFT initiative is <a href="https://www.samsung.com/sg/members//samsung-members-nft/">Samsung Members regional NFT in Southeast Asia &amp; Oceania</a>. Samsung Members NFT serves as a key enabling holders to unlock exclusive experiences and rewards with Samsung. Samsung leverages NFTs as a gateway to its imaginary universe, <a href="https://www.samsung.com/ph/members/whats-new/new-drop-the-epic-club-nft-collection/">the Kaleidoscope</a>.</p><p>The number total count of unique digital assets(NFTs) created is gradually increasing. The recent transaction spike on Feb 21st is also linked to this initiative. While specifics are under NDAs and cannot be disclosed yet, it’s evident that more enterprises, as well as government affiliates and agencies, are venturing into the NFT market. We will reveal more details for various projects as they progress, sharing insights into our ongoing initiatives and the exciting developments ahead</p><p>Despite challenging market conditions, Aergo has made significant strides in establishing itself within the enterprise blockchain market. With a focus on efficiency and enterprise-friendliness, Aergo, Blocko, and CCCV are expanding to establish more use cases in the enterprise-led NFT initiative through strategic partnerships driven by the increasing demand for innovation within this&nbsp;segment.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/digital-assets-as-a-gateway-expanding-enterprise-led-nft-initiative-cb770dcf44ec">Digital Assets as a Gateway: Expanding Enterprise-led NFT Initiative</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Section 6 shows more cool plots from simulation.</p> 1. Before: One-Sided Predictions <p>In a given epoch, a predictoor bot would predict a direction (“up” or “down”), and stake on that prediction (e.g. 10 OCEAN if not confident, 1000 if highly confident). Call it “one-sided predictions”. The image below illustrates.</p>Prior to v0.3, prediction bots would only submit an “up” OR a “down” prediction, i.e. “one-sided prediction”.<p>The problem is: accuracy in up/down predictions is typically 50.5% to 60% max. With such accuracies, a bot is never very confident in its up vs down prediction. It can nonetheless make $ doing these predictions, but is there a better&nbsp;way?</p><p>Furthermore, if a bot gets it wrong, they are slashed the full stake amount. So there is high variance in winnings from epoch to epoch: big win or big loss. High variance hurts profitability.</p><p>Towards a better way, here’s some brief&nbsp;theory.</p>  When a bot makes a prediction, its underlying model is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution">Bernoulli probability distribution</a> [1]. That is, there are exactly two possible outcomes, a single trial, and the bot’s model has estimated the probability of each&nbsp;outcome.  However, in the status quo code, the bot only expresses one side of the model— the most probable side — in the course of submitting a prediction. It’s leaving information on the table, and exposing itself to high variance.   2. New: Two-Sided Predictions <p>The idea of two-sided predictions is to let the bot express both sides of the distribution in the course of submitting a prediction.</p><p>For example, if the predictoor bot calculates a probability of up=60%, and therefore down=40%, and has 1000 OCEAN to stake, then the bot stake 0.60*1000 = 600 OCEAN to “up”, and 100 OCEAN to down. Therefore the bot is always on both the winning side and the losing side, pro-rata to its prediction confidence. The image below illustrates.</p>As of pdr-backend v0.3, prediction bots submit “up” and “down” predictions with a stake-weighted confidence on each, i.e. “two-sided prediction”.<p>The winning side will be there to catch the slashed stakes of the losing side, which in turn greatly reduces epoch-to-epoch variance.</p><p>Updated AI model. Before, the prediction bots a regression model to predict a next value of BTC etc. Now, it’s explicitly a classifier model, classifying up vs. down. pdr-backend currently has two linear classifiers: LinearLogistic and LinearSVC [2]. The classifiers give probability estimates.</p><p>How it’s implemented. In a given epoch, a predictoor bots does two transactions to the blockchain. It needs two accounts / private keys, because the Predictoor contracts allow only one tx per epoch per&nbsp;account.</p><p>How to run two-sided prediction bots. First, you need to set a second account, with envvar PRIVATE_KEY2.</p> export PRIVATE_KEY=&lt;YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY 1&gt;<br>export PRIVATE_KEY2=&lt;YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY 2&gt; <p>Second, be sure to have ROSE and OCEAN, to pay for gas fees and stake respectively.</p><p>Related minor&nbsp;changes:</p>  The model-based predictoor bot used to be approach 3. Now it’s approach 2. Approach 3 is deprecated.  Approach 1 used to randomly pick an up-vs-down prediction. Now it puts 50% stake into “up” and 50% stake into “down” (50–50). Therefore it needs two keys&nbsp;too.   3. Upgrades to Simulator <p>The prediction/trading simulator pdr sim got upgraded.</p><p>First, the simulator’s bots got upgraded.</p>  Sim prediction bots are now two-sided, behaving just like in the main predictoor bots. Therefore you can do rapid “what-if” experiments in simulation, before proceeding to run a predictoor bot for real&nbsp;$.  Sim trading bots are now confidence-based. Before, the trading bot would always buy OCEAN according to a fixed amount of USD if there was an “up” prediction; and did nothing on a “down” prediction. Now, in an “up” prediction it buys, in a “down” prediction it sells, both proportional to the model’s confidence in up vs&nbsp;down.  <p>Second, the simulator’s plots got a big upgrade. There are now realtime plots of: predictoor profit vs time, trader profit vs time, model accuracy vs time, predictoor profit distribution, trader profit distribution, and a contour plot to show the model’s probability response surface. The appendix shows these in detail. Or, run for yourself with pdr sim my_ppss.yaml. Expect simulator plots to continue to evolve&nbsp;😎.</p>The updated “pdr sim” realtime plot, having many sub-plots. The appendix zooms in on&nbsp;each. 4. Other v0.3 Improvements <p>From <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/releases/tag/v0.3.0">v0.3.0 release notes</a>, here’s a thorough list of&nbsp;changes.</p>  Predictoor bots: Two-sided prediction. Easy deployment of &gt;1 agents via Kubernetes + CLI; pm2 deprecated.  Trader bots: live-mocking ability, enabling “ghost”&nbsp;trades.  Simulator: predictions are two-sided. Trades use model confidence. New plots like predictoor profit vs. time and a visual of model probability response surface. Live trading possible.  Data pipeline: better structure, with DuckDB at the core. Analytics are starting to get built on&nbsp;top.  UX: There is now proper Python-style logging. ppss.yaml tuned. Small CLI utilities added.  Core: The codebase is more robust, including greatly-expanded type-checking and several bug fixes. Predictoor and trader agents are refactored to be simpler. Technical debt is low — no small&nbsp;feat.   5. Conclusion <p>As of <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend">pdr-backend</a> <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/releases/tag/v0.3.0">v0.3</a>, predictoor bots submit “up” and “down” predictions with a stake-weighted confidence on each, i.e. “two-sided prediction”. This reduces epoch-to-epoch variance and increases profitability.</p><p>Also, the simulator got upgraded: predictions are two-sided, the trader bot uses model confidence, and there are new plots like predictoor profit vs. time and a visual of model probability response&nbsp;surface.</p><p>The v0.3 release has many other improvements: in trader bots, data pipeline, UX, and core bug&nbsp;fixes.</p><p>Try for yourself at pdr-backend’s <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/predictoor.md">Predictoor bot&nbsp;README</a>.</p> 6. Appendix: Simulator Plots&nbsp;Details <p>This section gives plots from an example simulation run.</p><p>Settings. It was predicting BTC/USDT on Binance, on 5m epochs. The predictoor bot LinearLogistic model, using the most recent value of BTC and of ETH, staking 100 OCEAN per epoch. The trader used up to 1000 USD per epoch. Simulation ran for about 2000 epochs (1 week). The YAML file given below lists all parameters.</p><p>Below is predictoor profit vs. epoch. After 2000 epochs (1 week), it netted 915&nbsp;OCEAN.</p>Predictoor profit vs.&nbsp;epoch<p>Below is trader profit vs. time. After 2000 epochs (1 week), it netted $2613.19&nbsp;USD.</p>Trader profit vs.&nbsp;epoch<p>Below left is model accuracy vs time, where accuracy is the % time it was correct in predicting up vs. down. Green is the estimated value, and the grey shadow is the 95% [lower bound, upper bound] <a href="https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.stats.proportion.proportion_confint.html">confidence intervals according to a Binomial distribution</a>.</p><p>Below middle and right are predictoor and trader profit distributions as 1d scatterplots, respectively.</p>Left: model accuracy vs time. Middle: predictoor profit distribution. Right: trader profit distribution.<p>Below is a contour plot to visualize the model probability response surface. We can have a contour plot because this run has only two input variables: most recent value of ETH (y-axis), and most recent value of BTC (x-axis).</p>  The model predicts a direction of “down” for any (x,y)=(prev ETH, prev BTC) in the red region. The model predicts a direction of “up” for any (x,y) in the blue&nbsp;region.  The decision boundary is white. The contours towards the white are lower confidence; contours moving farther from white are higher confidence.  The red and blue points are training data for “went down” and “went up” respectively. Being encircled by yellow means that the model mis-classified on the training data; this is not surprising because we should not expect these two input variables to fully capture the response.

<p>Happy Birthday, dear Chameleons! 🎂🎉</p><p>A year ago, on February 28, 2023, we launched the Shyft DAO Ambassador Program, and what a journey it has been! To celebrate this milestone, we’re taking a moment to look back at the incredible path we’ve traveled together this first year, filled with achievements, challenges, and&nbsp;growth.</p> Early Beginnings <p>From the get-go, our Ambassador Program was joined by more than 9o active Apprentices, all eager to support our mission. Your energy and commitment, dear Chameleons, were infectious, and quickly led to 16 of the most outstanding performers stepping up as Ambassadors by March. This number grew to 21 by April, showing just how vibrant and dedicated our community is.</p><p>In June, the Ambassadors took the lead with the #DiscoverShyft campaign, spreading the word far and wide and bringing our message to over 241,465 people across social media. That’s a real&nbsp;feat!</p><p>We also celebrated the top contributors who had the most tweets in the #DiscoverShyft campaign — a real testament to hard work and passion. @Lauriano, @October, @September, @Manusan, and @Lucas — your efforts have been nothing short of inspiring!✨</p><p>And by the end of June, we also introduced the WotNot Made of Fire Collection, the first edition of Shyft DAO NFT series for all our members. Inspired by our iconic mascot, WotNot — the legendary detective known for its magical ability to change colors — this collection represents the spirit and adventure of our community.</p> Together Forward <p>As with everything grand, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. In October last year, we faced a spooky challenge when our Discord link got compromised. Yet, our quick response and the community’s resilience showed just how strong and secure we are together.</p><p>We listened and learned throughout the year, evolving our tasks to focus more on quality than speed, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their time zone, could contribute meaningfully. Our qualitative tasks, like creative videos and insightful tweets, have brought out the best in our ambassadors, highlighting the importance of thoughtful participation.</p><p>In the first month of 2024, our spirited Festive Campaign came to a close, overwhelming us with gratitude for our community’s incredible participation.</p><p>Our latest campaign on the successful rollout of User Signing in February also proved to be a resounding success, demonstrating the power of community engagement and the sharing of knowledge.</p><p>A total of 19 dedicated participants consistently contributed to the campaign with a total of 115 insightful tweets. These tweets not only sparked lively discussions but also shared valuable insights on the importance and intricacies of user signing within our ecosystem.</p><p>This shows that the creativity and insights our community shared through tweets, videos, and memes brightened our campaigns and deepened the understanding of Shyft Network, Veriscope, and User&nbsp;Signing.</p> Birthday Gifts &amp;&nbsp;Thoughts <p>As we mark a year of incredible progress and collaboration, we’re also kicking off celebrations in&nbsp;style.</p><p>For a limited time, we will be opening up the opportunity for everyone in our community to mint special RED NFTs without needing to be on a whitelist. This is our way of saying thank you and letting everyone share in the success of the past&nbsp;year.</p><p>❤️To mint, go to: <a href="https://launchpad.heymint.xyz/mint/wotnot-made-of-fire">https://launchpad.heymint.xyz/mint/wotnot-made-of-fire</a></p><p>For our dedicated Ambassadors, we have something extra special: the exclusive chance to mint GREEN NFTs starting today. These unique NFTs are a token of our appreciation for the relentless support and commitment our Ambassadors have shown throughout the&nbsp;year.</p><p>💚To mint, go to: <a href="https://launchpad.heymint.xyz/mint/wotnot-made-of-water">https://launchpad.heymint.xyz/mint/wotnot-made-of-water</a></p><p>🔍 But that’s not all — we’re also introducing an exciting opportunity for our community members. Anyone who mints an NFT featuring a magnifying glass between February 27 and March 3 will automatically be entered into a lottery. Three lucky winners will be chosen at random to receive SHFT tokens worth 50 USDC&nbsp;each.</p><p>This journey has been made possible by every Apprentice, Ambassador, and community member who believed in the Shyft DAO mission and contributed their time, creativity, and passion to its expansion and success. Here’s to another year of growth, innovation, and community. 🎊</p><p>The <a href="https://shyftdao.org/">Shyft DAO </a>community is committed to building a decentralized, trustless ecosystem that empowers its members to collaborate and make decisions in a transparent and democratic manner.

<p>This month Google and Yahoo introduced crucial changes to their email delivery requirements. For senders targeting individual Gmail accounts, particularly those exceeding 5,000 emails daily, Google mandates authentication measures. While Yahoo does not state a minimum sending requirement, it will align with Google’s criteria.</p>
<p>Requirements that are to be enforced:</p>
 
 Implementation of both SPF + DKIM 
 Sending with an aligned “From” domain in either the SPF or DKIM domains 
 Sending from a domain with a DMARC policy of at least p=none 
 Using a TLS connection for transmitting email 
 Valid forward and reverse DNS (FCrDNS) 
 One-click unsubscribe (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8058">RFC 8058</a>) 
 Low spam reported rate 
 
<p>Full requirements can be found in <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/81126">Google’s help article</a>.</p>
<p>What are the implications of non-compliance with Google and Yahoo’s email standards?</p>
<p>Failure to adhere to the new email standards set by Google and Yahoo could mean non-delivery to Gmail and Yahoo inboxes, affecting businesses relying on email communication.</p>
<p>These new requirements aim to fortify email security globally, emphasizing industry-acknowledged best practices. Safeguarding business reputation from phishing attacks is one of the top benefits of these changes. DMARC, now a <a href="https://blog.google/products/gmail/gmail-security-authentication-spam-protection/">steadfast requirement</a>, blocks domain impersonation, providing control over email identity. Google emphasizes the validation of sender authenticity for enhanced email security.</p>
<p>Take action now: Reduce email phishing and ensure deliverability</p>
<p>Strong authentication with DMARC and <a href="https://www.entrust.com/vmc">Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs)</a> is an important milestone for email users.</p>
<p>Entrust has been working with mailbox providers since June 2017 to create Brand Indicators for Message Identification (<a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/faq/what-is-bimi">BIMI</a>) with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.entrust.com/vmc">Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs)</a>, digital certificates that enable organizations to display their registered trademark logo in the avatar slot alongside outgoing emails in many mailboxes today. BIMI standards aim to make the email ecosystem more secure and engaging with DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance) and VMCs.</p>
<p>VMCs help an organization’s emails stand out and get noticed in a crowded inbox while protecting them against fraud through DMARC’s anti-spoofing technology. Entrust also offers DMARC implementation services to help customers in their BIMI journey. Check if your domain is BIMI ready using this free <a href="https://redsift.com/tools/bimi">online tool</a> from our partner Red Sift.</p>
<p>As Google and Yahoo make email authentication mandatory, industry-wide adoption of these practices is crucial. Businesses can ensure compliance for improved email deliverability and overall security.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Over the past few years, digital transformation has been relentless. Businesses of all sizes are at the forefront, continuously adapting to an ever-evolving digital landscape. One of the biggest challenges is managing the surge in cyberattacks, where the number and sophistication of phishing attacks have reached unprecedented levels, especially since the adoption of <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/09/generative-ai-security-challenges-fighting-fire-with-fire/">generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)</a> has led to cybercriminals being able to launch more accurate and effective phishing campaigns.</p>
<p>The need to protect your organization from threats has never been greater. The introduction of regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) has also spotlighted the necessity for data security and compliance. On top of it all, with the omnipresence of smart devices and the IoT, we’re living in an era where everything is connected. This interconnectedness, along with the growing reliance on <a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/25362/card-not-present-transactions--friend-or-foe--transaction-volumes-are-soaring-but-so-is-fraud">card-not-present (CNP) transactions</a> facilitated by digital wallets such as Apple Pay and Google Pay, accentuates the need for secure digital payment mechanisms.</p>
<p>Customers demand secure, seamless digital experiences</p>
<p>Along with these challenges, today’s customers have become well-informed, and their demands have never been clearer. They want a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/">mobile-first experience</a>, where their digital journey is seamless on their preferred device. Beyond just accessibility, they expect robust protection against fraud and the looming threats of advanced cyberattacks.</p>
<p>Speed and ease are paramount, with customers seeking frictionless access that doesn’t compromise their security and allows them to switch seamlessly from one device to another to continue their journey. Furthermore, the modern customer isn’t content with a one-size-fits-all approach. They want <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/17380/601818?utm_source=brighttalk-portal&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=topic&amp;utm_content=upcoming">personalized digital interactions</a>, tailor-made to resonate with their unique preferences.</p>
<p>Customer identity and access management (CIAM)</p>
<p>An effective customer identity and access management (CIAM) solution streamlines the digital onboarding process, making sign-ups both user-friendly and secure. It should support various login methods, including single sign-on (SSO), and integrate with popular social media platforms to streamline registration and login through social login. More than just managing identities, a CIAM solution enhances decision-making through intelligent access and detailed risk assessments, ensuring identity data remains consistent and unified across all platforms.</p>
<p>A CIAM solution’s impact on today’s business landscape is profound. It improves the user experience, which leads to increased sign-ups. This paves the way for building trust, as businesses can cultivate customer confidence with rigorous privacy measures and create personalized interactions. By delivering tailored services and products, the CIAM solution can boost sales and customer loyalty, while prioritizing safety through proactive fraud prevention.</p>
<p>The Entrust difference</p>
<p>At Entrust, our vision of the CIAM lifecycle is holistic. Starting with seamless digital onboarding, our system is designed to efficiently capture and manage customer identity. Robust authentication protocols are then employed to verify user access, ensuring that only genuine and verified users gain entry. Proactive identity management provides comprehensive oversight throughout the entire customer journey, from sign-up to eventual offboarding.</p>
<p>Administration is equally paramount, with policy enforcement mechanisms and measures to ensure continuous compliance. Lastly, in line with modern demands, our CIAM system is equipped to provide tailored engagements, crafting custom experiences that build deeper customer bonds.</p>
<p>Our identity verification (IDV) and digital signing capabilities, together with the ease of social logins, make remote customer onboarding customers easy. This trio of technologies is pivotal in transforming user experiences across a broad spectrum of industries:</p>
 
 In the financial sector, it enables banks and fintech companies to rapidly verify and onboard new customers, streamlining account openings and loan applications 
 Healthcare organizations leverage this technology for secure patient registration and to ensure compliance with privacy regulations 
 Government bodies utilize these tools for efficient citizen onboarding, offering access to services with enhanced security and convenience 
 In the retail e-commerce space, these solutions simplify the shopping experience, making it easier for consumers to authenticate their identities, sign up for services, and complete transactions securely – all from the comfort of their homes or on the go

<p>What we have in store for&nbsp;2024</p><p>We’re thrilled to announce GlobaliD’s new CEO — co-founder Mitja&nbsp;Simcic.</p><p>Co-founder Greg Kidd remains on the Board of Directors as Chairman.</p><p>GlobaliD will remain in safe hands. As CTO, Mitja has overseen the technical and product development of GlobaliD since its inception and brings experience and continuity to GlobaliD’s next&nbsp;chapter.</p><p>Here’s Mitja:</p><blockquote>Trust is the foundational building block of any society, but today, trust is at an all-time low — in our companies, our governments and institutions, and in each other. The reality is that many of our antiquated trust systems have simply broken down as we’ve seen decades of digitization across every industry.</blockquote><blockquote>At GlobaliD, we’re building the tools that will rebuild trust not only for today, but the many challenges of tomorrow — all while keeping the keys of the castle with the person that matters most:&nbsp;You.</blockquote><p>Mitja and the team have been working super hard behind the scenes in the last year and the culmination of that will be a series of feature rollouts in&nbsp;2024.</p><p>The name of the game this year is rapid experimentation. With these new trust frameworks, we’re entering uncharted territory and the only way to figure out what works and what doesn’t is through constant engagement with you, our community.</p><p>Here’s a bit of what we have in store right around the&nbsp;corner:</p>  A smarter, more streamlined onboarding experience — We’re making it easier for both users and partners to get&nbsp;started.  Decentralized, Secure Messaging Platform with WhatsApp Integration — Owning your communications is just as important as owning your identity. We’re starting with WhatsApp but Telegram and Slack are on&nbsp;deck.  Enhanced Non-Custodial Wallet with Fiat Ramps — Users will be able to hold and exchange value that they fully control within GlobaliD’s trusted ecosystem while also being able to view their assets across different custodians.  Introduction of TrustLink — This is our first step toward allowing users to build digital trust without the need to download an&nbsp;app.  Public Badges for Identity Verification and Gamification — Badges will allow for quick assessments of reputation while giving users pathways toward leveling&nbsp;up.  <p>Learn more about&nbsp;<a href="https://about.global.id/">GlobaliD</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalids-next-chapter-58b46cda3495">GlobaliD’s next chapter</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Oasis Sapphire-Powered Ocean Predictoor’s Growth Spurs Ocean Protocol &amp; Oasis Protocol to Formalize Ties  Overview <p>The core teams behind <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> and <a href="https://oasisprotocol.org/">Oasis Protocol</a> have joined forces via a formal partnership, to deepen the level of collaboration on <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai/">Ocean Predictoor</a> and&nbsp;beyond.</p><p>Ocean Predictoor is a stack and a dapp for accurate AI-powered prediction feeds, running on Oasis Sapphire confidential EVM chain. Ocean Predictoor enables AI experts to earn significant $ by running AI prediction bots or trading bots on crypto price feed$. Since launch just 6 months ago, Predictoor has grown to around $20M daily volume, and is the <a href="https://dappradar.com/rankings/protocol/oasis-sapphire?sort=totalVolumeInFiat&amp;order=desc">#1 dapp on Oasis Sapphire</a> in terms of volume. The success of Ocean Predictoor has spurred the Oasis and Ocean core teams to formalize their relationship into a partnership.</p><p>The first step in the partnership aligns incentives of the respective teams. Specifically, Ocean Protocol and Oasis Network have done a $500K token swap — $250K in OCEAN to Oasis, and $250K in ROSE to Ocean. The partnership is structured to quickly do many more of these going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>The next step reduces friction for people using Ocean Predictoor on Sapphire. Specifically, each team will add $250K of OCEAN and $250K of ROSE to an OCEAN-ROSE DEX pool on Sapphire chain, for a total of $1M liquidity baseline. This enables users to easily swap among OCEAN and ROSE, to further ease onboarding to Predictoor on Oasis Sapphire.</p><p>The partnership gives space for continually deeper collaboration, which we anticipate.</p> Ocean Predictoor Six-Month Snapshot <p>In the six short months since launch, Ocean Predictoor has climbed from zero to an impressive ATH of $20.5M daily volume, with a 30-day aggregate soaring to $174.97M — stats from Feb&nbsp;27.</p><p><a href="https://dappradar.com/dapp/ocean-predictoor?range-ha=30d&amp;range-ds=24h">dappradar.com</a> has further,&nbsp;stats.</p> Roots of Predictoor Success <p>Predictoor’s success so far has a few roots. First was a new hypothesis: that the most valuable data is predictions, because they are the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-data-value-creation-loop-68e23575be02">final step of the data value supply chain</a> right before action is taken and money is made. As its name implies, Predictoor focuses squarely on predictions.</p><p>Second was a focus on a vertical with high value, where Predictoor could make a difference, which has quick turnaround for users making $. DeFi meets this best. Other verticals will&nbsp;follow.</p><p>Third and final, Predictoor design &amp; rollout has been aggressively crypto-native: create a game, make it easy to play, add incentives, optimize. To elaborate:</p>  We started by creating an on-chain game where people can make $ quickly, where more usage led to higher accuracy, which in turn leads to more usage. Oasis Sapphire’s privacy features made it possible for Predictoor’s game to be fully on-chain.  Then, we made it easy to play, via easy-to-run bots.  We kickstarted usage by incentivizing people to run AI-powered prediction bots, via <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">Ocean Data&nbsp;Farming</a>.  And since launch, the Ocean core team has continually optimized by becoming an internal customer to pass on learnings as product improvements.   What Lies Ahead for Predictoor <p>The primary goal of the Ocean Predictoor core team is for both predictoors and traders making serious $. Right now, Predictoor’s growth is based on predictoors making good $. For predictoors to make serious $, traders need to spend serious $ on feeds. For that, traders need to make serious $ trading. Our first goal is to make that happen. We’re doing this by dog-fooding: working to make serious $ trading with Predictoor feeds. Results are highly promising, and getting better&nbsp;weekly.</p><p>Then, once traders are making serious $, we’ll expand the scope of prediction feeds. First within Defi, then other verticals. Imagine 10 thousand AI-powered prediction feeds spanning the globe. Real estate, weather, climate, transportation, agriculture, more. And we’ll keep scaling up, for truly huge&nbsp;data.</p><p>In short: traders serious $ → predictoors serious $ → expand&nbsp;scope.</p><p>As Predictoor traction grows, the Ocean and Oasis core teams expect to continually deepen their partnership.</p> From Team&nbsp;Members <blockquote>“Oasis Sapphire is the world’s first and only confidential EVM chain in production. This functionality was key for Ocean to ship Predictoor and grow its traction. We expect Predictoor to keep growing exponentially, and with that, our collaboration with the Oasis&nbsp;team”</blockquote><blockquote>— Trent McConaghy, co-founder of Ocean Protocol.</blockquote><blockquote>“Our entire team at Oasis is proud to be contributors to the accelerated growth of Ocean Predictoor as an important validation of the integral utility of smart contracts with customizable confidentiality. Predictoor has emerged as one of our industry’s leading privacy-preserving DeFi applications, and we are excited to see our close collaboration result in more of Web3 using this powerful&nbsp;tool.”</blockquote><blockquote>— Matej Janez, Business Development Manager at the Oasis Foundation.</blockquote> Conclusion <p>The data speaks for itself: Ocean Predictoor is enabling users to make money through AI-powered prediction bots and trader&nbsp;bots.</p><p>Ocean Predictoor runs on Oasis Sapphire confidential EVM&nbsp;chain.</p><p>The success of Ocean Predictoor has spurred the Oasis and Ocean core teams to formalize their relationship into a partnership. The first action is a token swap to align incentives of the respective teams. The second action is to create deep liquidity in the <a href="https://illuminex.xyz/swap?inputCurrency=0x39d22B78A7651A76Ffbde2aaAB5FD92666Aca520&amp;inputChainId=23294&amp;outputCurrency=0x8Bc2B030b299964eEfb5e1e0b36991352E56D2D3&amp;outputChainId=23294">OCEAN-ROSE DEX pool</a>. We look forward to build on our success with Predictoor, and to continue to deepen relations between Ocean and&nbsp;Oasis.</p><p>👉 To learn more about Predictoor, simply go to <a href="http://predictoor.ai">http://predictoor.ai</a> and see the feeds in action.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Warwick Ashford</a></p><p>We undoubtedly live in interesting times, at least in terms of technological innovation. And like most things in life, this can either be a blessing or a curse, depending on how we respond to it. Technology certainly provides new opportunities, but these are typically accompanied by a set of challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good example of this is the proliferation of internet-connected devices that have quickly become part of everyday life. These range from smartphones, smartwatches, and fitness trackers in the home that make up the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/wp80423/enabling-the-digital-business-with-identity-for-the-internet-of-things">internet of things</a> (IoT); to automatic and remote climate control, occupancy monitoring, and smart access controls in the office; to sensors and trackers for temperature, pressure, air quality, and noise levels on the factory floor that make up the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity_securing_iiot">industrial internet of things</a> (IIoT); to patient, blood glucose, heart rate, hygiene, and mood monitors that make of the internet of medical things (IoMT).&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Challenges associated with internet-connected devices&nbsp; 
<p>While all these devices are aimed at improving efficiency, productivity, and quality of life, they all come with challenges. The rapid adoption of these devices is increasing the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81218/attack-surface-management">attack surface</a>, making it challenging to manage and secure every device; the lack of standardized security protocols and frameworks across these devices leads to inconsistencies in security implementations; the lack of focus on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/csls2020_2020_11_11_fernandez-cuesta">security by design</a> leads to vulnerabilities; these devices often collect and transmit sensitive data, raising privacy concerns; and weak <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/risk-based-case-for-zero-trust-authentication-eic2023">authentication</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc71144/dynamic-authorization-management">authorization</a> mechanisms can lead to unauthorized access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the challenges do not end there. Inadequate network security measures may expose devices to cyberattacks; vulnerabilities introduced during the manufacturing and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81221/software-supply-chain-security">supply chain</a> process may be exploited by attacker; devices can be tampered with; managing the entire lifecycle of devices, including updates and patches; and decentralized data processing in edge computing introduces additional security vulnerabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Identity key to addressing IoT challenges&nbsp; 
<p>Identity plays a crucial role in addressing challenges associated with IoT, IIoT, and IoMT devices. Establishing identities for devices and users can ensure that only authorized entities have access to specific resources and functionality, while identity-based access policies enable organizations to define and enforce fine-grained authorization rules to improve security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assigning unique identities to devices enables secure authentication, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized devices can connect to a network, while implementing mutual authentication between devices and the network enhances overall security.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations can help prevent unauthorized access to internet-connected devices by managing the identity lifecycle proactively by implementing secure provisioning processes and ensuring that devices are decommissioned when no longer in use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Establishing identities for devices (<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/standards-framework-non-human-identities-eic2023">non-human identities</a>) and users enables organizations to analyze and monitor behavioral patterns. Anomalies indicating potential security threats can be detected and addressed promptly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations can improve privacy protection in consumer-facing applications by associating user identities with devices to enable personalized services, while respecting consumer privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use of standardized identity protocols such as <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/3083/2">OAuth</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5077">OpenID Connect</a> ensures consistent and security identity management practices for internet-connected devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tracking device and user identities helps with regulatory compliance because it enables organizations to demonstrate adherence to regulatory requirements and industry standards through identity-based audit logs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 It is all in the approach&nbsp; 
<p>And implementing a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/zero-trust">zero trust</a> approach, where devices are not automatically trusted and must authenticate before accessing resources, will improve security but requires robust identity management during the onboarding process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity-centric approaches, therefore, can contribute significantly to a more controlled, accountable, and secure environment, addressing many of the challenges introduced by the rapid adoption of internet-connected devices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Join the international identity community at KuppingerCole’s <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">European Identity &amp; Cloud conference</a> #EIC2024&nbsp; in June to discuss every aspect of identity across the wider IT landscape. There will be opportunities to learn about <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5687/3">Safeguarding Digital Identities in Today's World</a>, to get insights into <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5568/1">How AI Can Help IAM Deliver Better and Stronger Authorization</a>, to get answers the question: <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5504">Can you trust AI in IAM?</a>, to find out <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5509/1">How Identity Forces Are Making Enterprises Rethink Identity</a>, and much, much more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Mydex, we’ve grown wary of ‘market’ talk. People often talk about ‘the market’ for this or for that, as if they have a clear, precise understanding of something definite and real. But the deeper we dig, the more we discover the opposite is usually&nbsp;true.</p><p>In fact, we’ve concluded that thinking about economic challenges and opportunities in terms of markets where firms trade things for money prices is, more often than not, a good way of not understanding what’s going on and an even better way of not seeing opportunities that lie within our grasp. Market myopia blinds far more than it illuminates.</p><p>To rise to the challenges our society and economy now face, we need to escape market myopia. This blog explains Mydex’s thinking on this issue and what we are doing to escape&nbsp;it.</p> The information challenge <p>For a market to happen, money needs to change hands as ownership of something is handed over from one person to another. For the exchange to happen, a money price needs to be put on this ‘something’.</p><p>Friedrich Hayek was the high priest of market talk. Writing in the mid-1940s, he noted that to make good decisions and execute plans effectively, people and organisations need good information. Money prices are, he argued, the key source of such information.</p><p>Hayek’s bete noir was state socialism. When he pointed out that central planners could never, ever, collect and crunch the amount of information they needed to make and implement a good economic plan, he thrust an intellectual stake into state socialism’s heart.</p><p>“There would be no difficulty about efficient control or planning were conditions so simple that a single person or board could effectively survey all the relevant facts,” he wrote in his book The Road To Serfdom. “It is only as the factors which have to be taken into account become so numerous that it is impossible to gain a synoptic view of them, that decentralisation becomes imperative.”</p><p>Markets, he argued, are the best way to achieve such decentralisation. But such decentralisation generates a ‘division of knowledge’ between people, that acts as a potential source of fragmentation. It creates the need for a system of coordination which brings the separate efforts of decentralised parts together, to create a greater whole. This coordination can be achieved, he argued, by “the price system”&nbsp;… “which leaves the separate agencies free to adjust their activities to the facts that only they can&nbsp;know.”</p><p>Hayek’s was a brilliant argument that helped set the course of Government economic policies across the world to this day. But it was and remains irredeemably flawed.</p><p>Price changes, he argued, can and should “register all the relevant changes in circumstances&nbsp;…[to] provide a reliable guide for the individual’s actions”. This “enables entrepreneurs, by watching the hands of a few dials, to adjust their activities to those of their fellows.”</p> Why markets never work as&nbsp;intended <p>Trouble is, the one thing price changes can never do is register all the relevant changes in circumstances that provide a reliable guide for the individual’s actions.</p><p>Here are three reasons&nbsp;why.</p> Externalities <p>An ‘externality’ is economists’ jargon for a cost or benefit that is incurred by an entity that is ‘external’ to a transaction between two&nbsp;parties.</p><p>Pollution is a classic example. A producer spills noxious substances into a river. Not having to clean up his own waste means he is able to keep his costs (and therefore his prices) low. But these costs haven’t disappeared. They have just been passed on to somebody else — costs not recognised by the money price that has been paid by the producer’s customer.</p><p>Externalities aren’t always negative. They may be positive. For example, if a big new employer sets up in a town, the new enterprise attracts all sorts of other services related to and surrounding its enterprise. The result is extra employment on top of the enterprise itself, in services like food outlets, taxis and hotels for&nbsp;example.</p><p>In his writings, Hayek was well aware of the importance of externalities. “The main condition on which the usefulness of the system of competition and private property depends,” he wrote, is “that the owner benefits from all the useful services rendered by his property and suffers all the damages caused to others by its use”. (Our emphasis).</p><p>If there is a ‘divergence’ between the two, he continued, “whenever this divergence becomes important some method other than competition [the market] may have to be&nbsp;found”.</p><p>Oh dear. In making this statement, Hayek thrust an intellectual stake into the heart of his own arguments, because the way modern economies work means it is never possible for all the benefits and all of the costs of the owner’s services to be reflected in the money price. Which means that, using Hayek’s own logic, “some method other than competition” [the market] needs to be&nbsp;found.</p> Internalities <p>‘Externalities’ (both positive and negative) are one reason why the price system can never capture all the information needed for economic decision making - because externalities are ubiquitous. But ‘externalities’ are just one example of a much bigger challenge of information loss.</p><p>The genius of a money price is that it allows you to compare the values of completely incommensurate items: a pair of socks to a flight to Paris to a pizza. That’s wonderful and incredible. It’s why money prices have proved to be so&nbsp;useful.</p><p>But this genius comes at a very high price: a catastrophic loss of information. The only way it becomes possible to use one, single measure to compare diverse things like pairs of socks, flights to Paris and pizzas is to ignore everything about them which is not directly comparable. Which is&nbsp;… er&nbsp;… virtually everything, including their unique and special qualities, their utility (e.g. what they will actually be used for) and the real-world costs of producing them.</p><p>By ‘real-world costs’ we don’t mean anything measured by money. We mean physical, operational reality. Amount of time spent doing something. Amount of energy used doing it. Amount of resources used up. These are the real costs of production — costs that the money price&nbsp;ignores.</p><p>Hang on a second! Good economic decision-making depends on information about two crucial things: real-world utility and real-world costs. But these are precisely the two types of information that money-prices discard. People may use money price as a proxy for these things but, it turns out, the result is a distorting, obfuscating proxy. A blurring lens that crowds out other useful information, not than a clarifying one.</p><p>‘Internalities’ is one way to describe information about the real world utilities and costs that money price ignores. These ‘internalities’ go right to the heart of wealth creation. Why? While externalities relate to impacts on third parties not directly involved in either the production or consumption of the good in question, internalities relate to the costs and benefits of those directly involved.</p><p>By discarding all information relating to real world costs and benefits, to focus all attention on just one comparison point — the money price — the price system actually renders everything needed to make good economic decisions (and to take effective economic actions) invisible.</p><p>So, for example, if an organisation makes all its decisions based on money measures, e.g. budgets, ‘profits’ and bank balances, it is not using any of the real-world information it needs to actually understand what it itself is doing, or how to improve its operations. By focusing only on ‘what we can afford’ rather than <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-can-afford-what-we-can-actually-do-1-efdca9835617">‘what we can actually do</a>’ — such organisations routinely end up making counterproductive decisions and taking counterproductive actions.</p><p>Carbon emissions are a good example. Twenty years ago, if you had asked ‘what are the carbon emissions of this product or that service?’ you would have been met by a blank stare. People hadn’t even thought of collecting this data, never mind working out how best to do it. Yet, now, twenty years later, many people think an item’s carbon emission is its most important metric — a metric that money price does not, and cannot,&nbsp;measure.</p><p>The catastrophic information loss perpetrated by the price system means that Hayek’s vision of markets registering ‘all the relevant changes’ in circumstances and ‘providing a reliable guide for the individual’s actions’ can never happen. Instead, it results in informationally emaciated organisations operating within an informationally emaciated economy, lacking the informational nutrients they need about real world time, energy and materials costs and real world benefits (utility) — lacking the information they need to make better decisions and to implement these decisions better. That ignore what ‘we can actually&nbsp;do’.</p> Transaction costs <p>Externalities and ‘internalities’ represent a fundamental problem for the price system. But there’s more: the costs of operating the price system itself. This is the arena of transaction costs.</p><p>Many years ago the economist Ronald Coase described transaction costs as ‘market-ing’ costs — e.g. the costs of taking something to market. This is what he&nbsp;wrote.</p><blockquote>“In order to carry out a market transaction it is necessary to discover who it is that one wishes to deal with, to inform people that one wishes to deal and on what terms, to conduct negotiations leading up to a bargain, to draw up the contract, to undertake the inspection needed to make sure that the terms of the contract are being observed, and so&nbsp;on.”</blockquote><p>Without an understanding of what transaction costs are, and what effects they have, he continued, it is “impossible to understand the working of the economic system”. He was absolutely right. Far from being an automatic guarantee of efficiency, the market-isation of economically productive activities can simply add multiple layers of extra, burdensome red&nbsp;tape.</p><p>Two important things about transaction costs&nbsp;are:</p><p>a) that the particular transaction costs generated by each item are often very difficult to isolate or measure. So they tend to get lost in blanket accounting terms such as ‘overheads’. Once again, money prices don’t represent these costs accurately.</p><p>b) the very act of putting a price on something — of ‘market-ing’ — generates many extra costs in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>You can see this if you compare the cost structure of the UK health system to the American insurance-based health system (where everything has to have a price put on&nbsp;it).</p><p>In the American system, physicians spend an average of 19 hours a week dealing with the administration of insurance claims. Administration accounts for over 27% of all costs. The result is a country with the highest health care costs in the world but among the worst outcomes. In comparison, the NHS, for all its ills, is a paragon of efficiency, partly because it avoids the (hidden) transaction costs of putting a price on everything that&nbsp;moves.</p> Market-speak as a confusion engine <p>Hayek was right when he said “some method” other than the market “may have to be found” if money prices do not capture all the information people and organisations need to make decisions. When advocating markets as the solution to socialism’s information deficit, he simply advocated another system that creates even worse information deficits. Western societies have been yo-yoing between different variants of these two flawed solutions ever&nbsp;since.</p><p>To rise to the social and economic challenges nations now face, we need to free ourselves of market myopia and address the information deficit challenge. At Mydex, we are doing our bit — by demonstrating what ‘some method other than the market’ could look&nbsp;like.</p><p>Externalities People mesmerised by market-speak assume that the test of an organisation’s success is in how much money it makes: its profitability. But often a good way to improve profitability is to simply dump costs on other people, like the river polluter. Mydex does not exist to maximise money profits. Sure, to survive within today’s institutional frameworks we have to earn enough money to cover our costs. But we exist to maximise positive externalities — to create social and economic benefits for others that don’t flow back to&nbsp;us.</p><p>For people mesmerised by the money-price-market mindset, this is dumbfounding.</p><p>Internalities People who focus only on money prices and money costs lose awareness of all the information they are discarding (so can’t use). They have a huge blindspot, but they don’t even know they have it. We at Mydex are working to fill this hole and repair the damage it causes. Our data sharing infrastructure is all about information replenishment, making critical informational nutrients available (in our case, personal data) so that both people and organisations can make better decisions and implement these decisions better. We are doing what Hayek said needed to be done — but which his price system failed to&nbsp;do.</p><p>Transaction costs Everything we do is about stripping away the many layers of excess costs that are generated by attempts to put a money price on everything that&nbsp;moves.</p><p>These are just a few examples. There are&nbsp;more.</p><p>Markets are famously amoral, whereas humans judge each others’ behaviour on all manner of moral grounds. Markets have a one dimensional approach to human rights —recognising only property rights. Whereas humans recognise <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-human-rights-based-approach-to-personal-data-566f4e4a8cb4">a wide diversity of&nbsp;rights</a>.</p><p>Markets can only work if it is possible for one side to fully and completely ‘own’ the thing that’s being traded and to fully transfer this ownership to somebody else. If this can’t happen, a market can’t happen. But personal data isn’t legally owned by the organisations that collect or the individuals it relates to. So with our data sharing infrastructure, the question of ‘ownership’ of the data doesn’t even come up — so the question of ‘creating a market’ doesn’t come up&nbsp;either.</p><p>The best way of realising data’s value is to share it. So that is what we do — enable data sharing. This has nothing to do with ownership, and therefore nothing to do with ‘markets’. Nevertheless, enabling such data sharing helps unleash enormous economic value, generating real world utility and reducing real world costs — the things the price system&nbsp;ignores.</p><p>Also (by the way), markets never actually create any value in the first place. All a market can ever do is shuffle title deeds to bits of value that have already been created elsewhere — not in a market but by a producer. The focus of our work at Mydex isn’t to shuffle title deeds to value that already exists, but to enable the creation of new value — helping people and organisations use data to do better things in better&nbsp;ways.</p> Conclusion <p>The era of digital data opens up an epoch-defining opportunity to address the informational deficits created by externalities, internalities and transaction costs. But as soon as people try to shoe-horn their activities back into the price-market system, they risk squandering this opportunity&nbsp;. It was this price-market system that generated these informational deficits in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p>The money-price-market mindset is the source of a dazzling, mesmerising mirage — a mental straitjacket — that obscures peoples’ vision of how the world really works and how to act effectively within it.

<p>Those who have been following Holochain for a while have heard of <a href="https://www.ioen.tech/?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Internet of Energy Network (IOEN)</a>. In short, IOEN’s goal is to support a sustainable energy transition by enabling microgrids of local renewables to collectively account for the energy they produce and to engage in the global financial market.&nbsp;</p><p>To do this, they need a way for the individuals and communities that make up these microgrids to document their energy generation in a verifiable manner.</p><p>Holochain, <a href="https://rainlang.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rainlang</a>, <a href="https://gildlab.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">GildLab</a>, and IOEN have teamed up to bring a working demonstration of verifiable energy to ETHDenver 2024. This will show how you can build a verifiable data system on Holochain and connect that system to an EVM, accessing financial opportunities like semi-fungible tokens and renewable energy certificates.</p> The Demo <p>To demonstrate the possibilities of verifiable energy generation at ETHDenver we are scaling down to the human level. With an <a href="https://www.getoffthegrid.ca/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Off the Grid</a> exercise bike set up as a human powered generator, we’re asking event participants to join in and create some energy with us.&nbsp;</p><p>As the bike produces a charge it will be measured with a sensor on its way to charge a battery. This data is then fed into a raspberry pi running a Holochain app that will transmit this data to an auditable <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/4_dht/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DHT</a>. To tie that particular instance of energy generation to the person riding the bike, we’ll have them scan a QR code to connect the <a href="https://tokenproof.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">tokenproof app</a> (which they used for their ETHDenver tickets). Along with the profile from their tickets and the measurement of energy generated, an observer will post photographic evidence of the particular person riding the bike at the particular time that energy was generated.</p><p>Then, human power credits (developed for this demo) are minted and sent to the wallet the rider connected. These are then placed into the IOEN marketplace, where they will be aggregated into IOEN renewable energy certificates (IOEN RECs), and bought and retired using IOEN tokens — showing end-to-end value, tracking and transparency of data through the Holochain app, and showcasing opportunities for liquidity in decentralized energy generation and finance.</p> Demonstrating Verifiable Data <p>The exact data fields collected are particular to this demonstration. What is important are the ways we can layer data sources, building up context so that we can verify an event that occurred in the real world.&nbsp;</p><p>Having multiple sources of data which authenticate the same event allows for outside observers to verify the generation of that energy, compensating the individuals who generated the energy.&nbsp; Holochain provides a self-validating system where this data can be stored and managed. Because you can audit not just storage but also actions within Holochain it allows data to be updated over time. And because Holochain uses distributed peer-to-peer networks, there aren’t the data limits or transaction costs of blockchains. Plus now with Rainlang, we can <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-a-new-link-in-web3/">connect the data in Holochain to EVM transactions</a>, securely linking the financials with the data.</p><p>This system has been developed to prototype verifiable data, and these same principles can be customized to any particular use case. Different regulators need different types of information depending on the industry. The goal is to show how multiple data sources can be layered in a self-validating environment and used to connect the digital environment to real world assets. From there, systems for automated witnessing and the validation of outputs can be developed.</p> The Use Case <p>So, what is the use case at scale?</p><p>Renewable energy certificates (RECs) offer businesses a way to offset their use of non-renewable energy by supporting renewables. Currently these certificates are measured in MWh (megawatt hours) and often require extensive reporting and expensive auditors in order to be validated. This makes them often inaccessible to small or distributed producers, as only larger generating sources (like windfarms or larger solar arrays) can bear the cost to validate their energy production and receive the right to sell their certificates.</p><p>IOEN has partnered with PV BLOX which is supporting new markets and installations for small scale solar and renewable microgrids in South East Asia. These producers are households as well as companies with solar panels on their roofs. In order to provide proof of the renewable energy that they generate, they need to gather multiple sources of data together that can then be presented to third party auditors to validate before passing that on to government agencies who issue the RECs.</p><p>For this particular use case, the data collected is mimicked in our demo with the bike. First, they need to show how much energy they are producing; this is measured by a reading off their meter. To corroborate that the energy is being generated from a renewable source, they also take a photo of their new panels. Now, all of that data collection is happening locally and is self-reported. To add an additional layer from a third party source, they also include satellite photos of before and after the solar installation. Together, all of this data from PV BLOX is then held in IOEN’s Holochain app, allowing the local producers to directly hold their data, while also having it held by the network and accessible to auditors and others as needed. Because every action within Holochain is validated, the data can’t be replaced or altered without a trail of those changes attached to the original entry. This makes it easy for auditors to verify the data collected from these multiple sources, checking the claim of energy generated against the approximate capacity to generate. This creates a ‘direct line of sight’ from auditors, regulators, and purchasers to the underlying data (amount of energy generated) supporting the asset (the REC, now on-chain).</p><p>IOEN helps PV BLOX aggregate the data from the producers so that the energy they generate can be accounted for collectively. This is then presented to auditors and the relevant agencies, and RECs are granted and then sold either bilaterally or through the IOEN/PV BLOX marketplace. The funds from that sale are then fractionalized and sent across the value chain to reward participants, including the producers based on their individual energy generation.</p><p>With integrations for tokenizing the assets almost finished, the ETHDenver demo is the prototype that shows how this will function embedded with Holochain when complete.&nbsp;</p> The Finances <p>So, what does any of this have to do with blockchains?</p><p>By connecting the sale and consumption of RECs to the financial markets of blockchains, we can open up a few new DeFi-driven opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>For one, global liquidity and investment. For small producers, ease of fractionalization is important to scale up opportunities for finance. When a REC is sold, those profits are automatically dispersed to the producers, without the money being held up, captured opaquely, or lost in bureaucratic channels. And because the transactions are in a secure, public space, producers can check them to ensure fairness — creating upfront, open, and transparent business relations for those in the chain, and a fairer distribution of the profits.</p><p>Secondly, to increase future liquidity and financing options, IOEN is working with the new financial tool of semi-fungible tokens. In their implementation, they have fungible tokens representing units of energy which can be traded on the open market and NFTs representing RECs which can be pre-bought or held as a single MWh to offset carbon emissions. This NFT points to the data held in Holochain, showing all of the details of that particular REC, where and how the energy was produced, who audited it, etc. If that REC is to be retired or sold, the owner must balance the underlying energy value of the REC with the fungible tokens. The uniqueness of each REC will allow for a differentiation between their values, depending on the practices of their production, their level of verifiability, etc. Thus, by keeping a public account of all the relevant details, these financial tools will help encourage investment in more just and sustainable energy.&nbsp;</p> What It Means <p>IOEN is opening access to global financial opportunities and creating an economy of scale by aggregating small producers. This is part of a strategy for transition. By leveraging DeFi to finance a sustainable energy transition, the goal is to eventually move to a truly decentralized physical infrastructure for renewable energy generation. At some point, renewable energy certificates won’t matter because every factory, store, transportation service, and everything else we now see as polluters will be powered by locally produced renewables. Microgrids, with mutual credit currencies to manage and account for the local production and consumption of energy, auditable at the global level, will be the DePIN future for energy. IOEN is developing the tools that will help us make that transition and build the foundations of that future. </p>

<p>Sourcing is getting smarter. To start, many organizations have already pivoted from a tactical to a strategic sourcing mindset—which can make all the difference when it comes to gaining and retaining a competitive advantage.</p>



<p>Why? Because organizations with strategic sourcing mindsets look beyond price and cost savings-centered supplier selection initiatives. They instead focus on continuous improvement. They consider factors—like supplier performance or <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/sustainability">sustainability</a>—that support long-term partnerships, advance business needs and increase purchasing power. Successful strategic sourcing often results in process optimization, cost management, customer satisfaction, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/supply-chain-risk-management">risk management</a>, increased sustainability and other benefits.</p>



<p>But now, the benefits of strategic sourcing are becoming even more attainable thanks to innovation. Here are four smart technologies modernizing strategic sourcing processes today:</p>



 Automation 



<p>Business process automation (also considered a type of <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/how-data-automation-and-ai-are-transforming-business-process-outsourcing-into-a-competitive-advantage/">business process outsourcing</a>) is pervasive across industries, minimizing manual tasks in accounting, human resources, IT and more. Now, sourcing and procurement professionals are reaping the rewards of such automation: streamlining workflows, boosting the bottom line and finding efficiencies. Sourcing teams are automating processes like data analysis as well as supplier relationship management and transaction management.</p>



<p>For example, the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/transaction-manager">IBM Sterling Transaction Manager</a> automates manual transactions between businesses and suppliers. This helps reduce errors to improve data quality and response times to questions, which improves customer and supplier satisfaction. What’s more, automating transactions reduces the staff needed to onboard new suppliers, freeing them to focus on higher-value tasks. &nbsp;</p>



 Blockchain 



<p>Information is an invaluable business asset. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/blockchain">Blockchain</a> technology ensures that it’s stored, accessed and shared quickly, accurately and transparently. In sourcing strategy, blockchain technology helps track orders, payments, accounts and more.</p>



<p>For example, blockchain-backed contract management, when combined with automation, creates efficiencies and offers a high level of security. It works like this: “if/when…then…” statements are written into code on a blockchain. Then, when a predetermined condition is met and verified—such as releasing funds—the contract is executed immediately. Plus, blockchain transaction records are encrypted, making them incredibly difficult to hack or alter.</p>


<a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/smart-contracts">Learn more about Smart Contracts</a>



<p><a href="https://amwayconnections.com/healthy-living/consumers-want-traceability-transparency-in-their-products/">More than 60% of Americans surveyed</a> said they would pay up to a third more for products that are responsibly made and transparently sourced. In response to increasing expectations from customers and stakeholders alike, some businesses are leveraging the transparency and immutable record of blockchain to uphold their <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ethical-sourcing">ethical</a> and sustainable sourcing practices.</p>



<p>For instance, one company is using a network of trusted suppliers built on IBM Blockchain® to provide product provenance for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/sustainable-shrimp-partnership">sustainably sourced shrimp</a>. Now, anyone can follow the full journey of a shrimp through the supply chain.</p>

 Advanced analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) 



<p>Analytics engines and their “big data brains” provide real-time sourcing flexibility and visibility to enhance order management and inventory systems. With cognitive intelligence in their toolbelts, sourcing teams can better understand and act on changes in the increasingly complex supplier market—as they happen. The ability to make these sourcing decisions in real-time can help increase profits during peak demand periods and better meet customer expectations. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-52281">Try out cognitive intelligence free for 30-days.</a></p>



<p>In addition to enhanced decision-making, flexibility and visibility, analytics engines paired with AI can help manage supplier risk. For example, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/supply-chain-intelligence-suite/trust-your-supplier">IBM Trust Your Supplier’s</a> advanced analytics and AI continuously monitor suppliers’ regulatory compliance to enable a 24/7 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ibm-trusted-transparent-and-efficient-supplier-collaboration/">trusted supplier network</a>.</p>



<p>Another exciting use case for AI in sourcing can be found in <a href="https://www.ibm.com/watson/supply-chain/resources/smarter-supply-chain-control-tower/">smarter control towers</a>. Traditional control towers can’t always provide visibility across silos, drive actions, integrate with third-party data and keep pace with ever-evolving modern supply chains. The next generation of control towers is <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/supply-chain-intelligence-suite/control-tower">powered by AI</a>, with intelligent workflows and true end-to-end visibility to help forecast supply and demand fluctuations and navigate disruption.</p>



 How is sourcing strategy different than procurement strategy?&nbsp; 



<p>Often considered synonymous with <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/procurement">the procurement process</a>, sourcing is a distinct process within <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/supply-chain-management">supply chain management</a>. While procurement teams oversee the end-to-end process of acquiring goods and services, sourcing teams consider the “who,” or the providers and potential suppliers themselves. They handle upstream sourcing activities like contract negotiation, sending requests for proposals (RFPs) and requests for quotes (RFQs) as well as managing the supplier relationship once selected. However, due to their symbiosis, sourcing and procurement strategies often share similar initiatives, business goals and metrics.</p>



 Transforming your sourcing strategy 



<p>Building a strong sourcing strategy is critical for navigating the increasingly complex supply chain landscape. Strategic planning of supply chain processes requires technology, tools and partnerships that accelerate your goals—improving supply chain management, resiliency and sustainability.</p>

  <p>Howdy folks!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I'm thrilled to announce support for additional capabilities now available for&nbsp;Conditional Access reauthentication policy scenarios. Reauthentication policy lets you require users to interactively provide their credentials again - typically before accessing critical applications and taking sensitive actions. Combined with Conditional Access session control of Sign-in frequency, you can require reauthentication for users and sign-ins with risk, or for Intune enrollment. With today's public preview, now you can require reauthentication for any resource protected by Conditional Access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To tell you more about this capability, I’ve invited Inbar Cizer Kobrinsky, Principal Product Manager at Microsoft Entra, to talk about the scenarios and configuration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, and please let us know your thoughts!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alex Weinert&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi everyone!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m excited to tell you more about the public preview capabilities that we’re adding to the “Sign-in frequency – every time” session control in Conditional Access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Single sign-on (SSO) using modern authentication is like a secret sauce for productivity and security. It improves productivity because users can access applications smoothly without signing in to each one with their credentials. SSO also enhances security because it reduces the risks of credential reuse and gives you a common point for control and logging for your Zero Trust deployments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there are situations where you may want the user's input, such as interactive authentication, before accessing a resource. One of these situations is token theft. A token theft attack occurs when threat actors compromise and replay tokens issued to a user, even if that user has satisfied multifactor authentication (MFA). Because authentication requirements are met, the threat actor is granted access to organizational resources by using the stolen token. Risk-based reauthentication policies can help lower the risk that results from a token theft, requiring threat actors to compromise a fresh token to regain system access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, let's look at some additional examples of these situations, where you may want to prompt the user for reauthentication:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Accessing high-risk resources, such as connecting to a VPN.&nbsp; 
 Activating a privileged role in Privileged Identity Management (PIM).&nbsp; 
 Performing an action within an application, such as changing personal information in an HR application.&nbsp; 
 Critical actions such as Intune enrollment or updating credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Risky sign-ins, as called out above, help reduce and mitigate the risk of token theft.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>With the latest update, you now can create policies requiring interactive reauthentication for any application or authentication context protected by Conditional Access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the example below, we’ve created a reauthentication policy for super sensitive actions, such as wire transfer. We’re using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/developer-guide-conditional-access-authentication-context">authentication context</a>, which the developer has integrated into the application. Before a user can transfer any amount from the application, they must satisfy the Conditional Access policy that targets this authentication context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Create a "sign-in frequency - every time" policy for super sensitive actions using authentication context</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Conditional Access policy for this authentication context requires phishing-resistant authentication (using authentication strength) and “Sign-in frequency – every time”. The next time a user attempts to make a wire transfer, they will be required to reauthenticate with a phishing-resistant MFA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While many network admins outsource the management of authoritative domain name system (DNS) infrastructure to a third party like IBM® NS1 Connect®, there is a sizable community of network operators who prefer to dig in and build something themselves.</p>



<p>These do it yourself (DIY) authoritative DNS architectures can be cobbled together from various tools.&nbsp;BIND&nbsp;is most often used as an open source tool for managing internal DNS, but some people extend it out into external authoritative DNS as well. Others build on top of Microsoft DNS infrastructures with home-grown scripts and other tools.</p>



<p>Control is the main reason that you’d go with a DIY system for authoritative DNS. Or, maybe you have a funky, abnormal network setup that would naturally require several customizations even if a third party were to deliver your authoritative DNS.</p>



 Challenges of DIY authoritative DNS 



<p>While everyone has their reasons for adopting a DIY system for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/dns-server">authoritative DNS</a>, there are some distinct disadvantages to consider:</p>



 
 DIY systems are brittle: If your authoritative DNS infrastructure is built on BIND or Microsoft, you’ve probably pieced together a Rube Goldberg machine of scripts to make it work. Over time, the complexity of those scripts can become difficult to maintain as you account for new functionality and operating requirements. One false move—one single coding error—could easily bring down your entire authoritative DNS infrastructure and take your customer-facing sites offline. 



 It’s a lot of work to build and maintain: It takes time to get up to speed on the underlying tools like BIND. You must create and deploy the system. Then, you must maintain it, which isn’t a small task, particularly when you’re dealing with such a mission-critical system. 



 The hit-by-a-bus problem: DIY architectures only work for as long as the person who built them stays with the company. If that person leaves the company, their institutional knowledge about how DIY architectures were built leaves with them. Some companies get to the point where they’re afraid to change anything because it could very easily result in a downtime incident that’s difficult to recover from. 



 No automation support: DIY systems usually don’t work with any form of automation. DIY architectures usually aren’t <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/integrations">built to support standard automation platforms</a> like Ansible or Terraform. It’s near-impossible to orchestrate DIY architectures with a third-party tool. If you have a DIY authoritative DNS, you’re probably stuck with manual changes. 
 



<p>All these factors usually result in more time, energy and resources devoted to authoritative DNS management than most network teams are willing to spend. DIY systems are often perceived as “free”, but they can end up costing you quite a bit. If those maintenance and management issues cascade into an outage, then the business impact is even more profound.</p>



 Backing up DIY systems 



<p>Using DIY systems for authoritative DNS without any sort of resilient, redundant backup is asking for trouble. Finding the source of an error, particularly when you’ve got a maze of overlapping, interdependent scripts, can be a nightmare. It can take&nbsp;several days&nbsp;to locate the source of an issue and get your site back online. Most operations teams simply don’t have that kind of leeway, particularly for e-commerce and SaaS sites that have a direct impact on revenue generation.</p>



<p>None of this means that you have to abandon your DIY systems completely. It just means that you should have a plan B if (or really, when) things go wrong. Ideally, you’d have a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/addons/dedicated-dns">redundant solution</a> in place that can pick up the slack without any impact to site performance. What should that redundant system contain? We thought you’d never ask.</p>



 
 Separate infrastructure: Any redundant authoritative DNS system should be completely separate from your existing infrastructure so you can afford to spin things down on the main system while you hunt for the source of technical errors. 



 Real-time performance data: Metrics would also be important for a DIY backup, to ensure that everything fails over correctly and traffic isn’t interrupted. This would be particularly valuable in the case of a DDoS attack, to identify the source of the issue and rule out any architectural cause. 



 Health checks: How do you know whether a site is performing as you want it to perform? Does the site need to fail over to a redundant architecture because performance is deprecated in some way? Health checks and alerts are needed to ensure that service outages can be spotted and dealt with quickly. 
 



 IBM NS1 Connect as your DIY backup 



<p>Nobody should operate their authoritative DNS without a safety net. It’s just too important, particularly if your website is the primary generator of revenue. That’s why NS1 Connect offers a physically and logically separate system for redundant authoritative DNS. We started offering <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/addons/dedicated-dns">Dedicated DNS</a> as an add-on to our <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/managed-dns">Managed DNS</a> service, and now we offer it to customers who just want to add a separated, redundant layer to their existing architecture.</p>



 
 Separate infrastructure: NS1’s Dedicated DNS uses the same robust architecture as our flagship-Managed DNS service, but it’s set up on a separate infrastructure that’s unique to a single company. It’s the ultimate in downtime protection. 



 Compatible with any primary: Our Dedicated DNS service is available as a backup or secondary system to any kind of primary architecture. That makes it perfect for BIND-compatible authoritative name servers and DIY architectures. You can easily slide in a Dedicated DNS service as a secondary to a DIY set up. It’ll be spun up and ready to go at a moment’s notice in case disaster strikes. 



 Real-time performance data: Our innovative <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/ns1-connect/addons/dns-insights">DNS Insights feature</a> can collect critical data from any Dedicated DNS set up. When you’re experiencing an outage in your primary system, this data can help to quickly pinpoint the source of external issues (like DDoS attacks) that may have brought your system down. It can help you get back to the primary system as soon as possible. 



 Health checks: DNS can tell you a lot about how your applications, services and websites are performing. NS1 Connect automatically delivers alerts to tell you when site performance is deprecated or not returning results at all. NS1 also uses health check data to trigger and route failover logic so you can avoid downtime. This kind of automation simply isn’t available in DIY systems. 



 Easy migrations: NS1 Connect makes it simple to tack on Dedicated DNS as a secondary to any system.&nbsp;Importing zones and records&nbsp;into that secondary system with files from BIND and other architectures is easy to do in the NS1 Connect user interface. 
 



 Critical infrastructure needs a redundant layer 



<p>External authoritative DNS is one of the most critical pieces of infrastructure on your network. It’s so critical that it deserves the highest level of protection and assurance. DIY authoritative DNS offers administrators a lot of control, until the complexity of those overlapping scripts and tools becomes too much to support.</p>



<p>Even the most sophisticated, reliable authoritative DNS systems have a hiccup every now and then. NS1 Dedicated DNS provides the peace of mind you need to keep the lights on even when all your dashboards are flashing red.</p>

 IDnow’s recently released UK Fraud Awareness Report explores the nation’s awareness of the latest fraud terms, the industries most susceptible to fraud, and how commonly Brits use risky channels. 



 



<p>2023 proved to be a monumental year for fraud in the UK. In fact, by the middle of the year, the losses attributed to fraud <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2023/oct/25/uk-consumer-lose-580m-fraudster-first-half-2023-romance-scam-id-theft-fastest-growing-categories">were already £580 million</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The year was also important for the steps that the UK government pledged to take to address fraud. Chief among these was the release of its fraud strategy, which, the government hopes, will reduce fraud by 10% by 2025. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-fraud-charter-2023">Online Fraud Charter</a> was also launched in 2023, which is a voluntary agreement between the government and technology sector to reduce fraud on their platforms and services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While these initiatives will hopefully go some way to encourage the public and private sector to tackle the scourge of fraud in the UK, they will not necessarily address perhaps the most important challenge: educating the public in a tangible, meaningful way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the aim of investigating the British public’s awareness of fraud and its attitudes toward fraud prevention technology, we created the inaugural IDnow UK Fraud Awareness Report.&nbsp;</p>



 
   
     
                     UK Fraud Awareness Report 2024 
                     Learn more about the British public’s awareness of fraud and their attitudes toward fraud-prevention technology. 
                    <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/2024-uk-fraud-awareness-report/">Read now</a>
           
           
         
          
         
       
       
 


<p>In the first of a three-part blog series, we explore the fraud education levels of the British population, the areas of life most susceptible to fraud, and users’ behavior around insecure digital communication channels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Assessing the awareness of fraud. 



<p>If there was one term that appeared to be on everybody’s lips (from the fraud prevention community) last year, it was ‘deepfakes.’ However, despite some widely circulated deepfake videos of famous politicians making headlines in 2023, we discovered that almost half (47%) of Brits said that they do not know what deepfakes are.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We define deepfakes as deceptively lifelike, manipulated images, audio or video recordings. The quality of deepfakes is constantly improving as computing power increases and AI advances, making it increasingly difficult to distinguish between authentic and artificially created or altered material.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Social engineering, unlike other forms of cyberattacks, appeals to human vulnerabilities and emotions. For example, in romance fraud, the fraudster uses social engineering to build up a rapport with the victim with the intention of tricking them into registering for a service or transferring funds. Worryingly, we discovered that more than half of Brits (54%) do not know what social engineering is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, we did discover some positives regarding the British public’s awareness of fraud terms. A vast majority (83%) of respondents say they know what ‘phishing’ is (gathering a victim’s personal information, such as credentials or payment information, by getting them to click on a malicious link or attachment).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although many respondents were not aware of the definitions of the latest forms of fraud, an overwhelming number (93%) say they are concerned about fraud in one way or another.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Which industry is most susceptible to fraud? 



<p>Despite a majority (73%) of Brits believing their bank is effective in safeguarding their financial assets, three quarters (75%) of respondents said banking was the industry they were most concerned about when it comes to fraud. More than half (55%) of UK adults say they are also concerned about online shopping fraud, followed by a third of the population (37%) citing social media fraud as a worry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Respondents were also asked to assess the risk levels of different crimes: 32% think they are most at risk of someone having access to their bank account through identity fraud; another 21% of Brits think they are most at risk of someone hacking their social media profile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other industries are also perceived as rife with fraud. Around 2 in 10 Brits are concerned about insurance fraud (19%); 14% worry about fraud in cryptocurrency, eGovernment (13%), online dating (13%), travel (12%) and telecoms (11%).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Which channel is considered the riskiest? 



<p>Despite 97% of respondents knowing what identity theft means, and widespread concern about fraud in various areas of life, a third of Brits (33%) have admitted to sharing scans or photos of ID cards, driving licenses or passports via insecure and largely unencrypted channels, such as social media, email or messenger apps.&nbsp;Of these people, almost half (45%) said they were aware that these document scans or photos could land in the hands of fraudsters but&nbsp;proceeded to share these scans or photos anyway. This is a clear indicator that consumers are either unaware of an alternative way of verification (for example, via an identity verification solution) or the service they were trying to access did not offer a secure channel. It also highlights the importance for businesses to provide secure digital channels for customers to share personal information.&nbsp;</p>

			 Why Do Asset Managers Embrace Tokenization? 
 
<p>I’m excited to share some exciting news from our side, as we proudly participated in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.citigroup.com/global/businesses/digital-assets?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4#tokenization">Citi’s tokenization use case to test the ERC-3643 token standard</a>&nbsp;for enforcing compliance on-chain. This showcased how tokenized securities can thrive in a decentralized infrastructure while maintaining compliance and control.</p>
<p>Another significant news is Blackrock’s recent statement on tokenization, positioning it as the next step after the cryptocurrency spot ETFs. Now, let’s delve into why asset managers are eagerly embracing tokenization. According to PwC’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/financial-services/library/asset-wealth-management-trends.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">research</a>, the top priorities for asset managers in the next two years include&nbsp;accessing new segments and clients, increasing market share, and mitigating risks through product diversification. Below, I will explain how tokenization helps asset managers to achieve these strategic goals.</p>
 

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Tokenization opens the door for asset managers to gain new capital sources from untapped segments&nbsp;– new regions, and new types of investors such as High Net Worth (HNW) investors and family offices, to meet market demand and gain market shares. Illuminating this potential, EY’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ey.com/en_us/financial-services/tokenization-in-asset-management?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">report</a>&nbsp;underscores a significant trend: 61% of HNW investors plan to invest in tokenized assets in 2024. Tokenization enables asset managers to tackle the historical challenges rooted in manual, time-consuming processes, and fragmented systems through programmability and shared infrastructure. It empowers them to acquire the capability to efficiently handle a large number of clients and unlock a potential&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bain.com/insights/how-tokenization-can-fuel-a-400-billion-opportunity-in-distributing-alternative-investments-to-individuals/?utm_medium=social_advocacy&amp;utm_source=LinkedIn-dysi&amp;utm_content=659945e8-bafb-4474-abae-0cdb8cd50411&amp;utm_term=147236&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">$400 billion revenue opportunity</a>, according to Bain &amp; Company.</p>
<p>Moreover,&nbsp;PwC’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/financial-services/asset-wealth-management/high-net-worth-investor.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">survey</a>&nbsp;shows that 66% of HNW investors desire increased personalization in their wealth management relationship. This trend towards personalized models is also highlighted in Oliver Wyman’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2024/jan/asset-management-trends-for-2024.html?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">report</a>&nbsp;“10 Asset Management Trends for 2024,” suggesting opportunities for asset managers to compete with wealth manager home offices. Tokenized securities embed asset data, enabling such customization.&nbsp;By offering tailored tokenized portfolios based on clients’ risk profiles, asset managers can attract and retain clients.&nbsp;Tokenization can even combine with AI to allow&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/the-new-financial-world-ai-meets-tokenization/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">AI to analyze, and blockchain to execute</a>, creating another level of personalized experience.</p>
<p>Regarding risk management, thanks to transparency, automation, and availability of asset data, asset managers can&nbsp;automatically rebalance portfolios to migrate risks&nbsp;based on predefined risk conditions. For instance, setting up a smart contract to trigger a sell-off when the risk rating level transitions from AAA to AA.</p>
<p>Lastly, as highlighted in Oliver Wyman’s report, a notable trend in the private market is the&nbsp;surge in Limited Partner (LP) secondaries and the emergence of net asset value (NAV-based) lending.&nbsp;These have gained momentum as the return on capital slows, and investors increasingly seek liquidity.&nbsp;Tokenization emerges as a powerful solution, offering diversified products and cultivating liquidity. Tokenized securities, carrying both compliance rules and asset data, enable instant compliant transferability, support peer-to-peer transactions, and integrate seamlessly with third-party trading applications. This enables global and flat distribution. Furthermore, lending smart contracts can be easily launched to allow LPs to pledge their tokenized securities for borrowing.</p>
<p>This emphasis on liquidity is also our primary focus as&nbsp;we build distribution rails to expand the DINO distribution network for tokenized securities, as discussed by Xavi Aznal, our Head of Product, in&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/tokenys-2024-products-building-the-distribution-rails-of-the-tokenized-economy/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8KP45JgIukkxknLOWbMiQe2nFG-Hq7sF1GTQdrL9KNAOW9yiZsoT-YNaAUlOaOfkfzxYo4">the last Product Focus newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>We anticipate witnessing the launch of tokenization projects by at least 5 out of 10 of the largest asset managers this year.</p>
<p>Let’s stay tuned for this exciting moment.</p>

<p>Dear Community,</p><p>Despite numerous challenges, Metadium has achieved grown significantly over the past 5 years. We are proud to announce unveiling our latest vision map as Metadium prepares for another leap in&nbsp;2024.</p> Mission: Metadium with advanced technology, creating a new&nbsp;market <p>Since the announcement of Metadium 2.0, the Metadium team has been dedicated to providing better services. To achieve this updates such as Fee delegation, improvements in block validation methods, and the adoption of the EIP-1559 mechanism were implemented to offer users more convenient and secure services. Additionally, various partnerships have been to expand the Metadium ecosystem.</p><p>Metadium is enhancing its technological capabilities to provide services that more users can seamlessly adopt. Through the B2G (business-to-global) model, Metadium aims to expand its ecosystem globally. Moreover, we aim to lower the barriers to entry into the blockchain environment, providing opportunities for Web 2 users to easily and conveniently experience the benefits of Web 3. It will enable Metadium to open doors to various areas, such as smart student IDs, autonomous driving, and supply&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Metadium seeks to create a new market through advanced technology, breaking down the boundaries between Web 2 and Web 3, and striving for a continuous effort to create a high-value-added service&nbsp;model.</p> Vision: Decentralized Self-Sovereign Identity, Innovation in Digital Identity Management and Authentication <p>Metadium Blockchain’s Identity Layer aims to achieve decentralized self-sovereign identity and revolutionize users’ digital identity management and authentication. Users can directly own and manage their digital identities, securely protecting personal information and identity data through the blockchain-based Identity Layer without the need for central authorities or intermediaries, and selectively share them only when necessary.</p><p>With the advancement of blockchain technology, damages related to virtual assets are increasing, prompting countries to introduce regulations on blockchain-based services. KYC (Know Your Customer) is emphasized as an essential regulatory element, and DID (Decentralized Identity) services can be utilized for this purpose. Due to decentralization, blockchain-based services often involve anonymous transactions, potential harming users. Consequently, regulations requiring verification of the identity of transaction initiators are gradually expanding.</p><p>Furthermore, blockchain technology faces challenges such as malicious attacks and illicit fundraising, leading various countries to implement anti-money laundering (AML) measures for virtual asset operators. DeFi (Decentralized Finance) is the most active area of blockchain-based services, where KYC is emphasized as a mandatory requirement. Therefore, expanding DID services is expected to form the basis for blockchain-based financial transactions.</p><p>Metadium is striving to address the challenges experienced by users by introducing DID in various technical fields. Additionally, we pursue the B2G (Business-to-global) model and continuously improve multiple services to provide smooth services for businesses, including enhancing block validation methods. Metadium prioritizes personal data protection and user-centric services, aiming to contribute to blockchain technology’s innovation and security enhancement. Through these efforts, Metadium seeks to contribute to the development of the blockchain ecosystem and expand the ecosystem globally.</p> Metadium Vision Map&nbsp;2024 <p>Metadium is planning to enhance the blockchain network, governance changes, and expand DID usability through its 2024 Vision&nbsp;Map.</p> #Phase 1 — Chain Improvement <p>Metadium aims to improve its chain in line with the rapidly changing trends in the blockchain network. Although it already has high reliability and performance, it plans to make changes specific processes and provide additional support for ecosystem needs to prepare for future changes. Through this, Metadium will be able to reflect new technologies and service trends and be ready to apply upgrades safely and&nbsp;quickly.</p> # Phase 2 — Governance Change <p>Metadium’s upgrade begins with changes in governance. The governance operation, which allows network members to make decisions in a decentralized manner, has been validated over years of upgrades and modifications. Metadium aims to improve governance to enable decision-making on various aspects of the chain ecosystem and increase the participation of network members. The improved governance will strengthen the network’s decentralization through continuous upgrades and evolve in a transparent and reliable direction.</p> # Phase 3 — DID Usability Expansion <p>After the changes in governance and the establishment of a trusted environment, Metadium completes a trusted environment for a powerful DID service. The goal is to expand the usability of DID by broadening its scope and providing various functions through upgrades. Metadium is expected to serve as an identity layer by adding DID usage on-chain and strong connections with other chains. As the usage scope of DID expands in the on-chain environment, solutions utilizing DID transactions will increase, improving the activation of the network ecosystem and the stability of services.</p> Evolution of Metadium, easier to blockchain <p>Metadium is a project to build an innovative blockchain ecosystem based on Decentralized Identity (DID) technology and trust. To achieve this, it plans to integrate with Ethereum-based EVM blockchains to bring transactions from various services into Metadium and activate the ecosystem. Metadium aims to provide users with freedom and security, pioneering the future of blockchain by understanding the importance of identity information and enabling user-centric identity management. Additionally, the Metadium blockchain will contribute to the blockchain ecosystem through self-sovereign identity, supporting the proliferation of services that enhance decentralization and personal data protection. Metadium prioritizes users’ data privacy and security, leading innovation in the digital&nbsp;world.</p><p>- Metadium&nbsp;Team</p><p>안녕하세요. 메타디움&nbsp;팀입니다.</p><p>많은 어려움에도 불구하고 메타디움은 지난 5년간 큰 성장을 이루었습니다. 메타디움이 2024년 또 다른 도약을 준비하면서 최신 비전맵을 공개하게 된 것을 자랑스럽게&nbsp;생각합니다.</p> 미션: 진화된 기술을 담은 메타디움, 새로운 시장을&nbsp;만들어가다 <p>메타디움 팀은 메타디움 2.0 발표 이후 더 나은 서비스를 위해 지속적인 노력을 기울여왔습니다. 이를 위해 Fee delegation과 블록 검증 방법 개선, EIP-1559 메커니즘 도입 등의 업데이트를 통해 사용자들에게 보다 편리하고 안전한 서비스를 제공하고자 했습니다. 또한, 다양한 파트너십을 맺으며 메타디움의 생태계를 확장하는 노력을&nbsp;기울였습니다.</p><p>메타디움은 기술력을 향상시켜 더 많은 사용자들에게 자연스럽게 적용되는 서비스를 제공하기 위한 기반을 강화하고 있으며, B2G(business-to-global) 모델을 통해 메타디움의 생태계를 전 세계적으로 확장하고자 합니다. 또한, 블록체인 환경에 대한 진입 장벽을 낮추기 위해 웹2 사용자도 웹3의 장점을 쉽고 편리하게 경험할 수 있는 기회를 제공하고자 합니다. 이를 통해 메타디움은 스마트 학생증, 자율주행, 공급망 등 다양한 영역으로 확장해 나갈 수 있는 포문을 열어줄&nbsp;것입니다.</p><p>메타디움은 진화된 기술을 통해 새로운 시장을 창출하고자 하며, 웹2와 웹3의 경계를 허물고 부가가치가 높은 새로운 서비스 모델을 창출하기 위해 지속적인 노력을 기울일&nbsp;것입니다.</p> 비전: 탈중앙화된 자기주권 신원, 디지털 신원 관리와 인증의&nbsp;혁신 <p>메타디움 블록체인 Identity Layer는 탈중앙화된 자기주권 신원을 실현하고, 사용자들의 디지털 신원 관리와 인증을 혁신적으로 변화시키는 것을 목표로 합니다. 이를 위해 사용자들은 자신의 디지털 신원을 직접 소유하고 관리할 수 있으며, 중앙기관이나 중개자 없이 블록체인 기반의 Identity Layer를 통해 개인 정보와 신원 데이터를 안전하게 보호하고 필요한 경우에만 선택적으로 공유할 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>블록체인 기술의 발전으로 인해 가상자산에 대한 피해가 증가하고 있으며, 이에 따라 국가들은 블록체인 기반 서비스에 규제를 도입하고 있습니다. KYC(Know Your Customer)가 중요한 규제 요소로 강조되고 있으며, 이를 위해 DID(분산 신원 확인) 서비스가 활용될 수 있습니다. 블록체인 기반 서비스는 탈중앙화로 인해 익명성을 보장한 거래가 이루어지다보니 사용자에게 피해가 발생하는 경우가 있습니다. 이를 해결하기 위해 거래의 주최자의 신원을 확인하는 규제가 점차 늘어나고&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>또한, 블록체인 기술은 악의적인 공격과 불법자금 조달 등의 문제를 겪고 있으며, 각국에서는 가상자산 사업자에게 자금세탁방지(AML)를 적용하고 있습니다. DeFi(탈중앙화 금융)는 블록체인 기반 서비스 중 거래가 가장 활발한데, 이를 위해 KYC가 필수 요소로 강조되고 있습니다. 따라서, DID 서비스의 확장은 블록체인 기반 금융 거래에 기반이 될 것으로&nbsp;예상됩니다.</p><p>메타디움은 다양한 기술 분야에 DID를 도입하면서 사용자들이 경험하는 어려움을 해결하기 위한 노력을 하고 있습니다. 또한 B2G(Business-to-global) 모델을 추구하며, 블록 검증 방법 개선과 사업자가 원활한 서비스를 제공하기 위한 다양한 서비스 개선을 진행하고 있습니다. 메타디움은 개인 정보 보호와 사용자 중심의 서비스를 최우선으로 하며, 블록체인 기술의 혁신과 보안성을 향상시키는 데 기여하고자 합니다. 이를 통해 메타디움은 블록체인 생태계의 발전에 기여하고 전 세계적으로 생태계를 확장하고자&nbsp;합니다.</p> Metadium Vision Map&nbsp;2024 <p>메타디움은 2024년 비전 맵을 통해 블록체인 네트워크의 개선과 거버넌스 변화, 그리고 DID 사용성 확장을 계획하고&nbsp;있습니다.</p> Phase 1 — 체인&nbsp;개선: <p>메타디움은 빠르게 변화하는 블록체인 네트워크 동향에 맞춰 체인을 개선하고자 합니다. 이미 높은 신뢰성과 성능을 가지고 있지만, 앞으로의 변화를 대비하여 일부 프로세스를 변경하고 생태계를 위해 필요한 기능을 추가적으로 지원합니다. 이를 통해 메타디움은 새로운 기술과 서비스 트렌드를 반영하고, 업그레이드를 안전하고 신속하게 적용할 수 있는 준비를 갖출 수 있게&nbsp;됩니다.</p> Phase 2 — 거버넌스&nbsp;변경: <p>메타디움의 업그레이드는 거버넌스의 변화와 함께 시작됩니다. 탈중앙화된 방식으로 네트워크 멤버가 의사결정을 하도록 하는 거버넌스 운영 방식은 다년간의 업그레이드와 변화에서 필요성이 검증되었습니다. 메타디움은 거버넌스를 개선하여 체인 생태계의 다양한 부분에 대한 의사결정을 가능하게 하고, 네트워크 멤버의 참여도를 높이는 목표를 가지고 있습니다. 개선된 거버넌스는 지속적인 업그레이드를 통해 네트워크의 탈중앙화를 강화하고 투명하고 신뢰성 있는 방향으로 진화할&nbsp;것입니다.</p> Phase 3 — DID 사용성&nbsp;확장: <p>거버넌스의 변화와 신뢰 환경의 구축 이후, 메타디움은 강력한 DID 서비스의 신뢰 환경을 완성합니다. 업그레이드를 통해 DID의 사용 범위를 넓히고 다양한 기능을 제공하여 사용성을 확장하는 것이 목표입니다. 메타디움은 온체인에서의 DID 사용처를 추가하고, 다른 체인과의 강력한 연결을 통해 아이덴티티 레이어로써의 역할을 수행할 것으로 예상됩니다. 이렇게 DID 서비스가 온체인에서의 사용 범위를 넓혀감에 따라, DID를 이용한 트랜잭션이 증가하고 네트워크 생태계의 활성화와 서비스의 안정성을 개선하는 솔루션이 될&nbsp;것입니다.</p> 메타디움의 진화, 더 쉬운&nbsp;블록체인으로 <p>메타디움은 분산 신원 인증(DID) 기술과 신뢰를 기반으로 혁신적인 블록체인 생태계를 구축하고자 하는 프로젝트입니다. 이를 위해 이더리움 기반의 EVM 블록체인과 연계하여 다양한 서비스의 트랜잭션을 메타디움으로 유입시키고 생태계를 활성화할 계획입니다. 메타디움은 사용자들에게 자유와 보안을 동시에 제공하며, 신원 정보의 중요성을 이해하고 사용자 중심의 신원 관리를 가능하게 함으로써 블록체인의 미래를 개척하고자 합니다. 또한 메타디움 블록체인은 자기주권 신원을 통해 블록체인 생태계에 기여하고, 탈중앙화와 개인 데이터 보호를 강화하는 서비스들이 보급될 수 있도록 지원할 것입니다. 메타디움은 사용자들의 데이터 프라이버시와 안전성을 최우선으로 생각하며, 디지털 세계에서의 혁신을 주도해&nbsp;나가겠습니다.</p><p>- 메타디움&nbsp;팀</p><p>Website | <a href="https://metadium.com/">https://metadium.com</a></p><p>Discord | <a href="https://discord.gg/ZnaCfYbXw2">https://discord.gg/ZnaCfYbXw2</a></p><p>Telegram(EN) | <a href="http://t.me/metadiumofficial?fbclid=IwAR3MeXsYSQbBpKEuxTMdtNKMBDGnBpniwKrmLAoNCvGL80qVdXjpS65O0t0">http://t.me/metadiumofficial</a></p><p>Twitter | <a href="https://twitter.com/MetadiumK">https://twitter.com/MetadiumK</a></p><p>Medium | <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">https://medium.com/metadium</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-2024-vision-map-cb8e117516fb">Metadium 2024 Vision Map</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Metadium</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>About Making Data Better episode 9, <a href="https://www.makingdatabetter.com/2195663/14578278-the-bigger-step-want-a-single-digital-id">“The Bigger Step: Want a Single Digital ID?”</a></p>
 The presumption of a singular ID&nbsp; 
<p>We’ve been <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/digital-id-and-digital-identity/">writing about the new Australian Government Digital ID System</a> (AGDIS) and <a href="https://www.makingdatabetter.com/2195663/14477065-a-big-little-step-australia-shifts-from-digital-identity-to-digital-id">talking about it the Making Data Better podcast</a>. We’re reading press reports, speaking to commentators, and finding some ambiguity about whether this thing is might be a new ID or attribute.</p>
<p>The Finance Minister Katy Gallagher, responsible for the Digital ID Bill, says she is not in the business of producing a new national ID. We believe her.</p>
<p>Yet many still believe AGDIS must be producing some sort of new attribute. It could provide a new way to do KYC checks when opening a bank account, or proving how old we are when we buy alcohol online.</p>
<p>A lot is left to the imagination: Does AGDIS really mean a new sort of attribute, a de facto ID? No, and the spectre of a singular ID distracts from the true potential of Digital ID to fix what’s broken.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.makingdatabetter.com/2195663/14578278-the-bigger-step-want-a-single-digital-id">In our latest short conversation</a>, <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/about/george-peabody/">George</a> and I try to clarify what AGDIS could be delivering.</p>
 How do we think about the prospect of new attributes? 
<p>We’ve been celebrating the fact that with the Digital ID Bill,<a href="https://lockstep.com.au/rip-trusted-digital-identity-but-whither-australias-tdif/"> the government is not talking about “digital identity” anymore</a>.</p>
<p>But the term Digital ID in the public mind could be construed as a new identifier or national ID, and many don’t like that idea.</p>
<p>The good people of Australia, the US, the UK, Canada and New Zealand — the Common Law system countries — are famously allergic to National ID. So, there are some optics to be concerned about.</p>
<p>But much more important is the question of how relying parties use any ID, be it old or new. It’s the relying parties that actually make use of IDs and take a risk on them. We’ve seen over and over around the world that the success of digital identification is in the hands of relying parties.</p>
<p>The critical problem with a new digital ID is that the relying parties’ existing systems don’t know how to consume it.</p>
<p>They will not have seen it before. They won’t know what to make of it.</p>
<p>Even if lawyers and risk officers gave it the all-clear, a new ID needs to be incorporated into subsystems and business processes that have operated for years around driver’s licenses, birth certificates and Medicare numbers. Subsystems include onboarding routines, user interfaces, databases, risk assessments, and call centre processes. They would all need updating for a new ID.</p>
 The need for flexibility in identification 
<p>KYC (Know Your Customer) has a bad reputation and it’s far from perfect, but it works in familiar ways, drawing on sets of well-established IDs which can be put together in different ways to onboard new customers.</p>
<p>Every bank actually does KYC differently. KYC conventions allow for variations. </p>
<p>This is critical. Think of the challenge of “low doc” customers — individuals without the affordances of passports or driver licences who still have the same right to participate in the finance system. To accommodate customers with diverse personal documents, banks can vary their KYC processes.</p>
<p>Banks know their own way business environments and rightly have the discretion to customise their identification processes. </p>
<p>When KYC draws on lists of established IDs, it allows for flexibility, and compensatory controls when identification pathways need to be varied.</p>
<p>But if we throw a new attribute into the ecosystem — especially one that is supposed to be better or preferred — then we force the banks back to square one to work out what to do with it.</p>
<p>We know perfectly well from the <a href="https://www.secureidnews.com/news-item/fractional-identity-an-alternative-to-nstic-federated-identity-models/">failure of grand Identity Federations</a> that trust isn’t transitive. That is, the work done by one party to manage its risks is not going to satisfy other parties.</p>
<p>Instead of any new IDs or bundles of attributes, we need to make better data available to established identification processes. The Australian Digital ID System can do that simply through verifiable credentials that make it impossible for ID data to be replayed by fraudsters.</p>
<p>Let’s move away from plaintext presentation of IDs and adopt device-bound presentation just like we have with our chip payment cards and digital wallets, where hardware and software work together to make each presentation unique and non-replayable.</p>
<p>The golden opportunity we have now comes from so many people having computers in their hands that can present and release data in a far more secure way than filling out a form.</p>
<p>So in conclusion, we understand why people can suspect that Digital ID going to be a new ID, but it’s not. No new ID is needed.&nbsp;To fix online identification, we can conserve all the IDs we know today and make the move from plaintext to device-bound smart presentation.</p>

<p>Why isn’t the world moving more quickly towards passwordless tech?</p>



<p>Passwords have long been the bedrock of cybersecurity, but let’s face it, they aren’t a great solution, especially when personal and financial data is at risk. If you show me a news article about a high-profile breach, I’m probably going to point to reliance on passwords as one likely cause.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Examples:&nbsp;</p>



 
 In 2020, Ticketmaster <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/ticketmaster-pays-10-million-criminal-fine-intrusions-competitor-s-computer-systems-0">pleaded guilty</a> to a charge of repeatedly and illegally accessing competitors’ computers. How? They had an employee who used to work for a rival company. That employee was able to the login credentials for multiple corporate accounts at that rival company to steal information.&nbsp; 



 Also in 2021, the New York City Law Department ended up <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/cyberattack-on-nyc-law-department/">exposing the personal data</a> of thousands of city employees. This included evidence of police misconduct, medical records for plaintiffs, and more. All because of a single employee’s stolen email account password. 



 23andMe, in 2023, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/15/23andme-hack-data-genetic-data-selling-response">exposed data</a> for millions of users, thanks to hackers using all the bad passwords they could find to run what’s called credential stuffing attack that got them into the systems where they could harvest data to their dirty little hearts’ content. 
 



<p>What’s so wildly frustrating about all this is that there are better ways to secure accounts! We just have to get companies to support them.</p>



<p>So, let’s look at a more secure alternative.</p>



 The Case for Going Passwordless&nbsp; 



<p>Older passwordless solutions, like hardware tokens and smart cards, definitely offer enhanced security. You have to physically have a thing in order to access a thing. Combine that with something like biometrics, and suddenly you have two-factor authentication: something you have and something you are. I’ll be the first to admit, though, that diving straight into requiring a physical … something … to log in is not going to be the solution for everyone. It’s an extra step, and it involves someone buying that physical thing. There is always cost associated with security that may outweigh the data you are trying to protect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The really good news here is that <a href="https://www.yubico.com/">cute little hardware tokens</a> that you are going to lose, or, if you’re like my friend Sarah, will need to put on a pair of earrings so you don’t lose them, are no longer your only option for going passwordless. Enter in, stage left, passkeys!</p>



 About Passkeys 



<p>Passkeys are a technology that feels almost too good to be true, because they can work with your mobile device OR with a hardware token. What you use to store your passkey depends a lot on what security model you’re following: super duper high levels of security, or a casual, please don’t access my New York Times subscription model. If you want the full gory details of how passkeys work, I suggest you go down the rabbit hole at the FIDO Alliance website. They’ve got a great primer at <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 No, really, what is a passkey? 



<p>So, what is a passkey? A passkey is a digital credential, like an electronic key in this case, tied to both a user account and a website or application. Users can authenticate without having to enter a username or password, or provide any additional authentication factor, because they have this key, which is entirely under their control and can’t be shared or stolen the way a password can. When a user is asked to sign-in to an app or website (basically unlocking access with the key), the user approves the sign-in with the same biometric or PIN that the user has to unlock the device the passkey is stored on (whether that device is a phone, computer, or hardware key).&nbsp; It’s really just that easy to use. If my cats had phones, they could totally do this.</p>



<p>One of my favorite things about passkeys, when they comply with the FIDO standards that define them, is that they can’t be phished. Anyone spoofing an email, phone call, or SMS asking for your password or the code you received in a text message is out of luck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So now we have something that’s actually easier to use than a password because we don’t have to type anything in AND is more secure. So let’s talk about making the business case.&nbsp;</p>



 Crafting Your Business Case 



<p>I’m going to suggest that to advocate for passwordless systems, you need emphasize the benefits: enhanced security, potential cost savings, and a smoother user experience. What organization doesn’t find that attractive? I’m also going to go ahead and recognize that if you are working in a regulated industry like banking, a lot of this is already old news to you. Why? Because if you’re in the US, the Federal Trade Commission has required MFA since 2021 through its <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/12/09/2021-25736/standards-for-safeguarding-customer-information">Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information</a>. If you’re in the EU, you have similar requirements not to mention the recommendations in <a href="https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/what-is-eIDAS-2-how-digital-identity-verification-plays-a-key-role">eIDAS 2.0</a> and the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/nis2-directive">NIS 2 directive</a>.</p>



<p>But, for the rest of us, yay, let’s emphasize the benefits! But who are you emphasizing the benefits to? If you’re in the IT security department, you probably don’t need to be convinced. But there are a variety of other stakeholders in an organization that you can get on your side. If you’re in a big company, your HR, Legal, PR, and Financial departments might have a thing or two to say about protecting the company’s reputation by avoiding being lit on fire in the news because of a cybersecurity breach. They might also be really fond of the idea of having an argument to lower the tech insurance costs. And if you’re in a regulated industry like banking, healthcare, or are handling government contracts, then this is an obvious requirement to pass those audits. So, yep, lots of positive reasons to make these changes.</p>



<p>Whether your company is in the business of IT or not, better security is critical. If you have an Internet presence, if your employees log in to something to do their work, and especially if you have consumers, there are a lot of business cases you can make for moving away from a pure password model into something a bit more technologically sexy and secure.</p>



 Embracing Multi-Factor Authentication 



<p>Jumping straight to a passwordless world might be a bit too much to expect, and look a little too much like arcane magic to your executives. There are still things you can do to make your reliance on passwords a little less fraught with peril! And that’s requiring multi-factor authentication. MFA, which also encompasses two-factor authentication, requires at least two out of the following three things:</p>



 
 something you know 



 something you have 



 something you are 
 



<p>So, like a password, a physical token, or your biometrics. In some cases, you may want to require all three! It depends on what you’re trying to protect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More systems are ready to support MFA than they are to support passkeys. One of your limiting factors in convincing your organization to support passkeys is that the software you use might not support it yet. OK, I get it, but if your software or services doesn’t support MFA yet, you really need to have some stern words with your vendors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a lot of information out there about best practices when it comes to how to deploy MFA. I want to highlight two articles from the IDPro Body of Knowledge that should be required reading in this space:</p>



 
 <a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/49/">Designing MFA for Humans</a> – Nishant Kaushik 



 <a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/92/">Multi-factor Authentication</a> – Khaled Zaky and Dean H. Saxe 
 



<p>When your organization considers rolling out MFA or starts to evaluate MFA as part of their vendor evaluations, these articles will give you some really good things to think about when it comes to balancing what individuals need versus what’s the best shiny object for cybersecurity professionals, and what is best practice all around. Go read them.</p>



 Transition Strategies and Best Practices&nbsp; 



<p>You’ve made the case. You’re going to start with pushing MFA as a little less scary, a little more supported. But there are a few of your vendors or services ready to dive straight into the passwordless universe. That’s brilliant! However, as much as I love MFA and passkeys, and I want you to get there, I’m telling you right now, don’t just throw your user base into this brave new world and think that’s going to work for you.</p>



<p>Start with pilot programs, evaluate feedback, and scale up. You’re going to need to convince some people that the magic of passkeys is really more secure. You’re going to need to get them to understand that yes, their account even though they are just a junior staffer in the PR department, using MFA is important. You’ll need different arguments for different stakeholder groups, and that’s ok.</p>



<p>For your executives, cite successful case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness and compatibility of MFA or passkeys with existing systems. A basic Google search will net you several examples; if you’re using a vendor like Ping or Okta, they almost certainly have more. For your line managers, they might be more compelled if you pointed them to a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/how-do-you-train-your-employees-use-multi-factor">thread on LinkedIn</a> about “How do you train your employees to use multi-factor authentication securely and effectively?“ where their peers talk about the benefits of MFA.</p>



<p>There are other organizations that are paving the way. <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/passkeys">Google Identity</a> has some great developer documentation about passkeys. Okta has some <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/whitepaper/8-steps-for-effectively-deploying-mfa/">pretty good stuff</a> about MFA.</p>



 The Road Ahead 



<p>it’s going to take time for your organization to actually move, especially if you’re just starting to make the case for this change. This is good, because there is still one rather important kink to work out, and that’s account recovery. If, or more to the point, when, you lose your hardware token, phone, or whatever device you have your passkey on, you have a problem, and it’s not one a helpdesk can easily help you solve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At least at the moment, some of the best advice in high-security situations is to make sure you’re protected against losing your hardware tokens, have more than one hardware token. Not the best model ever, to be honest. There are other points to consider as well, and for all of those fine points about account recovery, I’m going to point you right over to the article on <a href="https://bok.idpro.org/article/id/64/">Account Recovery</a> by Dean Saxe over in the IDPro Body of Knowledge.</p>



<p>The journey to a passwordless future is ongoing. Stay informed about emerging technologies, educate your team, and be a proactive advocate for advanced security solutions in your organization.</p>



 Wrap Up&nbsp; 



<p>There you have it: my thoughts on how you can and should advance towards a passwordless future while bolstering security with multi-factor authentication. This post is purely a place for you to start; it should inspire you to encourage change both in how you handle your own accounts and how you take action for organizational change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Actually, Holochain 0.2 has been with us for a long time — since last <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-02x-series-gossip-fix-in-the-works-dev-tooling-expected-for-021">May</a> — and developers have been actively building hApps on Holochain 0.3 for a while as well. But for developers who are new to Holochain, we’ve still been recommending 0.1 up until this point. That’s because 0.2’s new networking layer introduced a few <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-02x-series-gossip-fix-in-the-works-dev-tooling-expected-for-021">performance</a> <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-0-1-6-maintenance-release/#holochain-02-progress-building-comprehensive-diagnostic-capacities">regressions</a> and <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/moving-along-on-all-fronts/#holochain-02x-series-gossip-fix-in-the-works-dev-tooling-expected-for-021">peer discovery</a> issues, and we wanted to be confident that the user experience was reasonably smooth before recommending it.</p><p>Today is the day we're now recommending Holochain 0.2.6 for all existing and new projects.</p><p>You'll notice that this release has been out for a few weeks, and there have been a number of unannounced releases since 0.2.1. In recent months we’ve adopted a new process for public releases. Here’s how it looks:</p>  The core dev team cuts a release candidate (RC).  The release candidate is ‘smoke tested’ to make sure it works with a few mature apps that exercise a lot of its functionality, particularly <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/talking-stickies?ref=blog.holochain.org">Talking Stickies</a> and HoloFuel.  If the smoke test passes, the RC designation is removed and the commit is promoted to a proper release.  The dev tooling (client libs, scaffolding, etc) are updated to the new release.  A ‘soak test’ is performed, in which an app is run for a couple weeks in order to discover long-term performance and discoverability issues.  If the soak test passes with reasonable performance, the commit is promoted to the latest recommended release and we spread the news.  <p>It’s been a long time coming, but Holochain 0.2.6 is finally the first release in the 0.2 series to pass the above checks to our satisfaction. Let’s get into what’s new.</p> Holochain 0.2.6: Recommended for all developers <p>Release date: 6 February 2024<br>HDI compatibility: 0.3.x<br>HDK compatibility: 0.2.x</p><p>The changelog from Holochain 0.1.6 is too long to repeat here, but here are the highlights:</p>  New networking layer based on WebRTC, which lets us use off-the-shelf session negotiation and NAT hole-punching techniques. The QUIC protocol, which we built 0.1’s&nbsp; networking layer on, was great, but it forced us to build a lot of network tooling from scratch.  Many performance improvements and fixes for peer discovery, function calls, signals, and gossip; apps feel much faster (and we’re working on making it faster still).  A small number of breaking changes in the conductor APIs and the WASM host API.  A lot of work to clean up the ‘workflows’, the processes that run pretty much everything in the conductor, leading to better testability, better performance, and more correctness.  <p>Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/main-0.2/CHANGELOG.md?ref=blog.holochain.org#20240206184429">full changelog</a> or skim through the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/releases?ref=blog.holochain.org">release notes</a>. If this is your first time using 0.2, make sure you read all the way down! And apologies for the coarseness of the second link — GitHub really needs to add a feature to let you filter by <a href="https://semver.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">semver</a>.</p><p>This release is paired with new libraries, developer tools, and infrastructure:</p>  HDI 0.3.6 and HDK 0.2.6 maintain compatibility with the WASM host API.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-js/releases/tag/v0.16.9?ref=blog.holochain.org">JavaScript client 0.16.9</a>&nbsp; and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-client-rust/releases/tag/v0.4.5?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rust client 0.4.5</a> maintain compatibility with the conductor APIs, along with the usual bug fixes and code/API cleanups.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama/releases/tag/v0.15.2?ref=blog.holochain.org">Tryorama 0.15.2</a> has been updated to JavaScript client 0.16 to give it compatibility with Holochain 0.2, and gets a new awaitDhtSync function, bringing back a useful feature Tryorama had back in the Holochain Redux days!  <a href="https://github.com/holochain/scaffolding/commit/ddb8b5a950e7be81d704000e662564696bef5d6b?ref=blog.holochain.org">hc-scaffold 0.2001.1</a> generates code that uses the latest HDI and HDK to maintain compatibility with 0.2.6.  <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@holochain/hc-spin?ref=blog.holochain.org">hc spin</a>, a new dev tool, spins up one or more conductors with your hApp running in them, opens up your UI in an <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/holochain-kangaroo-electron?ref=blog.holochain.org">Electron-based container</a> (a sort of mini-Launcher), and runs local network services.

We’re moving our UI tools back to Electron, as we’ve found Tauri’s cross-OS compatibility isn’t quite there yet. hc launch, the Tauri equivalent, is still available.  The public bootstrap server bootstrap.holo.host has been updated.  There are two new servers for the new WebRTC networking, signal.holo.host for connection establishment and turn.holo.host for traffic proxying.  There’s a new dev tool command, hc run-local-services, that will run bootstrap and connection establishment services for machines on your local network.

And what about disinformation and misinformation? What role does identity have here? What about data and deepfakes for onboarding and biometrics? What does data access governance meanin 2024? Is data integrity protection the biggest issue within cyber today? How should we handle fine grained and contextual access and how do the CISO and Chief Data Officer relate?</p>

				  Learn why building decentralized identity functionality into your existing solutions has never been simpler with the Indicio mobile SDK.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Indicio <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicios-new-software-developer-kit-sdk-makes-creating-and-customizing-digital-wallets-for-any-application-quick-and-easy/">recently announced</a> the new <a href="https://indicio.tech/mobile-software-development-kit/">Indicio Proven mobile SDK</a> which enables any organization to build digital wallet functionality right into their existing applications. This allows any existing mobile application to hold and share verifiable data and identity, which leads to faster, more secure information sharing and a better experience for the end user.</p>
<p>Recently I sat down with the developers behind the project, Patrick Kenyon (PK) and Kolby Kunz (KK), to learn more about their thought process and how this new piece of technology was created. You can watch the full interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuXNHa07izw">here.</a></p>
<p>The following are a few excerpts from that conversation that have been edited for comprehension:</p>
<p>TS: Could you please break down just what is an SDK quickly for us?</p>
<p>PK: An SDK stands for software development kit, to be more specific, oftentimes if you have a feature that someone wants to implement in an app, an SDK will just be a library or an aid focused on implementing that specific feature in other applications.</p>
<p>TS: So for the proven mobile SDK it implements features of proven and digital wallet functionality specifically correct?</p>
<p>PK and KK: Yes.</p>
<p>TS: What problem were you given to solve that led to the creation of the SDK?</p>
<p>KK: We had resources that were limited just to react native, and we really wanted to be able to target native applications and go from taking native applications and targeting other Frameworks like react native or flutter that can consume native code and get it all in one place and one solid API that everyone can work with.</p>
<p>PK: The alternative would be to use multiple other libraries across multiple different apps, like if they’re trying to use a different platform. So say they’re developing for Android native and iOS native they’ have to get two separate applications or libraries that don’t exactly always line up and so with ours it does line up across all of the platforms we support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>TS: What was your approach and how did you get started&nbsp; with the actual build?</p>
<p>KK: That was a lot, and we sat down for a long time with team leads and had a lot of discussion multiple meetings of what are we going to do, and I think originally we set out and we’re like “hey we’re gonna have to develop this in Kotlin for Android and Swift for iOS and we’re going to have to try to make sure that they mirror each other” and we ended up finding a solution where we could develop just in one code base and cross compile to another and that really made it a lot simpler for us to be able to have like a unified API or application interface so that everything was the same whether you are on Android or iOS developing and using this SDK.</p>
<p>TS: Are there any features you’re particularly proud of?&nbsp;</p>
<p>PK: One of the features about the SDK that I’m happy about, that we’ve recently done, is the react native rapper, because we were able to take our SDK and prove that it works in both IOS and Android react native. We were also able to create the API so that the SDK stays the same between Android iOS and react native, and so if you’re building a different application or using a different platform you only have to learn the SDK once and it stays the same. It’s really sweet.</p>
<p>KK: I’m particularly proud of the proofs module, proofs as far as a decentralized identity concept is a very difficult concept to develop for, and there are a lot of pitfalls that can come with it, and I feel like our solution to get there is fairly robust. It’s a little verbose on the end consumption, but it gives the user a lot of power for being able to submit proofs and fulfill proof requests, so I was pretty proud of getting that one through the finish line.</p>

  The FATF Travel Rule was implemented in the Philippines in February&nbsp;2021.  There is no minimum threshold in the Philippines for the Travel Rule to kick in, as originating and beneficiary VASPs must collect and share names and account numbers/unique reference numbers of their customers for all transactions.  The extent of information that VASPs are required to collect and share increases substantially when the value of crypto transactions exceeds ₱50,000 (about&nbsp;$893).  <p>In 2021, the Philippines joined the Asia-Pacific Group and became a member of FATF-Style Regional Bodies. The same year, Bangko Sentral NG Pilipinas (BSP), the country’s Central Bank, released <a href="https://www.bsp.gov.ph/Regulations/Issuances/2021/1108.pdf">Circular 1108</a> to provide guidelines for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), which included the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>With that, the FATF Travel Rule went into effect in February 2021 in the Philippines. As a result, crypto exchanges and service providers are now all required to follow the Philippines Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork/status/1742507280870822106">Image Source</a>)<p>This year, the Philippines has begun tightening Travel Rule requirements even further to strengthen the country’s AML and CFT measures against any illicit crypto transactions.</p> What is a VASP in the Philippines? <p>A VASP, according to BSP, is any entity that offers services facilitating the transfer or exchange of virtual assets and is involved in the following activities:</p>  Exchange between fiat currencies and virtual&nbsp;assets;  Exchange between different types of virtual&nbsp;assets;  Crypto transfer, and  Administration and/or safekeeping of crypto or instruments enabling control over&nbsp;crypto   Complying With the FATF Travel Rule in the Philippines <p>According to the country’s Central Bank, VASPs must share the following information with their corresponding VASPs for all crypto transactions, irrespective of the&nbsp;amount:</p>  Name  Account number or Unique reference number, if that is not available  <p>However, the extent of personally identifiable information that VASPs have to collect and share with their corresponding VASPs increases substantially when the amount of crypto transaction exceeds ₱50,000 (about&nbsp;$893).</p><p>In such cases, VASPs are required to collect and share the following information:</p>  Name  Physical address  Date &amp; place of&nbsp;birth.  Account number  <p>Additionally, originating and beneficiary VASPs must establish and actively adhere to strict sanction screening procedures. They must also screen all transacting parties against terrorist financing lists and adverse media&nbsp;reports.</p><p>Moreover, VASPs must perform necessary due diligence on the transfer of virtual assets to and from countries that haven’t implemented the FATF Travel Rule yet. They also have to exercise caution and perform enhanced due diligence when dealing with crypto transfers using unhosted&nbsp;wallets.</p> Global Context and Comparisons <p>The Travel Rule is part of a broader set of recommendations by the global anti-money laundering watchdog, the FATF, which included the Philippines in its ‘grey list.’ As a result of this, Southeast Asian countries like the Philippines have increased monitoring in order to maintain their trade relations and gain access to international finance.</p><p>Countries like the United Arab Emirates and Hong Kong, have already taken similar action and have tightened up regulations on the&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Meanwhile, several countries such as Singapore, Switzerland, Estonia, South Korea, Canada, Japan, the US, and the UK have also adopted the Crypto Travel Rule and require digital asset service providers to maintain customer information and establish procedures to ensure compliance with AML/CFT measures.</p><p>The Philippines’ Travel Rule threshold is in line with the FATF’s $1,000 limit and more or less in conformity with other countries. In Singapore, the threshold for collecting and recording sender and receiver information is SGD 1,500 (about $1,115), while in the United States, it’s $3,000. However, in Estonia and Malaysia, there’s no minimum amount requirement for gathering this information.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>While the Philippines has taken significant steps to align with international standards by implementing the FATF Travel Rule for cryptocurrency transactions, these regulations have sparked a debate about their&nbsp;impact.</p><p>By setting requirements for VASPs to collect and share detailed information on transactions, the country aims to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. However, the increasing regulatory measures, including the latest tightening of the Travel Rule, highlight the ongoing tension between ensuring financial security and maintaining the open, decentralized ethos of cryptocurrency.</p><p>This delicate balance continues to shape the landscape of crypto regulation both in the Philippines and around the world. Amid this, it’s crucial for both regulators and industry representatives to remember that user security and experience should always be a priority.</p> Frequently Asked Questions  Q1: What Are VASPs Required to Do Under the Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>They must collect and exchange personal information for transactions exceeding ₱50,000 (about&nbsp;$893).</p> Q2: Who Qualifies as a VASP in the Philippines? <p>Entities that facilitate the transfer or exchange of virtual assets, including exchanges between cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies.</p> Q3: What Happens if VASPs Fail to Follow the Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>They may face regulatory penalties, including fines and revocation of their operating license, for non-compliance with the BSP’s guidelines.</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

  <p>Like any other service, Microsoft Entra ID is not immune to human errors, accidental deletions, or malicious attacks that could result in the loss of important data. Therefore, it is essential to have a Microsoft Entra ID recovery strategy, especially for the objects that are hard deleted when removed from the service. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hard deletion means the object is permanently erased and cannot be restored by any means. The good news is that many objects support soft deletion, which means the object is marked as deleted in the service and moved to the recycle bin but not actually removed. The advantage of soft deletion is that the object can be recovered with its original configuration and dependencies, such as membership, assignments, and permissions, within 30 days. Therefore, it’s important to monitor and manage the soft-deleted objects in Microsoft Entra ID and decide whether to restore or permanently delete them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Users, Microsoft 365 Groups, (not security or distribution groups), and application registrations support soft deletion and can be restored using both the Microsoft Entra admin center and Microsoft Graph API. &nbsp; 
 Service principals and administrative units can also be restored from the recycle bin but only via the Microsoft Graph API.  &nbsp; 
 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s important to note that while synchronized user objects also support soft deletion, they should be backed up and restored at the source (Active Directory). Re-synchronization will automatically trigger the restoration of soft-deleted objects from the recycle bin. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
 Tracking deletions using Entra ID audit logs &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Every object deletion will trigger an event depending on the deletion type. For example, a soft-deleted user will trigger an event with the activity “Delete user” and a hard deletion will generate a “Hard Delete user” for a group that would be “Delete group” and “Hard Delete group” and so on, as shown in figure one below. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Microsoft Entra ID audit logs view</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the table below, delete, hard delete, and restore activities are listed for objects that support soft deletion, as they are seen in the audit log.  &nbsp;</p>

<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please also be mindful of the following when working with events in the audit log: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Notice minor differences in activity naming, as Kusto Query Language (KQL) is case sensitive. You might have unexpected results when using strict “==” equality operators. &nbsp; 
 For any object type that does not support soft deletion, only "Delete objectType" events will be logged, meaning a hard deletion. For example, Delete conditional access policy. &nbsp; 
 For some object types, there’s an option to perform operations in bulk, providing a .csv file as input. For such bulk operations, there are additional events logged for start and finish, but there are still individual events for every object on the list. For example, (started (bulk) / Bulk restore deleted users - finished (bulk)). &nbsp; 
 When a synchronized object is moved out of sync or deleted in Active Directory, then it will be soft deleted in Microsoft Entra ID with a corresponding event.   &nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Examples of queries for monitoring deletions with Microsoft Sentinel &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra ID works well with Microsoft Sentinel, our cloud-native security information and event management (SIEM), platform that is built on cloud technology and offers extensive threat detection and response features. If you use Microsoft Sentinel or Log Analytics to collect and analyze Microsoft Entra ID logs, here are some KQL query examples that can help you with investigating and alerting object deletion events from Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users that were soft deleted more than 25 days ago, will automatically be hard deleted soon:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
AuditLogs  
| where OperationName in ("Delete group", "Delete user", "Delete application", "Delete administrative unit",  "Remove service principal")  
| where TimeGenerated between (ago(29d) .. ago(25d))  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 50 objects hard deleted in the past 10 minutes:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
AuditLogs  
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(10m)  
| where OperationName in ("Hard Delete group", "Hard Delete user", "Hard Delete application", "Hard delete service principal")  
| summarize count()  
| where count_ &gt; 50  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>User deletion is followed by hard deletion:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
let queryfrequency = 1h;  
let queryperiod = 2h;  
AuditLogs  
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(queryfrequency)  
| where OperationName =~ "Hard Delete user"  
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
| project-rename HardDeletion_TimeGenerated = TimeGenerated  
| join kind=inner (  
    AuditLogs  
    | where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(1d)  
    | where OperationName =~ "Delete user"        
    | extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
    | project-rename SoftDeletion_TimeGenerated = TimeGenerated  
) on UserId  
| extend TimeDelta = HardDeletion_TimeGenerated - SoftDeletion_TimeGenerated  
| where  TimeDelta between (time(0s) .. queryperiod)  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The queries above are provided as examples, and real detection logic and thresholds will be different for each organization. One approach could be building a Sentinel workbook to visualize data and establish deletion/restoration/hard deletion baselines that will eventually help with the creation of detections. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Reviewing deleted objects &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Along with monitoring, it’s recommended to perform reviews of deleted objects. Reviews can be done regularly or prompted by some of the detection events discussed above. This can be done using the Microsoft Entra admin center, audit log-based queries, or Microsoft Graph API.&nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra admin center / Azure Portal&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easiest way to examine “recycle bins” for deleted users, groups, or applications is by administering Microsoft Entra ID in the Microsoft Entra <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#home">admin center</a> or Azure portal. However, this method has limitations, as the interface varies slightly depending on the object type, and for administrative units and service principals, there is no graphical experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: Deleted objects experience for users, groups, and applications</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Audit logs</p>
<p>Audit logs can also be used to generate a soft deleted items report that shows all the deleted objects for the last 30 days, excluding those that have already been restored or hard deleted.  &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s a sample query for User objects:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
let Users = AuditLogs  
| where TimeGenerated &gt; ago(30d)  
| where Category == "UserManagement";  
Users  
| where OperationName =~ "Delete user"        
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
| join kind=anti (  
Users  
| where OperationName =~ "Hard Delete user"  
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
) on UserId  
| join kind=anti (  
Users  
| where OperationName =~ "Restore user"  
| extend UserId = tostring(TargetResources[0].id)  
) on UserId  
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While audit logs is not a completely reliable method, they might be useful while building workbooks or reports. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Graph API</p>
<p>By calling the Microsoft Graph API using PowerShell and the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/Microsoft.Graph.Beta.Identity.DirectoryManagement/?view=graph-powershell-beta">Microsoft.Graph module, </a>you can get a list of all the objects currently in the recycle bin. The sample code below will generate a single report for all the object types, and when needed, it can be easily adjusted to perform restores using the Restore-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItem cmdlet. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph  
Connect-MgGraph   

$deletedUsers = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsUser  
$deletedServicePrincipals = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsServicePrincipal  
$deletedGroups = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsGroup  
$deletedApplications = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsApplication  
$deletedAUs = Get-MgBetaDirectoryDeletedItemAsAdministrativeUnit 

$deletedItems = @()  

$deletedItems += $deletedGroups  
$deletedItems += $deletedApplications  
$deletedItems += $deletedUsers  
$deletedItems += $deletedServicePrincipals  
$deletedItems += $deletedAUs  

if ($deletedItems.Count -eq 0) {  
    Write-Host "No soft deleted objects found." -ForegroundColor Green  
}  
else {  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Users: $($deletedUsers.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Service Principals: $($deletedServicePrincipals.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted M365 Groups: $($deletedGroups.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Applications: $($deletedApplications.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  
    Write-Host "Soft deleted Administrative Units: $($deletedAUs.Count)" -ForegroundColor Green  

    $report = foreach ($item in $deletedItems) {  
        $deletedDate = Get-Date($item.DeletedDateTime)  
        $now = Get-Date  
        $hardDeletedInDays = 30 - ($now - $deletedDate).Days  

        [PSCustomObject]@{  
            Id                  = $item.Id  
            UserPrincipalName   = $item.UserPrincipalName  
            DisplayName         = $item.DisplayName  
            Deleted             = $deletedDate  
            HardDeletionIn      = $hardDeletedInDays  
        }  
    }  
    $report | Sort-Object 'Display Name' | Select-Object Id, DisplayName, Deleted, HardDeletionIn | Format-Table   
    $report | Export-Csv -Path "C:\temp\softDeletedObjects.csv" -Encoding UTF8 -NoTypeInformation  
}

 Conclusion &nbsp; 
<p> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Tracking deletions in Microsoft Entra ID can be useful for several reasons. These include identifying and recovering any objects that were accidentally or maliciously deleted, to monitoring and auditing changes in the directory and ensuring compliance with security policies and regulations, and to optimizing license usage by removing any unnecessary or obsolete objects. Make sure to enable monitoring of deletions using queries above as a starting point and perform regular reviews of deleted items to be able to catch any potentially unwanted deletions while objects are still available for restoration.</p>

 Further Testing &amp; Enhancement Underway in Collaboration with VRS Provider Community <p>NEWTOWN, PA — February 22, 2024 — <a href="https://ledgerdomain.com/">LedgerDomain</a> and Spherity, leading providers in digital credentialing services, today announced results from their latest performance testing, exceeding the current<a href="https://www.oc-i.org/"> Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI)</a> requirements for the U.S. pharmaceutical supply chain under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA). Enacted in 2013, DSCSA requires end-to-end traceability for the vast majority of prescription drug products, preventing counterfeit or illegitimate products from reaching patients.</p><p>With OCI-compliant credentials, DSCSA stakeholders can digitally interact with each other, even if they have no prior business relationship and use different solution providers. These stakeholders include Authorized Trading Partners (ATPs) as defined by the statute (i.e. manufacturers, repackagers, wholesalers, 3PLs, and dispensers) alongside federal and state authorities and ATP Equivalents.</p><p>With 4.9 billion prescriptions filled in the U.S. each year, high performance is essential to ensuring supply chain resilience and security. In rigorous testing scenarios, both LedgerDomain and Spherity demonstrated performance speeds for their VP Generate and VP Verify API endpoints at least twice as fast as the baseline established by the OCI Digital Wallet Conformance Criteria. Under the OCI specification, both calls should average no more than 1500 milliseconds.</p><p>OCI-compliant credentials integrate with the Verification Router Service (VRS), a network designed to pass drug package verification requests between trading partners. As the recognized digital method for secure electronic message interoperability, OCI-compliant credentials also integrate with other channels, such as email and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for&nbsp;tracing.</p><p>Both LedgerDomain and Spherity continue to work closely with VRS partners to further enhance performance times to ensure real-time security and reliability. This broader effort in collaboration with VRS providers encompasses end-to-end performance.</p><p>“During the course of the current FDA Stabilization Period, solution providers are tuning up their systems to deliver the speed and reliability that the supply chain demands. We’re collaborating closely with our partners to resolve variations in end-to-end verification performance metrics as the VRS scales up through the spring.” — <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexcolgan?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAAYPCFwBxAVNlVQWIPRuC5SrU4qYiYIRJEQ&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BWkzq0kbvQEeBllraqJpiyA%3D%3D">Alex Colgan</a>, head of marketing and partnerships, LedgerDomain</p><p>“Interoperable networks like the VRS are only possible when all stakeholders pull together. We’re working hard to further scale our infrastructure with minimal latency and maximum throughput.” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chriswirrig/">Chris Wirrig</a>, customer success manager,&nbsp;Spherity</p><p>“Bringing enhanced drug distribution security under the DSCSA to life has been a decade-long effort, and the VRS is a cornerstone of this interoperable ‘system of systems.’ OCI-compliant credentialing adds a digital layer of secure authentication to the VRS, so that trading partners can exchange data with confidence.” — <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabethwaldorf?miniProfileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afs_miniProfile%3AACoAAACVUfMBzqFzp5bfWQydohbDTd2khyK2kLs&amp;lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_search_srp_all%3BhLO9w2ecSbCTnQPjw44S6w%3D%3D">Elizabeth Waldorf</a>, Director, Global Traceability and Standards, TraceLink</p><p>This progress comes ahead of the upcoming Healthcare Distribution Alliance (HDA) Distribution Management Conference (DMC) in March, where both LedgerDomain and Spherity will be present. For more information on the OCI DSCSA Interoperability Specification and its role in the pharmaceutical supply chain, visit <a href="https://www.oc-i.org/">oc-i.org</a>.</p><p>About LedgerDomain</p><p>LedgerDomain is a decentralized solutions provider focused on healthcare supply chain assurance and visibility. Their XATP solution enables trading partners including global enterprises, health centers, and independent pharmacists to comply with DSCSA requirements for authentication, enhanced verification, tracing, and saleable returns documentation — helping prescription drugs remain safe and effective for patients.</p><p>About Spherity</p><p>Spherity is a pioneer in decentralized identity and data sovereignty solutions. Their innovative technology focuses on solutions for industry use cases, that automate processes by digitizing company or product certificates and the exchange of sensitive industry data. Spherity is offering solutions for the US Pharma Industry, the global automotive industry, and has a special focus on Digital Product Passport Solutions for all ESPR-regulated product categories.</p><p>About OCI</p><p>The Open Credentialing Initiative (OCI) is a collaborative non-profit industry collaboration formed in April 2021 by a group of trading partners, solution providers, and standards organizations to support the pharmaceutical industry in adopting credentialing and digital wallet technologies to enhance supply chain security, and thus the protection of consumers.</p><p>Building on the DSCSA statute and FDA guidances, the Partnership for DSCSA Governance (PDG), GS1 US, Healthcare Distribution Alliance (HDA), and OCI are the organizations that have developed and published the business requirements, standards, and specifications that collectively define the DSCSA Enhanced Drug Distribution Security (EDDS) system. OCI provides open-source specifications built on interoperable standards defined by GS1, W3C, and NIST in close collaboration with industry stakeholders.</p><p>The OCI ecosystem is open to trading partners, solution providers, associations, standards bodies and others interested in contributing to future enhancements of the architecture and use&nbsp;cases.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/spherity/ledgerdomain-and-spherity-surpass-oci-performance-standards-in-latest-api-tests-4cf6fcd9ac23">Spherity and LedgerDomain Surpass OCI Performance Standards in Latest API Tests</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/spherity">Spherity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF78 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

  We’re excited to announce that the Bluesky network is federating and opening up in a way that allows you to host your own data.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>Today, we’re excited to announce that the Bluesky network is federating and opening up in a way that allows you to host your own data. What does this mean?</p>
<p>Your data, such as your posts, likes, and follows, needs to be stored somewhere. With traditional social media, your data is stored by the social media company whose services you've signed up for. If you ever want to stop using that company's services, you can do that—but you would have to leave that social network and lose your existing connections.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be this way! An alternative model is how the internet itself works. Anyone can put up a website on the internet. You can choose from one of many companies to host your site (or even host it yourself), and you can always change your mind about this later. If you move to another hosting provider, your visitors won't even notice. No matter where your site's data is managed and stored, your visitors can find your site simply by typing the name of the website or by clicking a link.</p>
<p>We think social media should work the same way. When you register on Bluesky, by default we'll suggest that Bluesky will store your data. But if you'd like to let another company store it, or even store it yourself, you can do that. You'll also be able to change your mind at any point, moving your data to another provider without losing any of your existing posts, likes, or follows. From your followers' perspective, your profile is always available at your handle—no matter where your information is actually stored, or how many times it has been moved.</p>
<p>Federation lets services be interconnected, so there are a variety of apps and experiences that users can move between as fluidly as they do on the open web. The version of federation that we’re releasing today is intended for self-hosters. There are some guardrails in place to ensure we can keep the network running smoothly for everyone in the ecosystem. After this initial phase, we’ll open up federation to people looking to run larger servers with many users. For a more technical overview of what we’re releasing today and how to participate, check out the <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/self-host-federation">developer blog</a>.</p>
<p>Some of our existing features already follow the federated philosophy, including <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-6-2023-domain-names-as-handles-in-bluesky">usernames</a> and <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/7-27-2023-custom-feeds">feeds</a>. Today, we’re opening up federation for data hosting. Below, we wanted to answer some common questions about what federated hosting is, what it means for your experience using Bluesky, and why we’re so excited about it.</p>
 How does this affect my experience on Bluesky? 
<p>The short answer is: it doesn’t! If you don’t run your own server, Bluesky will stay the same. Even if you do run your own server, you may be surprised by how little things change. In fact, it should feel so similar that you might have to double check that you’ve logged into the right server.</p>
<p>This is all intentional: we've made self-hosting your own data both easy and affordable, so when you do so, you should be able to get just as good (or better) of an experience than letting Bluesky host your data.</p>
 If my experience doesn’t change, why federate? 
<p>We set out to build a protocol for the future of social media that returns control to users. From the apps you use, the feeds you browse, or the moderation preferences you prefer, your experience on Bluesky is yours to customize. But the abundance of choice and innovation here will be short-lived if it’s dependent on one company. We think that the future of social media needs to be a public good, mutually owned by the people and companies that participate in it. Social media should be as open and reliable as the internet itself.</p>
<p>The ability to host your own data, just as you might run your own website, provides the fundamental guarantee that social media will never again be controlled by only one company. Even if Bluesky were to disappear, if the data is hosted across different sites, the network can be rebuilt. The fact that it requires no permission to set up a new website is what has made the open web such a dynamic and creative force. Larger services, like search engines, have come and gone (anyone remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ask.com">Ask Jeeves</a>?). But the underlying foundation of independently hosted sites continues to let the web evolve. Making social open in the same way will create a foundation for better public conversations.</p>
<p>Today, we’re taking another step towards the vision of a self-sustaining social web — social media that isn’t controlled by any single company and is free to evolve on its own terms.</p>
 Does this mean Bluesky is going to be like Mastodon? 
<p>Mastodon is another federated social network built on a protocol called ActivityPub. While Bluesky — built on a protocol called the AT Protocol (atproto) — shares the term “federation” with other networks, the way it works is very different.</p>
<p>On Bluesky, server choice doesn’t affect what content you see. Servers are only one piece of the protocol — when you browse Bluesky, you see posts that are pulled together from many different servers. This is why you can change your server after signing up without losing your username, friends, or posts.</p>
<p>A summary of some ways Bluesky differs from Mastodon:</p>
 
 A focus on the global conversation: On Mastodon, your “instance”, or server, determines your community, so your experience depends on which server you join. An instance can send and receive posts from other instances, but it doesn’t try to offer a global view of the network. Your Mastodon server is part of your username, and becomes part of your identity. On Bluesky, your experience is based on what feeds and accounts you follow, and you can always participate in the global conversation (e.g. breaking news, viral posts, and algorithmic feeds). You can use your own domain name as your username, and continue participating from anywhere your account is hosted. 
 Composable moderation: Moderation on Bluesky is not tied to your server, like it is on Mastodon. Defederation, a way of addressing moderation issues in Mastodon by disconnecting servers, is not as relevant on Bluesky because there are other layers to the system. Server operators can set rules for what content they will host, but tools like blocklists and moderation services are what help communities self-organize around moderation preferences. We’ve already integrated block and mute lists, and the tooling for independent moderation services is coming soon. 
 Composable feeds: We designed your timeline on Bluesky so that it’s not tied to your server. Anyone can build a feed, and there are currently over 40,000 algorithmic feeds to choose from. Your Mastodon timeline is only made up of posts from accounts you follow, and does not pull together posts from the whole network like Bluesky’s custom feeds. 
 Account portability: We designed federated hosting on Bluesky so that you can move servers easily. Moving hosting services should be like changing your cell phone provider —&nbsp;you should be able to keep your identity and data. Changing servers on Bluesky doesn’t disrupt your username, friends, or posts. 
 
 So how can I self-host and join the network? 
<p>It will become easier to host your own server over time, but at the moment you’ll need a bit of technical know-how to get up and running. If you’re excited to jump in, checkout the <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/self-host-federation">developer blog</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/pds">PDS repo</a> on our Github, and the <a href="https://discord.gg/UWS6FFdhMe">PDS Administrators Discord</a>.</p>

<p>January was a whirlwind month for SpruceID, as we dove headfirst into a series of impactful events, each shedding light on the evolving landscape of digital identity and its implications for society.<br><br>Let's take a moment to recap the highlights from our events throughout January.</p> January 17th: Cyber &amp; Digital Identity Innovation Capitol Hill Day <p>The start of our year kicked off with Cyber &amp; Digital Identity Innovation Capitol Hill Day in DC, an event organized by Okta Ventures that explored the intersection of AI, cybersecurity, and government service delivery.<br><br>Our CEO, Wayne Chang, was at the forefront, participating in a CEO panel discussion about restoring citizen trust in government institutions. Alongside Karine Mellata of Intrinsic AI and Matt Chiodi of Cerby, Wayne articulated SpruceID's commitment to empowering users to control their data on the web, a mission deeply intertwined with rebuilding faith in governmental processes. <br><br>SpruceID also had a booth at the conference where we had the opportunity to engage one-on-one with staffers interested in learning more about verifiable digital credentials.<br><br>We were honored to have kicked off our year with this exciting event, where we were able to help educate congressional staffers on digital identity, the risks of AI related to identity, and network with others in the space.</p> January 19th: New York State Digital Identity Roundtable <p>Next on our agenda was the New York State Digital Identity Roundtable, a thought-provoking forum delving into the landscape of digital identity in New York. The event was organized by Assemblywoman Solages, who sponsored Bill A01018 which paves the way for mobile driver's licenses in New York.<br><br>SpruceID CEO Wayne Chang opened the event with an overview of digital credentials, the risks and privacy concerns that should be considered, and the importance of verifiable digital identity with the increased sophistication of AI impersonations.<br><br>Round table participants, including members of the New York government, leading tech companies, and multiple privacy-oriented and civil liberties organizations, posed crucial questions surrounding privacy, security, and inclusivity in the digital identity landscape.<br><br>From concerns about bias and exclusion to discussions about democratic oversight, the conversations during this roundtable underscored the need for robust, transparent frameworks to guide the deployment of digital identity solutions. We were honored to participate in this roundtable and look forward to continuing the conversation on many of these important issues.</p> January 25th: Milan Digital Identity Observatory Workshop <p>Rounding out our month was the Digital Identity Observatory Workshop, a collaborative event to help chart the course for the future of digital identity. CIOs and digital transformation executives from leading European multinational corporations converged in Milan to explore emerging trends, opportunities, and challenges with verifiable digital identity. Through discussions and interactive sessions, participants charted a path forward grounded in privacy, security, and user empowerment principles.<br><br>SpruceID joined virtually with a brief presentation from Wayne Chang, SpruceID CEO, recapping our digital identity tech, national and global trends, and emerging best practices and use cases for verifying digital credentials in business workflows.<br><br>As we look ahead, SpruceID remains committed to driving the conversation around digital identity, advocating for solutions that prioritize the rights and well-being of individuals in an increasingly digital world.</p> Stay Tuned for What’s Next! <p>January was a busy month of community engagement and thought leadership for SpruceID. As we reflect on the insights gained and connections made during last month’s events, we remain eager in our mission to build a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions. Stay tuned for more updates as we join in on more exciting events in the coming months.<br></p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p><p></p>

<p>We are thrilled to announce this partnership between Holochain and <a href="https://rainlang.xyz/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Rainlang</a>. While we have been interwoven efforts for some time, making it official before heading to <a href="http://ethdenver.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ETHDenver 2024</a> feels like an important step forwards in our collaboration.</p><p>What is Rainlang? Rainlang is a framework that aims to simplify smart contracts and make them more accessible to a wider audience. The aim of making smart contracts accessible to everyone comes from the belief that accessibility is the difference between theoretical and practical decentralization.</p><p>By combining Holochain’s framework for building peer-to-peer apps with Rainlang’s easy to use smart contracts, new groundbreaking solutions in the Web3 space are possible, unleashing opportunities and possibilities for developers, enterprises, and users alike.</p> Fullstack DeFi <p>DeFi has exploded in recent years, but it is still a challenging space, accessible to the few, not the many. Rainlang’s work to make smart contracts more legible is an important step to democratizing this space. But there are still hurdles.&nbsp;</p><p>When we interact with smart contracts, we usually do so through a website. This is a point of centralization that introduces several risks, from phishing to DNS hacks. Plus, nothing stops a website from being taken down, either by the company running it or by a government, DDOS attack, or otherwise. The solution? Truly distributed applications, running on your device, interacting as a network of peers. This is what Holochain provides to DeFi, the opportunity for the infrastructure supporting the EVM to also be decentralized, secure, and verifiable.&nbsp;</p> Orderbook <p><a href="https://docs.rainlang.xyz/orderbook/introduction/?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Rain Orderbook</a> is an on-chain orderbook contract that enables users to deploy complex strategies for managing token trades. Using Holochain, the Rainlang team is building a decentralized platform where Orderbook users can share draft trading strategies, simulations, tests of strategies, and even raw financial data. This will make the trading tools of Orderbook more accessible as a community grows around them.&nbsp;</p><p>Building this platform on Holochain enables a collaborative platform that runs directly on user’s devices without data sitting on a third party server. This is a truly decentralized stack that maintains options for privacy where trading groups can make private spaces to share their trading strategies etc. With this user centric design that provides security from many common hacks in the crypto space, we can start to see new potential for Web3.</p> Holochain Apps Using Rainlang <p>For the last several months we have been experimenting with integrating Rainlang contracts into the stack of Holochain applications. <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/fractal-tribute-bridging-blockchains-and-holochain/">Fractal Tribute</a> demonstrated a Rainlang contract on the Polygon EVM, connected to a Holochain application where users played a collaborative art game. Holo was used to provide read-only access to the game, both for <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/fractal-tribute-nov-2?ref=blog.holochain.org">OpenSea</a> to access the art and for a website that allowed for public viewership of the game. </p><p>This is just one demonstration of how Rainlang can be used to connect Holochain apps to the blockchain. We are excited to see what others develop — pairing the financial markets and global consensus of EVMs with the agent-centric networks of Holochain. </p><p>We have more in the works. In the meantime, <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/augmenting-nfts-with-holochain/">read about more of the solutions we envision</a>, and maybe we’ll see you at <a href="http://ethdenver.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">ETHDenver 2024</a>?</p>

<p>In our digital era, presentation, and injection biometric attacks pose an unprecedented threat to the sanctity of identity verification. As we navigate a landscape increasingly dependent on digital transactions, the looming menace of AI-generated deepfakes demands innovative strategies to combat identity fraud. Gartner Analysts Akif Khan and Swati Rakeja affirm this urgency, stating, “Identity verification leaders must understand this emerging threat and take a proactive approach to secure their solutions*.”</p>
<p>*Emerging Tech: The Impact of AI and Deepfakes on Identity Verification – Akif Khan and Swati Rakeja</p>
<p>Presentation attacks, also known as spoofing or imitation attacks, involve attempts to deceive biometric authentication systems using fake biometric samples, such as photos, videos, or other replicas of the genuine user. With the advent of deepfakes, the methods used to detect presentation attacks have become outdated as many deepfake videos are very well created to be presented as a live video, with great rendering of an attacker superimposing their image on a live video.</p>
<p>One way to identify genuine users and prevent presentation attacks, like deepfakes, is through “liveness detection.” Liveness detection helps distinguish between genuine, live individuals and manipulated synthetic representations. Here’s how liveness detection helps identify users:</p>
 
 Dynamic Movement Recognition: Liveness detection systems analyze the dynamic aspects of facial expressions, eye movements, and other micro-expressions that occur naturally in live subjects. 
 Response to Stimuli: Liveness detection may involve prompting the user to perform specific actions or respond to stimuli during verification. 
 3D Depth Analysis: Liveness detection often utilizes advanced techniques like 3D depth analysis. By assessing the three-dimensional aspects of facial features, the system can verify the spatial relationships between different facial elements, making it harder for static images or videos to pass as authentic. 
 Texture and Reflection Analysis: Liveness detection examines surface characteristics such as texture and reflections on the face. Natural skin has unique textures and reflects light in specific ways that may be hard to emulate. 
 
<p>All these technology components have been embedded across various liveness detection engines and have effectively prevented a “Presentation Attack” often used to game the system. Most deepfake attacks happen when an attacker injects a fraudulent video to game the liveness detection engine. There are usually three types of injection attacks that occur:</p>
 
 Virtual H/W Camera Injections: Utilizing a virtual camera instead of a real camera to submit a photo or video. Software like Manycams is used to do this. 
 JavaScript Injections: Utilizing browser console to inject spooﬁng JavaScript code to be run instead of existing one on the webpage 
 Client Server Protocol Injections: A fraudster breaks the data channel between the browser and server or Classic IT infrastructure “Man in the Middle” type of attack. 
 
 Defeating Presentation Attacks with 1Kosmos 
<p>1Kosmos responds to this challenge with LiveID and LiveID+. LiveID leverages the front-facing camera on the mobile device (selfie camera) and records a video of the user. Once LiveID has determined the user is genuine, through a liveness check, LiveID will capture a “selfie” of the user and use it as a biometric reference for authentication. LiveID+ is an advanced SDK client-side solution. By actively identifying and thwarting injection attacks in real time, LiveID+ sets a new standard for security, offering robust protection against the deceptive tactics of deepfakes.</p>
<p>Adding additional capabilities to LiveID with LiveID+ allows organizations to prevent this growing attack vector. The new client-side SDK will catch injection attacks and not permit any identity proofing or authentication attempt if an injection attack is detected.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The advent of deepfake technology poses a formidable challenge to identity verification processes. As our digital transactions surge and passwordless biometrics become mainstream, the threat from AI-generated deepfakes will become more pronounced. Liveness detection is a good way of combating presentation attacks. However, the evolution of more sophisticated injection attacks, especially those utilizing injection techniques, necessitates innovative security measures like LiveID and LiveID+.</p>

We talked about his experience building and leading the Sovrin Foundation, which at one point was almost synonymous with the term self-sovereign identity. It was set up to be an identity metasystem that would reinvent how identity was done online… and we talk about why it didn’t end up becoming that.</p><p>Phil shares lessons from identity systems that got adopted, like the social login metasystem, as well as from things that didn’t get a lot of adoption, like certain identity blockchains and information cards a decade prior.

 An Anatomy of&nbsp;Hype Image generated by&nbsp;Dell-E-2<p>Writing 310 years ago, the essayist Jonathan Swift had this to say on the art of political lying.</p><blockquote>“It often happens, that if a lie be believed only for an hour, it hath done its work, and there is no further occasion for it. Falsehood flies, and truth comes limping after it, so that when men come to be undeceived, it is too&nbsp;late.”</blockquote><p>Swift’s essay was about how clever, devious people use political lies to get their way, leaving a trail of damage behind&nbsp;them.</p><p>Enter a new political lie about artificial intelligence and NHS&nbsp;data.</p><p>It’s the usual breathless stuff. “The world is undergoing the fastest technological and scientific revolution in the whole history of human civilisation, with profound implications for the United Kingdom,” gush former prime minister Tony Blair and former leader of the Conservative Party William Hague in <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/75ila1cntaeh/3pN0p29FVT0XV1FV9Up4MV/d2eaa86f106369827c3eed1b113c92ff/Tony_Blair_Institute_A_New_National_Purpose_-_Leading_the_Biotech_Revolution_January_2024.pdf">a new report</a>&nbsp;.</p><p>“The challenge of responding to that revolution is so urgent, the danger of falling behind so great and the opportunities so exciting that we urged all political parties to make their response to it nothing short of creating a new national purpose. We set out how the UK could harness the power of technology and reimagine the state and public services by restructuring Whitehall, making better use of&nbsp;data”.</p><p>If ‘weapons of mass destruction’ was the political lie that achieved the objective of regime change (the overthrow of Saddam Hussein), here we have a new type of regime change in sight: deposing health data as a public and personal asset and its mass transfer to the control and benefit of Big&nbsp;Tech.</p> The hype&nbsp;machine <p>Hype is the main tool of the political lie. The trick with hype is to set an agenda by mesmerising people with AMAZING Opportunities!!! while deflecting their attention from on-the-ground realities until they can’t be avoided any&nbsp;more.</p><p>Here are some of the detailed tricks of skilful political lier.</p>  Present one small part — the part you are trying to promote — as if it is the whole picture, ignoring everything that doesn’t fit into your carefully crafted&nbsp;agenda.  Exaggerate the benefits of what you are proposing to the nth&nbsp;degree.  Skim over all its flaws, inconsistencies, risks and loopholes. (Make sure you mention them briefly to give the appearance that you have thought about them, but only to brush them aside as minor, technical details to be sorted out&nbsp;later.)  Use small elements of truth to tell the big&nbsp;lie.  Craft the way you present your arguments so that the conclusions you arrive at are inevitable, given the assumptions you’ve smuggled in along the&nbsp;way.  <p>Tony Blair’s agenda for an NHS data landgrab is a good case study of hype in the service of a political lie.</p> Present a part as the&nbsp;whole <p>If you believe Tony Blair, the future of the NHS — indeed the competitiveness of the country as a whole (!) — depends on the UK taking a lead in AI (see ‘exaggeration’ below). Taking the lead in AI depends on amassing huge amounts of data to train this AI&nbsp;… which means that we simply have to hand over the nation’s health data to the Big Data experts — the Big Tech monopolies.</p><p>Tony Blair writes as if the insights generated by such AI will transform the provision of health and care services. This is nonsense.</p><p>Setting AI to work on big data sets does nothing to change those areas where treatments are already well developed and understood. It does nothing to improve the operational delivery of these treatments. In other words, it will not and cannot touch most of what the NHS actually does, day-to-day. Neverthless, it is being presented as if it is the answer to everything.</p><p>In reality, what the NHS needs to transform itself — to cut costs while improving quality — lies at the opposite end of the data spectrum. It lies in new data logistics capabilities: the ability to get exactly the right personal data to and from the right people at the right times, safely and efficiently, in a privacy protecting way.</p><p>Better data logistics enables better physical logistics — improving the ways in which work is organised; finding ways to reduce time and effort spent while improving outcomes. It’s about the practical, detailed work that takes place on the front line. Nothing to do with the statistical analysis of big sets of&nbsp;data.</p><p>But nowhere in his 72 page report does Mr Blair give this very real opportunity a single mention (or, for that matter, in any of his previous reports). After all, the whole point of the magician with his conjuring trick is to focus peoples’ attention on your trickery; to deflect their attention from what’s really going on behind the&nbsp;scenes.</p> Exaggerate the&nbsp;benefits <p>According to Tony Blair, Artificial Intelligence is “so urgent and important that how we respond is more likely than anything else to determine Britain’s future.” Wow! We had better drop everything else then! Focus everything we’ve got on&nbsp;it!</p><p>But this too is nonsense. AI will never water the Sahara, achieve world peace, feed the hungry or solve the challenge of Climate&nbsp;Change.</p><p>AI currently takes two main forms: machine learning techniques such as genetic algorithms and Large Language Processing models like&nbsp;ChatGPT.</p><p>The machine learning form of AI is very good at identifying patterns and correlations in huge amounts of data. That’s great. It can be a useful tool within a well managed research&nbsp;process.</p><p>But&nbsp;… er&nbsp;… that’s about&nbsp;it.</p><p>One drawback of this form of AI is that while it is very good at spotting correlations, a high proportion of them are meaningless false positives. To make things worse, spotting correlations has got nothing to do with understanding causation. Confusing correlation with causation can — and has already — set many damaging hares&nbsp;running.</p><p>Also, this form of AI is bound by the ancient ‘GIGO’ law of computing: Garbage In, Garbage Out. Machine learning outputs are only as good as the data they’ve been trained with (by humans), and very often this data is not very good. In fact, for almost every issue that a machine learning AI is set to work on, there is far more information out there in the world that is not contained in its training sets. This means the ‘insights’ it generates are always partial and contingent.</p><p>In addition, because of the way it works, there is no audit trail as to how it arrives at its conclusions (and it may arrive at different conclusions if it crunches the same set of data a second time). On top of this, no matter how good the analytics might be, what happens in the real world depends entirely on how any resulting actions are implemented. Which has got nothing to do with&nbsp;AI.</p><p>So machine learning isn’t half as transformational as people like Blair are making it out to be. Not by a very long&nbsp;shot.</p><p>The other Large Language Processing sort of AI (the one that drives ChatGPT and its rivals) works by brute number crunching. It analyses previous bits of text (that it has been fed with by humans) to calculate the most probable next letter in a word and the most probable next word in a sentence. It doesn’t understand the meaning of anything it spews&nbsp;out.</p><p>This sort of AI is quite good at providing summaries of conventional wisdoms (e.g. the words used in texts that have already been generated by&nbsp;humans).</p><p>But&nbsp;… er&nbsp;… that’s about&nbsp;it.</p><p>It has no awareness of ideas or information that are not in the data sets it has been trained with. It cannot use its (non-existent) understanding of content to produce any new ideas. Meanwhile, because it works only by brute number crunching without any idea of meaning, it can and does invent ‘facts’ and ‘statements’ that are simply untrue — what AI practitioners call ‘hallucinations’. So, yes, it can be useful for students wanting to cheat with essays or consultants wanting to streamline their report-writing. But change how the real world actually works? Not&nbsp;really!</p><p>AI is just another of a long line of tech bubbles. They all have a common pattern. The promoter’s trick is to dazzle people with promises of wondrous change tomorrow&nbsp;… to undertake a landgrab of today’s available resources. It’s worked many times before, and it’s being tried again&nbsp;here.</p> Skim over the flaws and&nbsp;risks <p>The trick here is to present something that is extremely difficult and fraught with risk as if it were safe and easy. This way, people aren’t put off by a realistic assessment of what’s really involved in making it&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Tony Blair’s papers are a masterpiece of such skating on thin ice. He tells us that we don’t have to worry about privacy because all the data will be anonymised. But he doesn’t provide any chapter or verse as to how this will actually work, or if (for example) this data could be de-anonymised as quickly and easily as it was anonymised.</p><p>Meanwhile, many of the promises he makes are based not on the use of anonymised data for statistical analysis but on extreme personalisation. “Over the coming decades,” he says, “AI systems will be created that can understand each individual’s composition and lifestyle, and harness that information to provide highly personalised lifestyle and treatment suggestions on demand, with little marginal cost for each additional patient.” How is that going to work if the data is anonymised?</p><p>Most of his proposals are aimed at giving ‘researchers’ access to data about people. But he never defines what a bona fide researcher is. Cambridge Analytica could have passed themselves off as ‘researchers’.</p><p>Research, he tells us, “serves a dual purpose; it is both a public service enabling technological advances and a commercial opportunity.” He makes a big fuss about the NHS being able to ‘sell’ our data to the private sector, thereby helping to fund the NHS. Really? What proportion of the NHS budget would it cover? And how exactly will this commercial opportunity be realised? By Big Tech companies using NHS data to generate new treatments, and then draining the NHS of cash in charges for access to these treatments?</p><p>Nowhere are such questions worked through. All skimming. All about making it sound both wonderful and easy. All skating on very thin ice&nbsp;indeed.</p> Use a small element of truth to tell a big&nbsp;like <p>For hype to be credible it has to contain an element of truth. People have to be able to recognise what it says and say to themselves “Yes! That makes sense!” As soon as you get their heads nodding you can use their agreement to lure them into the much bigger lie that lies behind your truth-hook.</p><p>Tony Blair’s reports use this trick often. For example, he writes that today’s fragmented system of data collection prevents researchers from “understanding how different features of a patient — their lifestyle, genetics, personality and physiology — relate to one another”. Absolutely spot on. According to the World Health Organisation, 60% of related factors to individual health and quality of life are correlated to lifestyle. And he’s right. Today’s fragmented approach to data collection and use makes it impossible to join the necessary data&nbsp;dots.</p><p>This is why individuals need personal data stores, so that they can collect all this data safely. So it can be used under their control, for their&nbsp;benefit.</p><p>But that, of course, is not what he suggests. The undeniable truth of data fragmentation is just a useful hook to sell his bigger lie. Fragmentation, he continues, “is limiting efforts to generalise beyond the subjects studied and holding back the transformative potential of AI.” (Back to presenting a small part of the picture as if it were the whole). Therefore, rather than addressing this fragmentation by empowering individuals with their own data, we should build a massive new centralised database&nbsp;… and hand it over to Big&nbsp;Tech.</p> Assumption smuggling <p>This entire campaign is based on a particular set of assumptions. A paradigm. This paradigm tells us that wealth can only be created by private companies making products which they sell in markets using money&nbsp;prices.</p><p>But the NHS is living proof that the ‘firms-products-prices-markets-profits’ paradigm is not the only way to create wealth and deliver value. That’s why the Big Tech companies and free market ideologues hate it so much. Because it doesn’t fit into their mental straitjacket and doesn’t serve their vested interests. It’s why all these reports’ recommendations are framed in terms of markets and monetisation: selling (not sharing) the data; ‘commercial opportunities’ (not public service); ‘competitiveness’ (who on earth is the NHS actually ‘competing’ with?)</p><p>The end result is downright insulting. “Countries that are home to frontier laboratories not only provide cutting-edge training but also exert a powerful pull for the next generation of top entrepreneurs, researchers and other globally mobile talent,” the report declares. So what about the millions of people who are not ‘top entrepreneurs, researchers and other globally mobile talent’? In other words, what about the people who actually deliver the service, day in and day out? Clearly, for the hype merchants they amount to&nbsp;nothing.</p> Conclusion <p>Tony Blair’s reports are not particularly unique or special. They are one of a genre, all of which display the same core characteristics. They&nbsp;display:</p>  unquestioning obedience to the mythology that monetisation and markets are the only way to create&nbsp;wealth  a studied indifference to the day-to-day operational realities of actually providing services  endless displacement activity that obsesses with The New! And The Cool!!! where the further they are away from day-to-day operational realities the&nbsp;better  barely disguised contempt for the people who actually produce and use the services in&nbsp;question  all for the promotion of the barely-concealed agenda of asset stripping to line the pockets of the already rich and&nbsp;powerful  <p>All bandwagons flourish by presenting a part as if it were the whole, by exaggerating the part’s benefits and by making light of the difficulties. Bandwagoneers use this heady mix to manipulate people to their own ends — to spread political lies. Today, the message that ‘AI is our saviour’ is one such political lie.</p><p>We ended our last blog on <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/beware-a-new-data-bandwagon-is-rolling-5eebf8501a42">the NHS data bandwagon</a> by saying the people of this country deserve better than this. They do. They deserve and need to be equipped with their own data and data tools to make their lives better — not to have their data and tools to be handed over to parasitic monopolists.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/ai-an-anatomy-of-hype-be617e1d65a9">AI — An Anatomy of Hype</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Metadium Website Update&nbsp;Details <p>Dear Community,</p><p>We are pleased to announce the launch of our newly revamped website. This website update is part of our ongoing efforts to implement the new Metadium plans and reflect the growth and vision for&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Since the teaser release of Metadium 2.0, we have been diligently establishing concrete timelines for roadmap execution and striving to develop a more secure and reliable manner. Metadium 2.0 aims to expand the ecosystem by leveraging decentralized identity (DID) for enhanced security and prioritizing user protection.</p><p>Following the announcement of the 2.0 version, we have continuously progressed in bolstering the technical infrastructure to support the ecosystem. Various policies and technological mechanisms have been considered for this leap forward, overcoming numerous challenges during the development and testing phases. We now have all the foundational technologies to move forward into the new ecosystem, prompting us to renew our commitment to Metadium and convey a fresh perspective to our many observers.</p><p>Since the completion of Metadium version 1.0, the initial ecosystem has been established, and successful experiences have been gained. Subsequently, efforts have been made to develop the technical foundation to support the expanded ecosystem with the release of version 2.0. Various policies and technological mechanisms have been considered in these efforts, and overcoming numerous variables has been necessary throughout the development and testing&nbsp;process.</p><p>From our experiences and feedback, Metadium has laid the groundwork for how the 2.0 version will contribute to building and advancing a better ecosystem. We are now fully prepared for the next leap forward, and we would like to express our gratitude to our many observers for their support and convey a new mindset as we move&nbsp;forward.</p><p>As the first step in Metadium’s new journey, we are pleased to introduce the revamped official website and our new&nbsp;goals.</p> Purpose of&nbsp;Renewal <p>There are several reasons why Metadium is redesigning its token&nbsp;economy:</p><p>Firstly, the blockchain and cryptocurrency markets are undergoing rapid changes. While generating revenue from a single platform used to be expected, the goal now is to connect different platforms to create a stable consensus structure and provide services.</p><p>Secondly, in the early days of the blockchain market, there were efforts to secure users by indiscriminately providing incentives. However, user motivation could have been smoother despite these efforts, necessitating improvements. Therefore, there is a shift towards paying ecosystem maintenance costs to users who contribute to the ecosystem, providing a better reward structure or usage&nbsp;method.</p><p>Thirdly, the Metadium blockchain has seen an increase in transaction volume proportional to the number of users based on various services. Continuous efforts are being made to improve this and maintain network security.</p><p>Furthermore, the project’s goals have changed. Previously, Metadium’s Identity Layer made efforts to penetrate the market, but now the goal is to adopt a verifiable structure within Metadium and across heterogeneous blockchains.</p><p>Lastly, Metadium aims to design a system where users can contribute to the ecosystem and receive rewards by increasing ecosystem volume and creating an environment where user tokens can be meaningfully used.</p><p>For these various reasons, Metadium has decided to renew its token&nbsp;economy.</p> Contents of Renewed&nbsp;Website <p>The new Metadium website has been transformed to reflect a fresh vision, aiming to provide users with a better experience through various improvements.</p><p>Firstly, the new website offers optimized screens for users regardless of their device, accompanied by design enhancements. It ensures smooth accessibility on desktops, mobile devices, and tablets. The website includes a developer and documentation center and diverse media content, allowing users to access essential information about the project, applications, and ecosystem intuitively and promptly.</p><p>Users can now quickly access news and updates, with Metadium’s latest achievements reflected on the new homepage. Furthermore, information about partners and clients has been updated and provided.</p><p>The introduction to Metadium has been reinforced, emphasizing the project’s motto. Additionally, to aid understanding, the DID process has been added to help users grasp Metadium more&nbsp;easily.</p><p>Moreover, the existing roadmap has been transformed into a vision map to emphasize the expansive future value of Metadium&nbsp;further.</p><p>In this manner, the new Metadium website renewal has been improved to enhance user experience and communicate a new&nbsp;vision.</p><p>-</p><p>Metadium promises to continue striving to enhance user usability and provide even more diverse content in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>We hope you are pleased with the newly revamped Metadium and kindly request your ongoing interest and&nbsp;support.</p><p>We sincerely appreciate your continuous interest and support for Metadium.</p><p>- Metadium&nbsp;Team</p><p>안녕하세요. 메타디움&nbsp;팀입니다.</p><p>메타디움의 웹사이트가 새롭게 변경되었다는 소식을 알려드립니다. 이번 홈페이지 업데이트는 새로운 메타디움 계획의 일환으로 이루어진 작업으로, 메타디움의 성장과 2024년 비전맵을 위한 발전을 나타내고&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>메타디움은 2.0 티저 공개 이후, 2023년에 로드맵 실행을 위해 구체적인 일정을 수립하고 더욱 안전하고 신뢰성 있는 메인넷으로 발전하기 위한 노력을 계속해왔습니다. 메타디움 2.0은 신원인증에 분산신원인증(DID)을 활용하여 보안성을 강화하고, 사용자 보호를 최우선에 두는 메인넷으로서 생태계를 확장해 나갈&nbsp;계획입니다.</p><p>메타디움은 2.0 버전 발표 이후 생태계를 뒷받침할 기술 기반에 대한 노력을 지속적으로 진행해왔습니다. 새로운 도약을 위해 다양한 정책과 기술적 메커니즘이 고려되었으며, 개발과 테스트를 거치는 과정에서도 다양한 변수들을 극복해야 했습니다. 이제는 새로운 생태계로 나아가기 위한 기반 기술을 모두 갖추었다고 판단하여, 메타디움을 관심 가지고 지켜보시는 많은 분들께 새로운 마음가짐을 전달하기 위해 리뉴얼을 결정하게&nbsp;되었습니다.</p><p>메타디움은 1.0 버전을 완료하면서 초기 생태계를 구축하고 성공적인 경험을 쌓았습니다. 그 후 2.0 버전을 발표하며 확장될 생태계를 뒷받침할 기술적 기반에 대한 노력을 진행해왔습니다. 이러한 노력 속에서 다양한 정책과 기술적 메커니즘이 고려되었고, 개발과 테스트를 거치는 과정에서는 수많은 변수들을 극복해야&nbsp;했습니다.</p><p>우리는 그 동안의 경험과 피드백을 바탕으로 메타디움이 2.0 버전을 통해 어떻게 더 나은 생태계를 구축하고 발전시킬 것인지에 대한 기반 기술을 갖추었습니다. 이제는 새로운 도약을 위한 준비를 모두 마친 시점이며, 메타디움을 지켜보고 계신 많은 분들께, 과거의 성과에 대한 감사함과 함께 미래로 나아가는 새로운 마음가짐을 전달하고자&nbsp;합니다.</p><p>메타디움의 새로운 여정, 그 첫 걸음으로 메타디움의 새 목표와 함께 리뉴얼된 공식 웹사이트를&nbsp;소개합니다.</p> 리뉴얼 목적 <p>메타디움의 토큰 경제(Token Economy)를 새롭게 설계하는 이유에는 여러 가지 이유가&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>첫째, 블록체인과 암호화폐 시장은 현재 급격한 변화를 겪고 있습니다. 이전에는 단일 플랫폼에서 수익을 창출하는 것이 일반적이었지만, 이제는 거대 플랫폼에 다른 플랫폼을 연결하여 안정적인 합의 구조와 서비스를 제공하는 것이&nbsp;목표입니다.</p><p>둘째, 초기에는 블록체인 시장에서는 인센티브를 무분별하게 지급하여 사용자를 확보하려는 노력이 있었습니다. 하지만 이러한 노력에도 불구하고 사용자의 동기부여가 원활하지 못했고, 이에 대한 개선이 필요했습니다. 따라서 생태계에 공헌하는 사용자를 위해 더 나은 보상 구조나 활용 방식을 제공하기 위해 생태계 유지비용을 지불하는 방식으로 발전하고&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>셋째, 메타디움 블록체인은 다양한 서비스를 기반으로 하여 사용자 수에 비례하여 트랜잭션 량이 증가하였습니다. 이에 대한 개선과 네트워크의 안전성을 유지하기 위한 지속적인 노력이 이루어지고&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>또한, 프로젝트의 목표가 변화하였습니다. 이전에는 메타디움 Identity Layer가 시장에 녹아들기 위한 노력을 하였지만, 이제는 이종 블록체인 간의 Identity Layer를 공유하고, 메타디움 자체뿐만 아니라 다른 블록체인에서도 검증 가능한 구조를 채택하고자&nbsp;합니다.</p><p>마지막으로, 사용자들이 생태계에 기여하여 보상을 받을 수 있는 시스템을 설계하기 위해 Ecosystem 물량을 늘리고, 사용자가 얻은 토큰이 유의미하게 사용될 수 있는 환경을 구성하고자&nbsp;합니다.</p><p>이렇게 다양한 이유로 메타디움은 토큰 경제를 리뉴얼하게&nbsp;되었습니다.</p> 공식 웹사이트 리뉴얼&nbsp;내용 <p>메타디움의 새로운 웹사이트 리뉴얼은 새로운 비전을 반영하여 새로운 모습으로 변화했습니다. 사용자들에게 더 나은 경험을 제공하기 위해 다양한 측면에서&nbsp;개선되었습니다.</p><p>먼저, 새로운 웹사이트는 디자인 개선과 함께 사용자들이 어떤 기기를 사용하더라도 최적화된 화면을 제공합니다. 데스크톱, 모바일 및 태블릿에서 모두 원활하게 이용할 수 있습니다. 또한, 웹사이트에는 개발자 및 문서 센터와 함께 다양한 미디어 컨텐츠도 포함되어 있어 사용자들은 프로젝트, 애플리케이션, 에코시스템에 대한 필수 정보를 직관적이고 신속하게 접근할 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>뉴스와 업데이트를 더욱 신속하게 확인할 수 있으며, 메타디움의 최신 성과도 새로운 메인 페이지에 반영되었습니다. 또한, 파트너와 고객사에 대한 정보도 최신화되어 제공되고&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>메타디움 소개 내용은 더욱 강화되었으며, 메타디움의 모토도 강조되었습니다. 또한, 이해를 돕기 위해 DID 프로세스가 추가되어 사용자들은 더욱 쉽게 메타디움을 이해할 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>또한, 기존의 로드맵은 비전맵으로 변경되어 메타디움의 확장적인 미래 가치를 더욱 강조하고자&nbsp;했습니다.</p><p>이렇게 메타디움의 새로운 웹사이트 리뉴얼은 사용자 경험을 향상시키고 새로운 비전을 전달하기 위해 다양한 측면에서&nbsp;개선되었습니다.</p><p>-</p><p>메타디움은 앞으로도 유저 사용성을 높이고 더욱 다양한 콘텐츠를 제공해드리기 위해 노력할 것을 약속&nbsp;드립니다.</p><p>새롭게 단장한 메타디움의 모습이 여러분 마음에 드셨으면&nbsp;좋겠습니다.</p><p>앞으로도 메타디움에 꾸준한 관심&nbsp;부탁드립니다.</p><p>메타디안 여러분의 지속적인 관심과 성원에 항상&nbsp;감사드립니다.</p><p>-메타디움 팀</p><p>Website | <a href="https://metadium.com/">https://metadium.com</a></p><p>Discord | <a href="https://discord.gg/ZnaCfYbXw2">https://discord.gg/ZnaCfYbXw2</a></p><p>Telegram(EN) | <a href="http://t.me/metadiumofficial?fbclid=IwAR3MeXsYSQbBpKEuxTMdtNKMBDGnBpniwKrmLAoNCvGL80qVdXjpS65O0t0">http://t.me/metadiumofficial</a></p><p>Twitter | <a href="https://twitter.com/MetadiumK">https://twitter.com/MetadiumK</a></p><p>Medium | <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">https://medium.com/metadium</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/metadium-website-updates-details-515b5073b789">Metadium Website Updates Details</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Metadium</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Remember the wise words of Charles Darwin? "It's not the strongest of the species that survives," he declared, "nor the most intelligent [...] – it is the one that is most adaptable to change." This rings especially true in today's financial services landscape, where digital disruption is no longer a whisper on the wind, but a full-blown hurricane tearing through legacy systems and traditional business models. Digital-first providers, including challenger banks, neobanks, fintechs, insurtechs and most recently, techfins, have morphed into formidable competitors, delivering seamless, personalized experiences that leave many incumbents gasping for air. And it comes as no surprise that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/content-library/ebooks/3952-unlock-power-digital-identity-financial-services.html">digital identity in financial services</a> underpins this very paradigm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as the rapid evolution of the financial services industry has shown throughout history, the most adaptable inherit the future. While the rise of digital-first providers across the industry presents undeniable challenges, so too it creates extensive opportunities for incumbent providers to raise their game, gain access to cutting-edge fintech/techfin innovation, and most importantly of all: deliver new streamlined, secure, and scalable experiences to their customers, while having them coming back for more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This explains why the most progressive (and successful) financial institutions continue to increase their investments in converged identity and access management (IAM) to drive hyper-personalization, adaptive security, and business model expansion at scale.</p>

This operation resulted in the successful disruption of the ransomware group, with law enforcement seizing their website and accessing a “vast amount of intelligence” regarding the internal workings of the group. Having posted a seizure notice on LockBit’s darknet website, law enforcement teased a countdown to a big reveal on the morning of the 20th.&nbsp;</p>

 From romance fraud to investment scams, there are a multitude of ways that fraudsters use social media to target victims. Here, we explore some of the most common and speak to one man who almost lost it all. 



 



<p>In 2024, it’s safe to say that if you use the internet, you’re more than likely to also use social media. In fact, of the 5.35 billion active global internet users, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/">5 billion are regular social media users.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether you want to look at photos of somebody you haven’t spoken to in 15 years, swipe on photos of somebody you’d like to speak to for the next 15 years, read about the latest conspiracy theory, or apply for a job, there’s a specific social media platform to connect with old and new friends alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The beauty of social media is how easily you can connect with people. Unfortunately, the danger of social media is also how easily you can, without any substantial identity verification check, create an account and claim to be whoever you want to be. Simply choose a name, select a photo and hey presto – you have an account. With just a few clicks, you’re free to contact with anyone on the internet. Free to share cat photos, argue why the moon is made of cheese, send your CV, or steal money from a complete stranger.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 It starts with a click. 



<p>In the first six months of 2023, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2023/10/social-media-golden-goose-scammers#1">$2.7 billion was lost through social media fraud</a>. Massive numbers compared to the next most common fraud channel: website and apps, which claimed $2 billion, or emails, which were responsible for the comparatively low figure of just $900 million. Little wonder, then, that for one in four people who’ve been defrauded since 2021, the initial communication began on social media.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, it’s likely that you have already been contacted via a scammer, and you may not even know it. Here are the top three types of social media fraud.&nbsp;</p>



 Romance scam. 



<p>Romance fraud is a type of scam initiated through social engineering, where emotional relationships are created to obtain financial gain or services. Romance scammers often use dating apps, but reports show that social media platforms are becoming even more common. While some dating apps, such as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/20/tinder-is-expanding-id-verification-to-the-us-uk-brazil-and-mexico/">Tinder are beginning to introduce identity verification</a> steps into onboarding, many do not.&nbsp;</p>

 Social media account takeover fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>37% of UK adults worry about social media fraud, according to our recently released <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/2024-uk-fraud-awareness-report/">UK Fraud Awareness Report 2024</a>. This fear is well founded, as someone who has access to your social media account can gather valuable information and photos about you and your family and friends for future fraud attacks. They can also post phishing attacks and links to investment scams from your account, lending the scam a convincing air of credibility and authenticity.&nbsp;</p>



 Investment scam / pig butchering scam.&nbsp; 



<p>One of the most common forms of social media fraud. Investment scams are typically ‘long con’ techniques that take place over a series of weeks or months, with the fraudster slowly establishing trust before presenting the victim with an investment opportunity. Although the website and payment portals shared may look genuine, any money that the victim sends is being transferred directly to the scammer. A variation of the investment scam is the pig butchering scam, which combines elements from romance scams, investment schemes, and crypto fraud.&nbsp;</p>



 “We just clicked.”&nbsp; 



<p>Anyone can be targeted by social media fraud. Young or old. Blue or white collar. After reading our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pig-butchering-scams/">‘Welcome to the fraud factory: Home of the pig butchering scam.’</a> IDnow was contacted by a German entrepreneur who realized that he had been defrauded. Below, we share his story:&nbsp;</p>



 Background. 



<p>I am an executive of a tech startup based in Europe, and 2023 marked a significant turning point for our company as it transitioned into a stock corporation. As the CEO, my primary responsibilities included securing financing, managing investor relationships, and selling shares to fuel the growth of the company. The second quarter of 2023 was particularly challenging, filled with numerous investor meetings and a determined push to promote our investment opportunities through Google Ads. It was during this period that I was contacted by a seemingly enthusiastic investor over LinkedIn, setting off a chain of events that would ultimately lead to the downfall of the company and my personal life.&nbsp;</p>



 The encounter.&nbsp; 



<p>In early May 2023, I received a message on LinkedIn from a young lady expressing her interest in investing in our stock corporation. Intrigued by her enthusiasm and apparent financial success, I engaged in a conversation with her. We quickly transitioned from LinkedIn to Telegram, and eventually she asked to switch to WhatsApp, and we exchanged phone numbers. She presented herself as a 37-year-old, successful investor in the art industry, with numerous investments in art galleries, including one in Hamburg.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As our conversations continued, she began sharing details about her immense wealth and philanthropic endeavors, especially her interest in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/nft-non-fungible-tokens-new-art-money-laundering/">Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs</a>). She frequently flaunted her account balance, boasting of having millions of USDT (cryptocurrency with a value that mirrors the US dollar) at her disposal. She assured me that investing in digital artwork would be a profitable venture for our struggling company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under her influence, I started investing in digital artwork on a platform called [removed], which frequently changed its domain. As she gained my trust, she probed for information about my net worth and assets, believing she was dealing with a financially stable partner. In reality, though, our company was facing dire financial straits, and I was desperate to secure the necessary financing to prevent bankruptcy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The ‘golden opportunity.’ 



<p>Then came the golden opportunity. She suggested purchasing a highly valuable piece of digital artwork, similar to the popular ‘bored ape’ NFTs, with the intention of putting it up for auction. I agreed to the purchase, spending $850,000, with the expectation that it would be sold for a substantial profit. A week later, it was indeed sold for $8,129,000, bringing immense relief as it seemed like a way to recover our company’s financial troubles and my personal investments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the moment I attempted to withdraw the funds, my joy turned to despair. I was asked to transfer 20% of the auction price, amounting to over $1.6 million, to a different wallet. Subsequently, they demanded an “advanced certification audit,” requiring me to provide extensive personal information, including bank statements, the source of my funds (my house and other assets), and a copy of my passport. A few days later, I received the shocking news that my account had been frozen due to suspicion of money laundering. To regain access, I was told to pay an additional $547,000 fee with a promise of a refund upon a positive outcome of the audit. Late September marked the realization that I had fallen victim to a complex and devastating scam known as pig butchering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The aftermath. 



<p>Despair took hold, and I sought help from white hat hackers in a desperate attempt to uncover the truth and recover my investments. Unfortunately, I encountered fraudulent individuals who claimed to be white hat hackers and extorted thousands of dollars from me under the pretence of uncovering the fraud. Today, the company faces imminent administrative shutdown, forcing the dismissal of all employees, and I am left with no choice but to file for insolvency.&nbsp;</p>



 What happened next? 



<p>The anonymous reader lost €900,000 in total. In the months since discovering the deception, he has contacted lawyers, forensic hackers and the police, all to no avail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The lawyer offered to trace and try to find the responsible company, but as you know, they are typically not registered and change their domains every three months.”</p>



<p>Although the forensic hackers did manage to locate the Wallet that contained the funds, they were unable to crack it, due to its Advanced Information Management Security Computer System (AIM), which was installed by a cyber security group.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is therefore looking unlikely that he will ever be able to recover the funds, so for the time being, he is focusing on recovering and staying positive.</p>

 What’s so social about social media fraud?&nbsp; 



<p>With <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiWiv_-gKiEAxUDUUEAHatSAXcQFnoECCUQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2023%2F04%2F12%2Flinkedin-rolls-out-ways-to-verify-your-identity-and-employment-without-a-price-tag%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw3OOaCHGFxTZi5nUbm6kAb_&amp;opi=89978449">recent steps by LinkedIn</a> to introduce an identity verification step, could the era of social media anonymity, which inarguably leads to the proliferation of social media fraud, be coming to an end? Considering LinkedIn’s step is only encouraged and not mandatory, the answer is probably “no, not yet…”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Flaws and loopholes also exist in X (formally Twitter) and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj2osmUgaiEAxUgV0EAHR9SAcUQFnoECCcQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.hootsuite.com%2Fmeta-verified%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw2Vp0omcgNlBwL9v3MzxTnu&amp;opi=89978449">Meta’s verification strategies</a>, with only paid subscribers able to become verified. Identity verification only works if everybody participates; if it is not mandatory then it’s largely pointless. In fact, according to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exposing-romance-scammers-becky-holmes/">Becky Holmes, the ‘romance fraud vigilante-turned-author’</a>, the decision to offer verification for a fee is a fraudster’s dream. “Suddenly you have an influx of people pretending to be celebrities who don’t need a blue tick anymore.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also, what’s stopping a fraudster just paying for the premium service and benefiting from the associated prestige?&nbsp;</p>



 How to protect yourself against social media fraud.&nbsp; 



<p>It’s safe to say that the digital identity verification market has never been healthier. Indeed, there were <a href="https://www.juniperresearch.com/researchstore/fintech-payments/digital-identity-verification-research-report?utm_campaign=pr1_digitalidentityverification_financial_fintech_oct23&amp;utm_source=businesswire&amp;utm_medium=pr">61 billion digital identity verification checks conducted in 2023</a>, a number that is predicted to grow by 16% to 71 billion by the end of this year. In a world of just 8 billion people, these numbers are staggering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Most industries, including financial services, gambling, mobility, travel, and telecommunications have all embraced the potential of digital identity verification. Some industries, like financial services remain at the forefront of digital identity verification adoption, as they are required by regulations to have certain <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer</a> and identity checks in place. While identity verification can help businesses meet compliance challenges and protect their business and customers from fraud, other industries are motivated more by its ability to optimize processes and scale their business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, until social media platforms adopt meaningful and comprehensive identity verification, users should connect with caution. Here are three top tips to protect yourself against social media fraud.&nbsp;</p>



  Stay aware.  



<p>From the latest terms, like social engineering or deepfakes, it’s important to have a rudimentary understanding of what they include, so that you can remain vigilant, and know what steps to take if you are suspicious of a new contact.</p>



  Don’t just click.  



<p>Never click on links from your social media contacts, especially if they are new ‘friends.’ Only move to encrypted channels when you are totally sure that they are who they say there are, and of their intentions. If you suspect that your friend’s account has been hacked, contact them via a secure platform to make sure it’s them.&nbsp;</p>



  Don’t send.  



<p>Never send money to a social media contact. Regardless of how many times you’ve messaged, how well they know you, or how good the opportunity is. Beware of investment platforms, and crypto payment portals, as criminals are incredibly skilled in creating fake websites.</p>

 IDnow fraud survey reveals: 33% of Brits share sensitive ID documents unprotected online, with youth most at risk. 



 



  33% of Brits have shared scans or photos of an ID card, driving licence or passport via digital channels, such as social media or email, despite knowing that these ID documents could land in the wrong hands  The survey also revealed that three-quarters of Brits are most concerned about banking fraud  Over half of Brits (54%) do not know what social engineering is, or the role it plays in fraud, with almost half not knowing what deepfakes are  



 



<p>London, February 20, 2024 – A major survey into attitudes and knowledge around fraud in the UK has been unveiled, with findings indicating a lack of knowledge around key tactics used by fraudsters, leaving Brits vulnerable to this crime, which is seeing exponential growth.</p>



<p>Commissioned by IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider, the YouGov survey of 2,264 people has uncovered that almost half (45%) of UK adults were aware that scans or photos of their ID documents could be obtained by criminals to be used to commit fraud – yet sent the documents via digital channels, such as email, social media and messenger apps anyway.</p>



<p>Such activity could lead to identity theft, which IDnow believes should be a concern to the UK public, especially given the rise in deepfake technology. Developments in generative artificial intelligence (AI) mean deepfake technology can now be used to create hyper-realistic fake documents, as well as videos. However, the survey found that less than a third (31%) of Britons know what deepfake documents are and are aware of the potential risks posed by digitally generated images of physical documents.</p>



<p>Lovro Persen, Director Document and Fraud at IDnow, commented: “Many of us have seen the uncanny deepfake videos of celebrities that spread like wildfire across the internet, showing how easy it is to emulate the likeness of someone using AI. But worryingly, this research suggests that the UK public is not as concerned, or aware as they should be, of the risks associated with such digitally generated images or videos.</p>



<p>“The extraordinary leaps in AI technology mean it’s now almost too easy for a fraudster to carry out financial crimes. Consumers shouldn’t make it even easier for fraudsters though. Our advice is always to think twice before sending a scan or photo of your driving licence or passport into the digital ether via unencrypted channels, such as social media or email.”</p>



<p>Interestingly, 48% of 18- to 24-year-olds surveyed have shared ID documents via such risky channels, compared with just 21% of over-55s, highlighting the potential need to better educate the younger generation on digital fraud threats.</p>



 Is fraud front of mind? 



<p>The survey also revealed that three-quarters of Brits are most concerned about <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">banking fraud</a>, when asked about the different areas of life where fraud could occur. An additional 37% of Brits are most concerned about fraud via social media channels.</p>



<p>With 54% of Brits unfamiliar with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/social-engineering/">social engineering</a>, encompassing deceptive tactics such as phishing or smishing, the majority of the population remains vulnerable to potential fraud attempts. Social engineering, one of the most prevalent and hard to catch fraud typologies, sees fraudsters manipulating trust or fear, putting consumers at risk of divulging sensitive information or falling prey to malicious links disguised as trustworthy messages.</p>



<p>In terms of the likelihood of being a victim of crime, a fifth (21%) of Brits believe they are most at risk of someone hacking their social media profile. In fact, social media was the primary security concern for those aged 18- to 24-years-old, with each remaining age group citing their main worry as someone accessing their bank account through identity fraud.</p>



<p>Hence, for accounts connected to larger sums or investments, three quarters of Brits (75%) would be willing to go through a lengthier online onboarding process, if this made it safer. Doug Pollock, Vice President Customer Success at IDnow, explained: “Our findings show that banks in the UK do not always go far enough to make their customers feel safe and secure. They need to go further in terms of fraud prevention technology to meet their customers’ risk appetite, especially when their money is at stake. Because, and our research confirms this, if banks get it wrong, the majority of people (54%) would consider moving banks were they to become a victim of fraud. </p>



<p>“We hope these findings highlight the massive impact online fraud continues to have on British people. Because fraudsters work across industries, regions and use cases, it’s vital we all work together – financial services, technology providers, government, law enforcement and the public – to identify and stop fraudsters before it’s too late.”</p>



 



<p>About this study</p>



<p>This release is based on data from an online survey conducted by YouGov Germany, in which 2,264 people in the UK took part between 6 and 7 December 2023. The results were weighted and are representative of the UK population aged 18 and over.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>The Era of Generative AI is upon us – there is no doubt about that. After over 50 years of academic research in artificial intelligence culminating in the development of neural networks and machine learning algorithms, and then another decade of building cybersecurity products based on those methods and trying to persuade customers to finally put their trust into them… The seemingly out-of-nowhere emergence of ChatGPT has managed to achieve that overnight.</p>
<p>Instead of a grumpy, suspicious crowd not willing to let AI automate their jobs, we now see a public craze that makes the Tulip Mania of the 17th century pale in comparison. Businesses are rushing to implement GenAI capabilities into all their processes and workflows. Vendors are struggling to come up with even more potential use cases to add generative capabilities to their products. But most importantly, literally everyone is happy to consume those capabilities again and again, disregarding potential risks and challenges (including being automated out of their jobs completely).</p>
<p>Even I couldn't resist asking DALL-E to create an illustration for the previous paragraph, and the result is quite impressive...</p>
<p></p>
<p>Discussing those risks for business applications of GenAI is a huge topic on its own. We already hear experts talking about lack of transparency, potential biases in training, compliance issues with leaking sensitive information to third parties, to say nothing about the massive costs of running LLM infrastructures. Still, the attempts of some organizations to outright ban ChatGPT usage on their premises have already been proven futile. Just like BYOD, this usage should be controlled by a combination of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/leal/ai-regulation-challenges-and-opportunities">government-level regulation</a> and organizations’ own <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-you-need-ai-acceptable-use-policy-aup-declan-van-esbeck-q9q6e/">acceptable use policies</a>.</p>
 Generative AI for cybersecurity practitioners 
<p>Still, today we want to focus on a more specific question: does the introduction of GenAI capabilities fundamentally change cybersecurity? What practical new functionality do they offer to security experts? And what are the challenges of developing and using security tools that rely on modern GenAI models?</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the most obvious use case doesn’t even require any additional interfaces between you and ChatGPT: it’s continuous education, an absolute must for every cybersecurity practitioner. Having a virtual assistant that can instantly answer any question and free you from doing your own research is a very alluring prospect indeed. You just have to remember that ChatGPT is not smarter than you. In fact, it works much more like a room full of hyperactive monkeys with typewriters, and not everything they produce is necessarily on par with Shakespeare. When an LLM does not know something, it will happily make up a completely wrong but still plausibly-looking answer, and it is entirely your responsibility to check its validity. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/zero-trust">Trust but verify</a>!</p>
<p>Another related area is using LLMs for creating various materials for safe simulations of cybersecurity incidents. The idea itself is, of course, not at all new – tabletop exercises, incident response bootcamps and other kinds of training are a big part of every business continuity program, but using Generative AI does not just reduce the cost of such exercises but dramatically increases the degree of their realism – after all, real threat actors are already using very similar tools for their nefarious purposes. Again, just keep in mind that the cost of an error in this business is not at your advantage – a poorly crafted spear phishing mail will only leave a hacker with a bit of lost revenue, yet a poorly designed phishing awareness exercise might leave your entire company unprotected against multiple future attacks.</p>
<p>With the tremendous improvements LLMs are now making in generating not just natural language, but application source code as well, the idea of making new software “secure by design” by replacing human developers (that make so many coding mistakes and are impossible to teach to follow security practices!) with code generated directly by an AI model is getting more and more traction. In a similar way, LLMs can be used to create more sophisticated authorization policies, generate synthetic data for security testing, etc. In a slightly less radical approach, LLMs would not outright replace humans but serve as an additional filter in an existing CI/CD pipeline to improve its coverage and efficiency.</p>
<p>To be honest, looking at the results produced by current-generation tools, I’m somewhat skeptical about AI completely replacing human developers anytime soon, but the situation might change quickly. In any case, however, there is absolutely no reason to treat the code generated by AI as inherently error-free. You’ll still need to keep unit tests, static and dynamic code analysis solutions, and a lot of other security tools included in your development pipeline. Can you delegate all these activities to LLMs? Perhaps, but should you? In the end, it is still someone’s liability, and you cannot put than on AI…</p>
<p>But wait, someone reading this might say, what about arguably the most interesting application of Generative AI – specialized security-trained LLMs built into solutions like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot">Microsoft Security Copilot</a>? Aren’t they the real future of cybersecurity?</p>
<p>Well, I cannot argue with that… to a degree. SIEMs, XDRs, and other security analytics solutions have been relying on various AI technologies for years, and the addition of GenAI does make them better in many ways. Providing better insights by cutting through the noise, helping to make critical incident response decisions faster, improving security analysts’ productivity – all these capabilities are great improvements, but they are not what makes a security tool reliable and scalable. Microsoft’s Copilot would never be so useful without the company’s existing vast telemetry network and threat intelligence database or their own cloud infrastructure.</p>
<p>Even Charles Babbage, the inventor of the first programmable computer, already understood the principle that later became known as “Garbage in, garbage out” – not even the most sophisticated machine can make right decisions based on incomplete, flawed, or biased input data. For Generative AI, this applies to a much larger extent than anywhere else in IT. Perhaps, when you’re choosing the next best cybersecurity tool for your organization, looking at its GenAI-powered bells and whistles should not be on the top of your list of priorities.</p>
 Tapping into the Wisdom of the Crowd 
<p>In the end, we cannot deny the fact that Generative AI is indeed a game-changer in almost every industry, including cybersecurity. And yet it is critical for everyone to understand that GenAI does not do magic. It is just a tool - an extremely sophisticated, sometimes quite delicate, and very expensive one. A crucial part of integrating these tools into your security strategy is to clearly understand their capabilities and limitations (which tend to change literally on a weekly basis). Even more important is to be aware of how both the trailblazers and ordinary peers within your industry are using them to capitalize on their experience and avoid their mistakes.</p>
<p>And of course, there is no better platform to meet those people than the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">upcoming EIC 2024</a>, Europe’s prime conference on Digital ID, Security, Privacy and Governance in an AI-driven world, which will take place this June in Berlin, Germany. I hope to see you there as well!</p>

<p>Last Friday, we <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-step-by-step-guide-on-verifying-bitcoin-non-custodial-wallet-ownership-through-user-signing">published a blog post</a> that explained the user signing process on the Bitcoin network using Trezor and Ledger hardware wallets. Today, we’re going to delve into the user signing process on the Ethereum network with the Trezor and Ledger hardware&nbsp;wallets.</p> User Signing on the Ethereum Network With&nbsp;Ledger  Step 1: Select the type of address you want to&nbsp;sign <p>First, we have to choose the type of cryptocurrency address to sign with, which is the Ethereum network in our&nbsp;case.</p> Step 2: Connect Your&nbsp;Wallet <p>Next, choose one of the four wallet options: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Ledger, and&nbsp;Trezor.</p><p>If you don’t have a wallet account, tap on the “I don’t have a wallet” option on the left side of the screen. This will take you to <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/find-wallet#main-content">the Ethereum Foundations’ list of supported wallets</a>.</p><p>For this section, we chose&nbsp;Ledger.</p> Step 3: Connect Your Ledger&nbsp;Live <p>Now, you have to connect with Ledger Live, which you can do either through Ledger Live Mobile or the Ledger Live&nbsp;Desktop.</p><p>For this guide, we will do it through the&nbsp;desktop.</p> Step 4: Connect to User&nbsp;Signing <p>You’ll then be prompted to connect to User Signing (dev.usersigning.shyft.network). Right click on both Ethereum and Polygon “Test on User Signing” options and click on the “Connect” button.</p> Step 5: Sign&nbsp;Address‍ <p>On this page, you will also see your selected Ethereum wallet address. Click on the “Sign Address” button, which will take you to a pop-up screen asking for your public key to continue the User Signing&nbsp;process.</p><p>Next, you have to open the Ethereum app on your Ledger&nbsp;device.</p> Step 6: Open Your Ledger Device and Complete the Sign up&nbsp;Process <p>Now open the Ethereum app on your Ledger&nbsp;device.</p><p>Next, on your Ledger device, you will be asked to confirm that you are the trust anchor of this public key and you own the given&nbsp;address.</p><p>That’s it. You have now finished signing the&nbsp;message.</p> Step 7: The Verification is&nbsp;Complete <p>After you sign the message, you’ll get a signature proof. This confirms that you own your Ethereum&nbsp;address.</p><p>We will now see a similar process on&nbsp;Trezor.</p> User Signing on the Ethereum Network With&nbsp;Trezor  Step 1: Select the Type of Address to&nbsp;Sign <p>First, select the Ethereum Network from the two available options — Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p> Step 2: Choose Your Hardware&nbsp;Wallet‍ <p>Next, select from the four available wallet options: MetaMask, WalletConnect, Ledger, and Trezor. For this segment, we will choose&nbsp;Trezor.</p> Step 3: Scan&nbsp;Accounts <p>Now, click on the “Scan Accounts” button to get a list of your Ethereum wallet addresses. Doing so will take you to the next screen, where Trezor will request permission to export your public key to the signing&nbsp;service.</p><p>On this page, you have to click on the “Export” button. This helps you verify the address you own without exposing your private&nbsp;key.</p> Step 4: Choose an Ethereum Wallet&nbsp;Address <p>Now, you will see a list of all your Ethereum addresses. From this list, choose the one address that you want to use for the User Signing process and click on the “Connect” button.</p><p>Once you do that, your Trezor wallet will be connected to Shyft User&nbsp;Signing.</p> Step 5: Signing the&nbsp;Message <p>Here, you have to click on the “Sign Address” button, which will take you to the pop-up screen asking you to allow signing with your Ethereum&nbsp;address.</p><p>To sign the Ethereum message, click on the “Allow Once for This Session”&nbsp;button.</p> Step 6: Open Your Trezor Device and Complete the Sign up&nbsp;Process <p>Follow the instructions on your Trezor device and confirm that you are the trust anchor and own the given Ethereum wallet&nbsp;address.</p><p>Next, your Trezor device will prompt you to confirm ownership of the address and verify you as the trust anchor for the public&nbsp;key.</p> Step 7: The Verification is&nbsp;Complete <p>The verification is now complete, generating a signature proof. This confirms your Ethereum address ownership.</p><p>📽️ If you want to watch a video of the entire process, you can find it here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glEXgOWSz0c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glEXgOWSz0c</a></p><p>______________________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>For Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), ensuring the legitimacy of transactions to comply with regulatory standards such as the FATF Travel Rule while maintaining user privacy is crucial. However, this was easier said than done until <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/user-signing-now-available-on-shyft-veriscope">Shyft launched User Signing</a> in late December last&nbsp;year.</p><p>With Shyft User Signing, VASPs now have a user-friendly and secure way for users to prove ownership of their non-custodial wallets.</p><p>In this guide, we outline the user signing process on the Bitcoin network with the Trezor and Ledger hardware&nbsp;wallets.</p> User Signing on the Bitcoin Network With&nbsp;Trezor  Step 1: Select the Type of Address to&nbsp;Sign <p>The first step in the user signing process is to select the type of cryptocurrency address you wish to sign. In this case, we are focusing on the Bitcoin&nbsp;network.</p> Step 2: Choose Your Hardware&nbsp;Wallet <p>After selecting Bitcoin, the next step is to choose the hardware device that you will use to connect to your Bitcoin wallet. For this section, we will proceed with&nbsp;Trezor.</p> Step 3: Connect Your Trezor&nbsp;Wallet <p>Connecting your Trezor device is straightforward. Once you’ve selected Trezor as your hardware wallet, you’ll be prompted to connect the device to your computer and enter your&nbsp;PIN.</p><p>The service will then communicate with your Trezor to prepare it for&nbsp;signing.</p> Step 4: Export the Public&nbsp;Key <p>Trezor will request permission to export your public key to the signing service. This is a crucial step as it allows the service to identify which address you’re proving ownership of without compromising your private&nbsp;key.</p> Step 5: Signing the&nbsp;Message <p>With your public key exported, the next step is to sign a message. This is done through the Trezor interface, where you will see a prompt to sign a Bitcoin message. Follow the instructions on your Trezor device’s screen to complete this&nbsp;step.</p> Step 6: Verification and&nbsp;Proof <p>Upon successful signing, you will receive a signature proof. This is a cryptographic string that proves you have signed a message with the private key corresponding to your public Bitcoin&nbsp;address.</p><p>Now, we will see a similar process with Ledger, another popular hardware crypto&nbsp;wallet.</p> User Signing on the Bitcoin Network With&nbsp;Ledger  Step 1: Select the Type of Address to&nbsp;Sign <p>First, select the type of cryptocurrency address you wish to sign. We selected the Bitcoin&nbsp;network.</p> Step 2: Choose Your Hardware&nbsp;Wallet <p>After selecting Bitcoin, the next step involves selecting your hardware device, which was Ledger in our&nbsp;case.</p> Step 3: Connect Your Ledger&nbsp;Wallet <p>Connect your Ledger device to your computer, enter your PIN, and open the Bitcoin application on the device. The interface will then establish a connection with your Ledger and prepare it for the user signing&nbsp;process.</p> Step 4: Export the Public&nbsp;Key <p>Your Ledger will now ask permission to export your public key to the user signing service. This step is essential for the service to verify your address ownership securely.</p> Step 5: Sign the&nbsp;Message <p>Once your public key is exported, sign the message using your Ledger. Here, you will see the details of the message to sign. Now, confirm the message on your Ledger device to complete the signing&nbsp;process.</p> Step 6: Verification and&nbsp;Proof <p>After signing the message, you’ll receive a signature proof — a cryptographic verification that you have used your private key to sign the message without exposing it. This proof is used to confirm ownership of your Bitcoin address securely.</p> Conclusion <p>User signing is a must-have for VASPs to keep transactions secure and compliant. With this guide, VASPs can help their users confidently verify their non-custodial Bitcoin wallets, making sure everyone’s on the same page with clear and secure processes.</p><p>If you wish to check the video of this entire process, you can head over here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuE6_IafxOs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuE6_IafxOs</a></p><p>______________________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

 As mobile transaction volumes rise, location intelligence is increasingly becoming a critical tool that enables companies to better authenticate customers and detect fraud. The increase in location-sensitive transactions, such as payments, content streaming, and online sports betting, necessitates verifying users’ physical locations at the point of transaction. Location intelligence vendors respond by offering solutions that authenticate legitimate users and escalate high-risk ones to traditional authentication methods. According to Meticulous Research, the Location Intelligence market is projected to reach $67.5 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 12.9% from 2023 to 2030. 



<p>Location intelligence, or geolocation, involves collecting, analyzing, and applying spatial data to derive insights and make strategic decisions. This enables businesses to understand patterns and trends, improve operations, target audiences effectively, and enhance security. As the need for secure, seamless user experiences increases, geolocation is essential for various applications, including account security, customer authentication, and identity verification. To stay competitive, some vendors in this market seek to integrate with larger platforms or broaden their product offerings in response to the trend toward Integrated Identity Platforms (IIPs).</p>

Here are some key takeaways from a recent Outside-in Report: Location Intelligence: Applications and Insights in an Evolving Market.</p>



 6 Key takeaways: 



 
 The growing sophistication of fraud threats and rising consumer expectations for low-friction user experience will drive future demand for location intelligence, with limited threats posed by consumer privacy and regulatory concerns. 
 



 
 Customer experience is crucial in authentication, with over 60% of consumers abandoning purchases due to forgotten passwords in the last six months. Frictionless, location-based authentication enables platforms to let low-risk users skip password steps entirely. 
 



 
 Businesses seek solutions with low-friction and cross-lifecycle capabilities, growing geofencing mandates for regulated industries, and continuing mobile transaction growth. 
 



 
 Nearly 75% of consumers are willing to share location data to enhance mobile app functionality. While hesitancy to share data may affect the use of location intelligence for authentication, it doesn’t significantly hinder the market’s growth. 
 



 
 Regulatory constraints are consent-based, with stricter privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA posing limited threats to location intelligence platforms since regulations emphasize consumer consent and don’t prohibit geolocation data collection. 
 



 
 The global legalization of regulated online gaming is expanding, with over 32 countries and 34 US states plus the District of Columbia now allowing online betting. Geofencing is crucial in adhering to local regulations, fueling the worldwide demand for location intelligence. 
 



 How It Works: Location Intelligence for User Authentication 



<p>For authentication use cases, geolocation providers combine multiple location intelligence signals with device-level data to risk score a login attempt and allow friction-free access or escalate to challenging a user with alternate authentication methods. For a detailed workflow, <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/6550f2ec5f47e70a690acdf3?utm_campaign=Liminal%20Articles&amp;utm_source=location-intelligence-blog&amp;utm_medium=article-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=hyperlink-link-sign-in">log into Link and download</a> the full Outside-In Report, Location Intelligence: Applications and Insights in an Evolving Market.</p>



 







 



 Use Cases 



<p>Geolocation has many use cases, including account opening and fraud prevention, account takeover protection, passwordless authentication, and geofencing.</p>



<p>Account Opening and Fraud Prevention: A common use case aims to prevent account creation by fraudsters using false identities, driven by the post-COVID-19 increase in online account creation across various sectors.</p>



<p>Account Takeover Protection: This targets the need for protection against cybercrimes and expressly unauthorized access to online accounts or systems, driven by the rise in sophisticated fraud techniques and the demand for advanced security technologies.</p>



<p>Passwordless Authentication: This method enables password-free account or system access, reducing user friction. Location intelligence facilitates user authentication with minimal added friction, acting as a primary or secondary authentication factor.</p>



<p>Geofencing: This method uses geolocation data to control access to online platforms based on geographic constraints. It is crucial for regulated online gambling to meet regulatory location verification requirements in the growing number of countries and US states legalizing it.</p>



 



 Why Now?&nbsp; 



<p>Demand for location intelligence data and analytics is rising due to enterprises seeking low-friction, cross-lifecycle solutions, increasing geofencing regulations in regulated industries, and the growth of mobile transactions. Enterprises aim for high user experience across the identity lifecycle, noting that location intelligence can reduce transaction abandonment in 42% of consumers facing high friction. These solutions, especially with other authentication methods, position location intelligence vendors as crucial players in Integrated Identity Platforms (IIPs).</p>



<p>Regulatory concerns are minimal, with privacy regulations like GDPR focusing on consent-based data collection and specific laws like the Massachusetts Location Shield Act allowing for authentication and fraud detection uses. Geofencing requirements in states with legal online sports betting create additional opportunities for these vendors.</p>



<p>Additionally, the rise in smartphone transactions, now expected to constitute over 40% of online transactions, and the increasing use of online-to-offline platforms like Uber, DoorDash, and Instacart highlight new use cases for location intelligence. This trend expands the technology’s application and supports the market’s growth, providing a positive outlook for location intelligence solutions in enhancing authentication strategies and meeting regulatory compliance while opening new market opportunities.</p>

			  Fabio Espinosa is Back-End Software Engineer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself!  
<p>Hello! I’m Fabio, originally from Colombia and currently living in Madrid. I work as a back-end software engineer at Tokeny. I’ve had a lifelong fascination with technology and how it has the potential to change people’s lives. Now, I think it is really cool to be able to work on technology myself.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Before joining Tokeny, I worked as a tech lead at another startup and occasionally freelanced through Toptal.</p>
<p>I recognized a point in my career where my knowledge growth in programming had stagnated. Despite my experience in back-end, front-end, and dev ops, the work became repetitive, offering limited space for new things, and consequently, it was not so interesting anymore. Moreover, I was managing people, which was not giving me much joy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was this realization that made me curious to explore something new, particularly related to blockchain. Tokeny presented itself as an exciting opportunity to grow.</p>
<p>Also, it’s widely recognized that tokenization is positioned for substantial growth—something that will take off. Such advancements hold significant potential, particularly for early entrants who typically experience disproportionate gains. This trend appears to be unfolding, as we are beginning to see growing interest from new investors wanting to join the market.</p>
<p>As Elon Musk says, “I could either watch it happen, or be part of it”. I chose the latter. </p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>I’d describe it as responsible freedom. The flexible work-from-home policy allows me to work from many locations, provided that expectations are met. This flexibility offers a great work-life balance.</p>
<p>Also, there’s a shared sense among the team that the industry is on the verge of taking off. While the exact timing remains uncertain, we are confident that it will inevitably happen.</p>
<p>Regarding Tokeny, a company is always about its people. In that regard, everyone at Tokeny is super awesome. We know how to have fun, connect, enjoy, share, learn, be there for one another, and share a good meme on the #random channel.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>It’s hard to find the thing I’m most passionate about. I can think of traveling, exploring cultures, writing, skiing, hiking, horse riding, creating things through code, enjoying food, music, spending time with family, and being there for my sisters, trips with friends.</p>
<p>But if I were to choose one, I’d say I’m most passionate about connecting with people. I live for interesting, deep conversations. When someone shares with me a bit of themselves they’d usually keep hidden or a strange, unique way to think about something, I honor it and feel connected.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My ultimate dream has always fluctuated over time. At some point, it used to be about money. I wanted to be as rich as not to have to work anymore and do whatever I want.</p>
<p>Nowadays, I see it differently. I mean, money will always be important, but my ultimate dream is to be constantly at peace with myself and aware enough to be in alignment with what is true to me the most I can.</p>
<p>On my deathbed, I want to look back and know that it wasn’t the external things that moved me, but the internal things, the really important ones.</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>I’d say working from home is always a challenge. I’d advise creating an environment where you can both focus, and disconnect to take breaks. It’s funny how sometimes the most productive moments come after a long, nice break when you can look at the code with different eyes.</p>
<p>Let yourself be taken through the ride and try to develop consistency in your pace of work. Everyone is there to help you, so count on anyone; they all want to see you succeed.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>It excites me to work on something different from the usual corporate environment, within a small team, with significant upside potential, and contributing to beneficial technological progress for people.</p>
<p>I’m also super excited about the next team building event; they somehow keep getting better.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Graham Williamson</a></p>Efficient, effective management of access controls from infrastructure to applications remains an aspiration for enterprises. The main drivers of this goal include the need for strengthening the cybersecurity posture, efficiency gains in managing access controls, the need for consistency in access controls across multiple solutions and layers, and regulatory compliance. Most organizations today struggle with a mixture of point solutions for managing access controls, many of these relying on static entitlements causing massive work and tending to become inaccurate. A consistent, policy-based solution for managing access controls ensures that the right people have the right access, at the right time, from the right place.

This Leadership Compass features vendors offering policy-based access control solutions and provides guidance on aligning a vendor’s solution to common corporate access control requirements.

				 <p>The Biden administration and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced a change to drop overdraft fees to as low as $3. The average fee for overdrafts is over $26.</p>



<p>Why this matters: Financial institution’s bottom lines will be greatly affected. We are talking about the nation’s largest banks losing roughly <a href="https://apnews.com/article/overdraft-junk-fees-banking-biden-jpmorgan-cb8b19687264c0eed757d84911b44303">$8 billion.</a></p>



<p>Who does this affect: Only “very large” banks, savings associations, and credit unions with assets of $10 billion or more will be affected.</p>



<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (<a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_overdraft-credit-very-large-financial-institutions_proposed-rule_2024-01.pdf">CFPB</a>) found that applying these rules to FIs with assets of $10 billion or more covers:</p>



 
 80% of consumer deposits 



 68% of overdraft charges 
 



<p>While smaller FIs won’t be directly affected by this rule, it is crucial to stay vigilant to changes in the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reactions:</p>



 
 The banking industry is gearing up to fight back with a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/banking-overdraft-junk-fees-cfpb-jpmorgan-3842af05c0197cba396a9552eb4b099c">multimillion-dollar marketing</a> and lobbying campaign. 



 Banks will need to start implementing new products or campaigns to make up for the revenue loss such as <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/cyber-safety/">cyber safety</a>, secure ID verification, safe browsing, and other privacy tools. (We’ll cover more on that below 👀) 
 



 Dive Deeper 



<p>The financial landscape is on the brink of change. The new rules will reshape revenue streams for banks and credit unions.</p>



<p>Overdraft lending: “Very Large Financial Institutions Proposed Rule”</p>



<p>The “Very Large Financial Institutions Proposed Rule” is part of an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">executive order</a> that “Established a whole-of-government effort to promote competition in the American economy.” This order’s initiatives create change across multiple industries, including health care, finance, technology, and more.</p>



<p>The Very Large Financial Institutions Proposed Rule:</p>



 
 Was presented by The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). 



 Wants FIs to use overdraft fees to break even by either:  FIs calculate their own costs and losses using standards outlined in the proposal.  
 
 Using the benchmark overdraft fees of $3, $6, $7, or $14. 
 
 



 Only applies to FIs with assets of $10 billion or more. 



 Change Regulation Z to expand on the definition of open-end credit: “plan” and “finance charge.” 
 



<p><a href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_overdraft-credit-very-large-financial-institutions_proposed-rule_2024-01.pdf">👀 You can read the full document from the CFPB here.</a></p>



<p>Other changes for the financial space from the executive order have included:</p>



 
 <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/Assessing-the-Impact-of-New-Entrant-Nonbank-Firms.pdf">The U.S. Department of the Treasury submitted a report</a> to the White House Council to show that fintech needs more regulations.&nbsp; 



 <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-proposes-rule-to-rein-in-excessive-credit-card-late-fees/">The CFPB proposed a new rule to lower credit card late fees.</a> 



 <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/why-were-modernizing-how-we-collect-credit-card-data/">The CFPB is making credit card comparison more accessible.</a> 
 



<p>For all banks and credit unions, these new rules can have significant impact. The CFPB is setting new standards in the FI industry, which consumers will come to expect from all FIs, no matter the size.</p>



 The Overdraft Fee Changes: Making New Revenue Streams 



<p>The proposed regulations can significantly reduce overdraft fee revenue, prompting banks and credit unions to seek alternative revenue sources. While this presents a challenge, it also creates opportunities for proactive innovation and the maintenance of financial well-being.</p>

  The Crypto Travel Rule threshold in Japan is&nbsp;US$3000.  It has been in effect in the country since June&nbsp;2023.  During its evaluation, the FATF praised Japan’s anti-money laundering efforts and called them effective while also noting areas for potential improvement.  <p>Japan was among the first countries to recognize the potential of the decentralized crypto ecosystem and took significant measures to position itself as the world’s crypto hub. One of the measures Japan took included the introduction of various crypto-related regulations, such as the FATF Travel Rule, aimed at preventing malicious entities from exploiting digital assets for illicit activities, including terrorist financing and money laundering.</p> Background of the Crypto Travel Rule in&nbsp;Japan <p>Japan legally recognized cryptocurrencies in 2016 and further solidified their status by amending the Payment Services Act in 2019 to treat crypto assets as legal property. It led to the establishment of clear guidelines for crypto exchanges, including the need for strict anti-money laundering measures.</p><p>The country later introduced the Crypto Travel Rule in 2022, requiring exchanges to share transaction data to combat money laundering. FATF Travel Rule, however, did not become active in 2022 and instead <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/japan-to-enforce-crypto-travel-rule-from-june-1st">came into force in June&nbsp;2023</a>.</p><p>The current threshold at which the Crypto Travel Rule applies to a crypto transaction in Japan is $3000. This means VASPS must transmit the required information only if the amount exceeds this&nbsp;limit.</p> Crypto Travel Rule Japan — Compliance Requirements <p>In line with FATF’s Recommendations, beneficiary and originator VASPs in Japan must obtain, hold, and make available on request to appropriate authorities the following information:</p><p>- Name and account number of the originator</p><p>- Place and date of birth of originator as well as address or national identity number, customer identification number</p><p>- Name and account number of the beneficiary</p><p>The information makes it possible for authorities to track the transaction routes of crypto assets and stablecoins.</p><p>Virtual Asset Service Providers, according to Japan’s financial regulation PSA, are those that are involved&nbsp;in:</p><p>- Purchase, sale, and exchange of crypto&nbsp;assets</p><p>- Intermediating, brokering, or acting as an agent for the above-mentioned activities</p><p>- Managing customer’s money in connection with all the above-mentioned activities</p><p>- Managing crypto assets for the benefit of another&nbsp;person</p><p>Now, a recent development seeks to refine this regulatory framework further, with <a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/newsletter/weekly2024/573.html">the FSA proposing</a> to simplify the Crypto Travel Rule on January 26th this year. The new draft requires VASPs to report restricted crypto-assets to a certified payment service association and publicly disclose this information. The agency is currently receiving public comments on the proposal until February 26th,&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Japan’s self-regulated crypto organization, JVCEA, also noted in its “2024 New Year’s Thoughts” <a href="https://jvcea.or.jp/news/main-info/20240101-001/">notice</a> that by revising the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds (APTCP) to implement the FATF Travel Rule, it has become the “first major developed country to do&nbsp;so.”</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>In Japan, centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are required to register with the FSA, which is responsible for overseeing banking, securities, and exchange sectors. Meanwhile, the Payment Services Act has been applied to all crypto exchanges operating in Japan since April&nbsp;2017.</p><p>Moreover, through amendments to its Payment Services Act, Japan already requires exchanges to implement Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-money Laundering (ML) measures. Under this, crypto exchanges need to provide customer due diligence procedures, maintain records, ensure customer assets are secure, and improve their security.</p><p>Now, with the Crypto Travel Rule in place, it further tightens these regulations for crypto exchanges in Japan, as they now have to assess the money laundering and financial terrorism risks for self-hosted wallets as&nbsp;well.</p><p>The APTCP also plans to update its rules, requiring VASPs to collect sender and receiver information for transactions involving self-hosted wallets or unregistered VASPs, including when these transactions occur in jurisdictions where the Travel Rule is not yet enforced.</p><p>Although Japan does not mandate covering transactions with counterparties in locations that haven’t yet implemented the Travel Rule regulations, VASPs must still evaluate the risks and gather necessary information. To aid this process, the FSA regularly updates its list of countries that meet Japan’s Travel Rule standards.</p> Crypto Travel Rule Japan — Global Context and Comparisons <p>Japan’s Travel Rule sets a US$3,000 threshold for cryptocurrency transactions, higher than Singapore’s SGD 1,500 and Canada’s CAD 1,000, and unlike many countries that have no threshold. This stringent threshold is part of Japan’s broader anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing strategy, which <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/countries/detail/Japan.html">the FATF has deemed effective</a> while also highlighting areas that could benefit from further improvements.</p><p>Moreover, according to <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/new-ventures/cryptocurrency-assets/pwc-global-crypto-regulation-report-2023.pdf">PWC’s report</a>, Japan is among the only 23 countries that were engaged in advancing crypto-focused regulations and legislation in 2023 across all four key focus areas: Travel Rule compliance, stablecoin regulation, licensing and listing guidance, and crypto framework development.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>In conclusion, Japan’s adherence to clear guidelines for crypto companies and global anti-money laundering standards, exemplified by initiatives like the Crypto Travel Rule, reinforces its standing in the crypto industry amid heightened global regulatory scrutiny.</p> Relevant Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-states">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in the United&nbsp;States</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-hong-kong">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in Hong&nbsp;Kong</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/comprehensive-guide-to-crypto-regulations-and-fatf-travel-rule-in-singapore">Comprehensive Guide to Crypto Regulations and FATF Travel Rule in Singapore</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-uae">A Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in the&nbsp;UAE</a></p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>Back in March of 1950, the FBI added Willie “The Actor” Sutton to their list of Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. During his tenure as an American bank robber, Sutton stole an estimated $2 million ($25 million in today’s dollars) and was known for using disguises. Police officer, maintenance worker, postal carrier, and telegraph messenger were a few of the roles the fraudster assumed to execute his heists.</p>
<p>When asked why he robbed banks, he replied, “because that’s where the money is.”</p>
<p>For a modern Willie Sutton, real estate seller impersonation might be considered the latest fraud method of choice. Fraudsters are focusing on compromising the identity of property owners to sell real estate they do not own. Their goal is to collect the funds a buyer intends to use for purchasing the property before other transaction participants realize the fraudster is not the legal owner.</p>
<p>Imagine owning a piece of land where you haven’t built anything yet, and one day as you drive past it you discover that there is a construction site on it. As you finally get to speak with the person in charge of the construction, you hear them claiming they rightfully own the land, with a perfectly valid deed of sale as proof.</p>
<p>How is this even possible in 2024, you may wonder? It’s simple: With the explosion of online business transactions over the last five years, technology has made it easy to buy and sell remotely – but not necessarily easy to do it securely.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long for a bad actor to find leaked data online, and to spot weak identity verification methods in a remote real estate sales process. Personally identifiable information (PII) belonging to real estate owners, loan applicants, sellers, and real estate agents is valuable to bad actors looking to commit seller impersonation fraud.</p>
<p>Seller impersonation fraud follows a specific methodology, and understanding the nuances is critical in safeguarding your organization. Our latest white paper provides more details about how it happens, the challenges it creates, and best practices you can put in place to prevent these risks without negatively impacting your sales processes.</p>

<p>Biometric spoofing, also known as biometric spoof attacks or biometric presentation attacks, refers to the manipulation or falsification of biometric data to deceive a biometric authentication system.</p>
 What Is Biometric Spoofing? 
<p>Biometric spoofing refers to deceptive <a>biometric authentication</a> attempts by presenting fake samples related to fingerprints, facial scans, or iris scans–a “presentation attack.” While <a>biometric identification</a> methods are significantly stronger than password-based systems, this does not make them invulnerable. Modern threats are evolving to bypass such protections. As such, many strong authentication requirements in compliance and regulatory standards require some form of liveness detection that can determine if the credentials presented are real.</p>
<p>In general, liveness detection methods can be classified as active or passive:</p>
 
 Active methods require user interaction, such as performing a specific action. For example, an active detection method might require the user to undertake some action, like smiling or speaking. 
 Passive methods work in the background without the user’s awareness. This method requires no direct interaction with the user. 
 
<p>Broadly speaking, active methods are typically harder to spoof but require more engagement with the user, which can impact usability. Passive methods are smoother and seamless but present more opportunities for fraud.</p>
 What Are Some Types of Biometric Spoofing? 
<p>Because different forms of biometric spoofing align with various forms of authentication, each attempt to address the specific weaknesses and opportunities of those methods.<br>
As such, presentation attacks can target various biometric modalities, including:</p>
 Facial Recognition Spoofing Attacks 
<p>Attackers may use different techniques to deceive facial recognition systems. Some of the common methods include:</p>
 
 Print Attack: The attack uses a printed photograph of the target person’s face to trick the <a>facial recognition system</a>. This is one of the simplest methods and can be effective against less sophisticated systems (most of which need to be deployed in a context where they would protect important information). 
 Replay Attack: Hackers record a video of the target person’s face and play it back in front of the camera. This approach is often more successful than a print attack since it incorporates motion, which some facial recognition systems may require. 
 3D Mask Attack: The attacker creates a realistic 3D mask of the target person’s face and wears it during authentication. This method can be more challenging to detect, but it’s equally challenging to do effectively without specific skills and equipment. 
 Deep Fake Attack: An attack uses a machine learning/AI program to create a video of the target’s face. Deepfake technology can create convincing facial movements and expressions, making it difficult for some facial recognition systems to differentiate between real and fake. 
 
<p>Facial recognition liveness detection techniques can include analyzing facial movements like blinking or verifying 3D depth information. Additionally, while there isn’t a consensus on how accurate deep fakes are, new technology from Intel can look for artifacts that signal that a video is artificial–rendering deep fakes relatively niche.</p>
 Fingerprint Spoofing Recognition Attacks 
<p><a>Fingerprint verification</a> systems, while generally secure, can still be vulnerable to spoofing if appropriate countermeasures are not in place. Some of the common fingerprint spoofing methods include:</p>
 
 Fake Fingerprints: Hackers create artificial fingerprints using materials like gelatin that replicate the target user’s fingerprint pattern, often taken directly from a fingerprint. The fake fingerprint can then be placed over the attacker’s finger or a dummy finger to deceive the fingerprint scanner. 
 Latent Fingerprints: An attacker lifts a target user’s latent fingerprint from a surface using adhesive tape or other methods and then transfers it onto a material that can deceive the fingerprint scanner. 
 3D-Printed Fingerprints: A sophisticated attack that involves someone creating a 3D model of the target user’s fingerprint using digital techniques and then 3D printing it with materials that mimic human skin properties. This method can create realistic replicas that can deceive some fingerprint scanners. 
 
<p>Countermeasures against these attacks include measuring finger skin temperature, moisture, or electrical properties to ensure the presented fingerprint comes from a live person.</p>
 Iris Recognition Spoofing Attacks 
<p>While iris recognition is generally considered to be a highly secure biometric modality, it can still be vulnerable to spoofing attacks if appropriate countermeasures are not in place.<br>
Some of the common iris presentation attacks include:</p>
 
 Digital Iris Images: Displaying a digital image or video of the target user’s iris on a device screen, such as a smartphone or tablet, and presenting it to the iris scanner. This method can use different lighting and sharpness settings on devices to fool some biometric scanners. 
 Artificial Eyes or Contact Lenses: Creating an artificial eye or a custom contact lens with the target user’s iris pattern imprinted. These can be harder to detect if the contacts are created well. 
 Physical Eyes: Although a rare and extreme method, using a preserved cadaver eye with the target user’s iris pattern can also deceive the iris recognition system. It would require someone to steal the eye of a dead subject and use it relatively quickly to be effective, which may be its form of deterrence. 
 
<p>To defend against iris presentation attacks, defenders may use techniques like examining the natural movement and contraction of the iris, verifying light reflection patterns, or analyzing the unique texture of the iris surface.</p>
 How Is Liveness Detection Used in Identity Assurance Level (IAL) Verification? 
<p>Identity Assurance Level (IAL) is a classification system used by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3-Implementation-Resources/63A/verification/">Special Publication 800-63-3</a>, “Digital Identity Guidelines” to categorize the level of confidence in an individual’s asserted identity. These standards are often used to add layers of identity verification to processes involving sensitive government systems or classified data.</p>
<p>IAL2 is an intermediate level of assurance, the second of three levels. At IAL2, an individual’s identity must be verified through remote or in-person proofing processes, which involve validating and verifying identity information against trusted records and sources. Liveness detection plays a role in IAL2 by ensuring the integrity and authenticity of biometric data collected during the identity-proofing process.</p>
 Combating Biometric Spoofing with 1Kosmos 
<p>Biometrics can improve security by replacing passwords, but they can be subject to theft, spoofing, and decision bias. As discussed, bad actors are implementing approaches to bypass biometric assurances with increasing success.</p>
<p>The 1Kosmos platform performs a series of checks to prevent biometric-based attacks. For instance, 1Kosmos LiveID can perform both “active” liveness (requiring the user to perform randomized expressions) and “passive” liveness, one without the user’s involvement. Additionally, 1Kosmos utilizes true-depth camera functionality to prevent presentation attacks and offers an SDK to protect against camera manipulation to prevent an injection attack. Alongside these advances, 1Kosmos BlockID also offers the following features:</p>
 
 Anti-Spoofing Algorithms:&nbsp;1Kosmos anti-spoofing algorithms detect and differentiate between genuine biometric data and spoofed data. Our algorithms analyze factors like texture, temperature, color, and movement to determine the authenticity of the biometric sample, catching virtual/hardware camera and JavaScript injections and ensuring the validity of the transmitted identity. 
 Data Encryption:&nbsp;1Kosmos ensures that biometric data is encrypted both during transmission and storage to prevent unauthorized access. Implementing strict access controls and encryption protocols prevents man-in-the-middle and protocol injections, ensuring the validity of the transmitted identity. 
 Regular Audits and Penetration Testing:&nbsp;1Kosmos conducts regular audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities, including access to a user’s biometric data. This helps ensure that security measures are effective and up to date. 
 Regulatory Compliance: 1Kosmos complies with regulations and standards related to biometric data protection and security, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST 800-63-3), iBeta DEA EPCS, UK DIATF, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Know Your Customer/Employee (KYC/KYE).

 Stakers can claim DF76 rewards. DF77 runs Feb 15— Feb 22, 2024. Bug fix in reward calculation  1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in Predictoor). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Here are DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Data Farming Round 76 (DF76) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Feb 8, 2024 and ended 12:01 am Feb 15. You can claim rewards at the <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF77 is live today, Feb 15. It concludes on Feb 22. 150K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF77  <p>And, for this post we have a special section 5, about a bug fix in DF reward calculation. The summary is: some Data Farmers were underpaid in the last few rounds. We have fixed the issue. Data Farmers can claim their reimbursement in the usual way to claim, via the DF&nbsp;dapp.</p> 2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF77 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20k ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> 5. Bug fix in reward calculation  5.1 Overview <p>Some Data Farmers were underpaid in the last few rounds. They’ve now been compensated the difference. The rest of this section elaborates.</p> 5.2 The&nbsp;Issue <p>In early February 2024, we identified an issue affecting DF reward calculation. The part of code that limits reward based on DCV (data consume volume) was supposed to limit in units of OCEAN. However it limited in units of USD. This led to Volume DF rewards being lower than intended, starting in DF63 (start of Predictoor DF). There were 69 wallets affected, with a total of 64,501 OCEAN less than it should have&nbsp;been.</p> 5.3 Solution in&nbsp;Code <p>As soon as we discovered the issue, we fixed it by limiting using the correct units (OCEAN, not USD). Then we took steps to reimburse; see next&nbsp;section.</p> 5.4 Reimbursement <p>We always strive to do the right thing. Trust is of utmost importance to us.In this case, that means: ensuring that every DF participant receives the DF rewards they&nbsp;earned.</p><p>We carefully calculated the missed amounts for each affected wallet. Section 5.5 lists each affected wallet, and the amount of OCEAN that was&nbsp;missing.</p><p>We are pleased to announce that these reimbursements have been processed and are now available for claiming. Participants affected by this issue can claim their reimbursement in the same manner as they would typically claim their DF rewards via <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">https://df.oceandao.org/rewards</a>.</p> 5.5 OCEAN Reimbursed, per&nbsp;Wallet  +--------------------------------------------+-----------------+<br>| Address

 Stakers can claim DF75 rewards. DF76 runs Feb 8— Feb 15,&nbsp;2024 <p>[Note: this article was meant to be published on Feb 8,&nbsp;2024].</p> 1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in Predictoor). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Here are DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Data Farming Round 75 (DF75) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Feb 1, 2024 and ended 12:01 am Feb 8. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF76 is live as of Feb 8, 2024. It concludes on Feb 15. 150K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF76   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF76 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Passive DF applies to OCEAN locked on Ethereum mainnet. Predictoor DF applies to activity on Oasis Sapphire. Volume DF applies to data assets published on Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/discover/networks">Here</a> is more information about Ocean deployments to networks.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

<p>The new year is always a time for reflection, and after a year shaped by AI, biometrics, and nation-state attacks there’s a lot to think about. So where are we headed from here? A utopian episode of Star Trek or a more dystopian Terminator 10 movie? The future as they say is up to us and that means reshaping trust and security for the realities of our brave new world.</p>
<p>The intensifying geopolitical landscape characterized by nation-sponsored attacks has made cyber the new battleground. Employing <a href="https://www.entrust.com/cybersecurity-institute/reports/building-a-solid-foundation-for-your-zero-trust-framework">Zero Trust</a> principles is a best practice, but not a cybersecurity guarantee in an era of AI-enhanced phishing, zero-day brokers, and malware-as-a-service. Adopting a term from U.S. Cold War simulations, <a href="https://www.pwc.co.uk/issues/cyber-security-services/insights/what-is-red-teaming.html">red teaming</a> is back in vogue. The red team is a pretend enemy that attempts to mount a cyberattack acting under the direction of the target organization. One such example comes from the <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/european-central-bank-to-put-banks-through-cyber-stress-test-a-24012?rf=2024-01-03_ENEWS_SUB_BIS__Slot1_ART24012&amp;mkt_tok=MDUxLVpYSS0yMzcAAAGQbvkmv4W-kSt1bPEzX98HJHUg04qWbpdOLJZTWjt_FPgrLy6XKsAky0jtvHG2DOrkVD9V66UM28zIenSQA8_0Smm1P_k2nVRNxCR3ykteB8xV6BBlHQ">European Central Bank</a>, which has started to conduct vulnerability assessments and incident response tests on banks to assess their cyber resilience. Whether simulated or real, all organizations should seek to turn cyber breaches into a blueprint for future security with actionable strategies to strengthen their cyber posture.</p>
<p>One particular area of cyber exposure is <a href="https://securityintelligence.com/news/high-impact-attacks-on-critical-infrastructure-climb-140/">critical infrastructure</a>, from the power grid to water treatment plants to public service providers and beyond. We live in an “everything is connected to everything” world, making critical infrastructure a vulnerable and attractive target to bad actors. In 2024, it’s long past time to get serious about <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/pki/iot-security">IoT</a> and Industrial IoT (IIoT) security. As well, AI-enabled biometric identity verification of employees, partners, and customers is increasingly essential to flushing out <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/1251094/deepfakes-emerge-as-a-top-security-threat-ahead-of-the-2024-us-election.html">deepfakes</a> and keeping organizations and people safe.</p>
<p>There are also some encouraging signs that regulators around the globe are stepping up to the challenges ahead. Similar to data privacy, consumer protection, and digital identity legislation, Europe is on the vanguard once again with the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/headlines/society/20230601STO93804/eu-ai-act-first-regulation-on-artificial-intelligence">EU AI Act</a>. The White House has also issued the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence Executive Order</a> and the bipartisan <a href="https://www.schatz.senate.gov/news/press-releases/schatz-kennedy-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-provide-more-transparency-on-ai-generated-content">Schatz-Kennedy AI Labeling Act</a> has been tabled. However, being that it’s an election year in the U.S., it’s likely that big tech will be left largely to self-regulate over the next 12 months. That said, the tech sector is stepping up, with seven technology behemoths including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft agreeing to adopt <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-secures-voluntary-commitments-from-leading-artificial-intelligence-companies-to-manage-the-risks-posed-by-ai/">AI safeguards</a> with the Biden administration. As well, ChatGPT maker and close Microsoft collaborator OpenAI has released its <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/openai-formulates-framework-to-mitigate-catastrophic-risks-a-23930">framework to mitigate catastrophic risks</a> like using generative AI to build biological weapons, spread malware, or carry out social engineering attacks. Meanwhile, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been busy building out the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework">Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework </a> (AI RMF) in close collaboration with the private and public sector to continue to leverage the power of AI while mitigating the risk.</p>
<p>So, at the outset of 2024, I remain cautiously optimistic that the forces of good will prevail and it will be a utopian technology-fueled future.</p>

				  Save your organization valuable development time while building digital wallet functionality right into your existing applications.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>An organization’s digital app is often one of the most effective ways it engages customers. For example, the American Bankers Association found that <a href="https://www.aba.com/about-us/press-room/press-releases/consumer-survey-banking-methods-2023#:~:text=More%20than%20half%20of%20Generation,prefer%20to%20visit%20a%20branch.">48% of bank customers</a> prefer mobile apps as their method of choice for managing their finances.</p>
<p>Given this, you want to make sure of two things: One, that it offers easy-to-use features, and two,&nbsp; that your customers stay on your app spending their time and money with you rather than going elsewhere.</p>
<p>Indicio designed the Proven Mobile SDK specifically to help you do both of these things.</p>
<p>Faster App Feature Deployment</p>
<p>App design and construction is not a simple process: for applications with multiple features, most sources say the average development time is <a href="https://spdload.com/blog/how-long-does-it-take-to-develop-an-app/">nine months or longer.</a> With this much time and money at stake, adding new features that require complex code changes is daunting, and it can be tempting to simply add on a third party application to achieve the required functionality.</p>
<p>But relying on a third party to handle features means sending your customers to that third party, reducing their time spent on your platform, and — crucially — losing control of their customer experience. For example, if you run a business and the only way to purchase something on your website is a third-party payment platform that is constantly buggy, the experience will be tied to using your website and risk losing you customers. People do not reward complexity and hassle online.</p>
<p>This is where the Proven Mobile SDK comes in. It helps you build digital wallet functionality directly into your existing application without your team having to reinvent the wheel. Built with packages for Swift, Kotlin, and React Native, your developers can add decentralized identity to your applications without the time commitment of learning new programming languages or practices.</p>
<p>But what functionality and features does the SDK add to your application that will enhance the customer experience?</p>
<p>Faster interactions through pre-verified data</p>
<p>Full digital wallet functionality allows you to hold and share verifiable data and identity information inside a digital credential —&nbsp;a “verifiable” credential. With verifiable credentials you can be cryptographically confident in who you’re interacting with online. Unlike passwords, verifiable credentials automatically share who issued them and who is presenting them in a provable way, as well as whether any information has been altered since being created, making them impossible to copy or steal.</p>
<p>Because these credentials can prove who you are on their own, they remove the need for the customer to jump through hoops when accessing their account, such as passwords, MFA, security keys, and more, letting customers move right on to what they came for.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven Mobile SDK in action:</p>
<p>One powerful use case for verifiable credentials is Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations. A financial institution can do its full customer vetting for account creation, a business loan, or mortgage and issue them a credential containing the relevant information. This means that the customer can share that information in a way that is provable,&nbsp; removing the need to repeat the expensive KYC process.</p>
<p>Schools can <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-revolutionizes-adoption-of-open-badges/">issue credential-based diplomas</a> that allow students to share them without the need to reach back out to the school for verification; businesses can use them for both <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven-works-verifiable-credentials-for-frictionless-secure-employee-identification/">employee access management</a> and customer loyalty programs; countries can allow their citizens to share their resident status for all kinds of things from <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicios-digital-travel-credential-is-what-the-travel-industry-has-been-waiting-for/">travel</a> to paying bills to <a href="https://indicio.tech/digital-identity-and-the-public-sector-using-verifiable-credentials-to-manage-social-security/">proving residency</a>.</p>
<p>In short, once you’ve met your initial identity assurance requirements, verifiable credentials can eliminate redundant paperwork and data input, and provide a simpler, streamlined, better customer experience.</p>
<p>And the Proven Mobile SDK provides all the pieces you need. In a fraction of the time. On any application. In whatever language your team is familiar with.</p>
<p>If you would like to learn how to get started you can <a href="https://indicio.tech/mobile-software-development-kit/">read more about the Proven Mobile SDK</a>, or <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">reach out to our team.</a></p>

 What is Customer Authentication? 



<p>Customer authentication is a critical security process that identifies and verifies users before allowing them access to digital accounts. It’s built on login credentials established during user onboarding, utilizing a blend of knowledge-based (passwords), possession-based (security tokens), and inherence-based (biometrics) authenticators. The adoption of multi-factor authentication (MFA) has become standard practice, requiring users to provide multiple identity proofs to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.</p>



<p>This security measure is essential for protecting against common threats like account takeover attacks by ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information. Despite the prevalence of password-based systems, their effectiveness is compromised by common security pitfalls, such as the reuse of passwords. Therefore, more advanced authentication methods, including MFA and adaptive authentication, are increasingly important. These methods assess risk levels and adjust security measures dynamically, improving the security posture without compromising user experience. New technologies like FIDO2 passkeys and biometric authentication pave the way toward more secure, passwordless authentication methods, emphasizing ease of use and improved security.</p>



<p>Customer authentication is a crucial building block gatekeeper for user data and access in digital security. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, customer authentication methods have also undergone significant advancements, aiming to strike a balance between robust security and user-friendliness. This balance helps to ensure that authorized users can easily access the digital world while maintaining the highest level of security measures to protect sensitive information.</p>

<p>Munich, February 13, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, joins a consortium of five partners including the <a href="https://www.iota.org/">IOTA Foundation</a>, <a href="https://walt.id/">walt.id</a>, <a href="https://spyce5.com/">SPYCE.5</a>, and <a href="https://bloomwallet.io/">Bloom Labs</a> with the goal of making Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) and self-hosted wallets compliant with the European Anti-Money-Laundering Regulation and the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new TFR regulation in the EU mandates that all cryptocurrency transactions will need to carry identifying data of the sender and the receiver. According to the new rule, compliance with TFR is mandatory for all CASPs. Additionally, the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52021PC0420">new AML Regulation</a> will require all CASPs to comply with similar AML rules as other financial institutions. For example, when a user opens an account and registers a wallet with a CASP, an identification process is required to comply with the new AML Regulation and TFR.</p>



<p>One challenge for CASPs to adhere to the new rules lies in GDPR compliance, as personal identifiable information (PII) should not be stored on blockchains or Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT). However, to comply with the new regulations, CASPs need to know with whom they are doing business and continuously verify this information.</p>



<p>Raising trust and transparency in crypto asset transactions</p>



<p>To address this challenge, the partners have formed a consortium to propose a system where a trusted party tokenizes an identification process it has witnessed, allowing CASPs to have confidence in this process, without revealing any PII. The resulting soul-bound token (SBT) can be used for blockchain processes, enabling web3 native interactions. Furthermore, the trusted party can reveal the identity information, if requested by an authorized party, such as law enforcement, as well as revoke the SBT, if needed.</p>



<p>Within the consortium, the IOTA Foundation, a non-profit foundation supporting the development of the IOTA protocol, will provide the underlying network as the proposed solution will be implemented on an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible IOTA Smart Contract Chain. walt.id, a leading open source vendor of decentralized identity and wallet infrastructure, will develop, provide, and maintain the trusted witness service for creating and verifying SBTs like identity proofs, while IDnow will deliver the identity verification solution to onboard users into the wallet solution. Bloom, an all-in-one wallet for the IOTA, Shimmer and EVM ecosystem, will provide the capabilities for users to store, present and prove ownership of the SBT. SPYCE.5, specializing in the integration of hybrid blockchain technologies, will provide the essential infrastructure for seamless interchain communication and transaction validation, ensuring the system’s overall efficiency and regulatory compliance.</p>



<p>Statements</p>



<p>“We are excited to be part of this forward-thinking consortium alongside highly esteemed crypto asset industry players to address a pressing need for crypto wallet solutions that comply with the latest EU regulations. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">Crypto companies</a> are facing a race against the clock to implement new requirements, which is why we wish to submit this proposed solution to the EU for consideration to address the technological and regulatory challenges around AML, KYC and TFR in crypto,” says Rayissa Armata, Director Global Regulatory and Government Affairs at IDnow.</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to be working with such incredible partners to create a truly seamless user experience and to provide the underlying distributed ledger technology. Identity verification in Web3 environments should be simple and straightforward, without sacrificing privacy or security. As regulatory requirements grow, we need innovative solutions that are easy to use for both businesses and everyday users,” says Dominik Schiener, Chairman of the Board of the IOTA Foundation.</p>



<p>“We have been building decentralized identity and wallet solutions for many clients across various industries, but this project is particularly interesting as it shows new ways of onboarding and verifying users for crypto and DeFi use cases that have traditionally been struggling with regulatory compliance,” says Dominik Beron, Founder of walt.id.</p>



<p>“Bloom is excited to be collaborating with the partners in this consortium. This project will ensure our users and the crypto ecosystem can benefit from a self-hosted wallet that complies with EU regulations,” says Nicole O’Brien, Co-founder of Bloom Labs.</p>



<p>“We’re proud to be part of this groundbreaking consortium, leveraging SPYCE.5’s hybrid chain architecture to navigate the complex landscape of EU regulations. Our innovative approach ensures not only compliance but also maintains the integrity and efficiency vital in the crypto space,” says Holger Köther, Managing Director of SPYCE.5.</p>

<p>A campaign to privatise NHS health data — your data — is now under way and building momentum.</p><p>It started in earnest in November 2023, when the Government handed a £330m contract to the US spyware firm Palantir to build a ‘federated data platform’ that will enable NHS trusts and regional health systems to share confidential patient information. Then, last week, The Times ran a front page story calling for the creation of ‘digital health passports’ which would take this process much&nbsp;further.</p><p>The week before that, former prime minister Tony Blair and former Leader of the Conservative Party William Hague joined forces <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/75ila1cntaeh/3pN0p29FVT0XV1FV9Up4MV/d2eaa86f106369827c3eed1b113c92ff/Tony_Blair_Institute_A_New_National_Purpose_-_Leading_the_Biotech_Revolution_January_2024.pdf">in a report</a> calling for the creation of an NHS Data Trust. This Trust would gather individuals health data from many different sources (e.g. NHS Trusts, GPs, care services, pharmacists), assemble it in one place and sell it to Big Tech firms in the private&nbsp;sector.</p> How to build a bandwagon <p>Bandwagons wreak untold damage by following these basic four&nbsp;steps:</p><p>1) Admit there’s a problem with something you’ve been stubbornly ignoring for years. The NHS tells us that its new Federated Data Platform is needed because, historically, data was “held in different systems that didn’t speak to each other, creating burdens for staff and delays to patient care” and making it “difficult to work at scale and share information”. People (including us at Mydex) have been complaining about this for&nbsp;decades.</p><p>2) Wax lyrical about all the benefits that would flow if this problem was addressed. The NHS promises that improved data sharing will “bring big benefits for patients by ensuring more joined up care, greater choice and improved health outcomes”.</p><p>The Times <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/24398476/times-health-commission_report_2024.pdf">Health Commission</a>, whose work is the subject of its front page article, tells us that by enabling patients to “have their health information digitally stored in one place any doctor treating them can access their records no matter where they are”. Patients would gain access to their own medical records, and be able to use the system as a gateway to book appointments, order prescriptions, view test results and contact&nbsp;doctors.</p><p>What’s not to like? We at Mydex CIC have been banging on about exactly these things for many years&nbsp;now.</p> Bait and&nbsp;switch <p>Then comes the crucial third step. 3) Propose a solution which seems to solve the problem but which doesn’t — which delivers an entirely different outcome instead. This is the crucial bait and switch; the secret sauce of every successful bandwagon.</p><p>The fourth step then follows so smoothly it’s almost automatic. 4) Use the excitement and enthusiasm generated for the benefits you are promising to implement the bait-and-switch solution — to deliver an entirely different outcome.</p><p>The likely end result in this case&nbsp;is:</p>  Huge amounts of available time, effort, energy and resources squandered on white elephant IT projects that never delivers their&nbsp;promise.  A raft of other ‘unintended’ consequences, such as handing over one of the country’s — and your — most valuable assets to big US tech monopolies.  <p>The trick with all such bandwagons is to exploit peoples’ best intentions — to harness their enthusiasm, commitment and energy — and to use this enthusiasm and energy for your own purposes, leaving them to suffer the consequences and clear up the&nbsp;mess.</p><p>In this case, it is absolutely right and necessary that available data is shared to generate more efficient joined up, seamless services that deliver better outcomes. But the solutions being proposed will do the exact opposite. Instead, they will neatly assemble our personal data into juicy packages and deliver them on a plate, ready and waiting for Big Tech vultures to&nbsp;pounce.</p> Real and pretend solutions <p>There are basically two different ways to share data: the centralised organisation-centric way, and the distributed, decentralised person-centric way.</p><p>This bandwagon is all about promising the benefits of the person-centric approach while delivering its opposite: recreating, deepening and extending the centralised approach that caused all of our current problems in the first place — only this time, at a higher, bigger&nbsp;level.</p><p>The organisation-centric centralised solution to the problem of data sharing has the following characteristics.</p>  It requires the Government to create vast new IT projects, which hand over hundreds of millions of pounds over to big US tech firms (such as Palantir). Such projects somehow never actually deliver what they were supposed to deliver, but always take far longer to complete and cost far more than their original projections.  It compounds rather than simplifies or eliminates the critical data logistics issues of how to move data from one provider to another (or provide access to this data) while a) ensuring its reliability and b) protecting the privacy of the individuals the data relates&nbsp;to.  It compounds rather than reduces the complexities and risks of managing consents, permissions and GDPR compliance, especially across borders. Proponents of these solutions always make a big point about patients being ‘in control’. But in reality, what they mean by this is that people will be bombarded with requests for permissions to access their data using processes that are both annoying and wide open to gaming — like the cookie pop-ups that plague our use of websites today. Meanwhile, they are disturbingly vague about who, exactly, would be able to access this data. (What do they mean, for example, by the word ‘researchers’?)  It limits the data that can be collected. As The Times Health Commission points out, one key problem with the current NHS Federated Data Platform is that it does not include GP or social care data, so even when it is implemented services will still not be properly integrated. The Health Commission therefore wants to go further, integrating data from GPs, NHS hospitals, pharmacies and social&nbsp;care.  <p>But even then, if your real goal is to address a person’s health, you would still be falling short. According to WHO, 60% of health outcomes are determined largely or mainly by lifestyle issues — data which health services do not collect. Which means that even if the Health Commission solution was implemented, many of its promises could never be realised.</p><p>But never mind. The bandwagoneers have an even better answer. In their proposals for the creation of an NHS Data Trust, Tony Blair and William Hague recognise this, talking of the need to integrate data about individuals’ “lifestyle, genetics, personality and physiology”, all of which could go into the individual’s ‘personal health account’&nbsp;… and put up for sale to private sector ‘researchers’ for the purposes of ‘commercialisation’!</p><p>What started out as a promise of citizen empowerment and seamless service provision somehow ends up as a Big Brother agenda for Big&nbsp;Tech.</p>  It limits the uses to which this data can be put. The biggest opportunity for improvement in health services today is not access to medical records per se but the organisation, coordination, planning, handovers and administration of all the activities that surround them. It’s about the ability to access and share exactly the right data at the right times. That requires a modular approach to data management, capable of instant and endless configuration and reconfiguration, that these centralised systems can never&nbsp;deliver.   Making real progress&nbsp;possible <p>Empowering citizens with their own data is the alternative approach to the problems the bandwagoneers are now claiming to address. Under this decentralised approach (which Mydex has been building for decades, and which is now live and operational) individuals are equipped with tools to collect all the data they need to manage their lives in their own database. This database remains directly under their control, in systems that work independently of the systems used by organisations that hold data about&nbsp;them.</p><p>These organisations deposit copies of key data in the individual’s personal data store. Individuals can choose to selectively share relevant portions of this data to service providers they trust and want to deal&nbsp;with.</p><p>This approach avoids all the problems associated with the new centralised systems now being campaigned for by the bandwagoneers.</p>  Far from requiring vast, expensive, time consuming new and risky IT contracts, the infrastructure already exists and can be implemented incrementally on a very low cost, case-by-case, test-and-learn basis.  It simplifies data logistics issues because it is designed at heart to enable automated data sharing (via APIs that create safe links between key data points) directly under the individual’s control (like a direct&nbsp;debit).  It simplifies issues relating to consents and permissions via standardised data sharing agreements that make it clear what data is being shared, with who, for what purposes. It builds implementation of human rights into the day-to-day operations of service provision.  It expands the range of data that can be collected, to include lifestyle data and data from other sources such as data from individuals’ own wearable devices. The only people able to see all of this data are the individuals themselves — because all the data is encrypted and only they have the encryption key that provides access to it. But they can share relevant bits of it whenever they need&nbsp;to.  It can simply be plugged into existing systems and services directly impacting operational delivery of health and care services, helping to heal the multiple flaws of the current organisation-centric approach.   Conclusion <p>It’s good that at last the great and good are beginning to acknowledge that instead of simply hoarding data, to streamline processes, create seamless services and deliver better outcomes, this data needs to be shared. The central question in health today is not whether we should do this, but&nbsp;how.</p><p>Elsewhere in Government, some genuine progress is being made. For example, the new UK Identity and Attributes Trust Framework envisages equipping people with their very own Personal Holder Service (personal data store) by which they can collect, receive, store and share data about their lives, where and when they want. These Holder Services give citizens agency and control while enabling safe, efficient, fit-for-purpose data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>What’s needed is new citizen-empowering data infrastructure such as this — infrastructure that tackles data sharing challenges at their root. But this is not what the bandwagoneers are proposing. Instead, they are simply offering more of the same, only at a different, higher level. Our health services and citizens need and deserve much better than&nbsp;that.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/beware-a-new-data-bandwagon-is-rolling-5eebf8501a42">Beware!

 We sit down with the romance fraud vigilante-turned-author to discuss the responsibility she feels for victims, why social media platforms need to be held more accountable, and why she put a photo of Keanu Reeves on the cover of her book. 



 



<p>Despite having a popular Twitter account (114,000 followers and growing), with the sole purpose of exposing romance scammers, Becky Holmes says she still gets contacted by hopeful, hapless fraudsters. In fact, she was contacted just 15 minutes before our interview.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Fortunately, a lot of them are not very observant, so I get to do what I do without too much recourse,” said Becky.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What Becky does is two-fold: She exposes the often-hilarious exchanges with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/romance-fraud/">romance scammers</a>, some of whom claim to be celebrities, and, more recently, provides a forum in which people can share their experiences and learn more about this increasingly common form of fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The conversation is clearly needed. Romance scams rose by <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202402/data-released-on-rise-in-romance-scams-as-valentines-day-looms">19% globally in 2023</a>. Considering only 58% of victims ever report the crime to law enforcement, that figure is likely to be much higher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Becky has just released her debut book, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Keanu-Reeves-Not-Love-You/dp/1789651638">‘Keanu Reeves is Not in Love with You’</a>, featuring first-hand accounts of victims, examples of scripts used by fraudsters, and a look into the psychology of fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the book itself only took nine months to write, the aim of helping people and raising awareness of the dangers of social media fraud began when Becky first joined Twitter (now X) in 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Almost immediately I got a flurry of messages from all these fabulously handsome men, and they were all immediately in love with me. They all said the same thing and were all from very similar looking men. Some were in the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/army-romance-scam">army</a>, and some were in pilots’ uniforms, and it was very clear that there was a pattern.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At first, I was blocking and deleting them and having a bit of fun by seeing how nonsensical I could be before they picked up on what I was saying. I began posting the exchanges on Twitter a few months later, and people found them funny and were laughing and we were all having a good time. Then, in 2021, quite a few victims of romance fraud got in touch with me and said that they’d been a victim and had lost a large amount of money. That’s when it all changed.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this interview, we discuss the different ways in which romance scammers tend to target men and women, the delicate balance in presenting information in a relatable, digestible format that does not undermine the danger and impact, and much more.</p>



 What were the main reasons behind becoming a ‘romance scam vigilante’? Did you ever become a victim yourself [i.e. transfer funds, or ‘fall in love’]? 



<p>So, I’m fortunate enough to have never been the victim of romance fraud. However, I was in a very coercively controlled relationship at one point, and the parallels between what victims of romance fraud go through and victims of coercive control are very similar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I ended up speaking on the phone with many victims and they said they hadn’t told anybody, and they didn’t know what to do. I hated the idea of people feeling lonely because I’ve been in that situation myself. So, I became kind of a sounding board for a few people and felt a responsibility.</p>



<p>Most had reported to Action Fraud but not heard anything back, so were in a very isolated place.&nbsp;I started realizing what a huge subject it was and how underreported it was, and it became like a passion project.</p>



<p>[Read more about the steps that the UK government is taking to address fraud, in our blog <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">‘UK declares war on fraud, calls on tech giants to join the fight.’</a>]</p>



 I see that many of the messages you share on Twitter are actual Twitter exchanges, in your personal experience, is this where romance fraud is most common? 



<p>No, I get messages on Instagram, on Twitter, and dating sites are, of course, rife with them. I’ve also heard about people receiving messages on TikTok, and bizarrely, if you play online games, romance fraudsters are lurking there too. Whatever platform it is, the one thing they immediately want to do is to take you to WhatsApp or Google Chat. I have a separate Google Chat account where I have these exchanges.</p>



 Romance scams target both men and women. Are there any differences in approaches? 



<p>Although I never view stats as&nbsp;wholly reliable, statistically, romance fraud targets men and women equally. I want to stress that not all women are approached with the promise of romance and men with the promise of sex, but more men do tend to be victims of sextortion. Sextortion is when you have exchanged intimate images with somebody, and that person then blackmails you. For example, a married man with kids or a high position at work will send images to someone [who is almost certainly not a Russian model], and the recipient will then reply and say that they’ve hacked into your Facebook and can now see your children’s Facebook accounts, and your colleagues’ accounts, and that’s when the requests for money start.</p>



 It’s the old adage, isn’t it, and, of course, there’s a danger of generalizing, but men are more led by what they see, and women by what they hear. 



<p>That’s right, although the example that I use in the book is of a lady who believed she was in a relationship with somebody, but very quickly realized it was a scam. When she ended the relationship, he said, “Yes, you’ve caught me. I’m not this person, but I’ve got your images. I know who your children are on Facebook.” He extorted about £14,000 from her. With that case, she never tried to get the money back, or go to the police as she had grown up children and grandchildren, and even though I assured her that the police would keep such investigations confidential, she was terrified her family would find out.</p>



 I once <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy-limitations-police/">interviewed an ex-police officer</a> who believed the danger of romance scams/ pig butchering is how it often leads to more serious forms of deception, and often spoke about the biggest hurdle being the perception of fraud, with many people not taking it as serious as, say, burglary. What is your opinion on how fraud is perceived in the UK? 



<p>So, as you’ll know, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pig-butchering-scams/">pig butchering scams</a> originate from Southeast Asia and this is an area where human trafficking is rife, because during COVID people with good computer skills were offered jobs and taken to scam compounds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, in some cases, it’s very cruel for both sides – even the name, ‘pig butchering’ and likening it to fattening up a pig for slaughter is just so repulsive.</p>



<p>However, it’s hard for me to think of the majority of romance fraudsters as victims. I’ve spoken to a couple of scammers and most of them are definitely not being trafficked. Sometimes it even becomes a racial issue. One scammer from Ghana told me it’s a way of getting back at the West for everything that’s happened to them over the centuries, which is a ridiculous excuse because he’s not putting the money into rebuilding parts of his home, he’s spending it on trainers and luxury goods.</p>



 Are there any anecdotes that have stuck with you and that you would like to share? 



<p>I’ve heard of people taking their own life, which you can understand if they’ve lost absolutely everything and are in the depths of depression. Some of the pig butchering scams, which leverage fake investment platforms are technologically very impressive. Regarding stories that have stuck with me, there was a lady who contacted me after seeing my Twitter and we spoke on the phone quickly after. She told me she had stage 4 cancer and had lost a fortune to this one guy. She knew that he was a fraudster; he’d admitted it, but she was still sending him money because she felt this bond with him. </p>



<blockquote><p>I remember her telling me that the only time her son will know what’s happened is when she dies, and he sees that he’s got no inheritance.</p> Becky Holmes, author of ‘Keanu Reeves is Not in Love with You’ </blockquote>



<p>I interviewed her, and then a few months later, as I was getting closer to submitting the book to the editors, I messaged her and asked if we could we meet up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>She replied and told me she was in a hospice, but that she really wanted to stay strong for the book launch, and I told her don’t worry, we can talk about this another time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few days later, I received a message from her Twitter account, and it was from her son saying his mum had passed away, but that he had seen our exchanges, and knew she had lost money. He wanted to know what on Earth had happened. I remember calling him at about 9pm one Friday night and explaining what had happened to his mum and where this money had gone. The saddest thing for me was how lovely her son was. He said how he wasn’t angry with his mum; he was just devastated that she hadn’t confided in him. It’s heartbreaking to think how many people don’t confide in family and friends when they will probably get the same understanding reaction. There is nothing to be ashamed or embarrassed about.</p>



 



 
 
 It’s a delicate balance to strike, between presenting this information in a relatable, digestible format, and in a way that undermines the danger and impact of romance fraud.  



 How did you decide the best way to set the tone in raising awareness of the scourge of romance fraud? 



<p>So, the feedback to the book has been exactly what I’d hoped it would be. People have said they’ve been able to digest it because it’s readable and funny, but I’ve also shared the victim stories, and explained what happens in some of the countries.</p>



<p>Humor to me is a really good way of bringing to life what can be quite a dry subject. Often when people talk about fraud, everyone in the room switches off, and so I think as long as it’s never seen as humor at the expense of the victims [which I’ve never been accused of], then it’s fine.</p>
 



 
  Becky Holmes, romance fraud vigilante  
 
 



<p></p>



 One thing that surprised me from researching for this interview you was the sheer number of ‘celebrity’ scams. This has never happened to me [yet!]. How common is it? 



<p>Well, I never received a message from a celebrity on a dating site, but Twitter and Instagram are crammed full of them. My book is called ‘Keanu Reeves is Not in Love with You’ because Keanu Reeves is not on any form of social media, and yet he is the most impersonated celebrity. Particularly on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Something I always get asked is why anybody would send money to an apparent multi-millionaire. The fraudsters have come up with new ways of getting money from people under the guise of being a celebrity. One of the most common is that they will say they really want to meet the person, but their manager is a bit of a tyrant, and when the celebrity next comes to the UK, the manager wants to set up a series of meet and greets, all, of course, at a cost. Another effective approach is when they say that they are raising money for a charity. Then, even if you just send £10, you’re considered a viable target.</p>



 People exposing scams sometimes face repercussions. Do you ever fear for your safety? 



<p>I’ve had some death threats. Once, when a scammer asked me for money, I agreed and asked for him to send me his bank account details. Noticing it was registered in the United States, and obviously not his account, I contacted the bank and told them what it was being used for, and it was shut down. Obviously, as only a day had passed between him sharing his details with me and the account being closed, he knew it was my doing. So I received some horrific abuse and threats then.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, as I’ve spent so long researching this topic, I’m aware that a lot of these fraudsters are outside of the UK so have never been too concerned. Having said that, a lot of people will have links to the UK, so I never take my safety for granted.</p>



 How much do you hold these platforms accountable? Do you pass on the scammers’ details to relevant authorities, and how involved are you in the prosecution etc? Do you think enough is being done to crack down on this type of fraud? 



<p>Well, I mean certainly more could be done. It’s difficult, Jody, because a lot of the fraudsters are very technologically advanced and always seem to be one step ahead. I also hold the social media platforms accountable. In Nigeria, romance scammers are called the Yahoo Boys, and they even have their own Facebook group with almost 13,000 active members. Now I’ve reported the page, as have many other people, to Facebook, but it’s never been taken down. When the key word of the group is categorically associated with fraud, how is that allowed to stay up?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Facebook should be 100% be held accountable. I think it’s outrageous. Twitter and Instagram are slightly better because they’re quite good at taking accounts down when they’re reported.&nbsp;However, all you need is for somebody to set up a new email address, and they’re straight back on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Elon Musk removing the blue tick from Twitter is a fraudster’s dream. Suddenly you have an influx of people pretending to be celebrities who don’t need a blue tick anymore. I obviously hold the fraudsters most accountable, but I do think the platforms have a duty to be looking at this more carefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s pointless me pointing out Twitter profiles of people because they’ve been kicked off the platform before, and they don’t use their real names either. I’ve also been told by UK police that if a WhatsApp number, for example, is out of UK jurisdiction, there is pretty much nothing they can do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>40% of all crime in this country is fraud, and yet police dedicate just 1% of resources to combat it,&nbsp;so, they’re not going to use that 1% trying to find somebody overseas.</p>



 Certain platforms, such as LinkedIn are experimenting with an identity verification step, although it is not yet a mandatory requirement. Perhaps because they do not want to alienate their customer base? 



<p>Yes, some dating platforms also require an identity verification step, where you have to wave your hand to show you’re a living person; however, what’s to stop a fraudster just doing that? So, more can be done, absolutely. I know the CEO of the <a href="https://theodda.org/">Online Dating &amp; Discovery Association</a>, and I do know that they take it very seriously, and steps are being taken. For example, if a fraudster is swiping right on every single woman’s profile in the hope that somebody connects, the ODDA will pick that up.</p>



 How much do you keep in contact with victims after they’ve messaged you? 



<p>I count three or four of them as friends now. A lot of these women that I speak to are people that I would naturally gravitate to. They are intelligent, interesting women, and people that I would like to be friends with, and they’re kind as well, and we could all do with some kind friends, couldn’t we?</p>



 Technology offers great opportunities to flag problematic behavior and identity users, thereby creating safer online environments, but it is also a double-edged sword. With the advent of AI-generated content like deepfakes, how optimistic are you regarding the future of romance fraud? 



<p>I fear for the future. A lot of romance fraudsters will pretend to be in the army or on an oil rig or a doctor or a surgeon working abroad, which they’ll use as an excuse for not being able to speak to somebody. This reluctance to video call can be a major red flag. But now, fraudsters will be able to transpose someone’s face over their own face and talk naturally. It’s terrifying.</p>

<p>But although MFA makes organizations – and their users – feel safe, cybercriminals are constantly evolving their technologies and practices to get around this additional layer of security. Some of these methods rely on driving <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/posts/2024/mfa-bombing-dismantled.html">MFA fatigue</a>, but others are more insidious and seek to bypass the protection offered by MFA altogether.

<p>While breaches targeting identity as the initial attack vector are on the rise, with increasing success and significant financial and reputational damage inflicted, IdPs are quickly becoming the attack vector of choice. Attackers maximize the payload by infiltrating the most critical system in your organization designed to secure access to all your company and customer data.</p>
<p>The Threat in Context</p>
<p>Once a user with access to the organization’s IdP is compromised through an account takeover (ATO) attack, detection becomes increasingly difficult. The attacker gains persistence within the network, infiltrating multiple critical systems and applications. This enables them to cause damage over long periods of time.</p>
<p>One such <a href="https://www.cio.com/article/657106/what-you-need-to-know-about-oktas-security-breach.html">attack recently compromised an IdP vendor</a> through their customer support systems. The attack supposedly took place when a customer support user was logged in to their personal Google account and stored their username and password for their service account within Chrome. The attacker had compromised the employee’s Google account, thus gaining access to the credentials to the customer support system. Once access to the support system was gained, the attacker then used session tokens and cookies stored in the HTTP Archive (HAR) files (which were used to troubleshoot issues with the IdP) to access the customer’s network and deploy ransomware and/or exfiltrate data.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://ca.news.yahoo.com/mgm-resorts-hackers-broke-tricking-111102542.html">attack took place at a large entertainment and hospitality chain</a> when an attacker used social engineering to gain access to information about a high-value target (user with privileged access to critical systems including their IdP). The attacker then contacted the IT support helpdesk requesting a reset of the high-value user’s MFA credentials. They provided all the required verification information obtained through the social engineering attack, enabling them to install their own MFA authenticator. The attacker was able to establish persistence within the organization’s network, gaining access to critical systems.</p>
<p>Securing Access to IdPs and Taking a Layered Approach</p>
<p>These examples showcase the need to secure access to IdPs with high assurance authentication. Privileged and high-value users with access to critical systems must use a high assurance passwordless authentication mechanism such as X.509 certificate-based authentication (CBA) when authenticating themselves. Enforcing CBA for users as well as devices ensures that the user is not logging in to critical systems on an unmanaged device. By enforcing CBA and eliminating passwords, organizations can defend against common identity-based attacks such as phishing and MFA bypass targeted at their privileged users. In addition, taking a layered approach to security is recommended, with risk-based adaptive access that can evaluate contextual information to dynamically grant or block access based on risk levels when authenticating to an application or service.</p>
<p>As we saw with the attack on the large entertainment and hospitality chain, protecting against these attacks during authentication is not enough; the processes of user registration or password/MFA reset requests must also be secure. By implementing identity proofing through identity verification of physical credentials such as passports and driver’s licenses, organizations enhance their security protocols. This is particularly valuable in processes such as resetting MFA credentials, registering or onboarding new users, or implementing step-up authentication for out-of-policy users or high-value transactions.

<p>Modern card issuance operations have embraced advanced technology, replacing outdated manual methods like clipboard monitoring. Today, operators and managers no longer jot down notes as they walk the floor; instead, they use digital platforms. Alerts, achievements, and operational details are instantly communicated across locations, giving operations executives real-time data to monitor machine performance and critical issues without leaving their offices. The shift to automated data analysis allows operators and technicians to access information from tablets anytime, anywhere, ending the need for manual charting. Additionally, aggregated machine intelligence provides a comprehensive view of plant productivity and cost-effectiveness in real time across multiple sites for an entire corporation.</p>
<p>These advancements are commonplace today, as <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/scm/industry-4-0/what-is-industry-4-0.html">Industry 4.0</a> cements itself in manufacturing history. It’s no surprise that digital intelligence brings increased efficiency and ROI opportunities to the forefront of smart card manufacturing. The <a href="https://www.entrust.com/issuance-systems/products/software/adaptive-issuance-production-analytics-solution">Entrust Adaptive Issuance™ Production Analytics Solution</a> is a software and technical consulting platform built on delivering this value proposition to card personalization operations through a customizable, real-time, aggregated architecture. It continues to drive next-generation smart manufacturing, bringing positive Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and enhanced value to operations. OEE is expressed as a percentage sum of three key production indicators: availability, performance, and quality. Let us take a closer look at each and how they bring a deeper understanding to issuance environments, focusing on net losses:</p>
 
 Availability 
 
 Availability is the percentage of planned production time the operation is available to run. It is the ratio of Run Time to Planned Production Time and considers loss, which includes events that stop planned production. Run Time is defined as the total time when machines are used for production in a running state, excluding idle and pause. Planned Production Time is defined as the total calendar time for the measurement period minus planned downtime, such as maintenance tasks, changeover, holidays, and shift breaks. Availability Loss includes any unplanned stops such as idle time, equipment failure or material shortage, and planned stops as noted above. 
 
 Performance 
 
 Performance percentage is the actual total production output compared to theoretical perfect production output, which is calculated using the machine’s maximum cycle speed. A perfect performance score would mean machines are always running at maximum speed when active. Total Production is defined as the total number of cards processed, which includes both good and rejected cards. Maximum Machine Throughput is defined as the maximum machine speed in cards per hour, also considering that throughput could be reduced based on the total number of modules used. Performance Loss includes anything that causes the manufacturing process to run at less than the maximum possible speed when it is running. Examples of things that create Performance Loss include machine wear, inferior materials, line misfeeds, and jams. 
 
 Quality 
 
 Quality is the number of good units produced as a percentage of the total units started. A perfect quality score indicates that all products are good: successfully manufactured the first time, and no rejects were produced. Simply and more realistically, total production equals good production + rejected production. Quality Loss accounts for manufactured parts that do not meet quality standards as defined by the operation. Examples of Quality Loss include scrap and rework. 
<p>Net Losses</p>
<p>Net Losses for all three production indicators can be explored further here from <a href="https://www.oee.com/oee-factors/">Vorne</a> as variations in issuance type, facilities, and machines contribute to loss variability. <a href="https://www.oee.com/oee-six-big-losses/">The Six Big Losses</a> are also common in issuance operations and include: unplanned and planned stops, small stops, slow cycles, production rejects, and startup rejects.</p>
<p>To learn more about OEE and the three key production indicators, measurement &amp; analysis, and calculating speed and efficiency, read our white paper, <a href="https://go.entrust.com/production-analytics-solution-wp">“Understanding Production Efficiency in High-Volume Card Issuance Operations.”</a></p>
<p>The Future of Digital Intelligence and Production Analytics</p>
<p>Machine learning and artificial intelligence are expected to revolutionize the industry further. These technologies will be integral in production planning, inventory management, resource planning, and cost analysis. Next-generation Industry 4.0 subject matter experts will take the output from these technologies and use it to make improvements across operational architectures, building more efficiency into the process. Digital intelligence can be used to mitigate operational bottlenecks, quality gaps, and overall line inefficiencies by focusing on the three key production indicators.</p>

 About Podcast Episode 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Note: This episode isn’t an introduction to DIDs; for those new to the concept, we recommend revisiting <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/decentralized-identifiers-did-methods-did-documents-did-resolution/">Episode 52</a> of the SSI Orbit Podcast for a foundational understanding.</p>
<p>In this podcast episode, we dive deeper into the world of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), moving beyond the basics to explore the critical aspects that will influence their trust and adoption.</p>
<p>Today, joined by Marcus, we embark on a detailed discussion framed around a SWOT analysis of DIDs, examining their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Our goal is to foster a comprehensive conversation that not only highlights the significant advantages of DIDs but also addresses the challenges and potential pathways to their widespread acceptance. We delve into the nuances of DIDs, aiming to contribute to the broader goal of promoting their adoption.</p>
<p>We aimed to follow the SWOT model, though it proved challenging at times due to the nuanced nature of many topics. Interestingly, what some may perceive as a strength could also be seen as a weakness, leading to a blend of perspectives. This complexity added depth to our discussion, making it particularly engaging!</p>
<p>The full list of topics discussed between Markus and I in this podcast include:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 [00:47] Comparison of DIDs to Other Verifiable Identifiers: Exploring how DIDs contrast with other types of verifiable identifiers and their benefits over traditional identifiers like email addresses and phone numbers.

 Terminology 
<p>Digital Identity: An amorphous concept attempting the impossible job of capturing all that a human is in digital form, leading to many years of disappointing national projects and draft bills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital ID: A single attribute or fact about an entity, represented digitally, that is relevant in one or more specific contexts.</p>
 A big little shift in terminology&nbsp; 
<p>The draft Australian federal <a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/have-your-say/2023-digital-id-bill-and-rules-submissions">Digital ID Bill</a> no longer uses the phrase “digital identity”. The same shift in language has been made by the <a href="https://nab.com.au">National Australia Bank</a> (NAB) in its year-long <a href="https://news.nab.com.au/news/digital-id-trust-who-you-choose-and-choose-who-you-trust/">multi-sector design collaboration</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both the NAB and the Australian government now refer to Digital ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This change is much more than semantics. I hope it reflects a recognition by government that identification is different from identity, and there is no universal way of identifying people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NAB has highlighted that businesses and agencies are usually less interested in verifying “identity” than a particular attribute or eligibility. The bank’s <a href="https://news.nab.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NAB-Digital-Identity-Roundtable.pdf">roundtable report</a> states “it is very rare that individuals need to prove who they are” and instead suggests a reframing of digital identity around “what do we need to know about an individual for a particular purpose”; that is, the process of identification in all its local variations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what does Digital ID mean? Well, it’s just shorthand for a credential in a certain context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reckon everyone knows what it means to be asked to “show some ID”.&nbsp; We effortlessly interpret “ID” in context, whether it’s proof of age at a bar, a student card when sitting an exam, or an employee ID when entering the office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re also familiar with the formal identification process carried out when opening a bank account or starting a new job. In these cases, we are generally asked to provide a number of IDs, from a pretty universal set of options including driver licence, birth certificate, Medicare card, passport and so on. And there are alternative forms of ID for people who need them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Fresh thinking; new precision 
<p>None of these IDs constitute our identity. And that’s how we like it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a rule, we should ask for and reveal as little personal information as possible, within the requirements of the transaction we’re doing. As the Canadian digital identity leader <a href="https://trbouma.medium.com/less-identity-65f65d87f56b">Tim Bouma once said</a>, “I want my identity to be less than the real me”.</p>
<p>Digital ID is concrete, specific and familiar. But “digital identity” is abstract and open-ended. It means different things to different people. Invariably, digital identity is interpreted as a new universal means of proving who we are. But there is no such thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So instead of imposing new identification standards and novel “digital identity” on Australians, the Digital ID Bill simply creates a governance regime to improve the quality and reliability of existing IDs when converted to digital form.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Australian Government Digital ID System (AGDIS) will conserve the meaning of existing IDs and leave businesses and agencies free to conduct identification as they see fit. The Digital ID regulator is being tasked to create rules and technology standards, with a view to fostering a marketplace of vastly improved digitised IDs.&nbsp;</p>
 Best in class 
<p>I believe the AGDIS represents world’s best practice in digital identification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AGDIS rules (to be developed after the Bill is enacted) will almost certainly embrace mobile phone digital wallets as carriers of Digital IDs. A large and fast-growing proportion of Australians are now familiar with using their payment cards in mobile wallets to “tap and pay” and “click to pay” (the Reserve Bank reports that <a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/annual-reports/psb/2023/the-evolving-retail-payments-landscape.html">35% of card payments are now made via mobile wallets</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The equivalent user experience of click-to-present any digital ID in context will be intuitive, widely available and vastly more secure than today’s plaintext handling of personal data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will be able to prove relevant facts about ourselves with the same security, safety and privacy as we prove our credit card details.&nbsp;</p>
 We’ve done this before 
<p>Smart payment cards (EMV chip cards) were introduced to replace magnetic stripe cards as they became vulnerable to skimming and counterfeiting. Chip-assisted presentation of cardholder IDs replaced the plaintext of a mag stripe and, as a result, essentially eradicated physical card fraud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the speed with which smart credit card IDs cut payment fraud, we can expect mobile technology Digital IDs to dramatically reduce identity crime via stolen personal data and, as a result, neutralise the personal data black market. </p>

<p>The modern work environment creates situations unthinkable a decade ago. Today, many employees will never step foot in an office or have face-to-face interactions with colleagues. While this flexible work model offers advantages for businesses as well as employees, it also presents significant security challenges, especially when it comes to reliable <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/identity-verification">identity verification</a>.</p>  
<p>Employee identity risk and fraud have skyrocketed in recent years. The <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220628">FBI recently warned</a> that fraudulent job applicants are using deepfakes and stolen PII to obtain remote work positions. “Bait-and-switch” schemes are also on the rise, where the person interviewed by a company is not the person who is actually hired. In the best case, companies end up hiring someone completely unsuitable for the position. In the worst case, they onboard and provide access to cybercriminals who can install malware, steal confidential and privileged information, and more.</p> 
<p>The risks go far beyond hiring and onboarding. Just this week, a multinational finance firm revealed that an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html">employee was tricked into making a $25 million wire transfer</a> by deepfake video and audio. The thieves used AI-generated likenesses&nbsp; of the company’s CFO and other known colleagues in a live video conference with the finance worker.</p> 
<p>Know Your Employee (KYE) ensures that your employees are who they say they are.&nbsp;</p> 
 What Is Know Your Employee (KYE)?  
<p>Know Your Employee, commonly abbreviated as KYE, is the process of verifying the identities and backgrounds of an organization’s current workforce and prospective new employees. KYE aims to ensure that employees are who they claim to be, and do not have a criminal background that poses an undue risk.</p> 
<p>The KYE - Know Your Employee process continues past initial hiring and onboarding. Effective KYE involves continuous monitoring and regularly updating and reviewing employee information to identify any potential risks that may arise.</p> 
 KYE vs. KYC  
<p>Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Employee (KYE) are two essential processes in the realm of compliance and risk management. KYC verifies customer identities to determine if they are who they claim to be and discover any potential risks, ensuring adherence to anti-money laundering (AML) and other regulations. In contrast, KYE involves verification of employee identities and thorough background checks to reduce the risk of employee fraud and theft, and address internal compliance needs.</p> 
<p>Both KYC and KYE share the common goal of mitigating risks, upholding legal standards and preventing fraud. The main distinction is in their focus: KYC is customer-oriented, while KYE centers on internal workforce dynamics. KYC is a point in time process, while KYE should be a continuous process, throughout an employee’s tenure. Integrating both processes is crucial for a comprehensive risk management framework in business.</p> 
 The Growing Importance of Know Your Employee (KYE)  
<p>Identity verification poses an ongoing challenge for organizations. In fact, 40% of IT security experts named it a top identity security challenge in the <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/report-workplace-identity-security-trends-2024">2024 Workplace Identity Security Trends report</a>. This is likely to climb as new attack and fraud tactics make accurate <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/best-practices-for-identity-proofing-in-the-workplace">identity proofing</a> and verification increasingly difficult. A recent report by Onfido found a 3000% increase in deepfake attempts in 2023, thanks to face-swapping apps, generative AI and other readily available fraud tools.</p> 
<p>The risks go far beyond non-compliance. Employee fraud tactics such as interview fraud, bait-and-switch scenarios, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/employee-fraud-how-companies-can-spot-employees-outsourcing-their-jobs-2022-8">unauthorized outsourcing</a>, mean that the person doing the work may not be the person you interviewed or hired. This creates massive security risks for organizations.</p> 
<p>Moreover, identity risks persist throughout the employee lifecycle – not just at hiring and onboarding. The recent breach of MGM resorts succeeded because attackers were able to impersonate an employee and convince the IT help desk to provide them with credential access to the corporate IAM service. Robust, continuous KYE processes could have prevented the attack. In this evolving landscape, a comprehensive KYE strategy is crucial for organizations to stay ahead of emerging threats, ensuring the integrity of their workforce and safeguarding against potential malicious activities.</p> 
 Tips for Implementing Know Your Employee (KYE)  
<p>While every organization will approach KYE differently depending on their specific needs and structure, there are basic principles that hold across all workplaces.</p> 
 Employ Multiple KYE Verification Methods  
<p>A thorough KYE approach requires layering multiple verification methods — which ones, and when to invoke them, will depend on the risk level of the employee verification scenario as well as organizational and environmental risks at play. Verification methods include document verification, facial biometric verification, live video, chat verification, as well as passive signals such as device/endpoint and location detection.</p> 
<p>As we’ve seen, identity fraud techniques evolve rapidly — it’s critical that your KYE methods keep up. A robust KYE strategy should incorporate advanced technologies such as liveness detection to detect deepfakes and other AI-aided fraud.</p> 
 Make It Easy for Your Admins and Employees  
<p>It’s human nature to circumvent processes that add an unreasonable burden. When done well, KYE - Know Your Employee processes should be fast and easy for both employees and administrators alike. This means automating processes as much as possible, requiring the right level of identity verification for the scenario, and using technologies that people are familiar with, like their smartphones. Of course security cannot be sacrificed for usability.</p> 
 Continuously Monitor for Risk  
<p>Employee identity risks do not end with secure onboarding. Higher risk scenarios arise throughout an employee’s career. Resetting credentials, getting a new phone, logging in from unknown locations, gaining increased access privileges, personal financial problems, active cyberattacks — all can be situations of elevated risk. Your KYE controls should be ready to address these, taking specific measures according to risk level.&nbsp;</p> 
 Don’t Operate in a Silo  
<p>It’s critical that your KYE processes and tools are connected and synchronized to your <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/workforce-identity-assurance">workforce identity security</a> systems and HR system of record. The users accessing digital services may differ from the identities that IT believes they have. In other words, the digital identity may not match the real world identity. Your employee onboarding and identity verification procedures should be directly tied to your authentication processes, ideally using phishing-resistant, passwordless methods. As mentioned, it’s also important to invoke re-verification at certain times of increased risk. This means connecting your identity risk monitoring to your Know Your Employee (KYE) systems.</p> 
 Keep Up With Current Regulations and Compliance  
<p>In the current regulatory landscape, it's not just ethical but imperative for businesses across various industries to comply with applicable statutes and standards. The incorporation of a robust "Know Your Employee" (KYE) process is a key aspect of this compliance. These checks are vital for verifying credentials, ensuring workforce integrity, and meeting legal obligations.</p> 
<p>The consequences of non-compliance are severe, underlining the indispensability of KYE in any organization's overall compliance strategy. For example, a comprehensive KYE process is vital for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance, helping identify potential risks and preventing misuse of the financial system.</p>

<p>Holochain provides blockchains with auditable applications that can be tied to on-chain transactions, opening new possibilities for NFTs, DAO communities, and more.</p> Binding Wallets to Holochain Apps <p>We’ve developed a proof of concept for binding together Holochain agent keys with public keys on blockchains. Holochain uses a system of source chain validation to ensure that any action taken in an application is auditable, creating a secure environment for most application needs. By binding a Holochain agent with a public key in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), data created by the Holochain agent can be associated with the EVM key. This setup allows for unforgeable and bidirectional verifiability, facilitating provenance confirmation on both Ethereum and Holochain.</p> Validated Content for NFTs  <p>Rather than storing NFT payloads in unvalidated and/or centralized storage, with Holochain you can create and validate the payload and the reference for an NFT fully within a distributed context. The demo below shows that you can also manage the minting and transfer of the NFT from a Holochain app precisely because you can first bind your wallet to your Holochain agent. By storing payloads for NFTs in Holochain, you can circumnavigate the storage limits of blockchain, providing a more validated and ultimately more dynamic solution than other current implementations like IPFS. </p> Notaries and Oracles <p>Combining patterns from oracles and notaries with agent binding on Holochain opens up new ways to move between peer-to-peer systems via “cross-chain” proofs. </p><p>Smart contracts pre-authorize the public keys of agents from whom they will accept proofs. The proofs are signed verifications that reference actions or decisions taken in Holochain, all of which are also transparent and verifiable by any member of the application. This enables scalable but still verifiable sensemaking. </p><p>An example of how this could be used is with DAOs. Large scale voting on-chain is costly, both in gas fees and network traffic. But a voting app on Holochain can provide the trust and transparency of blockchain without the gas fees, and then the fully verifiable decision can be notarized creating a proof which is used to make a single on-chain transaction. The cost savings to both individual DAO members and the organization as a whole are potentially immense. This also provides greater flexibility as DAO’s can now afford to conduct all of their business in validated environments.</p><p><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/daos-why-sovereign-accountable-commons-might-be-better/">Explore other benefits Holochain brings to DAOs. </a></p> Data Storage  <p>Given the two examples above, you can see that what Holochain provides to blockchains is validated data storage. While the examples given talk about two major concerns for current blockchain development, you can store or interact with any data you choose to program into an application. Holochain is an incredibly flexible framework — the validation rules of each application can be customized based on the security and design needs of a particular use case. The combination of energy and cost efficiency, auditability, and flexibility makes Holochain a perfect choice for applications that need to interface with blockchain.</p><p>Plus, it’s all coded in Rust — with UIs using your favorite JavaScript framework — making it even easier for Ethereum devs to use and build with.</p> Learn More and Connect <p>Learn how Holochain can <a href="https://bit.ly/holochain-web3?ref=blog.holochain.org">extend Web3</a>, and get involved by introducing yourself to our team and community on <a href="https://bit.ly/A-New-Link-in-Web3-DEV-HC?ref=blog.holochain.org">Discord</a> or by joining one of our <a href="https://bit.ly/holochain-events?ref=blog.holochain.org">upcoming events</a>.</p>

<p>New technology is tough to explain sometimes. But Holochain isn’t reinventing the wheel. Rather, we are inventing the bicycle when all you have ever seen or used are wagons. </p><p>Holochain is built from familiar technical components and best practices, just as a bicycle is built from wheels, gears, frames, and steering mechanisms which all previously existed as basic forms or principles in other contexts. </p>Sum&gt;Parts: The key components of Holochain already existed, but we put them on a new frame<p>Our back wheel is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table?ref=blog.holochain.org">Distributed Hash Table</a>, similar to the ones used by <a href="https://www.bittorrent.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">BitTorrent</a> or <a href="https://ipfs.tech/?ref=blog.holochain.org">IPFS</a> to revolutionize peer-to-peer file sharing. This is the database structure that allows data to be transferred in the context of a distributed app.</p><p>Our front wheel is built on a lot of the same principles as <a href="https://git-scm.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Git</a> which pioneered <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-cloud-is-a-prison-can-the-local-first-software-movement-set-us-free/?ref=blog.holochain.org">local-first</a> version control as we know it today. While our local-first tools are built out of slightly different materials, the principle remains: Agents can always make local changes which then update the network when connected online. Not dissimilar to how the front wheel determines the direction of the bike. </p><p>These wheels are powered by a familiar device, the bike chain. Holochain’s <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/3_source_chain/?ref=blog.holochain.org">source chain</a> uses an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_chain?ref=blog.holochain.org">hashchains</a>, which were popularized by blockchains, to connect one action to the next, every action containing the hash of the last. Each agent has their own bike and so they each update their own source chain, independent of the actions of other cyclists. This provides mobility compared to the wide wagon of a single central chain. The beauty of bikes is their independence, the ability to act without everyone needing to be in the same wagon. </p><p>The handlebars that steer this contraption are also familiar. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography?ref=blog.holochain.org">Public/private key cryptography</a> used for cryptographic signatures is a staple of most processes on the web, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS?ref=blog.holochain.org">HTTPS</a>, to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol?ref=blog.holochain.org">Signal Protocol</a>, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell?ref=blog.holochain.org">SSH</a> which is used by devs everywhere to access remote machines. Alongside encryption, these keys <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate?ref=blog.holochain.org">act as the identity tools</a> which connect the user, the human riding the bike, to their actions on the digital road. Every action they take is signed, controlled through those handlebars, and only the rider is able to steer. </p><p>Holochain pulls together all of these time tested tools and reconfigures them to do something none of them can do alone. </p><p>We’ve been talking about Holochain from the perspective of the agent — the rider and their bike. But Holochain is an application framework. In this analogy, every application is a unique path that controls where a rider can go, what actions can be taken, and how data is formatted. We talk about this from the perspective of the rider because they get to determine which paths they ride. Riders bridge between paths, connecting them into personalized neighborhoods. Each new app increases the area that the rider can travel and grows an ecosystem of potential routes. Different paths take you to different places, but Holochain lets you move between them seamlessly. </p><p>The affordances of each road dictate what can be done on it. Wide roads let many ride together, small curvy paths mean you slow down, etc. In the same way, the application rules are baked in. Changing them would be the same as changing roads. </p><p>As a framework for peer-to-peer applications, Holochain is taking on some of the toughest challenges of distributed computing. Ensuring data is validated and secure without central servers, allowing for asynchronous action across a network, and keeping agents honest, are all hard tasks. But each individual piece of this puzzle already exists, we are just recombining them to offer new possibilities. </p><p>Holochain is built to allow any group to come together, develop a bike path, and each with their own bike traveling at their own pace, ride the path together. Many different bike paths can overlap and intersect, and riders get to choose their route through them — traveling freely and at their own will.</p>

  ESMA’s latest guidelines clarify that non-EU crypto firms can only serve EU residents when they request it&nbsp;first.  It prohibits crypto firms from providing any additional services unrelated to the initial request from their EU&nbsp;clients.  The draft guidelines seek to thwart any attempts by third-country firms to bypass the rules while also encouraging stakeholders to provide feedback to improve ESMA’s approach.  <p>Recently, the European Securities and Markets Authority <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA35-1872330276-1619_Consultation_Paper_on_the_draft_guidelines_on_reverse_solicitation_under_MiCA.pdf">published a consultation paper</a> discussing the draft guidelines on reverse solicitation <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/eu-parliament-greenflags-mica-potential-impact-on-the-crypto-landscape">under MiCA</a>. Here, reverse solicitation refers to a situation where third-country firms solicit clients in the European Union, directly or indirectly.</p><p>The ESMA’s main purpose with these guidelines is to specify when third-country firms can offer crypto services to EU clients and to prevent firms from circumventing the reverse solicitation rule.</p><p>The agency also aims for these guidelines to be consistent, efficient, and effective when rolled out for implementation. For that, ESMA has urged all stakeholders, including crypto-asset service providers (including from third countries) and financial entities dealing with crypto-assets, to respond to this consultation paper.</p><p>Responses should address the questions asked, provide explanations, and suggest alternative options for the ESMA to consider.</p> When are Non-EU Crypto Firms Allowed to Offer Services to EU Residents? <p>The latest ESMA guidelines say that non-EU crypto firms can provide their services to EU residents only when they request it. However, after the initial contact, the firm can’t offer more cryptocurrencies or related services unless they are related to what the client asked for in the first&nbsp;place.</p> Instructions for Relevant National Regulators <p>To ensure an interaction is genuinely initiated by the EU-based client, the guideline suggests regulators look at how and when the client approached the firm. Was it truly on their own, without any nudges from ads or&nbsp;emails?</p><p>The draft guidelines also provide instructions to national agencies on how to decide if a third-country firm is marketing a new kind of crypto asset or service. They suggest that national authorities look at two&nbsp;things:</p>  The type of crypto asset or service being&nbsp;offered.  The risks involved with the new crypto asset or&nbsp;service.  <p>It also notes that MiCA only mentions three crypto asset types (asset-referenced tokens, electronic money tokens, and tokens that don’t fall into these categories), and such broad categories might enable third-country firms to <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/navigating-regulatory-challenges-mica-and-the-defi-landscape">circumvent the rules</a>. So, ESMA urges relevant national authorities through these guidelines to:</p>  Monitor the marketing efforts that third-country firms deploy in targeting EU-based&nbsp;clients.  Conduct relevant consumer&nbsp;surveys.  Keep a tab on clients’ complaints and whistleblowing.  Cooperate with authorities, including law enforcement, as and when required.   Concluding Thoughts <p>Overall, the draft guidelines offer insights and guidance on when third-country firms can approach clients in the EU and provide strategies for detecting any attempts to bypass these rules. And since it’s a consultation paper, stakeholders are invited to share their feedback on ESMA’s approach, identifying any potential gaps or effectiveness concerns. Responses are accepted until April 29,&nbsp;2024.</p><p>______________________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>One way to understand governance as a component of decentralized identity is to look at identity verification and data sharing as an “ecosystem.”</p>
<p>An ecosystem is any use case where you have:</p>
 
 One or more parties issuing verifiable credentials for digital identity to people, organizations, or devices. 
 People, organizations, or devices who then hold the credentials to prove their identity and share data within the credential to other parties. 
 People, organizations, or devices, that need to prove the identity of those presenting verifiable credentials, and the data within their credentials to accomplish some goal. 
 
<p>In an ecosystem, participants are interested in the same kind of data to solve the same kind of problems. This could be who is allowed to access a facility, an operational system, a software application.</p>
<p>Governance makes this happen.</p>
<p>The governance authority establishes who can issue credentials. If there is only one issuer, say in the case of a company issuing employee credentials, the company is the governance authority.</p>
<p>The authority establishes:</p>
 
 who can be issued a credential. 
 who else can issue credentials 
 What information is going to be issued in a credential. 
 How that information is to be interpreted — if x, then y 
 How that information can be shared in ways to comply with data privacy regulations. 
 
<p>While there are other technical aspects to governance (choosing credential formats, DID methods, protocols, cryptographic key management etc), the key governance actions can be reduced to two workflows:</p>
 
 Which credentials can I trust? 
 What data needs to be presented and authenticated and how does it need to be presented? 
 
<p>These questions are solved by machine-readable governance. The governance authority publishes a file in a format that can be read by the software required and held by each participant in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Once you have an ecosystem for a specific use case, you can extend the governance to other use cases, depending on how robustly you have authenticated the person, organization or device that you issued the credential to.</p>
<p>Governance would enable a credential issued to an employee to access a hospital to also access a specific database or device. Governance could allow this credential to be used as a proof of identity for specific organizations that provide employee benefits. So you’ve gone, just through a simple addition of code, from opening a door to opening an insurance policy.</p>
<p>Two different hospital systems could agree and use machine readable governance to authorize doctors in one system to work in another.</p>
<p>The fact that these rules can be rendered in a machine-readable format makes implementation and updating fast and simple. You can rapidly reconfigure your ecosystem to manage new data and requirements.</p>
<p>And once you are able to use verifiable identity and data, the permutations are limitless. Governance makes all these permutations work and enables expansion and scale.</p>
<p>It turns trust into an actionable, valuable commodity.</p>

<p>Everywhere you turn, it seems there’s a new process, a new technology, and a new consumer preference that is “going digital.” More and more cardholders around the globe are preferring, and expecting, a digital-first payment experience. Because of the technology behind it all, IT professionals are at the center of this digital transformation. The pandemic accelerated an awareness of and migration to contactless and digital payments, and the payments ecosystem is now one of the fastest movers when it comes to digitization.</p>
<p><a href="https://go.entrust.com/quick-pulse-survey-infographic?_ga=2.95126300.1605869982.1705256759-491805133.1665679376&amp;_gl=1*hc75j8*_ga*NDkxODA1MTMzLjE2NjU2NzkzNzY.*_ga_6QRW66BW5T*MTcwNTI1NjM1MS42MzQuMS4xNzA1MjU2Nzc0LjQ0LjAuMA..">51% of U.S. cardholders</a> state that their mobile banking app is their preferred method to engage with their financial institution. This data shows us that customers are looking for seamless, digital-first payment and card management experiences. With that data guiding us, it’s clear an elevated and enriched issuance and payment enablement process is now the gold standard to meet the demand of cardholders.</p>
<p>Bridging Physical and Digital Experiences for Cardholders</p>
<p>That gold standard experience – providing a compelling, seamless digital card and payment experience – can help a bank to achieve <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/07/maintain-your-top-of-wallet-status-with-advanced-card-controls/">top-of-wallet status</a>. We learned in a <a href="https://go.entrust.com/quick-pulse-survey-infographic?_ga=2.95126300.1605869982.1705256759-491805133.1665679376&amp;_gl=1*hc75j8*_ga*NDkxODA1MTMzLjE2NjU2NzkzNzY.*_ga_6QRW66BW5T*MTcwNTI1NjM1MS42MzQuMS4xNzA1MjU2Nzc0LjQ0LjAuMA..">recent survey</a> among 1,000 U.S. cardholders that digital card controls in the banking app make the cardholder more likely to use the card as a default payment method. This has led to some banks going all-in with fully featured, integrated digital card solutions. Others, especially small to midsize banks, have asked their IT teams to implement some fundamental digital features as building blocks to their digital card platform – a foundation that can be enhanced and expanded by partnering with a digital card solution provider to offer cardholders a truly digital-first payment experience.</p>
<p>But financial institutions have different challenges when it comes to enabling intuitive yet secure digital payment options for their cardholders. The building blocks themselves, like choosing the right digital features, knowing which features are most requested by cardholders, and meeting the demands of different demographic groups, can be challenging to organize and understand. Similarly, it’s important to consider a solution that is scalable and future-proof to ensure the biggest ROI. Most IT teams have heavy resource constraints with a multitude of existing projects. Smaller financial institutions may find it difficult to build out their own digital card solution, while bigger institutions will think closely about the existing infrastructure in place. For example, by leveraging what they’ve already put in place and partnering with Entrust, a financial institutions’ IT team can answer the need for an even more digital and seamless customer experience.</p>
<p>Simplifying Digital Card Implementation</p>
<p><a href="https://www.entrust.com/issuance-systems/products/software/entrust-digital-card-solution">The Entrust Digital Card Solution</a> is a single mobile software development kit (SDK) that’s easy to implement and opens a world of possibilities. The entire menu of capabilities becomes immediately available, but with the flexibility and scalability to pick and choose the right configuration for your customers at that point in time, adding more capabilities seamlessly as the organization’s payments enablement strategy evolves.</p>
<p>This innovative strategy shifts an IT team’s highly complex digital-first strategy to a unified and simplified integration for digital payments enablement. Our SDK or web service integration aims to create faster time to value with minimal intervention on behalf of IT. Our implementation helps IT teams overcome common challenges like internal resources among small departments, total cost of ownership across multiple features, and time to market.</p>
<p>Choosing a solution developed by experts focused on the digital card makes adding new integrations for the cardholder a much smoother, less time-intensive process. Ultimately, these specific capabilities enable IT teams to focus on mission-critical initiatives while promoting a fully integrated digital card solution.</p>

<p>As digital transformation accelerates across industries, technology thought leader Philip Sheldrake brings an urgent yet nuanced perspective on constructing digital identity systems centered on human needs.</p><p>With a perspective spanning engineering, computer science, and involvement in decentralized projects, Sheldrake understands the intricacies of designing digital ecosystems.</p><p>However, through his interdisciplinary lens, he sees profound gaps in how identity gets formulated in computational realms versus lived human experience.</p><p>In the same way that the internet has brought a series of helpful technological advancements, it’s also brought unintended consequences.</p><p>For Sheldrake, identity may be the premier challenge to align digital progress with human flourishing rather than harm.</p><p>By drawing out insights from his expertise in bridging social and computer sciences, this article explores the past, present, and most hopeful future pathways for digital identity.</p> Understanding and Describing Identity <p>Even defining digital identity proves slippery, as technologist Philip Sheldrake explains:</p><p></p><blockquote>“It’s so difficult to actually even describe the space we're about to talk about. It's astonishing how few words have real meaning in this space.”</blockquote><p></p><p>Identity intersects technology, business, government, philosophy, culture, and our personal lives. Thus, no singular perspective captures its complexity.</p><p>Sheldrake notes, “There are just a few throwaway phrases that just mislead people because they're so ubiquitous, they hardly mean anything anymore.”&nbsp;</p><p>Concepts like innovation, transformation, and disruption get used to the point of losing meaning. Making progress requires bridging disconnected outlooks. For example, social scientists and computer programmers use distinctive language and assumptions, often talking past each other. Successful digital systems blend these varied perspectives and provide enough interdisciplinary expertise to clarify complexity.</p><p>Sheldrake brings decades of experience working across domains, from helping launch open source browser Firefox to involvement with Ethereum and decentralized technology projects. He sees identity as the crux where technology and humanity meet — for better or worse:</p><p></p><blockquote>“I am obsessed with the potential for digital technologies to lend a hand in human flourishing. Except that, so far, the experiment of the digital has thrown up as many negative externalities… as positive. Little things, you know, like undermining democracy.”</blockquote><p></p><p>The alluring promise of technology remains unfulfilled until we construct frameworks elevating both computer science innovations and social scientific understandings of identity.</p> Technology Changes Identity Dynamics Over Time <p>While databases and algorithms remain constant, the societal outcomes and experiences with digital systems transform remarkably across months and years. Sheldrake explains how innovations go through a “series of phases” regarding consequences as usage patterns and cultural incorporation structurally mature.</p><p>In the early days of social media, few guard rails for behavior existed, enabling exploratory identity play. Yet, as digital engagement became mobile and pervasive, external constraints tightened. Structures accreted, along with probabilities of harm.</p><p>Sheldrake gives the example of shifting sentiment around decentralized technology projects like blockchain. Initial optimism about democratization gave way to backlash concerning crypto’s environmental impacts. This reveals less about the fundamentals of blockchain itself changing and more about the emergence of unintended externalities at scale.</p> Contrasting Views on Identity <p>There are fundamentally different perspectives on identity in computer science and social science. Sheldrake points out, “In computer science...nothing is addressable in internetworking until it has an entity and identifier.”&nbsp;</p><p>Rigid constructs like legal identities and cryptographic claims of personhood dominate programming approaches.</p><p>Meanwhile, in sociology and psychology, “identity is a sense-making capacity...a process, it’s a verb.” Human identity lives between people and contexts, ever-negotiated through information exchange. Instead of static entities, constantly co-created meaning flows.</p><p>Sheldrake argues the clash stems from differing historical customers driving innovation, noting “the first customers of IT were large corporations and governments...IT served the bureaucracy, it was the definition of bureaucracy.”</p><p>Thus, digitization elevated standardized legal identities for taxation and service provision — not the nuanced, fluid identities enlivening human relationships outside institutional walls. Much gets lost in translation.</p> The Path Forward Requires New Perspectives <p>Progress on digital identity relies on transcending entrenched disciplinary silos to enable genuine dialogue and collective innovation. While compromising on decentralized principles proves difficult, rigidly decentralized systems similarly risk harm without weighing human needs.</p><p>Sheldrake argues identity resides in “getting social science and computer science and the humanities, kind of riffing off each other's best strengths, rather than allowing computer science to riff off its worst weaknesses.” No single expertise holds the answers alone.</p><p>He continues: “One of my mentors mentioned to me, the beginning of the 90s, the 20th century was all about disciplinary excellence, the 21st century will all be about the interdisciplinary or even the transdisciplinary, trying to fill in the gaps between the disciplinary knowledge.”</p><p>To sufficiently fill those gaps, technologies like <a href="https://www.holochain.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain</a> aim to bring individual sovereignty and collective capacity. While there isn’t a perfect formula for identity, the next wave of innovators can learn from how it’s translated digitally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/resources/analyst-report/2023-forgerock-identity-breach-report">five consecutive years</a>, the leading cause of breaches has been compromised credentials — in other words, the use of stolen passwords.

<p>Considering a decentralized identity (DI) solution? Is this your wish list:<br></p>



<p>✔️ You want to deploy DI capabilities in the simplest way possible.<br></p>



<p>✔️ You want to focus on your core business while leaving others to do the detailed technical work of deploying your DI solution.<br></p>



<p>✔️ You want to deploy your DI solution faster and at a much lower total cost of ownership (TOC) than other deployment models offer.<br></p>



<p>To have those wishes granted, you need a cloud-based, SaaS deployment model—a complete and managed solution that includes the deployment, management, maintenance, and support of DI services. In short, you need the Anonyome Platform.</p>



<p>Read our <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/12/delivering-decentralized-identity-service-offerings/">whitepaper</a> or continue here for the highlights.</p>



 More companies are turning to a SaaS solution for DI &nbsp; 



<p>For software providers and integrators, adding a DI infrastructure to their product lines presents many of the same choices they faced when integrating other system elements: for example, will we host our web servers in own own local data center using our own hardware? Or should we opt for the simplicity of leasing server space from a cloud hosting provider?</p>



<p>Both methods have benefits. Some companies enjoy the peace of mind that comes with controlling their own hardware and software stacks. Others—an increasing majority—find peace of mind comes from knowing that the hardware and software stacks are delivered and maintained through a contract model.</p>



<p>The contract model is often referred to as cloud hosting or the more formal Software as a Service (SaaS) model because the vendor provider deploys, manages, maintains, and provides support for the software.</p>



<p>Calculating the total cost of ownership (TOC) usually determines whether to use a SaaS or on-site deployment model. The key cost drivers for any software implementation are the costs of:<br></p>



 
 software application 



 hardware/hosting 



 staff required to deploy, manage, maintain, and support the application. 
 



<p><br>Any of those cost drivers that a company can successfully outsource become line items in a budget without the operational complexities imposed by on-site deployments.<br></p>



 The Anonyome Platform embraces the SaaS model 



<p>Many companies have calculated the inefficiency, complexity, and additional expenses of the traditional on-site software model and have opted for the simplicity of the SaaS model. In fact, the SaaS model has become the de facto standard for delivering software solutions and the Anonyome Platform was built to embrace this model.</p>



 <br>Here are 7 reasons why: 



<p></p>



 1. No upfront capital costs 







<p>With the SaaS model, the customer doesn’t have to bear the upfront capital costs of deploying a software solution or even contracting their own cloud provider. Instead, the SaaS vendor incurs these costs (e.g., hardware/hosting, software application, and IT staff hiring and training). This simplifies startup and operating costs for the customer, the customer only pays a monthly or annual subscription cost, and deployment is immediate.</p>



<p></p>



 2. Fast deployment 







<p>SaaS delivers an almost instant solution to the customer, which is far more attractive than waiting the many months typically required for deploying and testing in-house solutions. Anonyome provides a fully automated approach to deploying new environments for customers.</p>



<p></p>



 3. Vendor-provided maintenance and upgrades 







<p>In the on-site solution, a customer is on the hook for updating and applying security patches to the software and operating systems, and for performing compatibility tests with every change. On the other hand, in the SaaS model, the software vendor maintains and upgrades the software, which includes delivering new versions and security patching the hosted system to protect against security vulnerabilities.</p>



<p></p>



 4. No staffing requirements 







<p>Paying staff to research, design, integrate, test, finetune, and launch any system is a significant cost with in-house solutions—up to 75% of the overall costs, in fact. The SaaS model eliminates the staffing concerns for contracted services.</p>



<p>In new emerging areas such as DI, it may be extremely difficult to find new hires with the right skills. The Anonyome Labs’ team, on the other hand, is highly experienced and highly trained in DI technologies. Beyond the Anonyome Platform, we support the ongoing development of DI by:</p>



 
 helping to run three DI-focused blockchains 



 being an active contributor to the DI standards organizations 



 contributing source code back to the DI open source community. 
 



<p></p>



 5. No-fuss application scalability 







<p>With in-house solutions, the customer must think about infrastructure issues such as network bandwidth, database and server sizing before deciding whether to ramp up their solution. But customers using the SaaS model don’t have to think about the technical how of scalability, because it’s already done for them. This leaves them free to focus on their business strategy and when to scale for maximum revenue.</p>



<p></p>



 6. 24-hour software support 







<p>The service level agreement (SLA) is key to a SaaS solution because it outlines the reliable actions and response times a customer can expect should an issue arise. With Anonyome’s global workforce across multiple time zones, staff are always on hand to respond to priority issues, even after hours at the customer’s site.</p>



<p></p>



 7. High level security and privacy 







<p>Under the SaaS model, the software vendor hires and trains people to maintain top security and privacy capabilities on the customer’s behalf, which is a significant resource saving.<br></p>



<p>DI is exploding as the new identity management solution</p>



<p>As you’d know, DI is the technology and standards that allow a new form of digital identity that works everywhere, is more trustworthy, and respects privacy. DI puts the user in sole control of the personal information that forms their identity. It’s decentralized because there’s no central authority or single issuing agent.</p>



<p>According to June 2023&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/plotting-the-roadmap-for-digital-identity-us-organizations-are-set-to-embrace-decentralized-identity-301865810.html">figures, </a>more than&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/05/7-insights-into-progress-on-the-path-to-decentralized-identity-dr-paul-ashley/">62 per cent</a>&nbsp;of US companies plan to incorporate a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/05/7-insights-into-progress-on-the-path-to-decentralized-identity-dr-paul-ashley/">DI </a>solution into their operations, with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/plotting-the-roadmap-for-digital-identity-us-organizations-are-set-to-embrace-decentralized-identity-301865810.html">74 per cent</a>&nbsp;likely to do so within a year.</p>

<p>Centralized identity models are no longer sufficient to safeguard against exploitations from either rogue internal operators or external bad actors. DI has stepped into the breach, because:<br></p>



 
 DI is safer: Without central storage of credentials, DI presents much less risk of credential theft or other operational issues for the customer as custodians of sensitive data. 



 DI streamlines process:Organizations no longer have to repeatedly collect and distribute data, and sign-up and sign-in processes are faster because there’s no need to duplicate efforts and approvals. 



 DI gives individuals control over data:The customer controls their own data, which reduces risk, unifies user experience, and boosts their satisfaction. 



 DI reduces the compliance burden: The system eliminates manual error and inconsistent and redundant data distribution and validation. 
 



 The Anonyome Platform specializes in DI (and much more) 







<p>The Anonyome Platform does three things we know enterprise customers want:<br></p>



 
 Very quickly deploys DI capabilities in their application environment 



 Handles the deployment, management, maintenance and support of the DI solution 



 Allows the customer focus on high-level strategy instead of the technical intricacies. 
 



<p>Within the DI offering, the Anonyome Platform has five licensable products:</p>



 
 White label mobile DI wallet: A standalone mobile application for iOS and Android, a user can use the mobile DI wallet for DI interactions and storage: creating storing cryptographic keys; and creating connections for receiving, holding and presenting verifiable credentials. It interacts with verifiable credential issuers and verifiers, and supports both AnonCreds and W3C Credential formats. 
 



 
 Mobile native DI wallet SDK: For customers who want to add the DI wallet functionality to their own mobile application, this native mobile SDK provides the capability for storage; creating cryptographic keys; establishing connections; and receiving, holding and presenting verifiable credentials. 
 



 
 Verifiable credentials service/SDK/sample apps: This service establishes connections with DI wallets, issues verifiable credentials, and requests and verifies presentation proofs from DI wallets. It supports both AnonCreds and W3C Credential formats. 
 



 
 Relay service/SDK: This service introduces an always-on capability for a mobile DI wallet. Implemented as a cloud service, the relay service provides mediator capability for incoming/outgoing verifiable credential and other messages, so that sending and receiving is not limited to when the client implementations of the mobile DI wallet and SDK are online. 
 



 
 Governance framework:This framework empowers DI network participants to enforce rules while staying true to the tenants of DI. Organizations can define and enforce governance rules associated with their ecosystem, including which wallets, issuers, and verifiers are trusted and which credentials can be used and requested. 
 



<p>In addition to the current Anonyome Platform DI products, we are also developing:</p>



 
 Enterprise DI wallet: A combination mobile wallet application and cloud wallet, the enterprise DI wallet manages credentials associated with the enterprise. Differing from a personal DI wallet, the enterprise DI wallet is intended for one or more users to use simultaneously and to be inheritable by a future occupant of a particular job or position within an enterprise. 
 



<p>The Anonyome Platform is a SaaS-based, API-first developer platform of individualized services<br></p>



<p>Also known as the <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, the Anonyome Platform offers a set of DI, privacy, and cybersecurity services and SDKs that developers can add as capabilities to their existing or new applications.</p>



<p>When a customer has licensed one or more of the Sudo Platform services, we create a new Sudo Platform deployment instance for that customer, which contains their specific licensed services. One of Sudo Platform’s unique features is it doesn’t use a shared deployment model (common for SaaS environments). Rather, Sudo Platform deploys environments individually for each customer. This means the customer can customize the environment for their needs, and that customer’s data and processing are completely separate from those of other customers.</p>



<p>Once we have deployed and configured an environment for a customer, we maintain and support it, which includes updating and patching it, and monitoring it 24/7.<br><br><a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/12/delivering-decentralized-identity-service-offerings/">Now, head to our whitepaper for specifics on how the Anonyome Platform operates</a></p>



<p>Ready to start building?</p>



<p>Remember, we built&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;so you don’t have to, and we make it easy for you to make it your own. It’s a modular, turnkey collection of services including:</p>



 
 DI 



 Safe and private browsing 



 Password management 



 Virtual private network 



 Compartmentalization 



 Virtual cards 



 Open and encrypted telephony and email communications. 
 



<p><br>You can use one, some, or the entire stack to augment your established offerings with adjacent capabilities that dramatically increase value for your customers.<br></p>



<p><a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a> includes everything you need to quickly bring new products to market or augment existing products with value-add privacy and identity protection capabilities. It includes:</p>



 
 Developer-focused documentation 



 APIs 



 SDK source code via GitHub 



 Sample applications for test-to-deploy of various capabilities 



 Brandable white-label apps for quick go-to-market deployments.

<p>Recent reports from the FBI have shed light on the escalating cyber espionage activities orchestrated by state-sponsored actors, particularly those emanating from China. Case in point — the emergence of the Volt Typhoon botnet, as highlighted in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/feb/01/china-hacking-threat-us-volt-typhoon-botnet-fbi-warning">The Guardian</a> and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fbi-china-espionage-hacking-db23dd96cfd825e4988852a34a99d4ea">AP News</a>, underscoring the critical need to safeguard sensitive information and ensure the integrity of digital identities, now more than ever.</p>
 Understanding the Threat Landscape 
<p>The FBI’s warnings regarding the Volt Typhoon botnet and China’s espionage activities serve as a stark reminder of the sophisticated tactics employed by cyber adversaries. Coincidently, my last <a>blog</a> covered Midnight Blizzard – Russian nation state attackers on Microsoft. These threats pose significant challenges to national security and underscore the vulnerabilities inherent in identity verification and data protection. This also means the threat landscape is expanding.</p>
 Luckily, the Threat was Prevented 
<p>In this instance, the threat was thwarted before an incident occurred. In the case of the Midnight Blizzard attack on Microsoft, we were not so lucky. The warnings come as a shot across the collective bow for all organizations and serve as a reminder that this will not be the last time a foreign entity or any other hacker will target the vulnerable.</p>
<p>So, what are organizations to do to keep themselves out of the headlines? Not a huge surprise, but first we must all keep up with applying security patches and up-to-date versions of the OS and application layers. To restate the obvious, good system management hygiene is a must.</p>
<p>But the uncomfortable truth is that bad actors log in as frequently or even more often than using some sophisticated hack to gain access. Many organizations are minimizing dependence on passwords, but they are finding that the big challenge is addressing the many authentication use cases.</p>
<p>Windows Hello for Business conveniently supports passwordless access within the Microsoft platform, but try getting this to work with Mac OS, Linux or even your VPN. Domain controllers and virtual machines, for example, also continue to depend on passwords. To the delight of hackers, the resulting “passwordless strategy” resembles Swiss Cheese more so than it does a Swiss Army knife supporting the broad range of needs enterprise wide.</p>
<p>So, on the path to eliminating passwords it’s the diversity of information technology that needs to be managed, and for good reason. Most enterprise IT environments evolved over decades as did security standards. There should be little to no expectation that somehow magically all ways of authenticating into this morass would happen with some type of hand waving let alone a black box that effortlessly solves all unanticipated authentication use cases.</p>
<p>Identity, it turns out, isn’t sufficiently managed with a password, an SMS code or the knowledge of mother’s maiden name. This is not new … a long list of three letter acronyms including IGA, SSO, PAM, and IAM all recognize identity as a corporate asset that needs to be managed and governed. None, however, seem able to keep up with the unrelenting attacks using social engineering and pirated account credentials. You just need to read the headlines to know this.</p>
 Closing the Open Door 
<p>At 1Kosmos, we’ve always approached passwordless MFA as a feature, but we’ve viewed the root cause authentication issue as a business challenge revolving around identity. We solved that by performing identity verification and then generating as an artifact a non-phishable passwordless MFA credential with liveness detection.</p>
<p>But as our passwordless journey continued, something interesting happened. We found that placing identity outside of the application platforms and providing for various levels of identity assurance tuned to the risk of the digital interaction helped us rapidly evolve our identity and authentication platform to address the constant stream of use cases that surfaced in just about every customer deployment.</p>
<p>It turns out that not everybody wants an app, not everybody owns a mobile device, and some work environments outright prohibit the use of mobile handsets. By offering identity verification and authentication in a single privacy-by-design platform we’ve provided ourselves and our customers an elegant way to systematically accommodate the unexpected, and in a sense, hardest-to-solve authentication use cases.</p>
<p>This approach to identity modernization quickly augments core identity and access management to mitigate risk, reduce technical debt, and enhance access controls, effectively closing the open door that many hackers walk through unchallenged. By way of example, it’s why we’ve been able to rapidly release app-less authentication, browser-based identity verification journeys and most recently BlockID 1Key, a biometric security key.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, we believe that by integrating identity proofing, credential verification, and strong authentication, we equip organizations with the tools and insights needed to combat identity-based attacks effectively – and in ways not possible before.</p>
<p>Through a collaborative and identity-centric approach to security, we help organizations bolster their resilience and navigate through this digital storm unleashed by sophisticated attackers like those behind Volt Typhoon.</p>
 Prepare Now for What May Come 
<p>Given the advanced warnings from the FBI regarding the Volt Typhoon botnet and China’s espionage, we were lucky this time. But this sequence of events telegraphs the dangers that live among us and should serve as a battle cry for heightened security measures, starting with identity verification at first and every login … for customers, workers, and citizens.</p>
<p>Embracing innovative technologies that in turn enable rapid business innovation … it’s the path forward to reduce risk and deliver order-of-magnitude business improvement. It’s the logical path forward for organizations that thrive on the speed of innovation and want to de-risk their business plan by modernizing and simplifying identity and access management. It’s this bright future we at 1Kosmos envision for all organizations navigating digital transformation and the delivery of digital services.</p>

  <p>In November 2023 at <a href="https://ignite.microsoft.com/en-US/sessions/07952ef8-8603-4a94-8185-975ae95e53bb?source=sessions">Microsoft Ignite</a>, we announced Microsoft-managed policies and the auto-rollout of multifactor authentication (MFA)-related Conditional Access&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/06/automatic-conditional-access-policies-in-microsoft-entra-streamline-identity-protection/">policies</a> in customer tenants. Since then, we’ve rolled out report-only policies for over 500,000 tenants. These policies are part of our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/11/02/announcing-microsoft-secure-future-initiative-to-advance-security-engineering/">Secure Future Initiative,</a>&nbsp;which includes key engineering advances to improve security for customers against cyberthreats that we anticipate will increase over time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This follow-up blog will dive deeper into these policies to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of what they entail and how they function.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  Multifactor authentication for admins accessing Microsoft admin portals 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Admin accounts with elevated privileges are more likely to be attacked, so enforcing MFA for these roles protects these privileged administrative functions. This policy covers 14 admin roles that we consider to be highly privileged, requiring administrators to perform multifactor authentication when signing into Microsoft admin portals. This policy targets Microsoft Entra ID P1 and P2 tenants, where security defaults aren't enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Multifactor authentication for per-user multifactor authentication users 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Per-user MFA is when users are enabled individually and are required to perform multifactor authentication each time they sign in (with some exceptions, such as when they sign in from trusted IP addresses or when the remember MFA on trusted devices feature is turned on). For customers who are licensed for Entra ID P1, Conditional Access offers a better admin experience with many additional features, including <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-users-groups">user group</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-cloud-apps">application</a> targeting, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-conditions">more conditions</a> such as risk- and device-based, integration with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-strengths">authentication strengths</a>, <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-session">session controls</a> and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-report-only">report-only mode</a>. This can help you be more targeted in requiring MFA, lowering end user friction while maintaining security posture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy covers users with per-user MFA. These users are targeted by Conditional Access and are now required to perform multifactor authentication for all cloud apps. It aids organizations’ transition to Conditional Access seamlessly, ensuring no disruption to end user experiences while maintaining a high level of security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy targets licensed users with Entra ID P1 and P2, where the security defaults policy isn't enabled and there are less than 500 per-user MFA enabled enabled/enforced users. There will be no change to the end user experience due to this policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Multifactor authentication and reauthentication for risky sign-ins 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy will help your organization achieve the Optimal level for Risk Assessments in the NIST <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/zero_trust_maturity_model_v2_508.pdf">Zero Trust Maturity Model</a> because it provides a key layer of added security assurance that triggers only when we detect high-risk sign-ins. “High-risk sign-in” means there is a very high probability that a given authentication request isn't the authorized identity owner and could indicate brute force, password spray, or token replay attacks. By dynamically responding to sign-in risk, this policy disrupts active attacks in real-time while remaining invisible to most users, particularly those who don’t have high sign-in risk. When Identity Protection detects an attack, your users will be prompted to self-remediate with MFA and reauthenticate to Entra ID, which will reset the compromised session.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-protection/concept-identity-protection-risks%22%20/l%20%22sign-in-risk-detections">Learn more about sign-in risk</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This policy covers all users in Entra ID P2 tenants, where security defaults aren't enabled, all active users are already registered for MFA, and there are enough licenses for each user. As with all policies, ensure you exclude any break-glass or service accounts to avoid locking yourself out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies have been created in all eligible tenants in Report-only mode. These policies are suggestions from Microsoft that organizations can adapt and use for their own environment. Administrators can view and review these policies in the <a href="https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_ConditionalAccess/ConditionalAccessBlade/~/Policies/fromNav/Identity">Conditional Access policies blade</a>. To enhance the policies, administrators are encouraged to add customizations such as excluding <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-conditional-access-policy-common?tabs=secure-foundation#user-exclusions">emergency accounts and service accounts</a>. Once ready, the policies can be moved to the ON state. For additional customization needs, administrators have the flexibility to clone the policies and make further adjustments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Call to Action 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't wait – take action now. Enable the Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies now and/or customize the Microsoft-managed Conditional Access policies according to your organizational needs. Your proactive approach to implementing multifactor authentication policies is crucial in fortifying your organization against evolving security threats.

<p>In an era where data security and privacy are paramount, the use of Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) in distributed ID and payment card printers is not just a recommendation but a necessity. These small hardware-based security modules serve as the sentinels guarding sensitive information in a digital age.</p>
<p>Security Significance of Trusted Platform Modules</p>
<p>At its core, a Trusted Platform Module is a dedicated microcontroller chip integrated into a device’s motherboard or system-on-a-chip. Its primary function is to secure and safeguard critical data, cryptographic keys, and system integrity. TPMs adhere to established industry standards and offer a range of cryptographic operations. They generate, store, and protect cryptographic keys and execute operations like digital signatures and card issuance. One of the most critical aspects of a TPM is its ability to provide <a href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/5254641">Secure Boot processes</a>, ensuring that the device’s firmware and operating system remain unaltered and authentic. This fundamental feature prevents attackers from compromising the system at its root, thereby establishing trust from the ground up.</p>
<p>Government institutions worldwide recognize the necessity of Trusted Platform Modules in safeguarding sensitive data and critical infrastructure. In the U.S., <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final">all devices connecting to government networks are mandated to incorporate TPMs</a> as part of their security standards. These modules play a crucial role in protecting classified information, securing communications, and mitigating potential breaches. Government systems equipped with TPMs are not only more secure but also enable remote attestation, meaning that their status can be verified and authenticated by trusted entities. This is essential for ensuring that the device’s software and firmware have not been tampered with, guaranteeing the utmost security.</p>
<p>Imperative for ID and Payment Card Printers</p>
<p>Without a TPM, devices such as ID and payment card printers become susceptible to rising security threats. Hackers, malicious software, and unauthorized users can exploit vulnerabilities in these systems, potentially leading to devastating consequences:</p>
 
 Data Breaches: Sensitive personal and financial information, including ID and payment card data, can be compromised, resulting in identity theft and financial fraud. 
 Counterfeit Cards: Fraudsters may take advantage of unsecured printers to produce counterfeit identification and payment cards, posing a severe risk to both individuals and institutions. 
 System Tampering: The absence of Secure Boot processes leaves systems open to firmware attacks, making them more susceptible to malware and unauthorized access. 
 
<p>The inclusion of Trusted Platform Modules in distributed ID and payment card printers is a necessity. Government institutions understand the imperative need for TPMs in safeguarding sensitive information, and the same principle applies to banks, universities, and enterprises. The absence of TPMs leaves these entities exposed to security vulnerabilities that could have severe consequences.</p>
<p>By integrating TPMs into their systems, organizations can fortify their defenses against data breaches, counterfeiting, and system tampering. These modules, with their technical prowess and cryptographic capabilities, offer a solid foundation for robust security in the digital age, ensuring the trustworthiness of the devices that shape our lives. Entrust is the only provider globally using Trusted Platform Modules across our latest line of issuance systems.

<p>In recent months, ransomware attacks have gained attention and become a top concern across multiple industries. The threat has affected many well-known brands, ranging from cable providers and aircraft manufacturers to mortgage servicers and title insurance companies. Ransomware is a type of malware used to infect computers and encrypt data. Once infected, the ransomware attempts to spread to connected systems. This can include computers accessible on the network, shared drives, and backups. The goal of the attack is to render data and applications unusable for the victim until a ransom is paid.</p>
<p>According to Corvus Insurance, ransomware leak site victims reached a <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/ransomware-victims-record-november/">record-high in November</a>: a 39% increase from the prior month and a 110% increase year-over-year. The report suggests the uptick was largely due to LockBit and the <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4966">CVE 2023-4966 Citrix Bleed vulnerability</a>. The exploit allows threat actors to circumvent password requirements and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to hijack legitimate user sessions for harvesting credentials and accessing data. On November 21, 2023, the Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) also issued this <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-325a">advisory</a>.</p>
<p>For financial services organizations, ransomware attacks can be particularly damaging. In August 2023, real estate brokers and agents in the U.S. suffered from an <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/real-estate-news/commentary/mls-cyberattack-a-wake-up-call-for-all-leaders">attack</a> that took 23 multiple listing service (MLS) systems offline. MLS systems are private databases created, maintained, and funded by real estate professionals to help clients buy and sell properties. In November, one of the largest <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/mr-cooper-data-breach-impacts-14-7-million-individuals/">mortgage servicers</a> in the U.S. experienced an outage impacting millions and homeowners were unable to submit mortgage payments. Weeks later, two large title insurance providers in the U.S. and UK were attacked and closing transactions were delayed. In early January, one of the largest non-bank lenders was also <a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/loandepot-ransomware-exposes-17M-people/705169/">attacked</a>.</p>
<p>What are the consequences of a ransomware attack? Depending on the industry, the answer will vary. To understand the scope of impact, consider these two sample customer transactions: An iced latte beverage versus a residential piece of real estate. While the first is likely the smallest purchase a customer may make in a single day, the other may be the largest single purchase they make in their lifetime. If the ice cubes used for making the latte represent data, a real estate financing transaction is an iceberg. The volume of personally identifiable information (PII) involved with buying and selling a home and making monthly loan payments make real estate, mortgage, and title firms highly sought-after targets for would-be attackers.</p>
<p>The Ice Cube</p>
<p>When a national coffee chain is subjected to a ransomware attack, customers are likely to face temporary inconveniences. Systems may go offline. Point-of-sale systems for credit cards may be unavailable until the recovery process is complete. Perhaps loyalty rewards information or some confidential data is exfiltrated. If it is determined that a material breach occurred, the compliance team will act in accordance with state and federal breach notification laws. The impacted organization will notify, within a required timeframe upon discovery of the incident, the attorney general for each state in which affected customers reside. Impacted customers will subsequently receive a notification. If PII is stolen or lost for certain customers, those individuals may be offered free credit monitoring for a designated period.</p>
<p>The Iceberg</p>
<p>For a mortgage lender or title agency experiencing a ransomware attack, the incident response process is similar. However, the downstream impact can have significantly greater consequences. For those in the process of buying or selling a home, closings may be delayed. Outages may prevent appraisers from uploading reports. Title companies may be unable to disburse funds from escrow. Seller proceeds, mortgage payoff amounts, real estate agent commissions, and other payments will be delayed until systems are fully restored. The homeowner may be unable to make their monthly loan payment online. A mortgage servicer may be unable to receive borrower payments.</p>
<p>For most borrowers in the U.S., the mortgage servicer also facilitates the property tax and insurance payments on behalf of the homeowner. For these escrowed loans, the impact of a ransomware incident could disrupt real estate tax payments to counties and payments toward homeowner insurance policy premiums. The extent to which stolen data is used for other purposes beyond extortion, such as identity theft or credit card fraud, may also remain largely undetermined for an extended period.</p>
<p>The real estate mortgage and financing ecosystem depends on moving large sums of money in a timely manner between multiple transaction participants. Whether delayed mortgage payments or delayed real estate agent commissions, the immediate impact of a ransomware incident on a financial services organization can be substantial. A sustained outage could affect loan amortization schedules, interest calculations, and principal balances. To facilitate funding new mortgages, lenders regularly sell loans to government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In turn, these GSEs offer mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which consist of a group of mortgages organized to pay interest like a mortgage bond. The mission for these entities is to help provide liquidity and stability to the U.S. housing market. Listed as one of 16 critical infrastructure <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors/financial-services-sector">sectors</a> by CISA, financial services firms play an integral role in ensuring economic stability.</p>
<p>From making their smallest purchase in a single day to the largest single purchase of their lifetime, a customer’s expectations regarding data protection will vary. Leaking a customer’s latte purchase history is not a desired outcome; however, the theft of data containing a borrower’s credit history, income, bank account number, and transcripts of past tax returns is exponentially less preferred. A substandard approach to securing transactions for this segment of the industry can create dangerously high levels of risk. The real estate financing industry plays a vital role in helping individuals achieve home ownership, and customer data protection efforts should be considered accordingly.</p>
<p>Best Practices for Preparation, Prevention, and Mitigation</p>
<p>CISA’s <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/ransomware-guide">#StopRansomware Guide</a> provides ransomware and data extortion preparation, prevention, and mitigation best practices. Preparation best practices focus on backups, incident response plans, and implementing a Zero Trust architecture. For prevention and mitigation best practices, CISA groups by initial access vectors, such as phishing and compromised credentials. Highlights from CISA’s recommendations include:</p>
 
 Maintain Frequent Backups: Encrypt backups of critical data and store them on separate devices inaccessible from a network. 
 Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA): Organizations should consider implementing a Zero Trust architecture to prevent unauthorized access to data and services. 
 Update and Patch Systems: Ensure applications and operating systems have the latest patches and updates. Updates should be obtained directly from vendor sites rather than clicking on email links. Enable automatic software updates and do not use end-of-life software. 
 Email: If you are unsure whether an email is legitimate, CISA recommends verifying the email’s legitimacy by contacting the sender directly.

 <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/user-identity">Phishing-Resistant Identities</a> ensure both the user and device are verified and authenticated using digital certificates to help protect against business email compromise (BEC) and account takeover (ATO) attacks. Compromised credentials are a common initial access vector in ransomware attacks. For more information, see the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/reports/gartner-mq">2023 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Access Management</a> recognizing Entrust as a Challenger. 
 <a href="https://www.entrust.com/digital-security/certificate-solutions/products/digital-certificates/verified-mark-certificates">Verified Mark Certificates (VMCs)</a> are digital certificates that enable organizations to display their registered trademark logo in the avatar slot alongside outgoing emails. A common delivery method for ransomware is phishing. Real estate brokerages, lenders, and title agencies leveraging VMCs can prove to their transaction participants that emails received are indeed from the sending organization and not spoofed emails. VMCs also help reduce the risk of wire transfer fraud and seller impersonation fraud. 
 <a href="https://www.entrust.com/solutions/post-quantum-cryptography">Post-Quantum Readiness</a> – Long-lived data, such as property ownership history and mortgage loan servicing information, are at greater risk of the “Harvest Now, Decrypt Later” threat. Within the decade, quantum computing capabilities powerful enough to break public key encryption protocols are expected.

 How are connected the digital Identity and Digital Signature in Web 3.0? 



<p>Explores how digital and electronic signatures are fundamental in the age of digital identity, with a special focus on decentralized technologies, advanced cryptography and Self-Sovereign Identity within the Web 3.0 world.</p>



 Disclaimer: 



<p>In this article, we will use the terms “decentralized identity” and “SSI” (Self-Sovereign Identity) interchangeably. It should be noted that the views and opinions expressed are based on our experience in the field of digital identity, but should not be interpreted as legal definitions.<br>What is an electronic signature?</p>



<p>An electronic signature, in essence, is your consent in the digital world. It can be an image of your signature, a PIN code, or even a click of a button. It is vital in managing digital identities and preventing cyber-attacks.</p>



 Digital signature: a specialization of electronic signature 



<p>The digital signature, a specific subset of the electronic signature, relies on asymmetric cryptography technologies. This technology uniquely links each signature to the signer and the document, providing reliable verification of authenticity. A clear example is the Verifiable Credentials (VCs).</p>



 Digital signature and legal entities in different countries 



 Let’s see two examples on this subject: 



 
 In Argentina: Digital signatures are restricted to individuals, which presents unique challenges for digital identities. 



 In Mexico: Legal entities can use digital signatures, advancing in the management of digital identities. 
 



 Private key management and security 



<p>The security of a digital signature is based on proper management of private keys. The responsibility for protecting these keys varies by country and type of entity, being crucial for online security.</p>



<p>Following the previous example, in countries where the digital signature is personal, as in Argentina, the responsibility for protecting the private key falls on the individual, which is fundamental for the prevention of cyber-attacks. In Mexico, on the other hand, the entity is responsible for its protection.<br>Identity in the legal and commercial sphere</p>



<p>Identity, both for individuals and entities, is built through actions, reputation and other attributes accumulated over time. For legal entities, this includes their track record, credentials and legal compliance. This identity is crucial in business and legal interactions and operations, and is at the core of what defines Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) in the Web 3.0 era.</p>



 Digital signature in Web3 



<p>Web3, with its focus on decentralized identity, proposes a new paradigm in the management of digital signatures. This decentralized approach, exemplified by protocols such as QuarkID, significantly improves interoperability between different systems and entities, allowing greater flexibility and control by users over their digital identities.</p>



<p>In turn, these technologies enable selective disclosure, which allows users to share only the information that is essential for a specific transaction, protecting their privacy.</p>



<p>Simultaneously, the concept of non-repudiation ensures that users’ actions, backed by the immutability of the blockchain and advanced digital signatures, are indisputable, increasing the security and reliability of digital interactions.<br></p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Digital and electronic signatures are essential in the era of Web 3.0 and digital identity. Understanding these concepts is crucial for their effective implementation. To learn more about how Extrimian integrates digital identity and cybersecurity solutions, visit Extrimian.</p>

<p>Bluesky is building an open social network where anyone can contribute, while still providing an easy-to-use experience for users. For the past year, we used invite codes to help us manage growth while we built features like moderation tooling, custom feeds, and more. Now, we’re ready for anyone to join.</p>
 
    <a href="https://bsky.app/">Sign up for Bluesky</a>
 
<p>Join more than three million people discussing news, sharing art, and just posting.</p>
 What is Bluesky? 
<p>To mark the occasion, we teamed up with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davis.social">Davis Bickford</a>, an artist on the network, to share why we’re excited about Bluesky.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>To learn more about Bluesky and how to get started, read our <a>user FAQ here</a>.</p>
<p>And if deep dives are more your style, we worked with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/martin.kleppmann.com">Martin Kleppman</a>, author of Designing Data-Intensive Applications and technical advisor to Bluesky, to write <a href="https://bsky.social/about/bluesky-and-the-at-protocol-usable-decentralized-social-media-martin-kleppmann.pdf">a paper that goes into more detail</a> about the technical underpinnings of Bluesky.</p>
 Looking Forward 
<p>We’ve been working on more features that put you in control of your social media experience. Here’s what you can expect to see soon:</p>
 Stackable Moderation Services 
<p>Safety is core to social media. Bluesky moderates the app according to our community guidelines, and our vision for <a>composable moderation</a> allows users to stack more moderation services together, such as subscribable moderation lists.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, we’re excited to release the labeling services which will allow users to stack more options on top of their existing moderation preferences. This will allow other organizations and people to run their own moderation services that can account for industry-specific knowledge or specific cultural norms, among other preferences.</p>
<p>One potential use case for labeling is fact-checking. For example, a fact-checking organization can run a labeling service and mark posts as “partially false,” “misleading,” or other categories. Then, users who trust this organization can subscribe to their labels. As the user scrolls through posts in the app, any labels that the fact-checking organization publishes will be visible on the post itself. This helps in the effective distribution of the fact-check and keeps users better informed.</p>
<p>We’ll be sharing more in the coming weeks. In the meantime, if you’re interested in partnering with Bluesky and setting up a labeling service, contact us at <a href="mailto:partnerships@blueskyweb.xyz">partnerships@blueskyweb.xyz</a>.</p>
 An Open Social Network 
<p>When you log in to Bluesky, it might look and feel familiar — the user experience should be straightforward. But under the hood, we’ve designed the app in a way that puts control back in your hands. Here, your experience online isn’t controlled by a single company. Whether it's your timeline or content filters, on Bluesky, you can easily customize your social experience.</p>
<p>This month, we’ll be rolling out an experimental early version of “federation,” or the feature that makes the network so open and customizable. On Bluesky, you’ll have the freedom to choose (and the right to leave) instead of being held to the whims of private companies or black box algorithms. And wherever you go, your friends and relationships can go with you.</p>
<p>For developers: We’ve already federated the network among multiple servers internally, and later this month, you’ll be able to self-host a server that connects to the main production network. You’ll be part of the first batch of servers that federate with the network, so expect to experiment alongside us! We’ll share more information on how to join the production network with your own server soon. In the meantime, you can test out your server set up via our developer sandbox. <a href="https://www.docs.bsky.app/blog/federation-sandbox">Find instructions here</a>.</p>

				  The first 2024<a href="https://www.meetup.com/indicio-identity-community/"> Indicio Identity Community Meetup</a> saw Michael Zuriek of SITA and Heather Dahl of Indicio analyze the rapid digital transformation in travel and hospitality driven by the deployment of digital travel credentials. 
 Watch the recording <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duaNhMAvFhA">here.</a>  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>The Indicio Identity Community Meetup kicked off its first discussion of 2024 with Michael Zuriek, Head of Innovation for Digital Travel at SITA, and Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio, diving into the ways verifiable credential technology will transform the experience of travel for everyone — passengers, airlines, airports, and governments.</p>
<p>First, some context. Indicio and SITA are partners who <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-sita-and-aruba-deliver-verifiable-credentials-for-digital-travel/">successfully developed and deployed a Digital Travel Credential (DTC)</a> following International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards.</p>
<p>Why is this a revolutionary technology for travel?</p>
<p>A paradigm shift is coming: Seamless travel</p>
<p>For years, countries have been storing traveler data in centralized databases and using complex agreements and policies to share that information to make travel possible. It’s why there are so many hoops travelers have to jump through when crossing borders.</p>
<p>Now, with a Digital Travel Credential (DTC) that follows ICAO’s global standard for storing identity data on personal mobile devices, there is no need for this complex, cumbersome system to facilitate border crossing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, the DTC allows security to simply scan the traveler’s digital information, in a fraction of the time of using a manual, paper-based system. And it provides a way to pre-authorize travel and check in before the traveler leaves home.</p>
<p>We have been conditioned to wait; but automation can severely reduce the bottlenecks in airports.</p>
<p>Dahl described using a DTC to pass through Aruba’s immigration as “almost magical.”: The system was so efficient and seamless that the border guard had waved her through before she was even aware of what was happening. The DTC allowed her paperwork and identity to be verified ahead of time and a biometric scan at the airport checked that she was the correct individual tied to that travel information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every traveler to Aruba will soon be able to have the same experience as the island implements DTC-enabled technology.</p>
<p>By using a DTC for all the touchpoints at an airport where identity needs to be checked, passengers get a much quicker experience, while airports, airlines, and governments benefit from the verified data, simplified privacy compliance, and enhanced security that comes from decentralized identity.</p>
<p>Airports have already invested significantly into biometrics when Covid hit, we could see rapid adoption of the DTC as some of the hardware is already in place.</p>
<p>The EU, US, IATA, and other governments and industry organizations are all currently working on bringing biometrics and digital travel together. Because Indicio and SITA’s DTC works on any airport system, deployment of the DTC will be rapid. The DTC makes biometric technology work much more efficiently and effectively, while simplifying data privacy compliance. And, on a practical level, as airports are an industry of fragmented IT systems, ease of adoption and integration is a critical value proposition. As many airports have biometric investments, the DTC is an easy way to capitalize on these investments and improve processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are just a few of takeaways from the conversation; if you have time, I highly recommend you watch the full recording which can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duaNhMAvFhA">here</a>. <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">Get in touch</a> with <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> today to get the DTC for your business.</p>
<p>Join us for the next meeting of the Indicio Identity Community Meetup, where we’ll be speaking with Klaeri Schelhowe, Executive Director of Trust Alliance New Zealand and their Digital Farm Wallet Pilot Project a tool that enables farmers, farm enterprises, and industry organizations to manage critical farm data in an efficient and secure way.</p>

  The European Securities and Markets Authority has urged member states to decide whether to opt into MiCA’s grandfathering scheme or not by June 30th,&nbsp;2024.  The first part of South Korea’s planned two-part crypto regulation draft will come into force in July this&nbsp;year.  2024 is going to be a regulatory intense year for the crypto space in the US, with the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act setting the stage for stablecoin regulations in the&nbsp;country.  <p>Just weeks into 2024, the crypto world is already seeing major regulatory changes, with the most notable one being the US SEC’s approval of 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs. That was just the tip of the iceberg, though, as a lot more is to come this year in areas like issuance, services, stablecoins, and oversight, with a strong focus on AML and KYC measures.</p><p>Emerging technologies such as DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs will also be under the regulatory lens, especially in Europe, Japan, and parts of Africa this year. So, what major crypto regulatory changes are we to expect from these areas in&nbsp;2024?</p> Europe <p>2024 will bring a wave of sweeping changes across the crypto landscape. The rollout of <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/mica-paving-the-way-from-liability-to-transparency">the Markets in Crypto Asset Regulation (MiCA)</a> in EU states is reshaping the scene, even influencing economic partners like Switzerland. As this unfolds, European regulators are joining forces, aiming to streamline how they categorize, monitor, and handle the tech side of crypto assets, creating a unified approach across the continent, with different types of crypto assets getting their own unique set of&nbsp;rules.</p> European Union <p>As a part of the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation rollout, the European Securities and Market Authority is <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/esmas-activities/digital-finance-and-innovation/markets-crypto-assets-regulation-mica">set to issue guidelines</a> on crypto asset categorization, market monitoring, and technological infrastructure standards. <a href="https://www.regulationtomorrow.com/eu/esma-encourages-smooth-transition-to-mica/">By June 30th, 2024</a>, EU states must decide on opting into the grandfathering scheme under MiCA, which permits crypto asset service providers to operate under national laws until MiCA authorization is obtained or&nbsp;denied.</p><p>This scenario could lead to varied regulatory approaches across Europe, which ESMA aims to harmonize. Furthermore, the Securities and Markets Stakeholder Group is <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA24-229244789-4595_SMSG_Advice_on_MiCA_package__1.pdf">advising ESMA</a> to ensure MiCA’s alignment with Decentralized Finance (DeFi) by the end of&nbsp;2024.</p> The United&nbsp;Kingdom <p><a href="https://decrypt.co/200289/uk-wont-be-copying-mica-crypto-parliamentary-group-chair">Instead of creating</a> a standalone regulatory framework like the EU’s MiCA, the UK plans to incorporate crypto activities into its existing financial services framework, necessitating crypto firms to comply with traditional banking regulations. The Financial Conduct Authority will offer guidance for crypto businesses <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/02/01/uk-crypto-firms-to-get-broad-laws-may-need-new-authorization/">requiring authorization</a> under this&nbsp;regime.</p><p>Different types of crypto assets, such as unique NFTs and already-regulated assets like security tokens, will also be distinctly regulated this year. Moreover, legislation to formalize this framework is anticipated in 2024, with transitional arrangements for businesses. As for stablecoins, the UK’s immediate regulatory emphasis is on fiat-backed ones used in payment systems, with legislation targeted for early 2024. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.taxjournal.com/articles/-it-would-be-premature-ineffective-for-the-uk-to-regulate-defi-activities-currently-says-treasury-#:~:text=the%20UK%20government%20does%20not,to%20regulate%20DeFi%20activities%20currently.">regulation of Decentralized Finance</a> remains under consideration.</p> Switzerland <p>Switzerland is implementing the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/tax/exchange-of-tax-information/crypto-asset-reporting-framework-and-amendments-to-the-common-reporting-standard.pdf">Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF)</a> this year, bringing digital assets under tax transparency regulations and necessitating due diligence on users by crypto service providers. Moreover, the Federal Department of Finance also plans to prepare a <a href="https://www.efd.admin.ch/efd/en/home/the-fdf/nsb-news_list.msg-id-98545.html">consultation draft for implementing these rules</a>, targeting completion by the end of June&nbsp;2024.</p> Asia Pacific&nbsp;(APAC) <p>Across the Asia Pacific region, governments and regulatory authorities are placing a heightened focus on strengthening the regulatory frameworks to ensure the security of digital assets and protect consumers. This includes the implementation of clear taxation policies for crypto assets, where profits from transactions are subject to taxation, and strict reporting requirements are imposed on crypto investors.</p><p>Governments are also emphasizing the importance of security and compliance, with regulations targeting anti-money laundering (AML), know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, and robust cybersecurity standards. Additionally, emerging technologies like DeFi, NFTs, and stablecoins are receiving regulatory attention, leading to the development of comprehensive policies and guidelines.</p> Japan <p>In 2024, Japan will continue its detailed approach to cryptocurrency regulation, focusing on consumer protection. This is in response to past breaches at Japanese exchanges, emphasizing the need for stringent security measures. We can also expect Japan to initiate <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/269200/japan-seeks-to-exempt-companies-from-tax-on-unrealized-crypto-gains-reports#:~:text=The%20Japanese%20government%20has%20approved,according%20to%20local%20media%20reports.">its much-anticipated tax policy reforms</a> to support the growth of crypto startups this&nbsp;year.</p> India <p>India is yet to finalize its approach to cryptocurrencies, with the anticipated cryptocurrency bill still pending since 2021. However, the Reserve Bank of India <a href="https://www.forbesindia.com/article/crypto-made-easy/rbi-ranks-crypto-near-the-bottom-of-systematic-risks-despite-harsh-criticism/77763/1">remains skeptical of cryptocurrencies</a> and instead favors CBDCs over other digital currencies, indicating no major regulatory changes in 2024. So, we are unlikely to see any major changes in terms of crypto regulations in India in&nbsp;2024.</p> South Korea <p>South Korea is working on a two-part crypto regulation framework for 2024. The first part, focusing on structuring the crypto market, will take effect in July 2024, whereas the second part, which is still under development, will establish rules for the issuance, listing, and delisting of cryptocurrencies. The country has also decided <a href="https://www.khan.co.kr/economy/finance/article/202401111541001">not to support crypto ETFs</a> and is considering <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/01/04/south-korea-regulator-seeks-ban-on-crypto-purchases-with-credit-cards/amp/">banning credit card purchases</a> of cryptocurrencies. Adding to this, <a href="https://crypto.news/south-korea-to-mandate-crypto-disclosure-for-5800-officials-in-2024/">both officials and companies</a> will need to start revealing their crypto holdings from next&nbsp;year.</p> Singapore <p>In 2024, the Monetary Authority of Singapore is set to focus on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-23/singapore-plans-more-rules-to-curb-retail-crypto-speculation">reducing speculative trading</a> in cryptocurrencies, including the ban on cryptocurrency platforms offering incentives for trading. Moreover, starting in mid-2024, the use of Singapore credit cards to purchase digital payment tokens will <a href="https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/cryptocurrencies-digital-payment-token-credit-card-mas-2311461">no longer be&nbsp;allowed</a>.</p> Hong Kong <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the Securities and Futures Commission <a href="https://apps.sfc.hk/edistributionWeb/gateway/EN/circular/doc?refNo=23EC67">are considering applications</a> for spot crypto ETFs and other virtual asset funds this year. It is expected to make significant progress in stablecoin regulation, too, with <a href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/news-and-media/insight/2023/12/20231227/">a consultation paper</a> already published seeking public feedback. The regulator also has plans to unveil <a href="https://www.hkma.gov.hk/eng/news-and-media/press-releases/2023/12/20231227-4/">a “sandbox” framework</a>, enabling market participants to engage directly with the regulatory environment in&nbsp;2024.</p> China <p>The People’s Bank of China recently <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/china-pboc-crypto-defi-stability-report">emphasized the need</a> for global crypto rules, maintaining its tough stance on cryptocurrencies. However, the country is pushing for <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/273492/china-forms-metaverse-working-group-with-huawei-tencent-ant-group-and-others#:~:text=China%20has%20formed%20a%20working,growth%20of%20the%20nascent%20industry.">standardization in the metaverse sector</a>, collaborating with tech giants and government representatives, and has <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/chinese-regulators-aim-to-disconnect-gaming-tokens-from-real-world-currency/#:~:text=Chinese%20authorities%20have%20proposed%20a,regulations%20for%20the%20gaming%20industry.">proposed a ban</a> on converting virtual gaming tokens to real-world assets this&nbsp;year.</p> Australia <p>Australia plans to advance its <a href="https://paymentexpert.com/2023/10/16/australia-new-crypto-regulations-2024/">crypto licensing framework in 2024</a>, introducing a regulatory framework covering licensing and custody rules for crypto asset providers. This legislation, once approved, will include a 12-month transitional period. The Treasury and Reserve Bank of Australia will also <a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/payments-and-infrastructure/central-bank-digital-currency/pdf/australian-cbdc-pilot-for-digital-finance-innovation-project-report.pdf">publish a joint report</a> on CBDC research this year, setting a roadmap for future&nbsp;work.</p> The Americas <p>Governments throughout the Americas are actively enhancing cryptocurrency regulations to address common concerns. They’re taking steps to combat issues like money laundering and fraud and safeguard investors.</p><p>A prominent focus is on regulating stablecoins, with measures to ensure that issuers maintain sufficient reserves and adhere to financial rules gaining traction.</p><p>Additionally, tax regulations concerning cryptocurrencies are being clarified, encompassing reporting requirements, capital gains taxes, and income tax obligations for crypto-related activities.</p> The United&nbsp;States <p>2024 in the US kicked off with the launch of <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/gensler-statement-spot-bitcoin-011023">the country’s first Spot Bitcoin ETF</a>. Yet, the SEC is maintaining its firm stance, not relenting in its rigorous crypto scrutiny. Laws for stablecoin issuers are also likely to emerge in 2024 following the House Financial Services Committee’s passage of <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4766/text">the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act</a>, which is currently awaiting consideration in the House of Representatives.</p><p>Another key focus for this year is <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12223">the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act</a>, which could shift the crypto world from securities to commodities, with the CFTC taking the lead. Similarly, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4356/all-info">the bipartisan Responsible Financial Innovation Act</a> aims to classify most cryptos as commodities, shifting more responsibility to the CFTC and establishing stablecoin regulations.</p><p>Moreover, from January 2024, <a href="https://www.bdo.com/insights/tax/infrastructure-investment-and-jobs-act-contains-new-cryptocurrency-reporting-requirements">the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act</a> has been in effect, making it mandatory for entities to report crypto transactions over $10,000 to the IRS or face serious consequences. Lastly, the outcome of the US elections in November 2024 could significantly impact the crypto industry, as a crypto-friendly administration could bring much-needed clarity and legitimacy to the&nbsp;sector.</p> Canada <p>The Canadian Securities Administrator announced <a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/news/canadian-securities-regulators-seek-feedback-on-rules-for-public-investment-funds-holding-crypto-assets/">new regulations for public investment funds</a> in crypto assets in January this year, which is open for public feedback until April 17th, 2024. The new rule will permit only the non-redeemable and alternative investment funds to handle crypto transactions directly, requiring other mutual funds to invest through these entities. It also underlines that the crypto assets must also be fungible, insured, stored offline, and listed on a recognized Canadian exchange with an annual custodian review.</p> Brazil <p>In Brazil, policymakers are working to tighten crypto regulation and bring brokerages under stricter supervision in 2024. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-government-tax-income-financial-investments-obtained-abroad-2023-05-01/">newly enacted income tax regulations</a>, effective January 1st, 2024, impose up to 15% tax on individuals earning over $1,200 from foreign-based exchanges, aiming to generate $4 billion in tax revenue. Also, the Brazilian central bank’s digital currency, DREX, is in its testing phase until February 14th, 2024, with a <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brazil-central-bank-names-digital-193619347.html">public launch</a> planned by year-end.</p> Colombia <p>Colombian lawmakers are drafting a <a href="https://bacsociety.com/en/new-bill-to-regulate-cryptocurrencies-in-colombia/">bill for comprehensive crypto regulation</a>, with collaboration between the crypto ecosystem and government bodies like the Central Bank and the Financial Superintendency. The bill, expected to be presented publicly this year, will undergo analysis by the Executive and then Congressional approval.</p> Argentina <p>This year, Argentinian President Javier Milei, a pro-Bitcoin advocate, aims to introduce crypto regulation aligned with the IMF’s anti-money laundering approach.</p><p>Milei’s draft bill, <a href="https://www.ambito.com/adjuntos/239/documentos/041/223/0041223294.pdf">the Law of Bases and Starting Points for the Freedom of Argentines</a> proposes favorable tax rates for declared domestic and foreign crypto holdings and legalizes their use. Tax rates start at 5% until March 2024, then increase to 10% through June, and 15% thereafter until September 2024.‍</p> Middle East &amp;&nbsp;Africa <p>In the Middle East and Africa, governments are attempting to strike a balance between nurturing the growth of digital finance and addressing regulatory challenges. This trend involves a focus on developing structured frameworks for cryptocurrencies, especially stablecoins, reflecting an awareness of their growing economic impact. However, there’s also an emphasis on enhancing anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism measures within the crypto&nbsp;sector.</p> The United Arab&nbsp;Emirates <p>​​This year, the UAE is on the brink of finalizing its stablecoin laws, with Dubai’s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority leading the charge. VARA, the first of its kind in crypto supervision, <a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/news/dubais-move-oversee-stablecoins-bring-certainty-regulatory-grey-area">has revamped its virtual asset rulebook</a> to integrate regulations for fiat-referenced virtual assets (FRVAs), or stablecoins. These rules categorize cryptocurrencies, placing FRVAs in ‘category 1’. For stablecoin issuers, this means getting authorization and a license from VARA and adhering to its stringent regulations and the newly minted FRVA&nbsp;Rules.</p><p>The UAE’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority has also recently <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-uae">tweaked its AML and sanctions rules</a> in line with the FATF Travel Rule, specifically targeting provisions related to wire transfers in the digital asset&nbsp;realm.</p> Saudi Arabia <p>As of yet, Saudi Arabia does not have a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies. The country has also banned banks from processing transactions related to crypto, while the Saudi Central Bank governor has <a href="https://saudigazette.com.sa/article/636735/SAUDI-ARABIA/SAMA-chief-warns-against-dangers-of-crypto-currencies">underscored the need</a> for adequate supervision, regulation, and coordination in virtual currency activities. Amidst this, SAMA has been experimenting through the launch of <a href="https://www.centralbank.ae/media/cbshgsmf/aber-report-2020-en.pdf">Project Aber</a>, a joint collaboration between SAMA and the Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (“CBUAE”), which explores CBDC for cross-border payments. Besides these developments that will continue this year, there’s not much happening on the regulatory front in&nbsp;Saudi.</p> South Africa <p>Last year, on October 22nd, South Africa began <a href="https://www.fsca.co.za/News%20Documents/FSCA%20Press%20Release_Declaration%20of%20Crypto%20Assets%20As%20A%20Financial%20Product_20%20October%202022.pdf">recognizing cryptocurrencies as a financial product</a> and made it <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2023/05/25/south-africas-crypto-firms-will-soon-need-to-apply-for-registration-or-face-a-heavy-fine/?_gl=1*1cr5fq9*_up*MQ..*_ga*NTE1NjY2NzkxLjE3MDU4MjY0MDI.*_ga_VM3STRYVN8*MTcwNTgyNjQwMS4xLjAuMTcwNTgyNjQwMS4wLjAuMA..">mandatory for all crypto exchanges</a> to secure operating licenses before the year ends. While the Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act currently governs them, crypto-related services will <a href="https://www.treasury.gov.za/public%20comments/2020%2010%2008%20CoFI%20Bill%20(version%20published%20for%20comment)%20(slightly%20updated).pdf">soon fall under the Conduct of Financial Institutions bill</a>, set to become law in the coming years. Additionally, with the Financial Action Task Force closely monitoring South Africa, 2024 will bring more robust anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures to the crypto sector, aiming to help the country exit the greylist by&nbsp;2025.</p> Nigeria <p>Nigeria, after lifting its <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigerian-central-bank-lifts-ban-crypto-trading-2023-12-23/">2021 crypto ban</a>, has set out <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2024/FPRD/GUIDELINES%20ON%20OPERATIONS%20OF%20BANK%20ACCOUNTS%20FOR%20VIRTUAL%20Asset%20Providers.pdf">new rules for VASPs</a>, focusing on strong KYC and AML checks. However, Nigerian banks still can’t <a href="https://www.cbn.gov.ng/Out/2024/FPRD/GUIDELINES%20ON%20OPERATIONS%20OF%20BANK%20ACCOUNTS%20FOR%20VIRTUAL%20Asset%20Providers.pdf">trade or hold cryptocurrencies</a> themselves. At the same time, Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission is starting to handle license applications from crypto custodians and exchanges, showing a careful move towards more involvement in cryptocurrencies.</p> Kenya <p>After passing the <a href="https://kra.go.ke/images/publications/The-Finance-Act--2023.pdf">Finance Bill 2023</a> and signing it into law, Kenya is ready for a comprehensive digital asset regulatory framework covering tax integration and revenue guidelines. The local industry lobby group, the Blockchain Association of Kenya (BAK), is tasked with <a href="https://www.mariblock.com/kenyan-lawmakers-blockchain-association-draft-crypto-bill/">preparing the first draft</a> of a VASP bill referred to as the Crypto Bill by the National Assembly’s Departmental Committee on Finance and National Planning. With that, Kenya might become the first country where the industry’s representatives <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockchainKenya/status/1748641509069435244">develop</a> the regulatory framework for&nbsp;crypto.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>In 2024, we’re at a crossroads as far as global crypto regulations are concerned. Across the globe, from the European Union to the United States, governments are crafting new rules, influencing how the world perceives and uses cryptocurrencies in everyday&nbsp;life.</p><p>While each country’s approach varies, it’s crucial to ensure that the underlying intent remains consistent: safeguarding user experience and security. The decisions made this year will not only shape the immediate future of cryptocurrencies but will also lay the groundwork for their integration into the mainstream global financial ecosystem. So, this year will go down in history as a defining moment for the crypto industry, one that could determine its trajectory for the years to&nbsp;come.</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 22nd January to 4th&nbsp;February <p>Welcome to the latest edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap! In today’s issue, we will cover the latest regulatory updates from all over the world from the last two weeks as we enter into the second month of&nbsp;2024.</p><p>As crypto adoption grows, regulatory developments, too, are getting ramped up with the US and Europe aiming for more clear guidelines. Meanwhile, in another part of the world, China remains unfriendly towards crypto while its special administrative region, Hong Kong, continues to provide regulatory guidelines in an attempt to become a crypto&nbsp;hub.</p><p>So, let’s take a deeper look into these regulatory advances being made around the globe and their impact on the crypto&nbsp;world.</p> The Global Landscape of Crypto Regulations <p>One of the major developments on the crypto regulatory front comes from the US, as American lawmakers are trying to delete the controversial accounting bulletin that imposes restrictions on companies for holding their customer’s crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>In Asia, Hong Kong is making major crypto regulatory moves, as it is planning to consult on the regulatory framework for over-the-counter crypto venues “very soon.” China, meanwhile, is amending its <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">anti-money laundering regulations</a> for the first time since 2007 to cover crypto-related transactions.</p><p>Similarly, in Europe, the European Securities and Markets Authorities, the securities regulatory authority of the 27-member union, is <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/ESMA75-453128700-52_MiCA_Consultation_Paper_-_Guidelines_on_the_qualification_of_crypto-assets_as_financial_instruments.pdf">seeking public feedback until April-end</a> to assess the criteria for classifying crypto as financial instruments.</p><p>With the proposed guidelines, the financial regulator aims to provide authorities and market participants with flexible conditions to determine whether a crypto asset can be categorized as a financial instrument, avoid having a one-size-fits-all approach, and ensure consistency across the&nbsp;region.</p> US Lawmakers Challenge the SEC on Crypto Custody&nbsp;Rule <p>Members of Congress, including Mike Flood (R-Neb.), Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), and Reps. Wiley Nickel (D-N.C.) has introduced resolutions to repeal the Securities and Exchange Commission’s <a href="https://www.sec.gov/oca/staff-accounting-bulletin-121">2022 staff accounting bulletin&nbsp;№121</a>.</p><p>The custody rule requires a company holding a client’s crypto assets to do so on its own balance sheet.

<p></p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Hi, I am Rob MacDonald, vice president of product marketing here at 1Kosmos, and today I’m joined by Huzefa, co-founder and COO of 1Kosmos. How are you doing today Huzefa?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>I am doing great, Rob. It’s a Friday, so never better.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>It’s Friday, you’re in New Jersey, I heard it snowed a little bit this week, I hope you’re keeping warm.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>When you talk about snow, you’re in Canada, so I cannot talk to you about snow. We got a little bit of a sprinkling, that’s it.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Fair enough. All right, well listen, today, thanks for joining us, or joining me. We just made a recent announcement of a new integration partner, Amazon Cognito. So, before we talk about all the goodness of what we’re doing with Cognito, why don’t you tell me a little bit about what it is? What is Cognito?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>So, Cognito is a single sign-on platform, an IdP provider that Amazon Web Services provides, especially if you are building your applications on the AWS platform, this is the native integration that the AWS provides out of the box. So, Cognito is widely used across applications, individual applications that may be developed and have their own ecosystems within the AWS network.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Cool. So, interesting. Where is AWS deployed within an organization? So, you said it’s an IdP, I think everybody that’s probably listening to these understands what an IdP is, but where do you typically find it? Because, when we think workforce in particular, there’s Okta and Microsoft and ForgeRock and Ping. Where’s Cognito, where do you find that?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>They primarily operate in the customer identity and access management or CIAM space today. So, they have not published essentially their numbers of their deployment, but it’s pretty vastly adopted. So, any kind of a public facing application which is hosted on AWS application, and if they would not have a custom integration to be done on Okta or Microsoft, Amazon says, here you go, you can use AWS Cognito.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, the primary use case for this would be a CIAM type of initiative, somebody’s put some application on AWS, and then this is the identity management portion of that application, is that what I understood?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Makes sense. So, what motivated either 1Kosmos to partner with AWS or AWS to partner with 1Kosmos? How did that come to be?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>So, identity is our motivation. We’ve made some significant deployments in the CIAM space recently. 2023 has been a great year for us in that particular sense. And our customers were essentially looking for, hey, do you have these integrations with AWS Cognito that you provide out of box? Their footprint is pretty vast, which I got to know. And that has led to us building this integration with them and providing a more out of box solution with them as well.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, that’s amazing. Everybody knows AWS, everybody knows Amazon, and it’s cool to know that they’re doing this part of their business as well. So, we are now considered an AWS advanced technology partner. So, what specifically does that mean?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>So, our integration today with AWS is around us being a strong authentication for them. Meaning, if you need to do either multifactor authentication, if you want to do passwordless, if you want to have passkeys that you can deploy on your application that is supported by AWS Cognito, here you go. We are the partner of choice that you can go to. So, it’s pretty significant because most of the applications are now being mandated from a compliance standpoint that, hey, you need to have either Strong MFA or support passwordless passkeys in your application deployment stack, and that’s where our integration with AWS Cognito becomes extremely important. I just wanted to add that we want to continue this particular integration and develop further stories, more on the other sides of pieces that we have, identity proofing and better public mentions, but that is more in the future for us.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, based on what I’ve read on the Amazon Cognito site, they have more of these advanced technology partners. It looks like organizations that are aligned to that have gone through some sort of testing, is that correct? By Amazon?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Yeah, integration as well as testing. So, while anything that we’ve done with AWS, it goes through significant scrutiny and review. So, even this particular integration that we put together, we had to document it. The entire GitHub of this particular technical integration is available. It is referenced in a blog that is published by the AWS community that goes out to anybody, the AWS customer. You can essentially go back and look at it. There are references to the GitHub link as well and what that integration is. But, anyway, all of this was not put together by us. We provided the integration story, but it was reviewed through multiple different channels and reviews. I cannot even recall how many by AWS and published by them.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Well, that’s amazing. So, somebody looking at adding our technology into that stack can be pretty much rest assured that it’s been tested by Amazon to make sure that it works with their technology, and that the integration and implementation of us with Cognito would be seamless.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Absolutely. So, if you’re a developer, if you’re watching this, if you have AWS Cognito, feel free to look at the blog. Maybe we can reference it into the link as well when we post this. But, it’s pretty simple, straightforward. You would essentially put a custom auth plugin with 1Kosmos, and there you go. You’ll be able to provide strong MFA or passwordless authentication to your end customers.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Awesome. We take user experience pretty seriously here at 1Kosmos. I guess, I’m sure you would agree with me on that. Everything we do revolves around that and basically privacy. But, it’s commonly known that users will go elsewhere if it’s too hard, if what they came to do wasn’t easy. How does 1Kosmos help Cognito users provide a better experience when they’re dealing with their end users?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Absolutely. So, when the experience is, and I always want to highlight that there are two experiences. One is the strong MFA, because we believe in the story of you don’t have to completely take your organization from password to passwordless from day one to day two. You may have a transition period, so strong MFA becomes important. So, we have factored that experience in the entire channel where you can authenticate in Cognito, and then there’s a dialogue box that opens up, which essentially factors in what 1Kosmos provides to you, as any of the strong MFA options that you may have, push notifications, OTP, TOTP, et cetera. For our passwordless and passkeys, we provide an SDK, which again, from an end user standpoint, it seems seamless for them, where all they’re doing is entering their username, their backend API calls that we’re available, that contact 1Kosmos console or gateway that we have, and then we provide, we essentially see if this particular authentication is valid and give the signals back to AWS.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>Listen, I think it’s amazing. So, when we look at Amazon Cognito customers, we touched on it earlier, but how easy, or a developer, how easy is it for developers to deploy 1Kosmos into a Cognito instance?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>So, like I said, you can sign up for a 1Kosmos instance by going to a developer environment. If you have a Cognito instance, you can sign up for a free account for Cognito as well. That is available on the AWS site. There are instructions to develop a custom auth plugin. And on that particular blog we also highlight, and the GitHub repository, what are the steps that you need to essentially use to integrate AWS Cognito with 1Kosmos.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, then as a follow on to that question, that obviously sounds relatively easy. How would customers acquire an instance of BlockID? So, it’s like, I like it, I installed it at work, and the testing developer did all the great work. How do I then pay for the instance that I chose?</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>We want to make the entire experience easy. So, if you’re a customer in the AWS ecosystem, we are listed on the AWS Marketplace. We have three distinct product lines that are available. So, you can choose any one of them. Most likely it will be around BlockID customer or verify. And you can sign up for the product through AWS Marketplace. You would get your instance, your license keys, et cetera, through that particular portal and you’ll be ready to go.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>That’s cool. Listen, Huzefa, I know that you’re super busy as always, and I wanted to thank you for taking the time today to sit down and tell us about this exciting announcement that we made this week. And I wish you the best, and I hope you come back and talk to me again on a vlog soon.</p>
<p>Huzefa Olia:</p>
<p>Look forward to it, Robert. Thank you.</p>
<p>Robert MacDonald:</p>
<p>So, listen, if you want to find out more about this integration, you can check out our website. We’ve got a data sheet and a press release there that you can go take a read and learn more about this Cognito integration. And then, plus, as Huzefa mentioned earlier, there’s a Amazon Cognito blog that you can read as well. We’ll put the links to all of those down below. Thanks again everybody. We’ll see you again shortly.</p>

<p>In 2024, our product vision is to continue delivering solutions that empower not only issuers, but all ecosystem participants in the tokenization journey to&nbsp;cultivate liquidity and accumulate more users.&nbsp;In our view, to achieve the liquidity endgame, we have to build it up through a few phases: standardization, digitalization, collateralization, distribution, and then reach the liquid secondary market.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			<p>Below, I’ll explain how we are turning our product vision into actionable steps to address your technical and operational pain points, smoothly transitioning to new phases, and adding value and services, all while improving liquidity for your investors.</p>
<p>Accelerating standardization phase:&nbsp;The industry now embraces the official token standard ERC-3643 for compliant tokenization. We’re working closely with the ERC3643 Association to swiftly advance standardization. Our focus includes developing key tools like the ERC-3643 DApp, streamlining the effortless deployment and management of ERC3643 tokens, and setting a new benchmark for simplicity in compliant tokenization.</p>
<p>Digitizing real-world assets and securities en masse:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Speeding up time to market:&nbsp;While our contributions to standardization are open-source, the value of Tokeny’s solutions extends beyond smart contract deployment (<a href="https://tokeny.com/what-should-you-expect-from-a-tokenization-platform-in-2024/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8RUs4gACQdk6BbN54jHVqFm74aEPuPDEGCyaq_EE5yfATnaaA2o47yqsavBstKBZv9NvI7">more details here</a>). We are committed to enhancing our APIs and white-label SaaS solutions. Tailored products for diverse segments, ranging from asset managers to Web3 RWA projects, are in development to catalyze the RWA wave and advance the asset digitization phase.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Delivering immediate benefits:&nbsp;Accelerating towards liquidity begins with addressing immediate pain points for institutions. Why tokenize now? It’s all about enhancing operational efficiency and streamlining processes with 3rd parties applications, to slash costs. By solving these points, we can set the stage for bringing enormous high-quality assets on-chain, laying the foundation for the critical mass needed for advanced services, and emphasizing transferability, reach, and liquidity.</p>
 
 Improved operational efficiency:&nbsp;Manual, human-based processes are not just time-consuming but also costly. And it is a common challenge across the entire private market. To tackle this, we’re developing features and smart contracts for various business cases, automating workflows from onboarding, and corporate actions, to secondary tradings. Automation increases operational capability, empowering institutions to reach a larger investor base. 
 Bridging 3rd party digital applications:&nbsp;Another notable challenge arises from the fragmented collaboration between various applications, each operated by different third parties. The multitude of digital applications involved in operations can create gaps when assets are brought on-chain. To address this, our products will continue to connect these disparate solutions, ensuring a cohesive operational workflow between tokenized assets and the involved providers. 
 
<p>3.&nbsp;The powerhouse for major corporations:&nbsp;Our strategy revolves around seamless integration into legacy systems and forming partnerships with tech providers, such as custody solutions, integrators, and financial platforms. Through strategic ecosystem integrations, we empower partners to seamlessly utilize our engine, allowing them to concentrate on their core business and sales while we manage all technical aspects.</p>
<p>Enabling DeFi by building a common data set for private markets:&nbsp;Initiated by accelerating permissioned DeFi, this month, we co-developed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.erc3643.org/news/erc-3643-association-members-developed-open-source-ui-components-to-bridge-defi-and-regulated-rwa?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8RUs4gACQdk6BbN54jHVqFm74aEPuPDEGCyaq_EE5yfATnaaA2o47yqsavBstKBZv9NvI7">an open-source UI component</a>&nbsp;with Dev.Pro. With this tool, DeFi is now equipped for regulated assets through ERC-3643, enabling any decentralized exchanges (DEX), automated market makers (AMMs), or lending protocol to provide compliant liquidity or collateralization for tokenized securities and RWA. Regulated entities can even launch their lending smart contracts. Our next move involves building a universal data set for tokenized securities through a product named AssetID, facilitating easy access to verifiable asset data for DeFi applications.</p>
<p>Building the distribution rails: DINO is an interoperable distribution network for digital securities that leverages the ERC-3643 standard. Our commitment to growth extends to integrating additional distribution channels into the DINO ecosystem. Compatibility with centralized exchanges (CEX) and AMMs is seamlessly established on our platform. As we eagerly await more DeFi protocols, the open-source UI component stands ready to welcome them. Think of us as a connector, ensuring a seamless convergence of all distribution rails on our platform.</p>
<p>Secondary market innovation:&nbsp;We will unveil an upgraded version of the Billboard, serving as a license-exempted P2P secondary market solution, enabling investors to seamlessly publish buy or sell intentions, just like placing an ad. Taking it a step further, we will introduce a fully decentralized version of the Billboard, entirely powered by smart contracts. This will allow counterparts to accept an offer directly on-chain, facilitating a peer-to-peer transaction. The offer can circulate across the entire distribution network, visible to all, but only eligible investors for the concerned tokens can accept it.</p>
<p>Exciting times lie ahead, and we look forward to embarking on this journey with you. Stay tuned for more developments throughout the year.</p>

 We can afford what we can actually do — 3 <p>Increasing financial constraints mean families, organisations and Governments are spending less money on the things they want and need, generating a doom spiral of decline. We need to find ways to <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-can-afford-what-we-can-actually-do-1-efdca9835617">expand what we can actually do</a> outside of the straitjacket of ‘we can only do what we can afford’. This third blog in a three part series, looks at how we at Mydex are working to expand what we as communities and as a society can actually&nbsp;do..</p><p>In <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-can-afford-what-we-can-actually-do-2-96213dd4d546">the second blog</a> in this series we looked at eight interconnected ways of expanding ‘what we can actually do’. They&nbsp;were:</p>  think capabilities (not just targets);  think genuine productivity (not just cuts and savings);  think mutual self help (to escape dependencies on external funders);  think clubs and communities (which provide agency, and not just markets and states, which take it&nbsp;away);  think institutional innovation (not just working within existing institutional constraints);  think genuine investment (and not just financial extraction);  think demonetisation (all the things we can do without money having to change hands);&nbsp;and  think Fair Process (because that’s the best way to do all the&nbsp;above).  <p>Here is how the work we (Mydex) are doing fits this&nbsp;agenda.</p> Think capabilities <p>Mydex’s data sharing platforms are a new form of infrastructure whose whole purpose is to expand what we can actually do with data. This includes expanding what we can do with the data itself (especially in terms of productivity) and, therefore, what we can actually do in terms of the services that this data makes possible. New data capabilities are all about expanding people and organisations’ ability to actually do&nbsp;stuff.</p> Think genuine productivity <p>In our work we enable safe, efficient data sharing and reuse so that the right people and organisations can access and use the right, reliable data at the right times. As our White Paper on the <a href="https://mydex.org/resources/papers/Hidden_in_Plain_Sight_The_Surprising_Economics_of_Personal_Data/hidden-in-plain-sight-the-surprising-economics-of-personal-data-mydex-2022.pdf">Surprising Economics of Personal Data</a> shows, this cuts a huge amount of FERC (Friction, Effort, Risk and Cost) out of existing processes, enabling people and organisation to do a lot more with the same resources. Everything we do is about enhancing genuine productivity.</p> Think mutual self&nbsp;help <p>Right now, a lot of the work we are doing is in what we call health and care ‘clusters’. This is where many different people and organisations all come together to better address a particular group of peoples’ particular needs. These clusters are a form of mutual self help in practice: different people and organisations coming together to share data and coordinate activities in order to help each other to produce better outcomes.</p> Think clubs and communities <p>The clusters we are working within in health and care are a form of club where everybody contributes their bit and everyone gets their share of the benefits. In addition, we have built an entire platform called Inclued to enable the data sharing that helps people share data and coordinate activities in mutually supportive communities.</p> Think institutional innovation <p>Mydex is a Community Interest Company. Yes, we make and spend money like every other organisation, because we live in a world constrained by ‘we can only do what we can afford’. But we don’t do what we do to make money out of it. We make money in order to invest it in our purpose: to advance the community’s interest when it comes to personal data. Everything about our legal form is designed to ensure this happens. CICs are a continuation of the long tradition of institutional innovation we referred to in the second blog of this series&nbsp;[LINK].</p> Think genuine investment <p>Mydex exists because, thankfully, some genuine investors still exist (as opposed to multiple ‘investor’ saboteurs who are only interested in financial extraction). We wish there were more genuine investors and fewer saboteurs!</p> Think demonetisation <p>One of the things that perplex people about Mydex data platforms is that no money changes hands for data. We are not building a market for data. We enable non-monetised data sharing for mutual benefit. That doesn’t mean it isn’t economically valuable or doesn’t make economic sense. Quite the opposite. Non-monetised data sharing unleashes enormous personal, social and economic value because of the productivity gains it unleashes and the opportunities for innovation it creates. In demonetising data, we are helping to demonetise genuine wealth creation.</p> Think Fair&nbsp;Process <p>Everything about Mydex as infrastructure and as an institution is organised around one thing: giving individuals a real say over how their data is used. Because this data is used to provide most services, this extends to giving people a say in how the services they used are organised and delivered. At one level, personal data stores are a technical solution to a technical data problem. But they are a lot more than that. They are also <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-human-rights-based-approach-to-personal-data-566f4e4a8cb4">engines of human&nbsp;rights</a>.</p> Conclusion <p>Throughout their history humans have wrestled with the paradox of having to work within constraints they are confronted with and cannot avoid while also working out ways to lift these constraints.</p><p>Today, increasingly harsh constraints of ‘we can only do what we can afford’ are closing down options for families, organisations and Governments, tipping them into a spiral of decline. That can only mean one thing: the quest to lift those constraints — of finding ways to expand what we can actually do — it also growing in importance as every day goes by. It’s the responsibility of all of us — no matter what circumstances we find ourselves in and no matter what level of responsibility or authority —to look for ways break out of the straitjacket of ‘we can only do what we can afford’ and to find ways to expand ‘what we can actually&nbsp;do’.</p><p>This is our quest. We hope you will join us in pursuing&nbsp;it.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/increasing-financial-constraints-mean-families-organisations-and-governments-are-spending-less-e34ffc932dc4">Increasing financial constraints mean families, organisations and Governments are spending less…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Stakers can claim DF74 rewards. DF75 runs Feb 1 — Feb 8,&nbsp;2024  1. Overview <p>Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean’s incentives program. In DF, you can earn OCEAN rewards by locking OCEAN, curating data, and making predictions (in Predictoor). <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Here are DF&nbsp;docs</a>.</p><p>Data Farming Round 74 (DF74) has completed. 150K OCEAN + 20K ROSE was budgeted for rewards. Rewards counting started 12:01am Jan 25, 2024 and ended 12:01 am Feb 1. You can claim rewards at the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards"> DF dapp</a> Claim&nbsp;Portal.</p><p>DF75 is live today, Feb 1. It concludes on Feb 8. 150K OCEAN and 20K ROSE are budgeted in total for&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>This post is organized as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Section 2: DF structure  Section 3: How to earn rewards, and claim&nbsp;them  Section 4: Specific parameters for&nbsp;DF75   2. DF structure   Passive DF. As a veOCEAN holder, you get passive rewards by&nbsp;default.  Active DF has two substreams.<br>– Volume DF. Actively curate data by allocating veOCEAN towards data assets with high Data Consume Volume (DCV), to earn more.<br>– Predictoor DF. Actively predict crypto prices by submitting a price prediction and staking OCEAN to slash competitors and&nbsp;earn.   3. How to Earn Rewards, and Claim&nbsp;Them <p>There are three ways to earn and claim rewards: passive DF (like before), Active DF&nbsp;: Volume DF (like before), and Predictoor DF&nbsp;(new).</p>  Passive DF. To earn: lock OCEAN for veOCEAN, via the<a href="http://df.oceandao.org/veocean"> DF webapp’s veOCEAN page</a>. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Passive Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button.<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more&nbsp;details.  Active DF<br>– Volume DF substream. To earn: allocate veOCEAN towards data assets, via the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/"> DF webapp</a>’s Volume DF page. To claim: go to the<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards#activerewards"> DF Webapp’s Rewards page</a>; within the “Active Rewards” panel, click the “claim” button (it claims across all Active DF substreams at once).<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/rewards"> The Ocean docs</a> have more details.<br>– Predictoor DF substream. To earn: submit accurate predictions via <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/">Predictoor Bots</a> and stake OCEAN to slash incorrect Predictoors. To claim OCEAN rewards: run the Predictoor $OCEAN payout script, linked from <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean docs. To claim ROSE rewards: see instructions in <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf/predictoordf-guide">Predictoor DF user guide</a> in Ocean&nbsp;docs.   4. Specific Parameters for&nbsp;DF75 <p>This round is part of DF Main, phase&nbsp;1.</p><p>Budget. This round has 150,000 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE rewards total. That OCEAN and ROSE is allocated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Passive DF: 50% of rewards = 75,000&nbsp;OCEAN  Active DF: 50% of rewards<br>– Predictoor DF. 50% = 37,500 OCEAN + 20,000 ROSE<br>– Volume DF. 50% = 37,500&nbsp;OCEAN  <p>Networks. Ocean currently<a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/"> supports</a> five production networks: Ethereum Mainnet, Polygon, BSC, EWC, and Moonriver. DF applies to data on all of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Volume DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, distribute OCEAN across each asset based on<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df22-completed-df23-started-reward-function-tuned-ffd4359657ee"> rank</a>: highest-DCV asset gets most OCEAN,&nbsp;etc.  Then, for each asset and each veOCEAN holder:<br>– If the holder is a<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-publisher-rewards-f2639525e508"> publisher, 2x the effective stake<br></a>– Baseline rewards = (% stake in asset) * (OCEAN for asset)<br>– Bound rewards to the asset by 125% APY<br>– Bound rewards by<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming-df8-completed-df9-started-32449b9a52c6"> asset’s DCV * 0.1%. This prevents wash&nbsp;consume</a>.  <p>Predictoor DF rewards are calculated as&nbsp;follows:</p>  First, DF Buyer agent purchases Predictoor feeds using OCEAN throughout the week to evenly distribute these&nbsp;rewards.  Then, ROSE is distributed at the end of the week to active Predictoors that have been claiming their&nbsp;rewards.  <p>Expect further evolution in Active DF: tuning substreams and budget adjustments among substreams. What remains constant is passive DF, and the total OCEAN rewards emission schedule.</p><p>Updates are always announced at the beginning of a round, if not&nbsp;sooner.</p> Appendix: Further&nbsp;Reading <p>The<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-data-farming-series-c7922f1d0e45"> Data Farming Series</a> post collects key articles and related resources about&nbsp;DF.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

Future updates will add decentralized ecosystem governance (DEGov), JSON-LD and SD-JWT credential types, and OID4VC, providing interoperability with the European Union’s Digital Identity Wallet standards. Indicio is committed to enabling interoperability with all major cross border projects.</p>
<p>“Our SDK is the biggest advancement in digital identity wallet technology to date,” said Heather Dahl, CEO, Indicio. “We’ve eliminated the complexity of having to cobble together code written in different languages from multiple libraries and delivered a single source for integrated innovation with comprehensive functionality and interoperability — all based on well-tested code. Everything’s in one place for you to start building, save time, save money, and deliver the killer features your customers want in your products.”</p>

<p>Between the pings, swipes, and endless scrolls of the modern world, genuine human connection often feels out of reach. For Joe Feminella, the problem of fostering meaningful interactions in the digital era led him to found the dating app First Round’s on Me.</p><p>Sparked by his own fatigue trying to find deep relationships in a system obsessed with scale over substance, Joe’s journey reveals three pivotal insights on coordinating impactful collaboration.</p><p>Joe's experience in developing a dating app offers a unique perspective on how innovative technology can be used to create more meaningful connections.</p> How the Design of Coordination Systems Affect Outcomes <p>While technology has the power to connect people globally, design choices dictate impacts on relationships. App founder Joe Feminella observes, “I think technology is just moving so quickly that we often don't know what to do with it.” Rapid digitization makes it hard to accommodate the reality of everyday life.</p><p>Consequently, Joe watched social platforms overwhelm users with information rather than facilitating meaningful connections. Engineered to maximize matches, the barrage of stimulus short-circuited genuine intimacy.</p><p>Joe suggests that “progress requires transcending entrenched, engineering-only perspectives.” Bridging system gaps in belonging allows innovation to elevate, not exploit, understanding.</p><p>This involves recalibrating metrics to empower care-centered coordination. As Joe concludes, “user-informed design interweaves logic with healthy social values.” By grasping technology’s influence, we gain a conviction for writing social code that finally facilitates the connections we want.&nbsp;</p> Using Feedback to Build a Better App <p>User frustration often signals when tools hamper rather than help healthy relating. For app founder Joe Feminella, the frustration he and his dates shared about the platforms they were meeting on revealed recurrent unmet needs.</p><p>Across demographics and identities, people voiced the desire for more intentional interactions cultivating genuine intimacy. They felt starved of courtship customs signaling care, not just matches indicating cursory interest. Stark contrasts emerged between the claims of these dating apps, which promised meaningful connections, and the actual experiences of emotional depletion they provided.</p><p>Application users expressed feeling reduced to a number, valued for quantification over quality of character. As the number of dating apps grew, environments that should encourage vulnerability lacked sufficient moderation protections. Leaving many to feel objectified by digitally amplified attention patterns.</p><p>Joe suggests exploitation causes anxiety, stating “onslaughts of stimulus overload sensitivities crafted over millennia.” By focusing computing on growth before grounded human needs, innovation routinely agitates users.</p><p>This taught Joe the need for cross-discipline solutions. He felt compelled to bridge the gaps hindering healthy bonds and to leverage technology for good. As he concludes, “Progress means transcending entrenched perspectives across disciplines.” Collectively authored improvements weave care back into digital social fabrics.</p> Bringing More Heart Into Tech to Bridge Understanding <p>Holochain's framework is made for peer-to-peer applications that are secure, reliable, and fast. Moreover, Holochain is made for social applications that bring people together, centering the user. This technology aligns perfectly with Joe's vision of building authentic connections.&nbsp;</p><p>His experience developing a dating app that emphasizes genuine human relationships is paralleled by Holochain's goal to connect user devices directly in secure networks, giving users the autonomy of locally installed software that still benefits from the power and redundancy of cloud software.&nbsp;</p><p>Joe's insight into user experience and cross-disciplinary thinking are essential. New, innovative technology still needs to be user-friendly and accessible to help enable human connection. Hope persists for redeeming technology to elevate healthy bonds, not degrade them. Joe suggests progress stems from “transcending entrenched perspectives” — blending wisdom across domains to braid ethical values back into digital spaces.</p> A More Connected Future <p>The tools either dividing or uniting us remain unwritten, awaiting our choice. While scripts concentrating on control and surveillance surround us, we retain the power to edit the tale toward care.</p><p>Now more than ever, we require rewriting the social code — infusing creativity with conscience, and computation with compassion. Though challenges persist in balancing scalability with situated nuance, a more beautiful technology beckons just beyond reach when we link hands across domains.</p>

<p>Less than a month into 2024 and password spraying is being named as the origin for our first eye-opening cyber-attack. In a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/01/25/midnight-blizzard-guidance-for-responders-on-nation-state-attack/">blog post</a>, Microsoft has identified Midnight Blizzard, the Russian state-sponsored actor also known as NOBELIUM for the attack on their corporate systems.</p>
<p>This is another in the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats. As organizations continue to grapple with the reality of sophisticated cyber-attacks, it becomes imperative to look for additional alternatives to bolster defenses if a breach is due to a wider security vulnerability.</p>
<p>Considering the recent guidance provided by Microsoft on the “Midnight Blizzard” nation-state attack, we at 1Kosmos delve into the nuances of this threat and offer insights into how organizations can navigate through the latest attack vector.</p>
 Understanding the Midnight Blizzard Cyber-Attack 
<p>What was the Midnight Blizzard cyber-attack? As covered by Microsoft Threat Intelligence, it represents a formidable challenge for organizations worldwide. Characterized by the group’s stealthy infiltration and persistent nature, this sophisticated attack exploited network vulnerabilities and breached Microsoft’s Outlook by using a test account to authorize a custom-built malicious application.</p>
<p>The group utilized a password spraying attack that successfully compromised a legacy, non-production test tenant account that did not have multifactor authentication (MFA) enabled. The account inadvertently gave hackers access to the inboxes of various executives, including those in cybersecurity and legal functions.</p>
<p>This allowed them to steal copies of their emails and attachments through a legacy OAuth application that had elevated access to the Microsoft corporate environment. The group had access for approximately six weeks before they were discovered.</p>
<p>The vulnerability was not limited to Microsoft’s own environment. As part of their forensic analysis, Microsoft determined that the same group of attackers used identical tactics to target the inboxes of an unspecified number of Microsoft’s customers.</p>
 The Attack 
<p></p>
 1Kosmos Perspective: Building Security Resilience 
<p>The nature of this attack illustrates a need to eliminate passwords, strengthen multi-factor authentication, prevent lateral movement, and simpifly the IT (Information Technology) stack.</p>
 How 1Kosmos can help: 
<p>Prevent Password Spraying Attacks: 1Kosmos can eliminate passwords wherever possible, and where not possible, enforce regular password reset intervals with a password reset workflow that proves the user’s identity to ensure the reset request’s validity.</p>
<p>Zero Trust Methodology: 1Kosmos authentication methods exceed Zero Trust guidelines and mitigate the risk posed by attackers, by verifying every user and device attempting to access resources. The result can limit the lateral movement of attackers within their networks, thwarting sophisticated infiltration attempts.</p>
<p>Phish-Proof MFA: 1Kosmos strong identity-based authentication protocols perform strong authentication and significantly improve the user experience. 1Kosmos LiveID is a phishing-proof MFA that proves identity at every access request.</p>
<p>Risk Based Authentication: One-size-fits-all authentication solutions prove ineffective, underscoring the imperative for risk-based authentication to become the standard rather than the exception. 1Kosmos can use contextual factors like device details and location to assess the risk level and apply the right level of authentication.</p>
<p>Audit and Reporting: 1Kosmos is built on a private and permissioned blockchain. This private, permissioned ledger retains a detailed, immutable audit trail of all events, enabling visibility to all logins, access attempts, information updates, and shared information related to the digital identity. These logs can be shared with SOC teams and other platforms to ensure quick digital forensic analysis.</p>
<p>Collaborative Defenses: Collaboration and integration are key to a successful security infrastructure. 1Kosmos has built out-of-the-box integrations with industry peers (including Microsoft) to enhance the resilience of organizations against sophisticated attacks. Relying on a duct tape infrastructure and the gaps they inject is exactly what these hackers are looking to exploit. A tightly coupled integration will reduce gaps and improve an overall security posture.</p>
<p>Industry Certifications: 1Kosmos has taken the step to ensure the safety and security of our platform. For instance, 1Kosmos is certified to many standards including FIDO2, NIST 800-63-3, UK DIATF and iBeta DEA EPCS. The combination of these standards prevents identity impersonation, account takeover and fraud while delivering frictionless user experiences that preserve user privacy.</p>
 1Kosmos Prevents Identity Based Attacks 
<p></p>
<p>As the threat landscape continues to evolve, we must remain focused and adaptive in our cybersecurity strategies. The Midnight Blizzard attack serves as a stark reminder of the persistent threat posed by nation-state adversaries. By embracing a proactive, collaborative, and identity-centric approach to security, organizations can bolster their resilience and effectively navigate through the digital storm unleashed by sophisticated attackers.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, we empower remote identity verification and passwordless multi-factor authentication, facilitating secure transactions with digital services for employees, customers, and residents alike. Through the integration of identity proofing, credential verification, and strong authentication, 1Kosmos effectively combats identity-based attacks, empowering organizations with the tools, insights, and expertise needed to combat threats such as this one and safeguard their digital assets.</p>

<p>On March 1st, 2021, the European Banking Authority <a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-01/a3e89f4f-fbf3-4bd6-9e07-35f3243555b3/Final%20Amending%20%20Guidelines%20on%20MLTF%20Risk%20Factors.pdf">published final revised guidelines</a> on money laundering and terrorist financing risk factors, offering directions on how it intends to lead, coordinate, and monitor the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing.</p><p>Nearly three years later, on January 16th, 2024, the EBA published guidelines amending the earlier&nbsp;ones.</p><p>So, what do these amendments imply? How do they impact CASPs, the crypto asset service providers? What do the CASP/VASPs need to do to comply with these amendments? These are the aspects we will discuss in the segments&nbsp;below.</p> How Does EBA’s Final Guidelines Impact&nbsp;CASPs <p>The amendments outline what CASPs must do to handle potential money laundering and terrorist financing risks in their overall business and each transaction.</p> The Assumption That Drives EBA’s Guideline Amendments for CASPs/VASPs <p>The new guidelines recognize that Crypto Asset Service Providers operate differently from traditional banks. They point out that CASPs often deal with transfers to self-managed wallets and various decentralized platforms, which aren’t uniformly regulated worldwide. This might make them more vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing. The guidelines also note that certain features in crypto assets, which can keep transactions anonymous, could increase these&nbsp;risks.</p> What Could CASPs Do to Reduce&nbsp;Risk? <p>The EBA is advising Crypto Asset Service Providers to increase vigilance against the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing, especially due to the ease of anonymous international transfers.</p><p>Their advice includes practical steps like limiting product features to control where money can be sent. This means <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/new-european-crypto-transfer-rules-in-2024">allowing transfers</a> only to certain approved parties, such as crypto-asset accounts or bank accounts in the customer’s name, which are already following strict anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regulations.</p><p>Additionally, the EBA suggests CASPs could use more controlled payment systems, like those used for small payments or transactions with the government. Another idea is to offer services specifically to certain groups, like a company’s employees, to better manage&nbsp;risk.</p><p>The EBA also notes that CASPs can lower their risk by ensuring customers meet regulatory standards and have a clean history of crypto transactions. Transactions that involve converting to or from official currency, especially through bank accounts in low-risk areas, are seen as safer. The same goes for low-value transactions for goods and services, as long as there’s no negative information about the involved crypto accounts.</p><p>CASPs are also encouraged to think about the risks linked to how and where they offer their services.</p><p>While these suggestions can help minimize risks, the EBA emphasizes the need for CASPs to actively implement measures that make their operations more&nbsp;secure.</p> The Measures that the EBA’s Amending Guidelines Recommend for&nbsp;CASPs <p>The EBA wants CASPs to have suitable and effective monitoring tools, including transaction monitoring tools and advanced analytics tools. The CASPs must also train relevant employees for them to have a wholesome understanding of crypto assets and ML/TF risks to which they may expose the provider.</p> The CASPs Must Ensure Enhanced Customer Due Diligence <p>According to the European Banking Authority’s published final revised guidelines,</p><p>CASPs must verify the identities of customers and beneficial owners using multiple trusted and independent sources. They also need to identify and verify majority shareholders who are not yet compliant.</p><p>EBA underlines that to understand customer relationships better, gathering more information about the customer and the business’s nature and purpose is essential, including tracing the origins of their funds and&nbsp;wealth.</p><p>CASPs are also advised to increase the frequency of monitoring crypto-asset transactions. And upon any triggering event, they need to rigorously review, update, and document relevant customer information. Conducting business relationship reviews more regularly is part of this protocol.</p><p>According to EBA, CASPs should use investigation tools more extensively for a deeper investigation into crypto assets. This includes examining all distributed ledger addresses a customer might use, particularly if they have several. They also need to monitor customer IP addresses more frequently.</p><p>Understanding a customer’s knowledge about crypto assets is another focus area of the amended guidelines. CASPs should take additional steps when withdrawal or redemption patterns do not align with the customer’s usual profile and determine whether the customer or a third party initiates these transactions.</p><p>Lastly, CASPs have the responsibility to verify that a customer truly controls and owns their self-hosted wallet address. To aid in this process, CASPs can now utilize <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/user-signing-now-available-on-shyft-veriscope">Veriscope’s User Signing feature</a>. It allows them to directly request cryptographic proof from users’ self-hosted wallets.</p> Analytics and Record-Keeping Requirements for&nbsp;CASPs <p>The EBA guidelines recommend the application of advanced analytics tools to transactions on a risk-sensitive basis.

The guidelines recognize that CASPs operate differently than traditional banks and may be more vulnerable to risks due to features like anonymity.  The EBA advises CASPs to take practical steps like limiting high-risk product features and transactions, verifying customer identities rigorously, and monitoring transactions more&nbsp;closely.  CASPs need enhanced customer due diligence including gathering more customer information, investigating crypto addresses, and understanding customer knowledge and behavior.  The guidelines recommend CASPs use advanced analytics tools to supplement standard monitoring and maintain comprehensive records linking crypto addresses to individuals/entities.  <p>______________________________________</p><p>Shyft Network powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

 ‘We can afford what we can actually do’ — 2 <p>Across the country people from all walks of life — from those running families to those running organisations and Governments — are <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-can-afford-what-we-can-actually-do-1-efdca9835617">having to ride two horses</a> at once: one that says we can only do what we can afford, financially speaking; and one that says we can afford what we can actually do. This second part of a three part series examines ways to expand what we can actually&nbsp;do.</p><p>In the dark days when the second world war was coming to an end people started discussing how to rebuild. As soon as they did so, they found themselves embroiled in a fundamental argument. Some said there was little if anything we could do, because we didn’t have the money to do it. Others, led by John Maynard Keynes said that was nonsense. As long as we had people who could work and resources they could work with, there were plenty of things we could do. “<a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-can-afford-what-we-can-actually-do-1-efdca9835617">We can afford what we can actually do</a>”, he&nbsp;said.</p><p>How then can we expand what we can actually do, in our current situation? Here are some of the things we at Mydex Community Interest Company have been thinking about and trying to put into practice.</p> Think capabilities <p>In recent decades, policy-makers and decision-makers have become obsessed with targets. They believed that if they defined the outcomes they wanted to achieve and focused resolutely and exclusively on achieving these outcomes, then all would be well. It all sounded very sensible and practical, but in fact it was quite the opposite. Why? Because what really matters is not whether one particular outcome is achieved, but whether we have the ability to continue achieving this outcome. What really matters is our capabilities because results follow from capabilities.</p><p>Yes, it is possible to strain every nerve and expend every ounce of energy achieving a particular target (and then collapsing in a heap afterwards). But doing this doesn’t build capabilities. It destroys them. And that’s what’s been happening with decades’ worth of outcomes-obsessed target setting, outsourcing and so on, with institutions like the NHS effectively being run into the&nbsp;ground.</p><p>Once we think of outcomes as the results of capabilities, then the main goal of every activity shouldn’t be just to deliver this or that particular outcome. It should be to do everything we can to build underlying capabilities alongside delivering the outcome in question.</p><p>Results are ephemeral. Once you’ve achieved them, they’re gone. But skills, knowledge, know-how and infrastructure are not ephemeral. They last. It’s capabilities that make results permanent — and that make it possible to improve on these results as time goes&nbsp;by.</p> Think genuine productivity <p>It’s all very well saying “we can afford what we can actually do” but what happens if what we can actually do is constrained — if our resources are&nbsp;limited?</p><p>This has been the human dilemma since the year dot. This is why expanding the scope, range and volume of the things we can actually do has also been the focus of human economic activity since the year&nbsp;dot.</p><p>At the heart of this lies productivity. Now, it’s sad but true: in recent times the word ‘productivity’ has got itself a bad name. It’s become associated with negative things like cutting corners or sweating the labour force — or, perhaps, with simply being boring and tedious. But in reality productivity is all we’ve got, because productivity is about making enough of the things we physically need practically available. Productivity is about building the ability to generate more, better outcomes using less resources — and what is more important than that? Without increased productivity it’s not possible to sustainably improve peoples’ material wellbeing.</p><p>Genuine productivity is liberating. When, for example, some clever sailors decided to start putting up sheets of fabric to capture the power of the wind rather than relying on rows of tired, sweating men desperately pulling on oars, they achieved a huge productivity revolution. Men who had previously worked desperately hard pulling oars could now devote their time and energy to doing other things. Boats could carry much bigger cargos (using the space previously occupied by oarsmen). And sailors could take these cargoes much further, because the wind never&nbsp;tires.</p><p>Sometimes productivity revolutions are generated by technical breakthroughs (LED lighting uses 85% less energy than previous forms of lighting). At other times, they are generated by changing the ways in which work is organised. Henry Ford’s moving assembly lines cut the time and labour needed to make a motor car by over 90%, making cars available to ordinary&nbsp;people.</p><p>Whether it’s from technical or organisational innovation, genuine productivity enables humans to achieve more using less resources: less time, less energy and effort, less materials. It is how real wealth has been created since the year&nbsp;dot.</p><p>But if Governments focus only on what they can afford — on the money overlay — while ignoring the underlying economic realities of what can actually be done, then the chances we have to improve productivity will be be passed over.&nbsp;Ignored.</p><p>This has now been happening for decades, and it really is time that it&nbsp;changed.</p> Think mutual self&nbsp;help <p>In countless situations humans can achieve far more if they cooperate and work together instead of simply acting alone. It’s much easier for two people to push a broken down car than one. Even easier if it’s&nbsp;three.</p><p>Back in the day, before this country had a welfare state and before Governments and states grew so big and powerful, people had all sorts of needs that weren’t being met. Governments of the day would not, or could not, do anything to help them, so they had to learn how to help themselves.</p><p>That’s what the labour movement did, for example. It gathered people together to share resources and to use these resources to help each other help themselves. People did this in many different ways, building friendly societies, mutual building societies, burial societies, producer cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, trade unions, and so on — all of them acting not on the mantra of ‘we can only do what we can afford’ but focusing on the question ‘what we can actually&nbsp;do?’.</p><p>Decades ago, in the face of institutional inertia and failure, the people of this country created a flowering of institutional creativity, building completely new institutions from the ground up, designed to fit the circumstances they found themselves in. The welfare state — social security benefits, state pensions, the NHS and so on — were just further examples of a long and deep history of mutual institutional innovation.</p><p>With Governments once again saying there are things that they cannot or will not do, perhaps it is time to cherish and revisit that legacy. Perhaps, we as a society and citizenry need to stop looking up to the top with a begging bowl and start looking to each other again, to ask a different question: “OK. So what can we as communities (in, that is, countless different types of community) actually do with the resources we have&nbsp;got?”</p> Think ‘clubs’ and communities, not just ‘markets’ and&nbsp;‘states’ <p>In recent years, many people have pointed out that the classic left/right debates about ‘markets’ versus ‘states’ renders a huge part of our lives invisible — the fact that we live in communities. They may be local, physical communities or communities of interest or communities of practice. Either way, they’re important because they bring people together in ways where they share a common experience or interest.</p><p>In the context of expanding what we can actually do, communities are important because there are many ways to cooperate and share resources, things, information etc within a community. There are ways to make things possible and enrich peoples’ lives without having to turn to either a market or a&nbsp;state.</p><p>But there is lots more where that came from. Back in the mid-sixties a young economist called James Buchanan wrote an article called ‘An Economic Theory of Clubs’. In it, he noticed that when we look at real world economic activities, very few of them fit the mould of either pure market (all just private individuals exchanging purely private property), or pure state (where everything is publicly owned and all decisions are made by the&nbsp;state).</p><p>In reality, he noted, most economic activities fit somewhere in the middle, in what he called clubs. This is where a number of people (but not everybody) contributes to creating a resource and enabling access to it and where, having contributed to this resource they share access to it according to rules that they have all agreed to. In a tennis club for example, every member contributes to maintaining the facilities, and every member gets to enjoy&nbsp;them.</p><p>To work well, clubs need boundaries. The tennis club can easily share a court between 100 or perhaps 1000 members. But if it becomes 100,000, then the court can’t serve them all. Likewise, five or six people helping to push that car is great. But if it is 50 or 60 it doesn’t work any more. So clubs happen when specific groups of people get together to do specific&nbsp;things.</p><p>Using Buchanan’s terms, firms a sort of club. So are supply chains and clusters where a number of organisations work together to achieve a common purpose — for example in health and care, dealing with one individual’s specific issue where lots of different inputs are required.</p><p>Once you think about it this way, it quickly becomes obvious that the vast majority of economic activity isn’t actually undertaken by either markets or states, but by ‘clubs’ where specific groups of people find ways of working together on particular things to improve on and expand what they can actually&nbsp;do.</p><p>This underlines the importance of human agency. Very often we find ourselves at the mercy of market forces, or dependent on the state. Markets and states are supposed to be complete opposites, but they have one thing in common. They both undermine and restrict human agency. (A key point about market forces is that they force us to behave in particular ways.) In contrast, clubs and communities emphasise and develop agency — our joint quest to lift the constraints we are faced&nbsp;with.</p><p>In short, there is a vast swathe of positive, productive economic activity that could be undertaken — that could expand what we can actually do — that needs neither remorseless market forces nor centralised bureaucracies to enable it to work. There is a vast untapped potential just waiting to be&nbsp;tapped.</p> Think institutional innovation <p>As Keynes pointed out, money isn’t a real economic resource. You can’t eat pound notes or build houses with them. To eat something we need food — a material thing, not a financial, symbolic thing. To have food we need to grow it. Growing food takes time, from planting to harvesting. Growing, processing and moving food requires energy and material resources like land, tractors and trucks. That is what the real economy is about: People, Time, Energy, Resources.</p><p>Money is just a poor symbol of these things. It’s supposed to represent real economic resources (though, increasingly it doesn’t), and it’s used as a mechanism to allocate and deploy these resources. But it is not the real thing. It is an institutional overlay, sitting on top of the real economy, creating a veil between us and the real thing (a veil which often obscures the real thing’s workings).</p><p>Institutions create the ‘rules of the road’ by which we humans get together and do things. We need these institutions. But sometimes they go wrong. Sometimes they are not well designed.</p><p>Money is one such institution. The institutional overlay of money and financial affordability works well when it deploys and allocates available human and material resources to meet human needs. But if and when it stops doing this job — if it creates a barrier between meeting human needs and the deployment of resources — then this institutional overlay is no longer fit for purpose. It has become a constraint that we need to&nbsp;lift.</p><p>The answer to not having enough money to spend on what we need is not to simply spend money as if there is no tomorrow. It’s not a choice between ‘fiscal responsibility’ and ‘fiscal irresponsibility’. It is to shift focus: to focus on expanding what we can actually do. To find new ways to connect real-world resources with real-world humans and their&nbsp;needs.</p><p>This isn’t just about technical innovation. It is about institutional innovation: building new institutions that create new rules of the road to enable people to get together. To make these connections in new ways to do new things. Just as the labour movement did a century&nbsp;ago.</p> Think genuine investment <p>In theory, the purpose of an investment is to build a capability that delivers better results. This is where the ‘returns’ on your investment come from. But over the past few decades, ‘investors’ have grown impatient with the time and effort that’s needed to build capabilities.</p><p>Instead, they have looked for ways to get better results wihtout having to worry about that pesky intervening bit of earning them via the extra wealth generated by the development of new capabilities. For example, if you can earn a bigger ‘return’ by shuffling the title deeds to an already-existing asset or gambling on its future price, why not? A return is a return. Who cares about how it’s actually&nbsp;created?</p><p>That’s why today, banks and the City of London hardly invest anything in real productive capacity. Virtually all of the money they ‘invest’ goes into the prices of existing assets such as houses, stocks and shares, or in gambling on the future prices of these in secondary ‘derivative markets’. For them, ‘investment’ is all about eating the cherries while doing nothing to plant the cherry trees or tending the cherry&nbsp;orchard.</p><p>The early 20th century economist Thorsen Veblen had a term for this. He called it sabotage. This was the process by which the people holding the money — the people deciding what is ‘affordable’ — go on strike if doesn’t guarantee them the quickest and highest possible return. Where they refuse to invest in things that may be immensely productive simply because it doesn’t line their pockets quickly&nbsp;enough.</p><p>In such a world it may be helpful to use the words ‘sabotage’ and ‘saboteur’ every time you come across the words ‘investment’ or ‘investor’. So, for example, if you see the term ‘social investor’, read ‘social saboteur’. With a few admirable exceptions it’s usually a good way of getting closer to the truth&nbsp;. But this is a truth that needs to change, with the return of real investors with a focus on expanding what we can actually&nbsp;do.</p> Think de-monetisation <p>For many decades now, most policy initiatives have focused on marketisation: where there is a human need it should have a price placed on it and for money to be exchanged. But if we enter a world where there is less money to spend, less money is exchanged, so fewer needs can be&nbsp;met.</p><p>It’s time to move in the opposite direction: to loosen this stranglehold by finding ways to de-monetise exchanges of value. If we focus on what we can actually do, rather than what we can ‘afford’ in narrow money terms, we find ourselves looking at real-world things like available time, energy (including human energy) and resources (both material and intangible e.g. knowledge, know-how, information and trust). To connect them, we might consider using local ‘alternative’ currencies or&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Such de-monetisation also opens the door to other forms of non-market exchange. Not everything has to be sold for a price. Things can also be shared, given, borrowed and lent. Deepening and extending what we can actually do includes deepening and extending what we exchange, and&nbsp;how.</p> Think Fair&nbsp;Process <p>A Fair Process is, if you like, a process for making and implementing decisions that treat those involved and affected with respect: giving them a voice, being impartial when assessing what they have to say, making decisions in their interests (rather than listening to some more than others, and biassing decisions in favour of particular vested interests). It’s a <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-human-rights-based-approach-to-personal-data-566f4e4a8cb4">human rights approach</a> to whatever you are trying to&nbsp;do.</p><p>That may sound obvious. But very often it’s not what happens. For example, ‘leaving the market to decide’ is an unfair process almost by definition. This is because markets are organised around the spending of money and that means those with the most money have the most say, while those without any money end up being&nbsp;ignored.</p><p>Fair processes, on the other hand, tend to produce the best decisions (precisely because all voices have been heard rather than just a select few). They also earn buy-in from those involved (precisely because the process is seen to be fair). This is crucial if and when to actually get something done we have to create a ‘we’: we have to bring people together in a way that encourages them to work together.</p> Conclusion <p>We now live in a world where what we can do is increasingly restricted by the institutional constraints of “what we can only do what we can afford”. Day to day, all of us at every level — from families to those working in Governments — have to find a way of surviving within these constraints. But as they get tighter we also have to look for wriggle room. We have to open up spaces which enable us to expand what we can actually do. This blog has suggested some ways we can do this (‘we’ being important here, because very often it needs a joint&nbsp;effort).</p><p>As a Community Interest Company, we at Mydex know all about the constraints of only doing what we can afford. We never have enough cash to do all the things we want to do. On the other hand, our whole raison d’etre is to expand what we as a society and individuals can do with data. So our next blog looks at how Mydex fits what we’ve been talking about&nbsp;here.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-can-afford-what-we-can-actually-do-2-96213dd4d546">‘We can afford what we can actually do’ — 2</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				 <p>By Sam Curren</p>
<p>Moving to digital trust and verifiable credentials is the goal of many current organizations. Doing so carries substantial benefits, including fraud reduction, increased data sharing with reduced integration costs, and even privacy law compliance.</p>
<p>Large-scale efforts by governments and orgs like GLEIF to create organizational identity are often championed as the foundations for this new digital world, and many are under the impression that it is one that we must wait for.</p>
<p>In reality, the relationships you already have are the key to building a digital ecosystem. Ecosystems need to identify the parties involved in the issuance and verification of credentials — who to trust for what. By contrast, large global identity projects&nbsp; will actually provide very little value to established ecosystems where the parties have established relationships with each other. Moreover, as ecosystems turn digital, newly created digital identifiers from ecosystem participants can be passed directly between participants and the ecosystem governance authority using existing communication channels and relationships; there is no need for that to be orchestrated by another party.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>Employees within a company — companies already know their employees and have existing HR processes for interacting and coordinating with employees. Employees know which company they work for. Issuing those employees verifiable employment credentials requires no outside authority.</p>
<p>Trade associations — trade associations already know their member companies and have been working with them for a long time, in some cases, years or decades. Verifiable credentials for member companies, including certifications, proof of membership, and other benefit qualifications are all based on existing relationships.</p>
<p>Business partner networks — insurance companies are a great example of how to build on established trust. They know the providers in their network, and they know the insured individuals. They can provide both directories and introductions between newly connecting parties, all leveraging these existing relationships. Patient VCs can ease onboarding at a new medical provider, while providers can provide qualification credentials to patients. Data entry errors are minimized, efficiency is gained, etc.</p>
<p>None of these examples need anybody’s permission to start innovating with VCs and gaining immediate benefits.</p>
<p>So, what do these large government efforts and global identity programs provide? We’ve made it clear that existing relationships don’t need external parties. What these large identity systems do provide is a trusted foundation for new relationships. It simplifies the process of identifying new ecosystem partners and participants, which can be a major source of fraud. By streamlining the correct identification of individuals and organizations, ecosystems can grow rapidly and more efficiently.</p>
<p>So what’s the holdup on these large programs?&nbsp; It should be no surprise that policy creation, technology development, and often regulation take time to get right.</p>
<p>As these programs mature and deliver the right technologies, they will assist in the growth of already established identity and trust ecosystems. They’ll improve upon existing methods of vetting new partners and participants, and that’ll be great.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the technologies needed to enhance trust and create digital ecosystems from your existing relationships already exist. We at Indicio help our customers do just that, and we’d like to help you as well.</p>

  <p>I’m thrilled to announce the public preview of advanced certificate-based authentication (CBA) options in Conditional Access, which provides the ability to allow access to specific resources based on the certificate Issuer or Policy Object Identifiers (OIDs) properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our customers, particularly those in highly regulated industries and government, have expressed the need for more flexibility in their CBA configurations. Using the same certificate for all Entra ID federated applications is not always sufficient. Some resources may require access with a certificate issued by specific issuers, while other resources require access based on a specific policy OIDs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, a company like Contoso may issue three different types of multifactor certificates via Smart Cards to employees, each distinguished by properties such as Policy OID or issuer. These certificates may correspond to different levels of security clearance, such as Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret. Contoso needs to ensure that only users with the appropriate multifactor certificate can access data of the corresponding classification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Authentication strength - advanced CBA options</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>With the authentication strength capability in Conditional Access, customers can now create a custom authentication strength policy, with advanced CBA options to allow access based on certificate issuer or policy OIDs. For external users whose multifactor authentication (MFA) is trusted from partners' Entra ID tenant, access can also be restricted based on these properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This adds flexibility to CBA, in addition to the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/advancing-cybersecurity-the-latest-enhancement-in-phishing/ba-p/2365681">recent updates we shared in December</a>.

 IDnow to become an active part of the European netID Foundation’s ecosystem 



<p>Munich, January 30, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, announces its cooperation with the <a href="https://netid.de/">European netID Foundation</a>. The goal: The introduction of an identity wallet for netID users in Germany as an alternative to the offerings of US platforms.</p>



<p>Developed by IDnow, the netID Wallet app will be available for users to download later this year and will allow them to reuse and share stored digital identities.</p>



<p>Self-determined and even simpler reuse of identities</p>



<p>netID is an open standard that enables users to access online services of netID partners (among others Süddeutsche Zeitung, Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland, ProSiebenSat.1 and United Internet with the WEB.DE and GMX brands) via the same login details, all in compliance with data protection regulations. The introduction of the identity wallet will make storing and retrieving identities even easier for around 40 million potential users.</p>



<p>Bundled in one digital location, users can access and verify proof of identity such as ID cards, driving licenses, social security data and much more on their smartphone at any time – making everyday processes more efficient. netID partners, in turn, can significantly simplify their processes for verifying customer data, for example for invoice purchases, and thus make them more cost-effective. </p>



<p>Wallet can be used by the partners of the netID ecosystem</p>



<p>The initial verification of the user’s identity to create the wallet is carried out using the proven IDnow solutions. Once the identity has been confirmed and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">digital wallet</a> has been successfully created, the user decides with whom they want to share what data. Anyone who uses the wallet once to register with a mobile phone provider, for example, can use it again at any time with one of the partners in the netID ecosystem for verified identification.</p>



<p>The wallet is another step toward the future: the European Commission is about to publish a new version of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas/">eIDAS regulation (electronic IDentification, Authentication and trust Services)</a>, which is expected to come into force in 2024. All EU citizens should have a digital identity by 2030. The launch of the netID Wallet supports this goal.</p>



<p>“netID has been simplifying digital life in Germany since it was founded. Transparency and data protection have always been at the heart of what we do. We see the netID Wallet as the logical next step in the further development of the netID offering. Thanks to the cooperation with IDnow, we can offer our users secure and user-friendly identity verification that will even be able to serve regulated use cases in compliance with eIDAS in the future,” explains Uli Hegge, CEO of the European netID Foundation.</p>



<p>“We are delighted to have gained a trustworthy partner for our identity wallet in Germany in the form of the European netID Foundation and to be an active part of the netID ecosystem in the future,” says Uwe Stelzig, Managing Director DACH at IDnow.  </p>



<p>“IDnow and netID pursue similar goals in terms of data security and user-friendliness, which we are now also pursuing together in identity verification. With the introduction of the wallet, users no longer have to identify themselves again and again, but can save their verified identities and simply reuse them the next time. In this way, netID partners can offer their users even faster and secure access to their services,” continues Stelzig.</p>

   by Martin Kuppinger  A while ago, I was asked how to deal with cybersecurity for Web3 and the metaverses. There is not a simple answer to this. I talked about this last year at KuppingerCole Analyst’s cyberevolution 2023, our cybersecurity conference. It’ll be a hot topic again at the upcoming EIC, KuppingerCole’s European Identity and Cloud Conference, from June the 4th to the 7th in Berlin.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>A while ago, I was asked how to deal with cybersecurity for Web3 and the metaverses. There is not a simple answer to this. I <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/securing-the-metaverse-cre23">talked about this last year</a> at KuppingerCole Analyst’s cyberevolution 2023, our cybersecurity conference. It’ll be a hot topic again at the upcoming EIC, KuppingerCole’s <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">European Identity and Cloud Conference</a>, from June the 4th to the 7th in Berlin.</p>
<p>Going back to the question: The easiest way to solve complex problems is by deconstructing them into smaller pieces, solving these, and putting everything together again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the graphic, foundational elements of Web3 converge with metaverses related technologies. It’s tough to try to solve security holistically, of course. But there is NFT Security as a smaller, yet complex&nbsp; challenge. There is DeFi (Decentralized Finance) Security — some of which we could deconstruct even further.</p>
<p>But, more importantly, there is a common universal element: Decentralized Identity. This is the glue. For solving security in a decentralized world, we need decentralized identity. Then we can solve the various challenges and construct a unified security approach.</p>
<p>Decentralized Identity, which is part of the broader theme of Digital IDs (aka Digital Identity) is one of the main themes of EIC 2024. Digital IDs are not just elements of Identity and Access Management (IAM). It is something much bigger. They relate to IAM, but in cross-organizational use (decentralized, reusable) and supply approaches that enable and leverage business models.</p>
<p>When we think about an avatar (or agent or whatever is the industry term de jour) in a metaverse, this is sort of a “digital double” to us. The term “digital twin,” unfortunately, is already used in another context (namely, manufacturing and simulation).</p>
<p>This digital double has an identity which relates to our digital identity. It acts on our behalf. This imposes challenges such as control, liability, and other concerns. Digital identity is the core of the solution, because we can define that identity, relate it to our identity and others, and keep control. Without this, we will fail in our journey towards new models, especially everything including autonomous or semi-autonomous (that is how I would name an avatar in a metaverse) systems.</p>
<p>While this field is still evolving, one thing is clear: A central foundational pillar of Web3 and the Metaverse (and every modern digital service and business) are Digital IDs, particularly decentralized identity. Also, don’t miss the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/leal/a-closer-look-at-eidas-20-and-the-eu-digital-identity-wallet">recent blog post of my colleague Alejandro Leal</a> on eIDAS and the EUDI wallet, another key topic at EIC 2024. There also is a lot of research on this topic available by KuppingerCole Analysts, such as the Advisory Note <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80858/how-enterprises-will-learn-to-love-decentralized-ids-the-roles-of-distributed-and-sovereign-identiti">How Enterprises Will Learn to Love Decentralized IDs: The Roles of Distributed and Sovereign Identities in Our Private Metaverse</a> written by Mike Neuenschwander.</p>
<p>Look at our research, talk to the analysts of KuppingerCole, and don’t miss attending EIC 2024. See you in Berlin in June!</p>

<p>"Our current credit system says, 'Saddle yourself, so we can give you more to saddle.'" Eric Lapin, President of <a href="https://www.formfree.com/">FormFree</a>, stated during a recent <a href="https://youtu.be/TZkK8a64E7I?si=2qhaIF22uGbD7lbJ">TBD live stream</a>. His comment sheds light on a fundamental paradox of the U.S. credit system: it often requires you to accumulate debt as a prerequisite for obtaining loans, leading to more debt. This systemic issue is underscored by <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/sce/credit-access#/experiences-credit-demand1">recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York</a>, which reveals that 1 in 5 applicants for mortgages, car loans, or other types of loans were rejected — the highest rate in five years. This trend disproportionately impacts Black and Latino applicants. Guided by their slogan, 'Democratizing lending for all people without bias,' FormFree developed a platform built with Web5 and AI to address these issues.</p>
 Residual Income Knowledge Index (RIKI)<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/shifting-loan-power-to-borrowers#residual-income-knowledge-index-riki" title="Direct link to Residual Income Knowledge Index (RIKI)">​</a> 
<p>The Fair Isaac Corporation score, better known as a FICO score, is a three-digit score that helps lenders in the U.S. evaluate the likelihood of a borrower repaying a loan. A higher score indicates greater reliability. However, achieving a high FICO score — or any credit score — largely depends on accruing and gradually repaying debt. This may come as a disadvantage for various groups of people who may not have a credit score, including veterans, formerly incarcerated individuals, immigrants, young adults, and folks who prefer cash transactions.</p>
<p>To provide a more holistic view of a person's creditworthiness, FormFree developed a new system called <a href="https://www.formfree.com/news-and-insights/formfree-releases-residual-income-knowledge-index/">Residual Income Knowledge Index™ (RIKI™)</a>. Instead, RIKI analyzes monthly income and spending. Integrating this method into our existing credit system provides greater opportunities for home ownership, car purchases, and other essential loans.</p>

<p>During the live stream, FormFree Software Engineer, Jon West, showcased their <a href="https://passport.formfree.com/">Passport</a> product. The demo highlighted Passport's ability to match borrowers with lenders. This feature inspired an audience member to comment, 'It's like Tinder for banks!'"</p>
<p>Here's how it works:</p>
 
 Borrowers securely connect to their bank account. 
 FormFree analyzes the account records and creates an anonymized credit profile for the borrower. 
 Lenders review these anonymized profiles and decide which borrowers to extend offers to. 
 Borrowers can now review offers from lenders and choose their preferred option. 
 All necessary borrower data is shared with the lender once a match is made. 
 
<p>Typically, borrowers endure aggressively pitched products from dozens of lending institutions. FormFree shifts control to users for more tailored loan consideration.</p>

 The landscape of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) transaction monitoring is rapidly evolving, driven by increasingly complex global regulatory demands and sophisticated money laundering tactics. Financial institutions face the daunting task of adapting to this changing landscape, where technological advancements like AI and machine learning are reshaping traditional monitoring methods. The pressure to comply with stringent regulations while managing operational complexities is higher than ever. 



 



<p>Financial institutions must effectively identify, analyze, and report suspicious activities within a landscape marked by technological evolution. The dual challenge of staying compliant with rigorous regulations and handling the operational complexities of transaction monitoring is a significant burden. This challenge is compounded by the need to manage the operational complexities of transaction monitoring and integrate advanced technology solutions that are both compliant and efficient in managing fraud risks.

 What is Anti-Money Laundering Transaction Monitoring? 



<p>Anti-Money Laundering Transaction Monitoring is a process driven by compliance regulations to ensure that financial transactions conducted by institutions are not used for money laundering or terrorist financing. The process is mandated by regulations such as the <a href="https://finance.ec.europa.eu/financial-crime/eu-context-anti-money-laundering-and-countering-financing-terrorism_en">EU’s AML Directives</a> and the <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-regulations/usa-patriot-act">USA PATRIOT Act</a>, which set international benchmarks for companies that engage with the US and Europe. Financial institutions use rule-based or AI-enabled tools to identify and report suspicious transactions, and analysts are responsible for maintaining compliance and ensuring secure financial environments.</p>



<p>These solutions play a critical role in detecting money laundering and other illicit activities, thereby ensuring the integrity of the financial system. Compliance with AML regulations is not only necessary for regulatory purposes but also vital to avoid severe legal and financial consequences. In fact, recent statistics indicate that global fines for AML violations have exceeded $5 billion in 2022 alone. By adhering to regulatory compliance measures, financial institutions can foster trust and contribute to the transparency of the financial system. Furthermore, compliance standards have led to significant advancements in AML solutions, with regulations such as the Bank Secrecy Act, USA PATRIOT Act, EU’s AML Directives, and FATF recommendations acting as catalysts for innovation in Anti-money laundering transaction monitoring technology.</p>



<p>The range of financial institutions that must comply with regulations has expanded to include fintech and cryptocurrency organizations, given the higher risk of money laundering associated with digital currencies and technologies. To address these new financial services, emerging regulations such as the “Travel Rule” from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the 5th and 6th Money Laundering Directives from the European Union have been introduced. The industry is also shifting towards the use of AI/ML technologies to detect suspicious activities more quickly and make more accurate decisions. Currently, 66% of financial services are investing more in AI to accomplish this.</p>

  <p>Tangle Labs are happy to share the release of Vira Wallet v0.3.0 one of the most advanced self-sovereign identity wallets on the market and just one step away from a full 1.0 release.</p><p>After rigorous testing over the past couple of months, and the impressive demonstration of interoperability with other projects, we have experienced significant positive feedback and ensured that the wallet has matured to a level where it is now being used for ticketing and open badge experiences in the real world. Learnings from such events and experiences have given the team valuable feedback that has Vira to develop into such an advanced application.</p><p>Vira is currently being used across a number of projects including the UNESCO Lifelong Learning project NGDIL, various real world event ticketing and open badge experiences, and has recently been declared a DIIP compliant wallet by the <a href="https://www.dutchblockchaincoalition.org/dbc-zone/diip-wallets">Dutch Blockchain Coalition</a>, alongside the UniMe wallet from Impierce Technologies. </p><p></p> Feature Updates <p>Whilst a lot has been done behind the scenes to streamline the app in the backend and to ensure its security, stability, and feature performance, the four big feature updates include:</p><p></p><p>Improved UX/UI</p><p>The Vira UI has developed into a seamlessly intuitive and easy-to-use user experience. The balance between user experience and security in the world of crypto and decentralised identity is a very difficult area, often sacrificing one for the other. Having worked alongside partners to build out seamless experiences, we have streamlined the Vira experience to be a smooth one, without sacrificing the importance of security and privacy for users. This important area of the development process can place Vira in the top ranks of user experiences in the identity wallet space.</p><p></p><p>Open Badge Support</p><p>Credentials can now be issued as standardised open badges, supporting the Open Badge Standard v3.0. Separating credentials by standardised types provides a versatile approach to how credentials are received, shared, and stored. The Open Badge standard, by Ed1Tech, is a world leading standard used all over the world. Having implemented the standard in its entirety in the latest release, Vira can now become an open badge compatible wallet that may be used by millions of badge holders in open badge ecosystems around the world.</p><p></p><p>Self-Signed Credentials</p><p>User signed credentials to allow self-declaration of information such as name and email. Having verified credentials issued by a third-party is one thing, but being able to verify that you have self-declared information personally, is another. By implementing self-signing within Vira wallet, this opens up a world of opportunity allowing users to assign self-signed data to profiles, such as name, telephone number, email address, and other data for profiling at the granular level whether its a business card, a user login, or another profile, Vira users can now declare the information they want to within their individual profiles.</p><p></p><p>Internationalisation and RTL Support</p><p>Fully integrated support for translation into any language allowing Vira to go global. Cross-border use is one of the huge value propositions of decentralised identity. With Vira now fully integrated with global internationalisation standards, it can support any language translation as we begin to be used in multiple countries around the world. So whether its an open-badge event in the Netherlands, a travel ticket in Germany, or a business document in UAE, Vira is poised to become a truly global app.</p><p></p><p>Login with DID</p><p>Login with DID support via open-source OpenID standards. Vira is 100% ready to allow its users to login with DID allowing any project to integrate login with DID into their apps and websites using the open-source libraries from Tangle Labs, giving users the opportunity to privately connect to services without the need for third-party identity providers such as Google, Facebook, or X, etc. </p> What’s next? <p>These updates alone have put us one step away from a final public v1.0 with a feature complete release scheduled for later in the year. With Vira already live in the real world supporting and showcasing decentralised identity in its many forms, the next release of v0.4.0 will add the final pieces of the puzzle to ensure the complete package is ready for adoption.</p><p>The next features to be updated and integrated into the 0.4.0 release for final testing include:</p>  <p>Full Multichain Support - to allow users to operate in different ecosystems by selecting which networks they wish to engage with.</p>  <p>Document Signing - allowing users to legally sign documents with digital signatures from within their Vira wallet</p>  <p>Translations - full translations to allow Vira to be used in various languages such as ES, NL, AR, DE, etc.</p>  <p>Verified Account Support - allowing users to verify their identity for reusable credentials</p>  <p></p><p></p>

 <br>
Background 
<p>At Northern Block, our journey toward enhancing Canadian critical mineral supply chain transparency and traceability collaboration began with an <a href="https://digital.gov.bc.ca/learning/case-studies/energy-mines-digital-trust-pilot/">innovative pilot</a> in 2022, in partnership with the Government of British Columbia, Copper Mountain Mining Corporation, and PricewaterhouseCoopers. </p>
<p>During this initial pilot, we successfully demonstrated that greenhouse gas emissions reporting could be converted into digital credentials, making this sustainability data verifiable and highly available for various systems within the supply chain. This demonstration effectively showcased how, by utilizing common standards and protocols, sustainability data can be seamlessly transferred between different organizations’ systems while maintaining its integrity (note: we cover more of ‘how this works’ in the section below ‘Why do digital credentials help create supply chain transparency in the mining industry?’)</p>
<p>In early 2023, we expanded our efforts by adding support for two new digital credentials:</p>
 
 Mines Act Permit: Easily prove your permit status (for major mine operators in B.C.) 
 Towards Sustainable Mining (TSM): Submit TSM scores and share verified environmental, social, and governance (ESG) data securely 
 
 <p>Both credentials are rooted in authoritative governance frameworks, and utilise OCA bundles for proper credential branding</p> 
<p>To support mining operators in receiving their Mines Act Permit in the form of a digital credential, we continued our ongoing partnership with the Government of B.C..</p>
<p>To transform TSM reporting data into digital credentials, we formed a key partnership with the <a href="https://mining.ca/">Mining Association of Canada (MAC)</a>, whose 100+ members account for most of Canada’s production of critical minerals. Canada already produces more than 60 minerals and metals and is a leading global producer of many critical minerals, including nickel, copper, potash, aluminum, and uranium. MAC is also behind <a href="https://mining.ca/towards-sustainable-mining/">the TSM initiative</a>, a globally recognized ESG standard implemented not only in Canada, but in countries such as Australia, Brazil, Spain, Argentina, and Colombia. TSM, first established in 2004, allows mining companies to turn high-level environmental and social commitments into action on the ground. Additionally, TSM was the first mining standard in the world to require site-level reporting with external verification. We anticipated that facilitating the creation of digital credentials for mines, based on a recognized and important reporting standard, should generate significant demand and value in downstream supply chains.</p>
<p>We worked closely with MAC to develop a set of rules and standards for this new type of digital certificate to mobilize the data generated through the&nbsp; TSM standard. This digital certificate, or ‘credential,’ is designed for organisations involved in extracting important resources. Our goal was to make this TSM digital credential as accurate and trustworthy as possible, similar to what we had previously achieved with the greenhouse gas credential in 2022. We aimed to base the TSM credential on direct, original data (source data) and combine technical methods with strong surrounding governance. This approach ensured that TSM data transmitted through this credential could maintain its reliability and integrity, increasing its value. It can then be used effectively by other companies and organisations further along in the supply chain.</p>
<p>TSM’s comprehensive approach, utilizing various environmental, social and climate change indicators, has been a great mechanism for promoting responsible production practices. Our work in this domain reflects our commitment to making TSM data not only more accessible but also a trusted element in global supply chains, reinforcing responsible mining practices worldwide.</p>
<p>In late 2023, we achieved a significant milestone by enabling mines&nbsp;to self-issue their TSM reports for the years 2021, 2022, and 2023 in the form of digital credentials, which were then digitally presented to MAC using this innovative method. This accomplishment marked a huge milestone for our objective of creating trusted data inputs for supply chains. In this process, we also involved PricewaterhouseCoopers and Envirochem, two recognised TSM verification firms. The two verification firms created externally verified TSM reports as digital credentials for the two mines in question. Essentially, this means that when a mining company receives one of these digital reports from their verifier, it comes with the verifier’s digital signature. This signature proves that the report is genuine and hasn’t been altered. When the mining company shares this report with other supply chain participants, everyone can trust the data accuracy and provenance.</p>
<p>Here is an overview of the ecosystem which Northern Block is supporting with both the Mines Act Permit and TSM credentials:</p>
 <p>Note that in this image, the Government of British Columbia has developed its own digital credential system for government ministries, independent of Northern Block’s system. However, both systems are capable of communicating with each other due to their use of interoperable technology. It’s important to recognize that a digital trust ecosystem can involve many different actors, each potentially using services from various providers. A key advantage of this decentralized approach is the flexibility it offers participants, allowing them to choose their preferred platforms without being confined to a single, centralized system.</p> 
<p>This advancement was a substantial step in making the existing international TSM standard more accessible for supply chain participants. Our next focus is on broadening its use and creating a demand generation strategy. Given the increasing demand for high-integrity data in supply chains, we believe that our efforts have established crucial foundational groundwork.</p>
 Why do digital credentials help create supply chain transparency in the mining industry? 
<p>Digital credentials are based on internationally accepted technical and governance standards that are meant to facilitate digital trust. A digital trust architecture enables any two entities to share data between themselves in a trusted manner, independent of the system or application they’re using. This can be compared to email clients, where emails are reliably sent and received regardless of the different clients being used (e.g., like Microsoft Outlook and Google’s Gmail). This reliability is due to the use of common underlying protocols (a common language). Digital trust solutions leverage a common set of protocols, enabling them to exchange trusted data between themselves, with Security, Privacy, Authenticity and Confidentiality in mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This allowed us to conduct trusted data exchanges between different systems. For example, we facilitated a live exchange&nbsp; between the Government of British Columbia and CMM, where CMM was able to use Northern Block’s ‘Orbit Enterprise Wallet’ to receive a digital credential representation of their Mines Permit. This was issued by the Government of British Columbia, from their credential issuance system, and CMM was able to receive the offer, and upon accepting it, stored the credential within their digital wallet, hosted by Northern Block. This demonstrates that by speaking a common set of standards and protocols, technical interoperability is attainable, avoiding enforcing any supply chain participants to use a specific solution, similar to how email works!</p>
<p>A key aspect of digital trust stems from digital signatures using cryptography. Whenever a piece of data (a digital credential) is sent from an authoritative party to another, that data is signed, becoming tamper-proof and backed by verifiable governance processes. For instance, when a supply chain participant consumes verifiable TSM data as a digital credential proof, they can be confident about the data’s provenance, knowing it came from a mine or the mine’s auditor, and that it followed the correct governance established by MAC. This creates a root of trust for ecosystems that wish to consume that data.</p>
<p>Once these digital credentials are available, they can be shared with any participant in an ecosystem at the discretion of the credential holder. For example, a mining company can easily share this data with investors, buyers, or ESG marketplaces with just a click of a button. They can also selectively share different credentials, controlling what data they share and with whom. Being able to mix and match various types of verifiable data can unlock new efficiencies and value creation opportunities. For example, CMM may share with an investor a proof that they’re a recognised mine in British Columbia, along with selective ESG data from their TSM credential. In this case, they were able to share data that came from two separate, but verifiable sources. The investor will know that all data proofs shared are authentic. This example starts to make us think about some of the efficiencies and new opportunities when being able to mix and match data from various sources.</p>
<p>By converting this data into digital credentials and storing them in wallets owned by the data owners, it becomes easier to share within supply chains, thereby making it more available. This is particularly important in the context of ESG reporting, where fraud is a concern. Digital trust is crucial because it allows for the creation of supply chain data inputs that are authentic and verifiable.</p>
<p>Ultimately, digital trust technologies will elevate the level of trust within critical mineral supply chains. Creating supply chain transparency is only as effective as the data that flows into it. Our goal is to ensure that the data entering supply chains is of high integrity and value, and our work to-date aligns well with the Canadian Critical Minerals Strategy.</p>
 Northern Block’s Mining Credentialing Solutions 
<p>Northern Block has been dedicated to developing enterprise digital credentialing technology suitable for a variety of applications. In early 2020, we launched the first commercial graded digital credential management platform in Canada, called NB Orbit Enterprise ; a no-code digital trust web-based platform that facilitates the storage, issuance and verification of digital credentials that are held and owned by organisations in digital wallets. The platform contains a collection of components based on identity management, distributed and edge computing, distributed ledger technologies and cryptography. Importantly, it is compatible with global digital trust standards and protocols.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some of the components available within Orbit Enterprise that we leveraged for this particular critical minerals digital trust project:</p>
 
 Organisational Wallet: a component that allows organisations to receive digital credential offers from their peers, such as governments and auditors, and securely store them in the organisational wallet (e.g., Mines Permit credential, TSM credential).&nbsp; 
 Secure Connection Manager: This tool helps organisations set up secure, two-way communication channels with each other. Once these channels are established, they can exchange information safely and privately, ensuring that all communications are genuine and confidential. 
 Digital Credential Creation and Sharing Module: This is a service that allows organisations to create and issue digital credentials, like digital IDs or certificates, either to themselves or to other organisations. It also includes features for requesting credentials, negotiating terms, and sending secure messages. This is particularly useful in business-to-business (B2B) situations, where two organisations need to collaborate on issuing these digital credentials. 
 Digital Credential Verification and Exchange Toolkit: This toolkit is used by organisations to either ask for proof of digital credentials from others or to provide proof of their own credentials. It supports collaboration and communication, similar to the credential issuance service, making it easier for organisations to verify each other’s credentials. 
 Credential Governance Toolkit: This toolkit is designed for creating and managing the rules and designs for digital credentials. It’s used by authoritative bodies to set standards and publish these credentials to trusted data registries. organisations can use this toolkit to follow these standards when issuing credentials. It also helps ensure that the branding and legitimacy of these credentials are consistent, especially in supply chains, so that everyone recognizes and trusts them.

 ‘We can afford what we can actually do’ — 1 <p>Across the country people from all walks of life — from those running families to those running organisations and Governments — are wrestling with financial shortfalls that restrict what they can do. This three part series asks ‘Is there a positive way forward?’</p><p>Sometimes, in order to deal with a difficult problem, we have to embrace a paradox. Paradoxes happen when one thing — call it Proposition A — is clearly, incontrovertibly, undeniably true, but when something else opposite — call it Proposition B — is also clearly, incontrovertibly, undeniably true. In situations like this, to move forward, we have to find a way of holding both ideas in our minds at the same&nbsp;time.</p><p>Right now this paradox is hitting us all. Increasingly. With a vengeance. This is the paradox of ‘affordability’.</p><p>The first part of this paradox — the Proposition A bit — is the common understanding that “we can only do what we can afford”. If we’ve only got so much money to spend, there is only so much we can spend it on. Full stop. The simple reality of our situation. And, if because of circumstances beyond our control, we find ourselves with less money, then there are even less things that we can spend it on&nbsp;… less things that we can&nbsp;do.</p><p>This is not a happy situation. It’s a tough, harsh reality affecting millions of people today in every walk of life. It’s the day to day misery of millions of families wrestling with poverty. It’s looming centre stage across the nation’s local authorities, with 20% of them verging on bankruptcy. It’s causing a crisis in health and&nbsp;care.</p><p>It’s also dominating Government policies. ‘Only doing what we can afford’ — ‘austerity’ — has been the one theme that has dominated UK Government policies for decades now, particularly since the great financial crash of 2008. Over many years the Scottish Government has promised to do many things such as abolish child poverty. But in the last few months it has presided over a budget which will result in the exact opposite. It, too, is knuckling down to the harsh realities of ‘we can only do what we can&nbsp;afford’.</p><p>If the Labour Party gets elected at the forthcoming UK General Election things may not change all that much either. Labour leader Keir Starmer is making a big point that whatever promises he makes “in the end the fiscal rule comes first”. We can only do what we can&nbsp;afford.</p><p>Yet&nbsp;…</p> We’ve been here&nbsp;before! <p>As a society we’ve been here before, only worse. In the dark days of the Second World War for example, Britain had run out of money. It had spent every penny fighting the Nazis. Then, in the early days of 1942, there was a chink of light. Perhaps, after all, we might actually win the war! As this thought took hold, peoples’ attention began to turn to the question: what comes next? How to win the peace? How to&nbsp;rebuild?</p><p>This triggered an almighty spat between the forces of financial orthodoxy — the people whose worldview was dominated by the mantra ‘we can only do what we afford’ — and those whose focus was on underlying economic realities.</p><p>John Maynard Keynes believed that keeping to the mantra ‘we can only do what we can afford’ would be disastrous. “At one level — the formal level of bank balances — it’s true we can only do what we can afford,” he said. “But at another level — of underlying economic reality — it’s nonsense. In fact, the exact opposite is true. In reality, we can afford what we can actually do”. This was his Proposition B.</p><p>Keynes didn’t actually use the words in the above paragraph. But below are the words he used in a BBC broadcast on 2 April 1942, when he took the spat between the two worldviews public. Keynes called for an ambitious programme to “build homes, libraries, theatres, concert halls and dance halls” so that “every substantial city [has] the dignity of an ancient university or a European capital”.</p><p>But the financial establishment would have none of it. We don’t have the money, they argued. We can only do what we can&nbsp;afford.</p><p>This is how Keynes replied to the financiers (whom he addressed as ‘Sir John’) in his BBC&nbsp;talk.</p><blockquote>“The money?”, I said. “But surely, Sir John, you don’t build houses with money? Do you mean that there won’t be enough bricks and mortar and steel and&nbsp;cement?”</blockquote><blockquote>“Oh no,” he replied, “of course there will be plenty of all&nbsp;that”.</blockquote><blockquote>“Do you mean,” I went on, “that there won’t be enough labour? For what will the builders be doing if they are not building&nbsp;houses?”</blockquote><blockquote>“Oh no,” he replied, “of course there will be plenty of all&nbsp;that”.</blockquote><blockquote>“Well,” I said “if there are bricks and mortar and steel and concrete and labour and architects, why not assemble all this good material in&nbsp;houses?”</blockquote><p>Keynes finished his talk by saying “anything we can actually do we can afford”: wherever there are people with skills and energy capable of doing work, and wherever there are sources of energy and materials that could be deployed, then it’s possible to bring them together to meet human needs. When push comes to shove it is what we can actually do that defines ‘affordability’.</p> Riding two&nbsp;horses <p>The point about paradoxes is that to embrace the truths they both contain, we need to keep them both in mind at the same time. For many people running families, organisations, institutions and Governments today Proposition A — that we can only do what we can afford — dominates their days. Day in and day out, they struggle endlessly with the realities of financial constraints; of having to make hard, miserable choices that stop them doing things they really want to&nbsp;do.</p><p>They feel they don’t have a choice and in one sense they are right. The institutional reality of their situation is that the less money they have, they less they can do. If they start spending money they don’t have — beyond what they can ‘afford’ — they risk going bankrupt.</p><p>Yet only acting on Proposition A ignores the truth of Proposition B — that, as a society we can afford what we can actually do. And the more we focus only on Proposition A the more we actually reduce what we can actually do. And over time, that makes our situation worse, not better. Focusing only on Proposition A is a trap, placing us on a spiral of&nbsp;decline.</p><p>Somehow, then, we have to find a way of acting on Proposition B even as we wrestle with the constraints that Proposition A forces upon&nbsp;us.</p><p>What does this mean? It means that none of us has only one job. None of us can focus only on doing what we can ‘afford’ to do. Even as we wrestle with the constraints of Proposition A, somehow, somewhere, we need to find ways of also opening up and expanding what we can actually do. We all have two jobs to do. Two horses to ride, even if very often they pull us in different directions.</p><p>Our next blog looks at some of the ways we can do&nbsp;this.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-can-afford-what-we-can-actually-do-1-efdca9835617">‘We can afford what we can actually do’ — 1</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
