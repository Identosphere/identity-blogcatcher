 Overview <p>This challenge invites data scientists to analyze 40 years of French tax information, utilizing data collected in a project with the <a href="https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/index_en">EU Commission’s Science Hub, the Joint Research Centre</a> (JRC). Held in collaboration with the JRC, known for its commitment to providing rigorous, evidence-based scientific and technical support to EU policymakers, this challenge presents a unique opportunity to examine extensive tax data to enhance data-driven decision-making. Participants will explore trends in municipal finances, develop predictive models, uncover correlations between population size and tax revenue, and assess the impact of tax policy changes on municipal revenues, aiming to offer valuable insights into the fiscal dynamics of French municipalities.</p> Objectives <p>Participants will conduct an in-depth exploration of the dataset, beginning with ranking municipalities by their tax revenue to identify those with the highest income from direct local taxes. It includes creating graphical representations to illustrate revenue trends in selected towns, enabling the drawing of meaningful conclusions from these visualizations. Additionally, the challenge extends to classifying municipalities based on their growth in tax revenues over various periods, investigating the relationship between population size and tax revenue, and assessing the impact of eliminating the professional tax collected before 2010. This comprehensive approach seeks to provide actionable insights into the fiscal management of French municipalities.</p> Data <p>We have meticulously prepared the dataset for this challenge, ensuring its efficiency for analysis. We aggregated French REI (<a href="https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/repertoire-national-des-elus/">Répertoire des Élus et des Institutions</a>) data files to create a comprehensive data pipeline. REI, a directory of elected officials and institutions in France, provides detailed information on French municipalities’ financial and administrative aspects. Originally a 3.6GB CSV file, we have transformed this dataset into a 0.6GB <a href="https://parquet.apache.org/">Parquet</a> file. Parquet’s columnar storage format allows faster data access, reduces file size, and improves query performance, making it particularly suitable for handling complex queries and large datasets. This meticulous preparation instills confidence in the quality of the data and provides participants with a powerful tool for their analysis.</p><p>We highly recommend using <a href="https://duckdb.org/">DuckDB</a> to interact with the dataset and facilitate querying. DuckDB is a high-performance, in-memory database engine optimized for SQL querying on local machines. We have set things up for participants to use DuckDB at no cost and with minimal friction. This is not just a tool but an exciting opportunity to learn a new, efficient way of querying data for an ML model. This combination of Parquet and DuckDB ensures that participants can quickly and effectively analyze the data, gaining deeper insights into the fiscal dynamics of French municipalities.</p> Mission <p>The mission of the French Fiscal AI Innovation and Prediction Challenge is to leverage data science and machine learning to gain valuable insights into the fiscal dynamics of municipalities in general. This challenge aims to foster data-driven decision-making and enhance the understanding of municipal financial management.</p><p>Participants will engage in various tasks to contribute to evidence-based policymaking by offering actionable insights that can improve fiscal governance and public administration. This collaborative effort underscores the importance of rigorous, data-driven analysis in shaping effective policies. It seeks to empower data scientists to use their skills to make a tangible impact on society, promoting transparency, efficiency, and innovation in public financial management.</p> Rewards <p>We’re dedicated to acknowledging excellence and nurturing talent, so we’ve designed a reward system that celebrates top performers while motivating participants of all skill levels. With a prize pool of $15,000–50% larger than our regular challenges — distributed among the top 10 performers, our structure brings excitement and competitiveness to the 2024 championship. Not only do the top 10 contenders receive cash rewards, but they also accumulate championship points, ensuring an even playing field for both seasoned data scientists and newcomers alike.</p>Prize pool and 2024 Championship points distribution Opportunities <p>By engaging in this challenge, participants will showcase their #AI and #ML skills and play a crucial role in contributing to the broader goal of making European policies grounded in science. This collaborative effort between data enthusiasts and the JRC aims to generate actionable insights that will significantly aid in French municipalities’ effective governance and fiscal management. Your work, therefore, holds immense value and influence in shaping evidence-based policymaking.</p><p>But wait, there’s more!

<p>London, June 18, 2024 – Ahead of the busy summer betting period, IDnow, a leading identity verification provider in Europe, has seen a significant spike in the number of gambling customers requesting identity verification.</p>



<p>Between 14 and 16 June, IDnow saw a 750% increase in the number of players being verified with a European gambling operator [1]. The busiest sign-up day was 14 June, the day of the opening match of UEFA EURO 2024, which saw a much higher volume of verification requests than was seen during the 2022 World Cup. </p>



<p>This latest spike coincides with the lead up to the opening game of UEFA EURO 2024 on 14 June. During each country’s first game, IDnow is expecting these figures to stay at a high level. With that, an increased likelihood of bonus abuse, multi-accounting, underage gambling, money laundering and fake documentation.</p>



 Effective, compliant verification processes to onboard vast numbers of players 



<p>“The challenges operators face during major sporting tournaments are not necessarily any different to their regular daily compliance hurdles, but the sheer volume of new players from all around the world, coupled with increased activity is likely to cause issues for unprepared operators,” said Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, Vice President of Global Gaming at IDnow.<br><br>“EURO 2024 will be a huge opportunity for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">gambling platforms</a>, new and old, so it’s essential they capitalize on the event, while safeguarding their players and their reputation. It’s important they have effective, compliant verification processes in place to onboard vast numbers of players as smoothly and safely as possible. Only when operators are confident they can verify accounts thoroughly, and onboard the right players during such busy period, will they be effective in fighting fraud.”</p>



<p>As global sporting events have such broad appeal, they often attract both casual and regular bettors. Combined with the convenience and accessibility that online platforms now offer, betting during these periods is getting increasingly popular. Indeed, betting during the 2022 World Cup increased by <a href="https://www.openbet.com/news/openbet-processes-more-than-200m-bets-during-the-world-cup">13 percent compared with the 2018 FIFA World Cup</a>.</p>



<p>Worryingly, the surge in gambling activity was seen on both regulated and unregulated sites. For example, in the UK alone, <a href="https://bettingandgamingcouncil.com/news/black-market-world-cup">250,000 people visited unregulated, black-market sites during the last World Cup</a> compared with just 80,0000 during the same time frame of the previous year.</p>



<p>Other key security concerns that are exacerbated by major sporting events, such as EURO 2024:</p>



  Increase in site traffic is often used by fraudsters as a smoke screen for nefarious activities. They may conduct identity theft, or attempt account takeovers by launching phishing attacks and cyberattacks on unsuspecting users.  Unsecured public Wi-Fi networks can pose a security risk when players log in to place bets. These networks are susceptible to interception by hackers, leading to unauthorized access to user accounts, exposure of sensitive personal information and potential financial losses for both users and operators.  Rising rates of gambling fraud, with chargeback fraud a particularly common issue. While identity verification solutions can help verify the identity of users and detect fraudulent activity, preventing chargeback fraud requires additional measures, such as transaction monitoring and collaboration with payment processors to identify and block suspicious transactions in real time.  



<p>Although all global gambling platforms are likely to see an uptick in player onboarding, it will likely be European nations that share the same time zone as the tournament that will see the biggest increase in usage.</p>



<p>“Gaming operators in these particular regions must offer secure player onboarding, deposits and withdrawals, and conduct seamless Anti-Money-Laundering and age verification checks to help fight the expected proliferation of fraudulent activity in both the build up to EURO 2024 and throughout the tournament,” concluded Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk. </p>

<p>As enterprises shift from on-premises to cloud systems, hybrid cloud solutions have become essential for optimizing performance, scalability, and user ease. However, risks arise when poorly configured environments connect to the cloud. A compromised Microsoft Active Directory can fully compromise a synchronized Microsoft Entra ID tenant, undermining the integrity and trust of connected services.</p>  
<p>Researchers at Horizon3.ai <a href="https://www.horizon3.ai/attack-research/n0-attack-paths/on-prem-misconfigurations-lead-to-entra-tenant-compromise/">recently published a fascinating analysis</a> on how on-premise misconfigurations in hybrid Microsoft environments can be exploited by attackers using well-documented techniques. In this case, the attack chain can lead to full compromise of the Entra Tenant. In complex enterprise environments, such misconfigurations are all too common. It’s critical for security teams to understand the tactics attackers use and strategies to close these points of vulnerability. Here we take a closer look at the attack chain and offer some additional mitigation strategies.</p>

     <p>NBT-NS traffic from Host 1 is poisoned to relay a netNTLM credential to Host 2 — an SMB server that doesn’t require signing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Fortunately, this hacking exercise was carried out by white hat pentesters. The researchers at Horizon3.ai noted that, with absolutely no prior knowledge of the company’s environment, it took the NodeZero tool only an hour to compromise the on-premises AD domain, and the associated Entra ID tenant was compromised in less than two hours.</p> 
 Prevention Strategies  
<p>The team at Horizon3.ai included a set of solid initial mitigation recommendations. These include:</p> 
  
  Prevent NTLM Relay: Disabling NBT-NS and enforcing SMB Signing would have prevented the initial access technique used, although other vectors can be used for initial domain access.&nbsp;  
  Use LAPS: Reuse of credentials for Local Administrators enabled key lateral movements that lead to the discovery of Domain Administrator credentials.&nbsp;  
  Treat Entra Connect as a Tier-0 Resource: Install Entra Connect on a non-DC server (with LAPS enabled) and adequately protected with an EDR solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  Do not Use On-Premises Accounts for Entra Administrator Roles: Microsoft recommends limiting the number of Entra Administrators and their level of privilege.&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  
 Further Critical Recommendations  
<p>In addition to those, we recommend specific strategies to close common security gaps in Microsoft Entra ID environments.</p> 
  
  Use HYPR as a complement to LAPS to ensure administrators access their devices and systems using a phishing-resistant authentication method.  
  Review and revise your PAM (Privileged Access Management) program. The Static Domain Admin password should be rotated after it is used / checked out. You should also reduce the viability of the Domain Admin Credential in Cache.  
  Use secure <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/single-sign-on-sso">passwordless SSO</a> methods such as HYPRspeed that don’t rely on shared secrets and instead leverage public key cryptography.  
  Enforce the use of phishing-resistant <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-authenticate-passwordless-mfa">passwordless MFA</a> methods, such as HYPR, for privileged Entra users access.  
  Begin migration to Entra ID from legacy on-prem technology. While not a small project, it will reduce the threat model of older protocols that rely on hash/passwords.

  Name: Libby Brown<br>Team: Product Management<br>Based in: Seattle area   About Libby <p>I’ve been working in technology and product management for longer than I care to admit, the past 6 years of which were in Identity at Microsoft as product manager of the Microsoft Authenticator app, then all of our passwordless credentials for Microsoft Entra (formerly known as Azure Active Directory.) I really enjoyed working at that intersection of building new technologies in the identity and security ecosystems, and driving the adoption of those technologies by creating user experiences that were compelling both on an individual and organizational level.&nbsp;</p><p>Coming to SpruceID was just a “shift left” in my career, moving upstream in the identity lifecycle, moving to concepts that are earlier in their definition and implementation stages, while at a company still in its launch phase.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Can you tell us about your role at SpruceID? <p>As Product Manager, I see my role as setting the longer-term direction of the products we are building while staying grounded in the day-to-day details of what and how we deliver&nbsp; on customer promises today. I want to define who SpruceID’s customers are, what they need, and how we’ll meet them, then get everyone on board to deliver.&nbsp;</p> What do you find most rewarding about your job?&nbsp; <p>Startup life is amazing! I love the hustle, the energy, the pressure to deliver because everyone on the team has to play their part to make the whole company successful - it’s invigorating!&nbsp;</p> What are some of the most important qualities for someone in your role to have, in your opinion? <p>Product (and program) managers need to be able to explore and understand a subject's big picture and then dive down to the nitty gritty details to be successful. Problem-solving and collaboration are also key skills—my current mantra is, “Yes, and….” as in, “Let’s say yes to the idea or challenge, and what else do we need to do to make it happen?” It’s in those discussions of how to do something that good ideas rise up, and the consensus is gained; that doesn’t happen if the first response is a No.&nbsp;</p> What are you currently learning, or what do you hope to learn? <p>First, I’m still learning non-Microsoft tools - I doubt I will ever come to love Google Calendar – but after 2 decades of muscle memory, I’m beginning to leave Outlook behind.&nbsp;</p><p>I was reading the AAMVA Implementation Guide yesterday afternoon; digging into the W3C VCDM email digests earlier; and last week was refreshing my knowledge of NIST IAL levels. Learning is just a constant in this space, which is one of the reasons I love working on the bleeding edge of identity and security. If I ever find myself NOT learning, that’s when I know it’d be time to move on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> What has been the most memorable moment for you at SpruceID so far? <p>I was in Rio de Janeiro for our all-company meeting, my second week on the job. It was definitely one of my best onboarding experiences ever! It was a great way to meet everyone at once and learn folks’ roles and responsibilities. Also, being a part of big, foundational conversations we were having as a team helped me jump right into product management tasks when I returned home.&nbsp;</p> What's the best piece of advice you’ve received since starting your job here? <p>“Meet Everyone.” Each person at SpruceID has unique skill sets, so it’s been great to learn what those are and jointly figure out how to combine those capabilities to deliver great results.&nbsp;</p> How do you define success in your role, and how do you measure it? <p>I have done my job successfully when:&nbsp;</p>  customers know what SpruceID can deliver through our digital identity capabilities with the Credible platform;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Customers can realize the business value to their organization from digital credentials and&nbsp;  SpruceID has a long and lustrous roadmap to continue delivering features of value to our customers, existing and new.&nbsp;   What is your favorite part about working at SpruceID? <p>I love #startuplife! After a long time working in and around Microsoft, the direct control I have for driving product definition is wonderfully both terrifying and invigorating.&nbsp;</p> Fun Facts <p>What do you enjoy doing in your free time? I enjoy spending time with my kids. They’re at a fun age where they still want me to be a part of their activities. </p><p>What is your favorite coding language (and why?): HAHAHAHAHA—I am not a programmer, though I’ve spent my life around computers and technology. My first language was Basic, written on a Timex Sinclair computer and saved on an audio cassette. I built my first website via Notepad and FTP. I really didn’t advance in computer science much beyond that until I took an Intro to Programming class taught in Java this spring. </p><p>If you could be any tree, what tree would you be and why?: A weeping willow - they love being near water and make perfect playgrounds and climbing gyms for children under their long boughs.&nbsp;</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p>Hopefully there’s no need for a post-quantum preamble to this blog. Any techies who have not been living in a cave in some outpost of the globe should already be aware of the threat that Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs) will have on the classical algorithms that permeate the tech and IT infrastructure that we rely on in the 21st century. Entrust has blogged in the past about <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2023/11/harvest-now-decrypt-later-fact-or-fiction/">Harvest Now, Decrypt Later</a>, with the main takeaway being … you can’t afford to wait until CRQCs are viable.</p>
<p>We also recently blogged on the updates to the <a href="https://www.entrust.com/blog/2024/05/nsa-announces-update-to-commercial-national-security-algorithm-suite-2-0-and-quantum-computing-faq/">Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite (CNSA) 2.0.</a> With an industry eager to start using the new algorithms, the six-year (and counting) NIST PQC competition is nearing a milestone with FIPS 203 and 204 set for publication in the summer of 2024, with FIPS 205 anticipated later in the year.</p>
<p>The concern for some in the industry is that these post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms are shiny and new –&nbsp;mathematically, algorithmically, and in terms of software implementations. In particular, the lattice-based algorithms ML-KEM (FIPS 203) and ML-DSA (FIPS 204) still garner some skepticism about their long-term security.</p>
 Enter the hybrids 
<p>Hybrids are a combination of a quantum-safe algorithm, such as ML-KEM, with a battle-hardened traditional algorithm, such as RSA or ECDH, to form a “hybrid algorithm.” This means any serious threat actor needs to be armed with both a CRQC to break the classical crypto part, and a catastrophic algorithmic breakthrough or implementation bug to break the PQ part. As long as one component remains secure, the data remains secure.</p>
<p>One example of the adoption of the hybrid approach is <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-tls-hybrid-design">Hybrid key exchange in TLS 1.3</a>. It’s proposed to be the first standardized post-quantum cipher suite for Transport Layer Security (TLS) and builds on <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2016/07/experimenting-with-post-quantum.html">years of experimentation with hybrid cipher suites by Google</a> (2016), <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-tls-post-quantum-experiment">CloudFlare’s TLS Post-Quantum Experiment</a> (2019), and others. It will use the ML-KEM key exchange in combination with an ECDH key exchange.</p>
<p>Entrust has been actively involved in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) working group, with Entrust’s John Gray and Mike Ounsworth (co-author of this blog post) being lead authors of a proposed standard that brings the same hybrid encryption protection to network security protocols that use certificate-based encryption, such as S/MIME email encryption: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-kem/">Composite ML-KEM for Use in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure and CMS</a>. This proposed internet standard was adopted by the IETF in August 2023 and is well on its way to being published as an RFC.</p>
 What about hybrid digital certificates? 
<p>When it comes to certificates, the argument in favor of hybrids is less clear. Certificates are most used for authentication. For example, TLS uses certificates mainly for the server to prove that they are who they say they are prior to the user typing in sensitive information. To attack authentication, you need to perform the attack in real time; doing the attack years later does no good. Think of it this way … if a police officer pulls you over and asks for your ID card, you need to produce a real (or forged) card now; the police officer will become impatient if you delay for 10 years until your forging technology has improved!</p>
<p>There are, however, some cases where pre-emptive migration to PQ certificates – and therefore hybrids where the lattice scheme ML-DSA is used – do provide value. Think, for example, of devices with extremely long service lifetimes that are difficult to upgrade once deployed, such as:</p>
 
 Satellites in orbit 
 Sensors in cars, airplanes, and cell phone towers 
 Smart water and electricity meters in people’s homes 
 The chip in a 10-year ePassport 
 
<p>To push over-the-air firmware updates to these devices, the devices need an embedded cryptographic root to verify the integrity of the new firmware, which leads to the chicken-and-egg problem: What security issues are lurking if you allow field-updating the trusted cryptographic root? Typically, they are burned into ROM and can’t be changed to avoid the whole question.</p>
<p>Therefore, it follows that if you’re manufacturing devices that are expected to have a service lifetime beyond “Q-Day,” then you should probably be deploying them with PQ (or PQ/traditional hybrid) trusted cryptographic roots today.</p>
<p>With that introduction to the “sometimes urgent, sometimes not” needs for hybrid signatures, let’s dive into the world of standards surrounding them.</p>
<p>Entrust recognized as early as 2017 that while hybrid encryption is relatively straightforward, hybrid signatures would need a more elaborate design process. Entrust was involved in the development of one of the earliest post-quantum/traditional (PQ/T) hybrid certificate formats: <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-truskovsky-lamps-pq-hybrid-x509/">Multiple Public-Key Algorithm X.509 Certificates</a>, first published in March 2018,&nbsp;and the related mechanism standardized in <a href="https://www.itu.int/ITU-T/recommendations/rec.aspx?rec=X.509">ITU-T X.509 2019</a>, which has since fallen out of favor for technical reasons.</p>
 Major milestone 
<p>A new major milestone in the PQ migration journey was recently reached where the IETF adopted <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs/">Composite ML-DSA for use in Internet PKI</a>, of which John Gray and Mike Ounsworth are also lead authors, into the internet standards track.</p>
<p>This document, the first draft of which was published in March 2019, has seen an incredible amount of community feedback, hackathons, multi-vendor collaboration, academic study, and general debate of all kinds. It failed its first call-for-adoption in June 2023, mainly due to the scope of the document being too broad. With a few more rounds of industry feedback to distill it down to the core elements, it passed its second call-for-adoption on May 1, 2024.⁠</p>
 Reassuring IETF-backed standards 
<p>At Entrust, we know that X.509 certificates and public key infrastructure is more than HTTPS certificates. We know that next to TCP/IP, X.509 certificates are one of the oldest and most fundamental technologies of the internet, providing the trust layer that underpins a vast diversity of network security protocols.</p>
<p>Looking to the long tail of specialized uses of X.509 as we help our customers migrate to PQ over the coming decade, we’re pleased to have IETF-backed standards for both composite encryption and PQ composite signatures in our toolbox.

 Key Insights: 
 
 Germany’s approach to driving wallet adoption includes an innovation competition (“Funke”) and a consultation process with civil society. 
 Interoperability profiles, such as OpenID4VC and the Dutch Decentralized Identity Interoperability Profile (DDIP), aim to promote adoption and innovation by providing a common subset of technologies and specifications. 
 The role of big tech companies in providing mobile operating systems and browsers is a double-edged sword, enabling better user experiences but also raising concerns about control and data monetization. 
 Governments have a crucial role in setting regulations and fostering an equal playing field for all stakeholders in the digital identity ecosystem. 
 
 Strategies: 
 
 Governments can promote innovation and adoption by creating testbeds, innovation competitions, and consultation processes. 
 Interoperability profiles, updated in a cadence, can help organizations and vendors align on a common set of specifications and technologies, enabling interoperability. 
 Separating the roles of big tech companies as infrastructure providers (mobile operating systems, browsers) and product providers (wallets) can help address concerns about control and data monetization.

 We sit down with our Director of Global Regulatory and Government Affairs, Rayissa Armata and our&nbsp;Senior Architect, Sebastian Elfors to discuss collaboration, consortiums and the honor of being invited to join the European Blockchain Sandbox. 



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/consortium-crypto-assets-compliant-eu-regulations/">we revealed</a> that we had joined the <a href="https://www.iota.org/">IOTA Foundation</a> consortium, alongside&nbsp;<a href="https://walt.id/">walt.id</a>, <a href="http://havn.network/">HAVN Network</a> and <a href="https://bloomwallet.io/">Bloom Labs</a> with the aim of creating a Web3-ready KYC and identity verification solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This initiative will enable Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) and self-hosted wallets to become compliant with the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/transfer-of-funds-crypto/">Transfer in Funds Regulation (TFR)</a>, which is part of the greater EU Anti Money Laundering Package.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sounds relatively straight forward, right? Well, yes and no. New regulations mandate all crypto transactions to a) carry identifying data of the sender and the receiver and b) comply with similar AML rules as other financial institutions. The issue lies with CASPs also being required to comply with new rules regarding GDPR compliance, which stipulate that personal identifiable information (PII) should not be stored on blockchains or Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLT).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter the consortium; each partner bringing its own strengths and areas of expertise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here, Rayissa and Sebastian fill us in on how the project has been going since it was announced in February 2024.</p>



 As Web3 is still just an idea for a ‘new internet’, why did we decide to join the consortium to try and solve this ‘theoretical problem?’ Will this project be important for the future of payments, in particular in the crypto space? 



<p>Rayissa: Great question. Yes, there were several reasons why IDnow joined the consortium. For one, it is important to collaborate and to be able to adapt to new environments be it from a regulatory or technological perspective. Although concepts can be developed quickly, building the frameworks and ultimately achieving a usable product or service does not happen in a vacuum.</p>



<p>As you know, Europe established the crypto regulatory framework and licensing regime, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mica-eu-crypto-wild-west/">Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA)</a> and the companion rule known as TFR, which applies to transactions between cryptocurrency businesses and personal wallets. Due to be applied by the end of the year, TFR applies to transactions between cryptocurrency businesses and personal wallets. For example, with transactions, TFR requires CASPs to store certain PII so it can be cross matched to verify information on the originator of the transferred funds and the beneficiary of the transfer. The consortium took on the challenge of how this information can be transferred on and off chain. These solutions not only address privacy concerns, KYC and interoperability but will enhance trust in a relatively new technology ecosystem.</p>



<p>Sebastian: One key objective with this project is to design and implement a<a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/"> KYC solution</a> that can be used when issuing credentials that are stored as SoulBound Tokens (SBTs) on a blockchain. Technically speaking, the consortium is using Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible IOTA Smart Contract Chain. Having said that, the SBTs must also be compliant with GDPR regulations, so the SBTs contain anonymous identifiers instead of PII  in clear text. If there is a need for an authority to verify the user’s identity, this can be done by requesting the initial KYC user information from walt.id in conjunction with IDnow.</p>



 What has the consortium been working on since February? Do you have any updates? 



<p>Sebastian: The consortium has spent the past four months testing the solution and refining the implementation with scalability for production purposes in mind. Long term archiving and retrieval of identity documents is one such topic. We have also presented and demonstrated the solution to several stakeholders, with very positive feedback.</p>



 
   
     
                     Preparing for the known: Operating in a world of crypto regulation. 
                      Download to discover how crypto exchanges can prepare for the brave new world of crypto regulation.&nbsp;  
                    <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/whitepaper-crypto-regulation-uk/">Read now</a>
           
           
         
          
         
       
       
 


 Now onto the good news. The consortium’s Web3 Identification Solution (which will enable KYC and identity verification in the Web3 environment), has been selected to take part in the European Blockchain Sandbox. What is it and why is it important? 



<p>Rayissa: Let me share a little about the European Blockchain Sandbox initiative since we have already covered a little about the consortium’s aims and activities above. The European Commission provides various opportunities to introduce new solutions that meet European regulatory requirements, such as data sharing in the TFR. This European Blockchain Sandbox initiative is geared so that new use cases that involve DLT can be developed and tested. This Blockchain initiative began in 2023 and will continue until 2026.</p>



<p>Sebastian: We are proud and happy that our consortium has been selected to participate in the Sandbox. This is a way for IDnow to demonstrate blockchain-based solutions to EU legislators, and pinpoint how they can meet the relevant EU regulations for cryptocurrencies. In particular, the IOTA solution is targeted to comply with the upcoming TFR regulation and we are keen on proving how the product can meet those requirements.</p>



 Why is cross-collaboration so important for such a project? 



<p>Rayissa: The European Commission recognizes the need for collaboration and cooperation between public and private sectors. Part of the regulatory framework is to set requirements that address interoperability, innovation, security and user accessibility. Collaboration is key to enabling this set of requirements and we have many legal experts and technology-savvy developers guiding our project to build something new. IDnow has been at the forefront of good management, regulatory compliance and smart growth since we began and collaboration is a big part of our success.</p>



<p>Sebastian: In addition to the cross-collaboration with the EU Commission, we are also very proud of working with the IOTA-founded consortium. All parties contribute with cutting edge technologies: </p>



  IOTA provides the underlying network based on the IOTA Smart Contract Chain<br>  HAVN Network integrates hybrid blockchain technologies<br>  IDnow delivers the ID verification, prior to the tokenization into a SBT<br>  walt.id has developed the trusted witness service for creating and verifying SBTs<br>  Bloom provides the digital wallet for storing and presenting the SBTs  



 How will our existing and future crypto clients, who use our solutions to onboard customers and process transactions, be able to benefit from the research and development that is going into the Web3 Identification Solution? 



<p>Rayissa: From a compliance perspective, CASPs will be able to use this solution to comply with national and European KYC and TFR requirements to share personal data between the originator and beneficiary of a specific transaction. This will enable trust in the crypto ecosystem and beyond in Web3 and use cases. There may not be a regulatory framework with set requirements for Web3 or Web4 applications, but trust brings growth and what a great opportunity for these environments to become more mainstream.</p>



<p>Sebastian: The solution developed by the IOTA solution has the potential to go beyond the realm of cryptocurrency transactions, which is the current scope of the project. The SBTs that are issued could also be used for digital identities in the Web3 metaverse, for example for identifying avatars purchasing NFTs such as digital paintings.</p>



 Will the Web3 Identification Solution be commercially available in the future? If so, which companies and industries will the product appeal to? 



<p>Rayissa: Yes, certainly that is a goal. We are already in discussions with our consortium members and external CASPs and companies specialized in IOT services.</p>



<p>Sebastian: The term Web3 was initially coined in 2014 by the Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood when he created the vision of a “decentralized online ecosystem based on blockchain.” So yes, the Web3 Identification Solution can be used by all industries that have a need for digital identification. In addition to authentication for CASPs, totally different verticals such as the gaming industry could benefit from Web3 identification. Only the imagination sets the limits.</p>

  Decentralized identity is gaining traction globally through diverse implementations and aligns with SpruceID's mission to empower users with control over their data.

<p>Decentralized identity is rapidly gaining momentum as an industry concept, with a growing number of live implementations. Its early roots were in pioneering projects like <a href="https://whitepaper.uport.me/uPort_whitepaper_DRAFT20170221.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">uPort</a>, appearances at <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">IIW</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-decentralized-id-blockchain/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Microsoft’s subsequent bet</a>, and its emergence as a hot topic at industry conferences like Identiverse and EIC. We see it in practice globally in the <a href="https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/ca-dmv-wallet/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">California DMV Wallet</a>, the European Union Digital Identity initiative, and even digital pioneers like <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202406/bhutans-national-digital-id-showcased-as-ssi-model-for-others?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Bhutan</a>.&nbsp; </p><p>It’s easy to get confused because “decentralization” has become a buzzword for many new technologies. While its source of decentralization doesn’t need to come from blockchains or cryptocurrencies, decentralized identity is ultimately aligned with the objective of returning control to end users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>At SpruceID, we think about decentralized identity as systems built using the <a href="https://spruceid.com/learn/verifiable-credentials?ref=blog.spruceid.com">issuer-holder-verifier model</a>, which achieves decentralization when open protocols are used such that any party can assume the role(s) of the issuer, holder, or verifier. These roles come with a clean separation of concerns that mitigate undesirable side effects, such as issuer “phone home” during holder usage. These systems can support either functional (“attributes”) or foundational identity. So, it’s decentralized in that we’re not forcing all digital identity-related interactions through one central control point; instead, peer-to-peer interactions are the default.</p><p>Starting with this definition, it’s easier to evaluate technical standards based on their core ability to support these interoperable capabilities, rather than indexing on affiliation with certain brands or use cases. For example, all the digital credential technologies mentioned in the <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/european-digital-identity-wallet-architecture-and-reference-framework?ref=blog.spruceid.com">EU ARF</a>, including W3C Verifiable Credentials, SD-JWTs, and ISO/IEC 18013-5 mobile driver’s license (mDL), can fit this definition of supporting decentralized identity depending on the implementation details. These can all also violate the definition depending on implementation details.</p><p>It’s worth noting that identity and credentialing systems are already more decentralized than you might realize. Even in the United States, DMVs do not have a monopoly on all forms of identification: other documents, such as passports or permanent residency cards, are widely accepted. Even utility bills and bank statements often play a role in verifying identity.&nbsp;</p><p>If we start with a decentralized landscape, a decentralized approach to the technology seems to make the most sense. Open digital standards for sharing this already broad plethora of credentials largely amount to bringing existing credentials together under one umbrella and opening the playing field for other issuers, whom verifiers can choose to trust or not, on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Already, verifiable digital credentials issued across state and federal bodies fall under different administrations, many of which don’t see eye-to-eye, even within the same agency. This doesn’t even scratch the surface of the complexities within the private sector—and an open system is the best way to accommodate that complexity.&nbsp;</p><p>Here at SpruceID, we believe the use of decentralized identity, under this definition, furthers our mission to let users control their data across the web (and beyond). We will continue to evaluate technologies and technical standards to ensure alignment with these capabilities and our organization’s values.&nbsp;</p><p>To learn more about how we are working to build decentralized identity, visit our <a href="https://spruceid.com/learn?ref=blog.spruceid.com">knowledge base</a>.</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/learn?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Learn More</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

				  Your health data is important. You should be aware of how it is stored, shared, and who has access to it. This information is even more critical for athletes, as their health data is in demand and can cost them opportunities and potentially millions of dollars.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Indicio recently hosted an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqQsWQPrf1o">in-depth discussion on athlete health data</a> featuring <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/honor-data-rights-management/">HONOR Data Rights Management</a> CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristyagale/">Kristy Gale</a> that includes a great breakdown and thorough examination of this topic. We highly encourage you to give it a watch or a listen if you have time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Problem:</p>
<p>Athletes, particularly student athletes, are the source of a lot of data. Health, biometric, and even tracking data are all collected by teams, medical services, and wearable devices that the athletes use to monitor their workouts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All this data is gathered, used, and often shared without the athlete’s consent. Recruiters can get their hands on a surprising amount of data that you would think would be private, for example, how many times a player has sprained their ankle or visited the onsite medical team. They do this through legal loopholes or by going directly to the healthcare provider without the athlete’s knowledge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The simple truth is that gaps in current laws and business practices leave sensitive health data open for third parties to access. While athletes feel the effects the most, everyone should be able to know who can access their data. We need a technical solution that puts control of the data back into the hands of athletes and everyday people.</p>
<p>How Verifiable Credentials can help:</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/what-are-verifiable-credentials-with-pictures/">Verifiable credentials</a> are a technology that allows for a packet of information to be created using a decentralized ledger and securely stored on an end user’s mobile device. By storing the information in this way, you can be sure that the data is only shared with whoever the end user chooses, and by creating the package in this decentralized manner, you can be sure that the end user does not have the ability to change the information inside.</p>
<p>When it comes to athlete health data, all of the data they are creating, including statistics, physiological performance, evaluations, biometric data, tracking data, and more, can all be issued to the athlete as a tamper-proof credential. This accomplishes a few things:</p>
<p>1. It removes liability from teams, colleges, medical providers, and anyone who used to store this data.</p>
<p>2. It gives the athlete complete control over the information. It can still be shared with any party that needs to see it, but now they need to ask the data owner, who can choose to share all or just specific parts of the data.</p>
<p>3. All the data is now in one convenient place, no need to track down all the sources of the information when it is requested.</p>
<p>4. The data can be assumed to be as trusted as the source. The user doesn’t need to waste time double checking or verifying with the issuing party because any changes to the data would be visible on the decentralized ledger and “break” the credential.</p>
<p>5. The data can be easily shared with trusted partners, such as an agent for an athlete, who can share it on the athlete’s behalf if necessary.</p>
<p>By providing information in this new, technical way, we give control over their data back to the athletes. Not only do they have legal recourse should they find out their data has been misused, but they can also stop their data from being wrongfully shared at the point of request.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you find this topic interesting and would like to learn more about how athlete data is currently collected, held, and shared, the recent <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=bqQsWQPrf1o">Indicio Meetup</a> on this subject is a great place to start.</p>

 A Deep Dive to ZKPs and Decentralized Technology with Extrimian 



<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital identity management, privacy and security are paramount. <a href="https://extrimian.io/wikis/zero-knowledge-proof-zkp/" title="">Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)</a> stand out as a revolutionary technology, enabling the verification of claims without revealing underlying data. Extrimian is at the forefront, integrating ZKPs into decentralized digital identity systems to offer unmatched security and privacy.</p>



 Understanding Zero Knowledge Proofs 



<p>Zero Knowledge Proofs are a form of cryptographic protocol that allows one party (the prover) to prove to another party (the verifier) that a statement is true, without revealing any information beyond the validity of the statement itself. This technology is particularly potent for privacy-preserving digital interactions.</p>



 Key Concepts of ZKP: 



 
 Completeness: If the statement is true, an honest verifier will be convinced by an honest prover. 



 Soundness: If the statement is false, no cheating prover can convince the honest verifier that it is true, except with some small probability. 



 Zero-knowledge: If the statement is true, no verifier learns anything other than the fact that the statement is true. 
 



 Extrimian’s Application of ZKPs in Digital Identities 



<p>Extrimian harnesses the power of ZKPs to enhance the security and privacy of digital identities. By using ZKPs, Extrimian allows users to authenticate and share their credentials without exposing any sensitive personal information.</p>



 Example of ZKP in Action: 



 <code>const { zkSnark, generateProof, verifyProof } = require('extrimian-zkp-toolkit');

// Setup: A simple example where a user proves they are over 18 without revealing their age.
const { proof, publicSignals } = generateProof({
    age: 21,
    lowerBound: 18
});

// Verification: The verifier checks the proof without ever knowing the user's exact age.
const isValid = verifyDetails({
    proof,
    publicSignals
});

console.log(isValid);  // Output: true</code> 



 



<p>This simple code snippet demonstrates how a user can prove they meet the age requirement without revealing their exact age, using Extrimian’s ZKP toolkit.</p>



 Practical Use Cases of ZKP in Decentralized Digital Identity 



<p>ZKPs empower several practical applications in decentralized identity systems:</p>



 
 Privacy-Enhanced Authentication: Users can authenticate themselves to services without revealing any unnecessary personal information, thus enhancing privacy. 



 Credential Verification: Verify the authenticity of credentials without exposing the underlying data, useful in scenarios like employment verification or accessing restricted services. 



 Fraud Prevention: Secure systems against fraudulent claims and transactions by enabling entities to prove the legitimacy of their actions without revealing sensitive data. 
 



 Extrimian’s Integration and Benefits 



<p>At Extrimian, we integrate ZKPs within our digital identity solutions to provide:</p>



 
 Enhanced Privacy: Users have complete control over their personal information. 



 Increased Trust: Entities can trust the verification process without accessing private data. 



 Scalability: ZKPs allow for complex operations to be conducted without a significant increase in transaction costs or delays.

<p>In today’s fast-evolving financial landscape where customer expectations and technological advancements are constantly shifting, financial institutions must stay ahead of the curve to remain competitive. One crucial step in this pursuit is a comprehensive review of your current technology setup while exploring what’s currently available in the market.</p>
 The Importance of Reviewing Your Technology Setup 
<p>For financial institutions using inferior instant issuance solutions, as highlighted in the new Juniper Research report, <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.juniperresearch.com%2Fresearch%2Ffintech-payments%2Fbanking%2Fmodern-card-issuing-platforms-market-research%2F%3Futm_campaign%3Dpr1_moderncard_financial_fintech_jun24%26utm_source%3Dbusinesswire%26utm_medium%3Dpr&amp;esheet=54023271&amp;newsitemid=20240602845962&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Global+Modern+Card+Issuing+Platforms+Market+2024-2029&amp;index=2&amp;md5=046553e5a086e9363699a2357b6e55c6">Global Modern Card Issuing Platforms Market 2024-2029</a>, card issuers are predicted to face rising competition to remain top-of-wallet with customers and members. This emphasizes the need to reevaluate your financial institution technology setup, particularly concerning instant issuance.</p>
 Why Instant Issuance Matters 
<p>Among the advancements to consider is your instant issuance portfolio, which empowers you to provide your customers with immediate access to banking services by issuing cards directly at your branches or other locations. Let’s explore why it’s critical to reevaluate your technology setup, especially with regard to instant issuance.</p>
 For Financial Institutions Not Yet Using Instant Issuance 
<p>In the February 2024 PaymentsJournal podcast episode, “<a href="https://www.paymentsjournal.com/adopting-instant-issuance-programs-give-fis-a-competitive-edge/">Adopting Instant Issuance Programs Give FIs a Competitive Edge</a>,” Brian Riley, Director of Credit and Co-Head of Payments at Javelin Strategy &amp; Research, pointed out how instant financial card issuance helps build customer relationships.</p>
<p>“That card really reinforces the brand,” Riley said. “Getting into instant issuance is important because you’re really at the height of the relationship.”</p>
<p>If your financial institution hasn’t implemented instant issuance yet, you’re missing a significant opportunity to elevate your offerings. Here’s what you’re leaving on the table:</p>
 
 Enhanced Customer Satisfaction and Loyalty: With instant issuance, customers receive fully functional, ready-to-use cards in minutes, drastically reducing their waiting time and immediately addressing their banking needs. 
 Competitive Differentiation: Offering instant issuance helps differentiate your institution from competitors, providing an innovative, value-added service that attracts new customers and retains existing ones. 
 Operational Efficiency: Issuing cards instantly simplifies workflows, reduces operational costs, and increases productivity across branches. 
 
 Challenges With Substandard Instant Issuance Solutions 
<p>If you’re already leveraging instant issuance but rely on a solution that leaves your team struggling with substandard machines, disappointing card quality, or lackluster customer service, it’s time to reconsider your options.</p>
 What to Look for in a New Solution and How Entrust Can Help

<p>Last week, SpruceID attended the European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC) in Berlin, an event that brings together industry leaders, innovators, and experts to discuss and explore the latest advancements in digital identity and cloud security.</p><p>This year, SpruceID CEO Wayne Chang was among the panelists contributing to three in-depth discussions on the evolving landscape of decentralized identity. These panels provided a comprehensive overview of how decentralized identity can help mitigate modern threats and enhance trust in digital ecosystems in today’s world.</p> Panel: Building Trust in AI through Decentralized Identity Photo courtesy of the Decentralized Identity Foundation<p>One of our most anticipated sessions was the panel "Building Trust in AI through Decentralized Identity." This session focused on the pressing issues posed by AI technologies and brought together Wayne Chang, Kim Hamilton Duffy from the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), and Linda Jeng, founder of Digital Self Labs.</p><p>In this talk, Wayne highlighted the increasing risks of traditional identification methods in the face of sophisticated AI technologies. He pointed out, “Until now, we’ve been able to get by holding a driver's license up to a webcam, but with new AI tech, you can fool these systems — this is already showing up at the edges. ” He emphasized the rise in phishing attacks utilizing AI-generated voices that can convincingly mimic trusted individuals, making it easier for scammers to deceive victims.</p><p>The panelists discussed how decentralized identity could offer solutions to these emerging challenges. Wayne explained, “We need to add authenticity to communication. We don’t want to present a strong ID every time we want to use a chat app, so it makes sense to embed decentralized identity into comms channels to prove I’m real.” Decentralized identity is not only about identity but also about establishing data governance and creating chains of trust to mitigate risks from synthetic data. This approach empowers individuals with greater control over their data.</p><p>They touched on the promising developments in automated compliance with data regulations and the potential for expanding trust to content authenticity. They emphasized the need for ongoing education and the role of user demand in driving the adoption of decentralized identity technologies. In Linda Jeng’s words, “We need to spend time educating policymakers and the public, but in the end, it comes down to end-user demand for solutions.”</p><p>Read more about the discussions that took place during this panel in the blog post published by the <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/building-trust-in-ai-through-decentralized-identity/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>.</p> Panel: Expert/Digital Wallet &amp; Verifiers Q&amp;A Photo courtesy of the Decentralized Identity Foundation<p>In the Expert/Digital Wallet &amp; Verifiers Q&amp;A session, Anil John, Technical Director of the DHS S&amp;T Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP) at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, introduced the newest cohort members of SVIP, including SpruceID. Wayne Chang, SpruceID CEO, engaged in a Q&amp;A with digital wallet solution providers and industry experts from other SVIP cohort members, including Hushmesh, Procivis AG, Ubiqu, Netis, and Credence ID. The discussion focused on the practical aspects of integrating digital identity into digital wallets and verifiable credential systems. It covered a range of topics, including the challenges and opportunities in implementing decentralized identity, the role of verifiers in ensuring trust and security, and the potential for digital wallets to enhance user privacy and data control.&nbsp;</p><p>Panelists emphasized the importance of interoperability and user-centered design in developing digital wallet solutions, which are crucial for securely and conveniently managing digital identities and credentials.</p> Panel: Decentralized Identity in Production <p>Our final panel, "Decentralized Identity in Production," explored the practical applications of verifiable credentials and the integration of decentralized identity into production environments.&nbsp;</p><p>Wayne, along with panelists from Condatis, Adobe, Spherity, and Accenture, shared valuable insights and experiences on the business case for decentralized identity, highlighting key success factors and lessons learned from recent projects and discussing how verifiable credentials have been effectively integrated into workforce certifications, supply chain documentation, and educational qualifications, demonstrating enhanced trust achieved through decentralized identity. </p><p>The panelists emphasized key success factors in project learnings, product roadmaps, and the future direction of decentralized identity, and they encouraged attendees to explore practical applications for decentralized identity technologies within their organizations.</p> Continuing the Conversations on Decentralized Identity <p>We're grateful to have been invited to speak on several panels alongside other experts in the field at this year's event. </p><p>SpruceID is excited to be at the forefront of these important discussions and committed to advancing the development and adoption of decentralized identity solutions. We look forward to continuing these discussions and working with partners and stakeholders from EIC!</p><p>Check out our website to learn more about how SpruceID uses decentralized identity to build a more secure and trustworthy digital future.</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Learn More</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unified Identity and Access Management (IAM) has emerged as a critical solution to these issues. A unified IAM strategy integrates various identity and access management functions, such as identity verification, identity governance and administration (IGA), identity management (IDM), access management (AM), identity orchestration, and fraud and risk solutions into a single platform. As a result, unified IAM streamlines identity processes across multiple healthcare IT systems, applications, and environments. </p>

				  When it comes to phishing, financial institutions and their customers are targeted <a href="https://www.stationx.net/phishing-statistics/">more often than others</a>. Digital credentials solve this problem and provide customers with a better user experience when logging into their bank accounts.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Phishing is where someone pretends to be from an organization you know and requests information from you that allows them to steal your login data. This might be in the form of an email requesting that you reset your password, a text message, or even a phone call.</p>
<p>Phishing is on the rise because it works: <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/articles/s/the-history-of-phishing/">22% of data breaches</a> can be attributed to phishing.</p>
<p>Phishing in finance</p>
<p>In finance, phishing often involves someone pretending to be a customer trying to retrieve their account details by contacting their bank. Bank call centers receive <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/30/business/voice-deepfakes-bank-scams.html">thousands of deepfake calls per year</a>, wasting time and resources, and requiring vigilance on the part of the employee to spot the scams and stop the call. As deepfake technology becomes more dynamic this will be much harder for a human to do.</p>
<p>The other common vector for phishing attacks is that of a scammer pretending to be a bank. Financial institutions are the <a href="https://www.americanbanker.com/list/4-things-bankers-need-to-know-about-phishing">most impersonated organizations</a> by scammers. These attacks often come via an email, text, or even a call from the bank saying that there is something wrong with the customer’s account and they need to log in immediately. Unfortunately, the link provided by the scammer will steal the personal account information of the customer when they try to use it.</p>
<p>Stop phishing with verifiable credentials and decentralized identity</p>
<p>The reason phishing works is because there is currently not a good way for identifying who people claim to be online. Passwords and logins are prone to being lost, stolen, or copied, and even assuming they are secure, they are only effective in one direction — when the customer is trying to reach out to the bank. If a bank, or someone pretending to be the bank, tries to reach out to the customer, due diligence is required on the customer’s part to make sure the message is authentic.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity solves this problem. A bank can be absolutely certain that an account holder really is an account holder, and an account holder can be absolutely certain that they are interacting with their bank —&nbsp;and this mutually assured authentication is proven instantaneously by cryptography, and occurs before any information is shared.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>A bank customer’s digital wallet software is able to create a secure communications channel directly with their bank. The customer’s wallet creates a decentralized identifier (a DID) and uses this DID to connect to their bank’s DID. DIDs enable public key cryptography.</p>
<p>Each party uses the other party’s cryptographic keys to send encrypted messages to each other. Only the bank can decrypt the message sent by the customer because the customer has encrypted a message with the bank’s key; only the customer can decrypt the bank’s message because the bank has used the customer’s key to encrypt its message.</p>
<p>In reality, this is instantaneous. But it means that when a customer uses a DID to connect to their bank and then presents a verifiable credential for their bank account, the bank knows its their customer. It is more effective than adding multi factor authentication because it doesn’t require customers to jump through hoops, allows both parties to verify who they are interacting with, and even enables <a href="https://indicio.tech/passwordless-login-will-soon-be-the-norm-for-bank-accounts-financial-institutions/">passwordless login</a> by default.</p>
<p>To learn more about how this all works you can <a href="https://youtu.be/DE2gFx-msuE">see demonstrations of the technology in action</a>.</p>

<blockquote>“We appreciate the patience of the community and look forward to a combined $ASI token that is supported by all partners, exchanges and token holders.”</blockquote><p>Zug and Singapore — June 11, 2024 — The Artificial Superintelligence Alliance is dedicated to the successful and seamless integration of our anticipated token merger. SingularityNET, Fetch.ai, and Ocean Protocol have today announced a revised date for the ASI token merger, moving from June 13, 2024, to July 15,&nbsp;2024.</p><p>This schedule adjustment is necessary to accommodate the logistical requirements and technical dependencies of exchanges, validators, and broader ecosystem collaborators. The preparation phase for the token merger involves managing complex integrations, careful coordination, and attention to numerous moving parts. These third-party dependencies are critical to the smooth execution of the token merger process and ensuring that all stakeholders’ needs are adequately met is paramount. While this delay is unfortunate, it is a strategic decision to ensure the token merger is carried out with the highest standards of accuracy and efficiency.</p><p>Token Merger Schedule:</p>  Originally, the plan was for FET to be renamed to ASI today, June 11, followed by the token merger on June&nbsp;13.  On July 15th, FET, AGIX and OCEAN will merge into the new ASI&nbsp;token.  <p>Token Merger&nbsp;Steps:</p>  Current Status: The existing FET, AGIX and OCEAN tokens will continue to trade on exchanges independently.  Future Steps: Once third-party integrations are finalized, the ASI token will be launched and FET, AGIX and OCEAN will cease to trade independently and merge to the ASI&nbsp;token.  <p>Support and Guidance:</p>  Support will be provided on the official FET, AGIX and Ocean channels as well as the ASI&nbsp;channel.  Token contracts, migration contracts and all possible audits will be shared this&nbsp;week.  <blockquote>“While the finalization of the ASI token merger is now scheduled for July due to necessary adjustments by our partners, the commitment and vision driving this alliance remain stronger than ever,” said Humayun Sheikh, CEO of Fetch.ai and chairman of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance. “This temporary delay does not impact the substantial progress we have made towards creating a decentralized superintelligence network. Our teams are actively working with centralized exchanges to finalize the remaining steps. We appreciate the continued support and patience of our community and stakeholders as we work through these final logistical steps.”</blockquote><blockquote>“While working through the complexities of executing this unprecedented tokenomic merger,” noted Ben Goertzel, founder and CEO of SingularityNET Foundation and CEO of the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance, “we have at the same time been advancing toward integration of our respective AI and blockchain technologies. The finalization of the 3-way tokenomic merger on July 15 will be a major milestone, and we anticipate a series of progressively more exciting milestones after that as we leverage our $ASI token based network to move toward increasingly capable AI systems and in time actual superintelligence.”</blockquote><blockquote>“We appreciate the patience of the community and look forward to a combined $ASI token that is supported by all partners, exchanges and token holders.” Added Bruce Pon, founder and CEO of Ocean Protocol and board director in the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance&nbsp;Council.</blockquote><p>Token holders are assured that no action is required on their part at this time. The ASI token merger remains firmly on track and no further delays are anticipated.</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/artificial-superintelligence-alliance-announces-revised-timeline-for-token-merger-42d8bea9885e">Artificial Superintelligence Alliance Announces Revised Timeline for Token Merger</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   One type of cloud architecture is not necessarily better than another. When deciding between single-tenant vs. multi-tenant architecture, your organization's specific needs should determine the deployment type.&nbsp;

<p>One type of cloud architecture is not necessarily better than another. When deciding between single-tenant vs. multi-tenant architecture, your organization's specific needs should determine the deployment type.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To demonstrate how these two architectures work, let’s consider the familiar experience of looking for a place to live. Specifically, let’s pretend you’re trying to decide whether to buy a home or rent a house.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you like the layouts of apartment buildings you’ve toured, don’t mind sharing common walls, and think your life would be easier if things like maintenance, pest control, and landscaping were done for you, then having your own dedicated space as a tenant within a multi-tenant complex might be the right choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you want to customize your space, knock down walls, put in a new kitchen, fill your yard with apple trees, and enjoy the safety, security, and responsibility that come with maintaining and protecting your own domain, then a single-family home, where you’re the dedicated tenant, may be a better choice for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like someone searching for a place to call home, deciding between single-tenant and multi-tenant architecture requires considering what you want to do with the space once you move in. As you’ll learn below, the choice to go either way depends on a variety of factors.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>We’re excited to announce that guidance for SAP Identity Management (IDM) customers planning to migrate their identity management scenarios to Microsoft Entra is now available. In a&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/microsoft-and-sap-collaborate-to-modernize-identity-for-sap/ba-p/4056600">previous post</a>, we discussed SAP ending maintenance for their identity management solution (SAP IDM) by 2030.&nbsp;We've since begun jointly developing documentation to help customers plan a seamless migration to the recommended alternative—Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;For many customers, it may be possible to get started immediately, leveraging the subscriptions that they already own with Microsoft 365 suites. Microsoft 365 enterprise suite licenses include Entra ID P1 features that will be the focus of this first round of guidance.&nbsp;In this post, we’ll also outline additional benefits of Microsoft Entra ID and list some key partners who can help you get started.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Continuing collaboration for enterprise security&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft and SAP have a long history of collaborating to keep our customers’ organizations productive and secure—an effort especially important now as more companies have adopted hybrid work arrangements, making it possible to work from office and from home. For example, last year we announced how Microsoft Sentinel is helping organizations bring&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-sentinel-blog/revolutionize-your-sap-security-with-microsoft-sentinel-s-soar/ba-p/3823857">SOAR threat monitoring capabilities to their SAP environments</a>. We continue to deepen our relationship, and now we’re extending support for SAP customers’ digital transformation and cloud adoption goals with a seamless and secure identity management solution in Microsoft Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, we’re introducing the first set of&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/MigrateFromSAPIDM">guidance to migrate from SAP IDM to Entra ID</a>. SAP customers who are using SAP IDM for cloud and on-premises applications like SuccessFactors, SAP Cloud Identity Services, or Windows Server Active Directory can begin to use Microsoft Entra features such as Conditional Access to enforce Zero Trust access policies, and automatic provisioning that ensures users have the accounts they need for their job role. For SAP IDM customers who want more guidance on advanced IAM integrations, such as with Micosoft Entra ID Governance or external IDs, for example, we’re developing additional in-depth guidance on each of those areas that will be published later this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Modernizing your security strategy and moving toward a Zero Trust framework is not an overnight process, so we recommend customers start their journey to adopt cloud services and gain productivity and security benefits.&nbsp;Therefore, we’ve included guidance for migration of the most common scenarios, including:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft and SAP will continue to enhance Microsoft Entra ID and deliver deeper integrations with SAP Cloud Identity Services and SAP Cloud Identity Access Governance.&nbsp; As new scenarios become available, we’ll provide ongoing updates to this&nbsp;guidance, incorporating customer and partner feedback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Modern identity management is a strategic investment 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Progressive organizations are switching to cloud-based identity solutions. Older systems, designed for on-site environments, fail to satisfy the demands of the modern cloud-first, mobile, decentralized workforce. Additionally, they can be expensive, complicated, and susceptible to security risks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that multifactor authentication (MFA) and single sign-on methods&nbsp;<a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RW166lD?culture=en-us&amp;country=us">can reduce password breaches by 99.9%</a>, but the benefits of a cloud-based solution in Microsoft Entra ID extend beyond just a stronger security posture. Optimized operational efficiency allows identity teams to do more impactful work and an improved user experience makes the entire organization less frustrated. By moving to Microsoft Entra ID, the benefits of your strategic investment continue:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Support for SAP and non-SAP apps and systems—both on-premises and cloud&nbsp; 
 Rich set of APIs, SDKs,&nbsp;and connectors for customization&nbsp; 
 Minimized vendor footprint&nbsp; 
 Reduced costs and complexity&nbsp; 
 Help meeting identity-related requirements for GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO 27001&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; 
 
<p>Modernizing identity management is key to boosting organizational security and shielding users and assets from the most common security threats. It’s more than just a cybersecurity measure; it also enhances user experience and operational efficiency. Generative AI, Zero Trust security, decentralized identity, and the flexibility to tailor access policies to exactly match your unique needs and demands offer compelling opportunities to better protect&nbsp;your apps and resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Partner network ready to help 
<p>&nbsp;<br>We’ve also been working with a set of key partners to help organizations begin their migrations, including some with long-term experience in Microsoft/SAP environments. </p>

<p>Recent healthcare cyberattacks have highlighted the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures in the healthcare industry. In February 2024, Change Healthcare, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, was hit by a ransomware attack when hackers exploited a server that was missing a fundamental security measure: multi-factor authentication (MFA). The incident not only paralyzed healthcare services but also led to the payment of a $22 million ransom and is expected to cost the company over $1.6 billion in recovery efforts. Moreover, according to Axios, health care providers are losing up to $1 billion a day from cyberattack.1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As healthcare providers and payers continue to digitize their operations and patient records, they also continue to be the prime target for cybercriminals. According to the 2023 ForgeRock Breach Report2 of all industries healthcare is the number one targeted industry by cybercriminals. The stakes are high: a breach not only compromises member and patient data but also disrupts essential healthcare services. To mitigate these risks, healthcare organizations must adopt comprehensive security measures, with multi-factor authentication (MFA) across the organization being paramount.</p>

<p>In a hybrid world that blends on-premises and cloud-based resources, securing access to sensitive data and systems is no longer achieved by defending a perimeter, but through authentication. While authentication technologies have evolved over the past decades from their humble password origins, preventing unauthorized access still hinges on choosing and implementing the right identity-based controls.<br>
This involves navigating a landscape where knowledge-based, possession-based, biometric, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods offer a variety of advantages and limitations. Let’s consider each of the options available to organizations and how to select the right mix of controls to improve their security posture.</p>
 Knowledge-Based Authentication 
<p>Knowledge-based authentication (KBA), which encompasses passwords and PINs, is the most traditional form of authentication. Its widespread adoption and user familiarity make it a convenient starting point for many security protocols. However, its susceptibility to social engineering, phishing attacks, and the perennial issue of weak password creation by users necessitate a cautious approach. For environments where ease of use is paramount and risk levels are comparatively low, KBA can serve as a component of a more comprehensive security strategy, particularly when augmented with additional authentication factors.<br>
Knowledge-based authentication (KBA) is best suited for environments with comparatively low risk levels, where ease of use is paramount and the accessed information is not highly sensitive or critical. It can serve as a supplementary authentication factor in conjunction with other methods, such as biometric or device-based authentication. Examples include accessing non-critical information, utilizing KBA alongside other authentication methods as a first factor, and implementing it in public Wi-Fi hotspots for streamlined user access without compromising security.</p>
 Possession-Based Authentication 
<p>Possession-based authentication methods require users to have a physical object, such as a security token or a mobile device, to gain access. This approach adds a tangible layer of security, making it harder for attackers to gain unauthorized access without physical possession of the required object. It’s particularly effective in scenarios where additional security is needed without significantly complicating the user experience, such as in financial transactions or access to high-security areas. However, the risk of loss or theft and the potential cost implications of deploying hardware devices must be considered.<br>
Possession-based authentication methods offer heightened security measures for a range of scenarios, including financial transactions, remote work access, secure online transactions, and compliance-driven environments like legal and government agencies. In online banking, users require physical possession of a security token or mobile device to access their accounts securely. Similarly, in remote work settings, this method ensures that only authorized employees with designated devices can connect to corporate networks and sensitive data, mitigating risks associated with unauthorized access. Additionally, in e-commerce platforms and online payment systems, possession-based authentication enhances transaction security, reducing the risk of fraud and protecting sensitive financial information. Furthermore, compliance-driven industries can benefit from this approach to meet regulatory obligations and safeguard confidential information.</p>
 Biometrics 
<p>Biometric authentication offers a high-security level by utilizing unique user characteristics like fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans. This method is highly resistant to traditional hacking attempts and provides a seamless user experience. It is well-suited for environments where security cannot be compromised, such as in government or healthcare settings. Nevertheless, concerns around privacy, the potential for spoofing, and the need for compatible hardware investments can pose challenges. Organizations must weigh these factors against the critical need for secure and user-friendly authentication mechanisms.<br>
Biometric authentication, which leverages unique user characteristics like fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans, is ideal for various high-security environments. It is best suited for secure access to sensitive data and fortifying high-risk online systems. Despite its advantages, organizations must consider privacy concerns, potential spoofing, and compatible hardware investments when deploying biometric authentication systems.</p>
 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 
<p>MFA combines two or more authentication methods listed above to create a layered security approach, significantly enhancing protection against various threats. By integrating knowledge, possession, and biometric factors, MFA creates a dynamic defense mechanism that is much harder for attackers to bypass. This method is ideal for protecting sensitive data and critical systems, offering a balanced solution that addresses the vulnerabilities inherent in single-method authentication systems. While MFA introduces complexity and potential user resistance, its ability to significantly reduce security risks makes it a vital component of modern cybersecurity strategies.<br>
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a versatile security method that finds applications across industries, serving to protect sensitive data and critical systems. More commonly, MFA is required to ensure secure access to corporate systems from outside the office, and in e-commerce platforms to safeguard customer accounts and high-risk customer and citizen transactions. Overall, MFA provides a defense mechanism against various threats, combining multiple authentication factors to significantly enhance security and mitigate risks inherent in single-method authentication systems.</p>
 Passwordless 
<p>Passwordless authentication represents a significant leap forward in cybersecurity, eliminating the vulnerabilities associated with traditional knowledge-based methods. The majority of authentication methods included in the above still require a user name AND password as a first step in authenticating users. But, by leveraging biometrics, mobile devices, or security keys, passwordless systems offer a user-friendly and highly secure alternative that reduces the risk of phishing, password theft, and unauthorized access. This method is particularly advantageous in creating a seamless user experience without compromising security, and ideal for environments aiming to minimize friction while maintaining high security standards. Organizations looking to bolster access security while enhancing user satisfaction should consider integrating passwordless authentication into their strategic security framework, offering an optimal balance between ease of use and robust protection.<br>
Organizations across diverse sectors, particularly those looking for a better, more secure user experience, should carefully consider integrating passwordless authentication into their security frameworks. By leveraging biometrics, mobile devices, or security keys, passwordless systems offer a robust and user-friendly alternative to traditional password-based methods, effectively mitigating the risks associated with phishing, password theft, and unauthorized access. This approach not only enhances security posture but also fosters a seamless and efficient user experience, aligning with the modern landscape of digital operations where stringent security measures and user satisfaction are paramount.</p>
 Choosing the Right Strategy 
<p>The choice of authentication method should be driven by an organization’s specific needs, considering factors such as the sensitivity of the data, user experience requirements, and regulatory compliance mandates. Here are four key considerations for selecting the appropriate authentication method:</p>
 
 Risk Assessment: Evaluate the level of security risk associated with the data or systems being protected. Higher risk scenarios may warrant more stringent authentication methods, such as biometric or MFA. 
 User Experience: Consider the impact on the user. While security is paramount, overly cumbersome authentication processes can lead to poor compliance and user frustration. 
 Cost and Infrastructure: Assess the financial and infrastructure implications of deploying new authentication technologies. While advanced methods like biometric authentication offer enhanced security, they also come with higher implementation costs. 
 Compliance Requirements: Ensure that the chosen authentication method aligns with industry regulations and standards, which may dictate specific security measures. 
 
<p>Defending against increasingly sophisticated cyber threats requires understanding the unique advantages and limitations of available authentication methods, and selecting the controls that are best aligned with organizational needs and user expectations. Using the methods described above can help define an authentication strategy that ensures security measures remain robust, responsive, and user-friendly.</p>

  <p>Online manipulation is mentioned in several EU Regulations as one of the cyber threats that need to be countered. Recital 3 in the eIDAS 2.0 regulation also mentions manipulation as a threat that the European Digital Identity Wallet and other subjects covered in eIDAS are to address. This talk will detail from a normative perspective what manipulation is and how online manipulation has specific traits. From that perspective the way the EUDIW is discussed and how it can aggravate or reduce manipulative capabilities in the online realm.<br> This talk draws from research that is conducted at Delft University by Henk Marsman on the topic of digital wallets, national identity and online manipulation, for which a paper is forthcoming in 2024.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/manipulative-digital-identity-eic24"></a>

  <p>In the next three years, the twenty seven states of the European Union (EU) will have to finalize the implementing acts for the eIDAS2 regulation and issue digital identity wallets to their citizens. Although the Architecture Reference Framework (ARF) defined by the EU expert group has clearly identified mandatory standards for several parts of the wallet, such as the credentials formats, or the verification or presentation protocols, it has not mandated standards on how to secure of the wallet credentials, sensitive data and key materials.<br>The ARF has identified use cases requiring a high level of assurance (LoA) in terms of security, such as the provisioning of the Personal Identification Data (PID) or the use of qualified signature, as well as possible means to ensure this high LoA: with secure elements embedded into the mobile device, with external electronic identity documents accessed by communication channels such as Near Field Communication (NFC), or with the use of remote Hardware Security Modules.<br>Today, the vast majority of mobile devices are embedding secure elements and trusted execution environments that already provide certified high level of security for several use cases such as secure connectivity, payment, ticketing, or digital keys. These secure elements are deployed on billions of mobile devices, and are based on recognized standards such GlobalPlatform Secure Element or Trusted Execution Environment specifications.<br>This presentation will give an overview of the different security standards and technologies available in mobile devices, and how they can be applied for securing digital identity wallets. Besides the secure storage and secure execution environment aspects, this presentation will also address secure provisioning of wallet applications, credentials and sensitive data, as well as their security certification. It will bridge the gap between the high level requirements of security and the possible deployment scenarios that will enable digital identity wallet to enjoy the same level of security as existing proven and largely deployed solutions.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/an-overview-of-deployment-solutions-eic24"></a>

  <p>Providing a product or service across markets internationally can come with significant technical and regulatory overhead. The challenge of such overhead might seem to reduce itself in the current market development in Europe with the soon to be standardized eIDAS architecture and unified wallet interaction protocols that seem to streamline identity integration requirements across 27 countries. In practice though, moving beyond the EU context will still require significant adaptation and often parallel implementation of identity standards and protocols, this is true for the Swiss market as much as it is true for the US or even Japanese market. While all these markets move towards the digital identity wallet paradigm as a new identity model, their technical approach differs significantly.</p>
<p>Abstracting this complexity for companies that simply want to provide their product or service across markets is a tough challenge. Solution providers need to consistently monitor changing specifications, requirements, and regulation, while making sure that their own technological platform is ready to support the variety at hand. Many incumbent solutions and platforms do not handle such diversity well since they were developed for a concrete market environment and then updated on a sub optimal path of evolution towards ever more complexity.</p>
<p>As a Swiss provider of digital identity core technologies, Procivis had to naturally tackle the challenge of a future proof technology solution that is capable of handling complexity since day one. Our home market is too small to justify a solution built for only that environment, so we had to get creative and build a product that can naturally handle complexity and interoperability without compromise.</p>
<p>This presentation will tell the story of our journey to rethink product development in times of uncertainty. It will describe how we learned to radically build for adaptability and extensibility. After the initial instinct to resist uncertainty, we learned to embrace it and I will talk about our company's journey to this new state of consciousness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/embracing-diverse-specifications-eic24"></a>

  <p>Digital wallets are applications used to receive, store, and share identity attributes in a standards-based [preferably], secure, privacy enhancing fashion. To prove that the legitimate, natural person is receiving, in possession of, or sharing these identity attributes a means to bind them to the natural person is needed.<br> In 1995, for example, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) clearly recognized the desirability of pursuing the use of biometrics in travel documents as the single best way to link the document and its rightful “owner.”<br> In this example the issuing authority binds the identity attributes to the authorized holder by including biometric data in the cryptographically signed logical data structure. When the holder makes an identity claim the relying party (verifier) can determine the authenticity and integrity of the identity attributes and, through biometric recognition, determine if the authorized holder is presenting the information. This works well for the intended use case: in-person identity verification by government authorities for cross border travel.<br> The EU, for another example, specifies three assurance levels for electronic identification (low, superior, and high) which involve different levels of rigor in the identity proofing process and in the binding process itself, from: <br> The binding has been established on the basis of nationally recognised procedures.<br> to<br> The binding has been verified on the basis of a unique identifier representing the legal person used in the national context; and on the basis of information uniquely representing the natural person from an authoritative source.<br> Here the EU defines authoritative source as:<br> any source irrespective of its form that can be relied upon to provide accurate data, information and/or evidence that can be used to prove identity; <br> The goal of digital wallets in general, and the EU digital wallet in particular, is to be able to prove identity claims to a certain level of assurance both in-person (like an ICAO ePassport or ISO 18013-5 mDL) and on-line (like an ISO 18013-7 mDL). <br> <br> This session will discuss how authentication may rely on the digital wallet to bind the holder to identity claims and what the associated challenges as influenced by varying levels of assurance.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-wallet-holder-binding-eic24"></a>

  <p>The IAM community grapples with various issues today, including complex UIs from vendors, vendor-specific jargon, and heavy reliance on SMEs for routine tasks, driving up service costs significantly. This presents a challenge for smaller organizations unable to afford such expenses, hindering their ability to derive benefits, despite training efforts. Large organizations face lengthy onboarding processes and complex implementations, frustrating business lines as they struggle to perform tasks efficiently. Generative AI simplifies the process by removing the need to decipher vendor terminology and navigate intricate UIs. It provides a uniform interface, enhances productivity, and leads to significant savings in deployment and maintenance. This approach enables all stakeholders, including deployment personnel and help desk teams, to effectively engage with IGA. The session will include a demonstration.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/transforming-iga-with-generative-ai-eic24"></a>

  <p>The cybersecurity landscape is evolving rapidly, and traditional security paradigms are proving inadequate in the face of modern threats. As organizations strive to embrace Zero Trust principles, the role of Privileged Access Management (PAM) is pivotal. This talk explores the transformative concept of "Micro Authorizations" and its potential to shape the optimal direction for PAM implementations in support of Zero Trust initiatives.</p>
<p>The Authorization Fabric decides whether a specific principal is authorized to perform a precise operation on a particular resource and whether the resource permits this access.</p>
<p>The granularity of this approach is vital in today’s threat landscape, requiring organizations to shift their focus to a comprehensive, system-wide authorization framework. This shift, parallels the principles of microservices but applies them to the realm of access control.</p>
<p>Rather than depending on a single point of control, there is a need for a network proxy that acts as a bridge between trust and authorization.</p>
<p>Join us on a journey towards a future powered by micro authorizations, where precision, adaptability, and contextual awareness define access control. Explore how micro authorizations can address contemporary security challenges and facilitate the adoption of the Zero Trust model.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/zero-trust-in-privileged-access-management-eic24"></a>

  <p>Compared to externalising authentication, externalising authorization has proven elusive. Yet a combination of the rise of advanced threat actors, regulation, compliance and pressures for greater business agility is bringing it back in focus. It is tempting to think of externalising authorization as a technology problem. Technology like policy languages, authorization engines and workflow systems is necessary to enable the externalisation of authorization, but it is not sufficient. Externalising authorization requires three foundational building blocks to be in place, namely value for all stakeholders from engineers to customers, supporting business processes and technology. In this session we explore each of these building blocks should be internalised in terms of mapping value for all stakeholders, the process and culture needed to make authorization policies explicit and finally the need to drive authorization infrastructure, from policy language to enforcement engines, into the compute and network fabric to address greenfield and brownfield deployments in order to remove barriers to externalising authorization.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/authorization-before-we-externalise-it-eic24"></a>

  <p>In an era marked by the pervasive spread of disinformation and the&nbsp;democratization of advanced artificial intelligence capabilities to&nbsp;create synthetic media, the need for robust defense mechanisms has never been more urgent. The Defending Against Disinformation Common Data Model&nbsp;(DAD-CDM) and the DISARM Framework stand at the forefront of this&nbsp;battle, offering structured approaches to identify, analyze, and&nbsp;counteract disinformation campaigns. The DISARM Framework and DAD-CDM&nbsp;serve as a unified platform for organizations worldwide to exchange&nbsp;critical information, facilitating early detection and rapid response to&nbsp;emerging threats. Leveraging the DISARM Framework, which codifies&nbsp;adversary behaviors and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs),&nbsp;stakeholders gain insight into manipulative strategies employed in&nbsp;disinformation campaigns, enabling proactive defense measures and&nbsp;enabling a more rapid and comprehensive incident response.<br> <br> In our upcoming presentation, we will explore the intricate&nbsp;intersection of AI, disinformation, and cybersecurity, shedding light on&nbsp;the pivotal role of DAD-CDM and DISARM in safeguarding against evolving threats. Through real-world case studies and practical insights, we&nbsp;explore how these frameworks empower governments, cybersecurity experts,&nbsp;industry, and organizations to mitigate the influence of disinformation&nbsp;and AI-created synthetic media. Join us as we uncover strategies to&nbsp;fortify defenses and foster collaborative efforts in combating&nbsp;misinformation in the digital age.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/combating-misinformation-in-an-ai-enabled-world-eic24"></a>

By combining the lessons learned from the user experience of consumer identity; mission-critical identity proofing and identity validation in financial services; and data privacy regulation compliance across regulated markets, a brand new approach of secure identity management across all industries has been on the rise.</p>
<p>Collaborative Networks (suppliers, partners, distributors, brokers etc.) have a very diverse set of users with varying security, privacy and user experience needs. Discover how to strike that balance to harness the true power of collaboration!</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-trust-building-collaborative-networks-eic24"></a>

  <p>The proliferation of micro-services along with the changing threat landscape means it is no longer possible to rely on network segmentation to establish a secure permitter while allowing broad access between services inside the perimeter. As a result, we have to assume that the attackers are inside the perimeter and apply fine grained authorization at the microservice level to ensure least privilege access based on the context of each transaction. This context includes details of the transaction, the user, other services, or workloads in the call chain as well as the trust domains in which the services operate.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are two new complimentary standards being developed in the IETF OAuth working group that provide a standardised mechanism for preserving transaction context. The Transaction Tokens draft provides a mechanism for preserving context for fine grained authorization decisions within a trust domain, while Identity Chaining across Trust Domains provides a mechanism for preserving that context even when crossing trust boundaries. In this session we will provide an overview of these two emerging standards and describe how they are used to enable fine grained authorization in microservices.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/enabling-fine-grained-authoirization-eic24"></a>

  <p>Stolen secrets and credentials are one of the most common ways for attackers to move laterally and maintain persistence in cloud environments.</p>
<p>Modern cloud deployments employ secrets management systems such as KMS to protect key materials at rest and avoid leaking keys or credentials in source code or other build artifacts. However, secrets are unprotected at runtime, so any vulnerability or compromise of a service could lead to credential theft.</p>
<p>This talk will propose an architecture that, in conjunction with a secret manager, tokenizes secrets and rewrites requests at runtime. Through this approach, application code never directly interacts with key material. Additionally, it enforces stringent access control rules based on Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies for accessing secrets, significantly reducing the blast radius in the event of a security breach.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/securing-workload-identities-eic24"></a>

  <p>As part of the revision of the EU common identity framework regulation, also known as eIDAS 2.0, EU Member States will all soon implement a new common structure for electronic credentials based on digital identity wallets. This includes the development of a European Digital Identity (EUDI) wallet.</p>
<p>This wallet can be implemented as a web wallet running in a browser. This means a smartphone is not required to use the wallet – making it inclusive and independent of app stores and phone vendors. Instead of using native APIs to protect cryptographic keys, this web wallet can use FIDO security keys to secure the wallet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIDO is a natural fit to secure digital wallets as users are becoming more and more familiar with its associated registration and sign in flows now many websites have adopted passkeys as a means to access their services.</p>
<p>In this session, we will discuss how the wallet works, how FIDO is used to protect the wallet, highlight current use cases of how the wallet is being used by EU member states, and how this model can be replicated in other countries around the world.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/securing-digital-identity-wallets-using-fido-security-keys-eic24"></a>

  <p>In the realm of modern authentication, FIDO and passkeys have launched a new paradigm that is both practical and transformative. Passkey providers have seamlessly integrated the capability to synchronize passkeys across various devices, extending their reach even to different device families. Users enjoy default implementations of passkey providers with each new device, empowering relying parties to leverage passkeys across the multitude of devices.<br> In contrast, relying parties cannot assume the universal presence of identity wallet functionality on the typical devices used by their customers.<br> Given the three-year device switch cycle and the concurrent use of multiple devices, cloud storage services have efficiently addressed the migration of standard data between devices. While these services generally have access to data in the clear, they implement safeguards to prevent inadvertent disclosure.<br> Passkey providers not only synchronize passkeys but also implement robust recovery methods, crucial for scenarios involving the loss or theft of all devices. Similarly, identity wallets, tasked with managing verifiable identity attributes and associated secrets, necessitate safeguards akin to those implemented by passkey providers. <br> This webinar explores the similarities and differences between passkey providers and identity wallets, offering valuable insights into what identity wallets can glean from the proven methodologies of passkeys.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/convergence-of-passkeys-and-identity-wallets-eic24"></a>

  <p>For decentralised identity to reach its full potential we need high levels of trust and high levels of inclusion. <br>As a community we have developed some great standards and practices for identity verification, but they mostly rely on having strong documentation issued by a government if you want to gain the higher levels of trust. <br>The reality is not everyone has strong documentation and not everyone has access to digital technology to verify that documentation remotely. For example, in the UK around 11 million people have neither a passport nor a driving licence, the 2 primary documents used for identity verification. In many countries this number is far higher. <br>And, while we drive forward with more and more technological means of proving who we are online, some people will always struggle to use these technologies or simply not be able to. <br>Vouching for someone as part of the identity verification process has been around for a while but is only now crystalising in the minds of identity experts. It is also one of the most decentralised ways of proving who you are. <br>The process of Vouching is intended to increase inclusivity of population scale identity systems by enabling people with insufficient documentation (identity evidence), or those unable to complete a conventional identity registration to gain a digital identity.<br>In this session Adam Cooper seeks to outline the issues we should be addressing and the approaches we can take to create better inclusivity in digital identity ecosystems based on over a decade of working with governments, citizens, and the private sector to deliver better outcomes for all of us.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-is-already-decentralized-eic24"></a>

  <p>The Trust Over IP Foundation (ToIP), which just had its fourth birthday, has long held the conviction that technical trust alone is insufficient for enabling human trust in digital interactions. Thus, ToIP has been developing a dual stack that pairs technical architecture with governance architecture. <br> <br>To maximize technical interoperability, ToIP believes there must be a minimum viable “trust spanning” protocol that enables ubiquitous secure, private data exchange. Then every digital trust ecosystem can choose which higher-layer “trust task” protocols—such as exchanging digital credentials between digital wallets, or verifying ecosystem participants using trust registries—they need to meet their specific authenticity, confidentiality, and privacy requirements.<br> <br> With regards to the harder problem of human trust, in the real world this is built through relationships, agreements and other intangible elements within a context. By contrast, in the digital world trust has to be engineered. This means each ecosystem needs to be able to define their governance architecture, policies, credentials, and trust lists/registries that can be communicated both within and across ecosystems using interoperable protocols to maximize the potential for cross-ecosystem trust relationships.<br> <br> This interactive panel, moderated by ToIP’s Executive Director, will convene a set of ToIP leaders to explain why they have been investing in this new approach to decentralized digital trust infrastructure, where it fits with eIDAS 2.0, how it builds upon (not replaces) X.509 PKI and OpenID, and what to expect over the coming year.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/emerging-trust-layer-for-the-internet-eic24"></a>

  <p>With cybercrime on the rise, ransomware attacks that target Active Directory (AD), the primary identity store for most businesses worldwide, are as common as having a cup of coffee. Many cyber incidents involve AD in one way or another. Given that an attack on AD, these days, is more of a "when" rather than an "if" scenario, organizations must have a tested AD DR plan and purpose-built solutions for securing AD before a cyberattack and recovering and securing AD after that cyberattack. In addition, if like many organizations today, you have a hybrid identity environment that connects AD with Entra ID (formerly known as Azure AD), do you know what needs to happen to reconnect? Recovering as fast as possible is one thing, assessing the security of your AD and mitigating any (critical) risks is another. But what about reconnecting AD back with Entra ID? Knowing which precautionary measures to take to minimize damage (i.e., the impact on user experience and data loss) within Entra ID is of utmost importance!</p>
<p>This presentation discusses the risk to today’s enterprise organizations and explains why prioritizing hybrid identity (Active Directory and Entra ID) security is so important. Examples of various identity threat detection and response (ITDR) tools to evaluate AD security (pre- and post-attack) and discover vulnerabilities that could attract attackers are also discussed.</p>
<p>Attendees will also learn why an AD Recovery Plan is a vital resource for ongoing operational resilience, including the different ways to execute parts of that DR plan and what the impact is of such an execution. Finally, we will discuss what the problem is with reconnecting AD back with Entra ID and what you can do about it to mitigate any impact.</p>
<p>In summary, during this session, attendees will learn the following:</p>
 
 Learn how to evaluate the security of an AD 
 Learn how to prepare for a disaster scenario 
 Learn which backup to choose and why 
 Learn how to remediate risk (due to security) right after recovery 
 Learn how to remediate impact when reconnecting AD with Entra ID&nbsp; 
 
<p>If time allows, the highlights of a real-life AD recovery scenario will be discussed, to put all the pieces together.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ransomware-attack-against-your-ad-eic24"></a>

  <p>In the&nbsp;Dialectic of Enlightenment, Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer introduce a critical view of the process of civilization, economy and enlightenment as such, a critical view of the seemingly self-evident notion of pure reason, science, and technology. What Horkheimer and Adorno are trying to capture and reflect is the very process of rationality backlashing into irrationality. The long history of enlightenment is thus the demystification of nature and the development of pure calculative rationality. According to Horkheimer and Adorno, we have tried to free ourselves of the dangers and brute force of nature, but in the process of developing technology and production we have ended up narrowing our rational capacities, dominating ourselves, and tying ourselves to a petrified system now even endangering our own planet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We seem to have reached the era of modern technology and exact calculation, but this leaves us with no sense of control or meaningfulness in the face of a global environmental crisis. Humanity's technological orientation to the world makes clear the responsibility of human beings to the well-being of the world. This taking of responsibility will become vital in the future since it has become perfectly clear that the Earth will not be able in the long term to support the exploitative and care-less ways in which ever growing parts of humanity have been inhabiting her since at least the Industrial Revolution. However, the need to ask about modern technology is presumably dying out to the same extent that technology more definitely characterizes and regulates the appearance of the totality of the world and the position of man in it. Thus, it is important to ask: how does modern technology affect our actuality?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This session will explore how technology is not merely a means to an end but also a lens through which we understand ourselves and the world. It will highlight the increasing responsibility that humanity bears for the well-being of the planet, especially in the face of a global environmental crisis.

  <p>In the fast-evolving landscape of digital connectivity, one of the biggest challenges service providers in highly regulated industries face today is ensuring that authentication and API authorization mechanisms are implemented correctly. At the same time, they are required to meet high expectations of customers for a seamless experience.</p>
<p>Traditionally, authentication and API authorization functions have been combined into one system architecture, often through a managed service provided by a vendor. However, this restricts how service providers can customize their identity and access management systems to deliver a consistent brand experience.<br>To thrive in the competitive environment, service providers are increasingly opting to build their own authorization servers in-house. They are taking control of their identity and access management systems to deliver a frictionless and differentiated experience.<br>Discover examples of how well-respected brands have built their fully compliant and secure authorization servers by offloading the protocol processing and management, accelerating the growth of their digital services.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/liberate-yourself-from-vendor-limitations-eic24"></a>

  <p>What would happen if standards-based digital credentialing technology becomes widely accessible? Any entity, large or small, can start issuing and verifying within weeks, days or even hours. Then, the initial adoption of digital credentials will mostly be driven by ‘local’ needs. This is inevitable due to the decreasing cost and complexity of technology. However, as more and more begin to issue credentials on their own terms with little to no coordination, even when the technology everyone uses is based on interoperable standards, as long as there is no established human trust, two entities won’t be able to accept each other’s credentials right away. So how to facilitate trust building in this emerging world of digital credentials?<br><br>This session will introduce a new model, Decentralized Federation, which leverages to the best extent possible of existing systems and connects trust registries, and how it is already being implemented to solve today’s trust problems.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/decentralized-federation-new-trust-model-eic24"></a>

This talk will explore the potential role of EUDI Wallets in meeting these requirements, consider gaps that exist and explore additional technologies and capabilities that may be needed.

  <p>In the rapidly evolving agricultural sector, the importance of data management and sharing has never been more critical. Traditional methods are no longer sufficient; they create compliance burdens, inefficiencies and face a lack of trust. New Zealand is undertaking a transformative approach with the Digital Farm Wallet pilot, conceived by the Trust Alliance New Zealand (TANZ), a non-profit industry consortium recognising that trusted data sharing is essential for the growth of New Zealand’s primary sector.</p>
<p>The TANZ Digital Farm Wallet Pilot Project exemplifies the commitment to empowering stakeholders to share and verify information in a trusted and permissioned manner, fostering trust and transparency throughout the value chain. This initiative aims to offer tangible proof of brand promises, while alleviating farms from the repetitive tasks of data management.</p>
<p>To ensure international market and financial access demand of digital proofs, such as environmental claims are increasing. The Digital Farm Wallet addresses this by facilitating the sharing of key data points like greenhouse gas and Scope 3 emissions, underscoring good management practices. Exploring various applications, this initiative aims to deliver real value for farmers and food processors.</p>
<p>Klaeri Schelhowe was contracted through Scheddebrock Ltd. to act as the Executive Director for TANZ. In this role she established an industry consortium to focus on trusted data sharing within the primary sector. A significant challenge was posed in bringing together the many and varied stakeholders, many of whom competed with each other, to cooperate in the development of a functioning ecosystem. Developing stakeholder understanding and willingness to engage in a co opetition model in order to build critical mass is a more complex and demanding undertaking than the adoption and deployment of the technology itself.</p>

  <p>Choosing the right platform to secure identity access to privileged resources is more challenging. This is partly because of the escalating risk of under protected identities in the cloud and the tendency of bad actors to target those with privileged access. It’s also because the choice of tools has widened. The protection of privileged identities has traditionally fallen to PAM vendors such as CyberArk or BeyondTrust, but in the last few years, the space has widened to include CIEM and ITDR providers who focus on securing identities in the cloud, for development environments and at the edge.</p>
<p>In this session Paul will explain why these newer technologies emerged, why they are important, and the difference between them and traditional PAM. He will share his analysis of how these technologies can be orchestrated to work together and how some are being deployed in a decentralised fashion for specific identity management and protection tasks.</p>
<p>You will learn the fundamental design elements of each of these technologies, how they can protect your identities and which may offer a solution for managing privileged identities in your organization.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/pam-ciem-itdr-difference-eic24"></a>

The problem of finding and matching John Doe versus J.Doe is attempted in an end-to-end procurement process to detect internal fraud, based on data from ERP systems. We present an explainable AI (XAI) approach that attempts to explain to business users how certain features of data affect high-risk indicators in a procurement process. Various state-of-the-art XAI methods and novel contributions are empirically evaluated to provide an explainable AI-driven output that can be trusted by business users for actions.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/threat-detection-in-a-mixed-identity-landscape-eic24"></a>

  <p>This is an implementation and enterprise change management story about how we moved Okta from a baseline of traditional MFA gating app/resources access to a far more dynamic &amp; secure app/resource access policy position using ZTA principles, passwordless, &amp; eventually, phishing resistance. It’s about cross-departmental partnership, iterative improvement, and performance benchmarking to deliver a data-driven transformation in our security posture in a short, yet realistic, time frame.</p>
<p>This session will show WHY and HOW we managed both the technical and cultural enterprise changes needed to make this a success, and provide attendees within all industries with ideas and examples they can take back to undertake iterative security improvement in their own organizations.</p>
<p>We will start by introducing Okta on Okta. OoO are the identity practitioners within Okta, and just like other EIC attendees, we have to deliver solutions to business identity challenges. Though we may wear “team colors,” we talk shop with the credibility that comes from having to actually implement, own, and iterate it - without the marketing mission to distract us.</p>
<p>We will highlight the status quo and the drivers for this change. We will then move on to the foundational work needed to overhaul our security signals and access policies based on said signals, including how we kept the enterprise from experiencing change &amp; security fatigue, how passwordless was a QoL feature to start, but evolved as the program did to emphasize phishing resistance as the real value. As the program went on, we began layering security feature after feature at sign-on time, including user behavior analysis, managed and BYOD device profiling and security signals, CrowdStrike signals, and more until organically we got to a place were we authenticate every user, every device, and constantly review and adjust our policies based on new security threats.</p>
<p>We will share the metrics on how we tracked our objectives, including auth metrics we tracked to know we were making an impact. We will share the business value impact as well in terms of UX, security hygiene, and worker hours saved - and emphasize this is how we kept exec attention on this program so it wouldn’t peter out. We will end by highlighting that our phishing-resistant journey is not “complete” until all aspects of the user’s identity lifecycle are secured with PR credentials, including onboarding, desktop sign-on, and credential recovery.</p>
<p>This is an implementation &amp; ent. change management story. It IS set w/in Okta &amp; executed by Okta employees, but this is not about the product- it is about the doers getting this done. This is a universally applicable story on passwordless as the first step toward the real goal of phishing resistance, and the iterative process toward ZTA using diverse identity &amp; security tooling signals.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/passwordless-phishing-resistance-eic24"></a>

  <p>In order for digital identity initiatives to be successful and sustainable, they have to place people and their societal values at the center of their architecture. This means following the principles of human-centered design, inclusion, privacy-by-design, and ethics while building easy-to-use systems that seamlessly enable access to services while combating fraud and theft. But what happens when these principles end up in conflict with each other? How do we, as identity practitioners, navigate the challenge of building for the world that people actually live in, not the one we wished they lived in - and the dilemmas that creates for us? In this talk, the presenter will lay out some of the trends and drivers he is seeing in global projects that surface these quandaries for which no blueprint currently exists. He will also describe some of the design debates that take place as a result between stakeholders, and detail possible approaches to tackle these issues when they inevitably land on your desk.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/human-centered-design-eic24"></a>

  <p>Maurice Ravel's Boléro is one of the world’s most well-known classical pieces, in part due to its simplicity: eighteen minutes of repeated rhythms and melodies make it easy to grasp.<br> <br> But in the midst of that clarity, Boléro holds demanding questions for the listener. Written in the aftermath of the First World War, it sees the dangers of automation and technology—and inquires if humanity can avoid being assimilated into the march of the machine. Ultimately, Boléro asks the hearer two questions: “What is authentic humanity?” and “Can authentic humanity survive the modern world?”<br> <br> These questions still resonate almost one hundred years later. The recent rise of automation in the form of generative AI shows great promise, but also presents similar challenges to 1928. The rush to adopt this new technology is eroding authenticity not just in biometric authentication and identity, but in writing, in art, and in other activities long thought to be the prerogative of humanity. In response, we must reexamine what it means to remain "authentically human" amidst the drumbeat of innovation.<br> <br> Through one person's experience in losing and recovering Boléro, we'll explore the questions that Ravel's masterpiece presents and propose ways in which identity can safeguard authentic humanity.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/recovering-bolero-and-the-death-of-authenticity-eic24"></a>

  <p>Identity verification is rapidly evolving, blending both federated systems and decentralized models to cater to diverse needs. However, this integration often presents challenges, including balancing ease of use with stringent security requirements. Many identity solutions provide seamless user experiences but fail to adequately address the complexities of identity security within hybrid environments. This talk will introduce the Hybrid Wallet, a pioneering approach by Digidentity that merges federated identity systems with decentralized technologies. We will explore how this hybrid model not only enhances user control and privacy but also ensures robust security across different digital landscapes.&nbsp;</p>

				  Add additional features to existing credential systems while preserving their original functionality with Indicio Proven.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>The emerging age of digital credentials will transform how we interact digitally, prove identity, and share data. The benefits will be reduced fraud and friction, increased data privacy and security, and the ability to create seamless processes based on data that can be instantly verified and acted on.</p>
<p>There are different kinds of credentials for different needs: some offer only basic authorization; others can manage the kind of data sharing and verification that are essential for business. The key is to be able to interoperate between the two, where a credential with limited features can be given a wrapper that preserves its original function while providing the advanced features of other credential types.</p>
<p>Enter Indicio Proven’s newest feature: a credential bridge. It’s a simple way to bridge the gap between limited and more advanced credential features and allow participation in multiple credential ecosystems.</p>
<p>For example, the Microsoft Entra Verified Identity Platform has basic features but is widely available. It only supports one credential type (JSON Web Token VC), and one DID method (DID: web); it doesn’t support OpenID4VCI (essential to interoperate with European Union’s preferred digital identity protocol), has limited digital wallet support (Microsoft Authenticator), limited governance capability, and doesn’t contain the privacy-preserving features of other verifiable credential types.</p>
<p>These features may not matter to some users, but, increasingly, we see enterprise and public sector organizations around the world opting for more expansive features to meet business, customer, and citizen needs. Why shut yourself out of these ecosystems?</p>
<p>Using Indicio Proven as your credential bridge, you don’t have to limit your options because it’s not a case of one or the other. Now, you can wrap an Entra identity in different credential formats, preserve the underlying capacity to verify it as an Entra identity, and take advantage of Indicio’s:</p>
 
 Support for additional DID methods 
 Selective disclosure, zero-knowledge proofs, and predicate proofs to share data in privacy-preserving ways. 
 Support for additional OIDC specs for interoperability with the EU. 
 Support for additional communication protocols such as DIDComm, which opens up the capacity of direct, secure communication between DID holders. 
 Enable use of peer DIDs for subjects, which improves security 
 Convert to additional credential types such AnonCreds, SD-JWT, BBS+, mDoc/mDL. 
 
<p>The point is — don’t get locked into a single path when the technology is advancing rapidly. It is highly unlikely that there will ever be a single credential format or protocol that does everything. So why not be able to use them all?</p>

<p>An explosion in new financial services experiences, powered by fintech apps for consumers and small businesses, has propelled the rise of open banking technology in the U.S. and around the world. Every player in the consumer finance arena must now rethink what is possible when consumers and small businesses have full control of their financial lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> (CFPB) is embracing this moment of innovation with the long-awaited Dodd-Frank Section 1033 open banking rule, which will accelerate the adoption of open banking technologies and protect consumer interests as we move further into the digital future. This proposed rule is set to be finalized in the second half of 2024. With decades of leadership in data responsibility, Mastercard’s principles align with the tenets of CFPB rulemaking and our role is to protect this data.</p>



<p>Mastercard has created this primer to outline the provisions of CFPB Section 1033 and explain how banks, fintechs and other holders of consumer financial data will be affected by the proposed rule. Read on to discover what CFPB rulemaking means for you — and how Mastercard equips customers to thrive in this new landscape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Index</p>



 
 <a>What is the CFPB</a>? 



 <a>What does the Dodd-Frank Act Section 1033 say about consumers’ rights to access financial data?</a> 



 <a>What is the CFPB’s role in Section 1033 rulemaking?</a> 



 <a>What parties are impacted by the CFPB Section 1033?</a> 



 <a>How does the proposed rulemaking impact personal financial data rights?</a> 



 <a>What types of data are covered by the CFPB open banking rule?&nbsp;</a> 



 <a>When does the open banking regulation take effect?&nbsp;</a> 



 <a>How can Mastercard help?&nbsp;</a> 



 <a>Where can I learn more?</a><br><br> 
 



 What is the CFPB?&nbsp; 



<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is an independent agency of the United States federal government, established in the wake of the 2007-2008 financial crisis to protect consumers’ interests in financial markets and promote long-term stability in the broader economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CFPB was created under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, better known as Dodd-Frank, to provide a single point of accountability for protecting consumers from unfair, deceptive or abusive financial practices and to taking action against companies that break the law.&nbsp;<br></p>



 What does the Dodd-Frank Act Section 1033 say about consumers’ rights to access financial data?&nbsp; 



<p>Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act establishes consumers’ right to access financial data associated with the financial products and services they use, such as credit cards, deposits and savings accounts.&nbsp; This data includes account details, transactions, balances and more (see “<a>What types of data are covered by the CFPB open banking rule?</a>” below), and is subject to rules put forward by the CFPB.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>



 What is the CFPB’s role in Section 1033 rulemaking?&nbsp; 



<p>Section 1033 gives the CFPB authority to issue rules governing personal financial data rights.&nbsp; The CFPB has been working toward implementing this rulemaking since 2016.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some key milestones include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 publishing a set of consumer protection principles (2017)&nbsp; 



 holding a symposium on consumer access to financial records (2020)&nbsp; 



 releasing detailed documentation of rulemaking proposals and alternatives under consideration (2022)&nbsp; 



 convening a Small Business Review Panel and issuing a report of its findings (2023)&nbsp; 
 



<p>In October 2023, the bureau released its proposed rule and opened a period of public comment through December 29, 2023. Since then, the CFPB has been working to finalize the written regulations. Once it takes effect, the proposed rule will serve as implementation of Dodd-Frank Section 1033.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>



 What parties are impacted by the CFPB Section 1033?&nbsp; 



 
 Data providers – financial institutions and&nbsp;some payment facilitators 



 Third-party data recipients – fintechs and financial institutions acting on consumers’ behalf as data recipients and data aggregators acting on their behalf 



 Qualified industry standard-setting bodies – CFPB-recognized issuers of fair, open, and inclusive industry standards<br> 
 



 How does the proposed rulemaking impact personal financial data rights?&nbsp; 



<p>Broadly speaking, the CFPB open banking rule is a framework of regulations and industry standards that provides consumers with ownership and rights to control their financial data; enhanced consumer protections; and consistency in how data can be accessed and used.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CFPB proposal will require financial institutions and some payment facilitators to make financial data available to consumers and authorized third-party data recipients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The proposed rule also:&nbsp;</p>



 
 outlines obligations and limitations for how companies must collect, use and store consumer data&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 requires banks to share data in a standardized format via safe and secure application programming interfaces (APIs)&nbsp; 



 seeks to empower consumers with their financial data&nbsp; 



 enables better access to financial products&nbsp; 



 and jump-starts competition between banks of all sizes, fintechs and other digital players&nbsp;<br> 
 



 What types of data are covered by the CFPB open banking rule?&nbsp; 



 
 Transaction information, including amounts, dates, payees, historical data, and fees.&nbsp; 



 Account balances&nbsp; 



 Account and routing numbers, both tokenized and non-tokenized&nbsp; 



 Terms and conditions, including fee schedules, rates, rewards terms and overdraft coverage&nbsp; 



 Information on upcoming bills, such as minimum payment amounts 



 Basic account verification information, including names, mailing addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers.&nbsp;<br> 
 



 When does the open banking regulation take effect?&nbsp; 



<p>While the CFPB hasn’t given an exact date, it has indicated that it will finalize the proposed rule toward the end of 2024, with a tiered compliance timeline to follow, which makes it even more important that financial service providers are prepared for the change.&nbsp;</p>



 
 First, the CFPB must finalize the rulemaking.&nbsp;
 
 While the bureau hasn’t given an exact date, CFPB Section 1033 is expected to be finalized in the second half of 2024, most likely in the fall.&nbsp; 
 
 



 Third parties must comply within 60 days.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 For consumer-authorized third parties, the CFPB proposed rule becomes effective 60 days from the date of the final rulemaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 
 The proposed timeline for complying with the CFPB rule varies based on the size of the financial institution. Banks and other institutions that hold deposits will have between six months and four years to comply, based on their assets. Non-deposit institutions will have six or 12 months, depending on annual revenue. The CFPB has detailed this tiered approach as follows:&nbsp;

 <br>How can Mastercard help?&nbsp; 



<p>At Mastercard, we believe that consumers own their financial data; they should be in control of how and by whom it is used and should benefit from its use. Mastercard’s role is to protect this data and help data providers do the same. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The CFPB proposed rule calls for secure permissioned data-sharing across developer interfaces, or APIs. Navigating this compliance is going to be complex, as financial institutions must decide to build APIs on their legacy infrastructure or outsource, as well as addressing other areas, including but not limited to consent management, info security, and third-party risk management.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Bug bounty programs are sometimes viewed with a negative connotation for a variety of reasons. This post aims to overcome implementation obstacles by debunking those misconceptions, and providing recommendations for organizations as they embark on the bug bounty journey.</p> 
 What Is a Bug Bounty Program?  
<p>First a quick definition. A bug bounty program is a security scheme offered by many websites, organizations, and software developers where individuals are paid to find security vulnerabilities. These programs incentivize independent security researchers and ethical hackers to discover and report potential flaws, making the technology more secure and reducing breach risk. So why don’t more companies have them?&nbsp;</p> 
 Common Objections to Bug Bounty Programs  
<p>I’ve been involved in a few companies where bug bounty programs were generally perceived negatively. Colleagues gave a number of reasons for not implementing a bug bounty program. These included:</p> 
  
  Too expensive  
  Takes several months before seeing results  
  It’s hard to manage and is extremely time-consuming  
  Researchers can be hostile  
  Quality of findings can be inadequate  
  
<p>However, I’ve been fully managing a bug bounty program for more than two years now and I can attest that these concerns are essentially baseless.&nbsp;</p> 
 Financial Concerns  
<p>The financial concern is misplaced since it’s significantly cheaper to find a critical vulnerability by doing a routine penetration test, or through a controlled bug bounty program, than if one of your customers discovers that vulnerability and demands a fix as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The consequences of customers and prospects finding security issues in an application can range from reduced confidence in your product, to actually losing an opportunity because the prospect considers the application insecure. This is far more expensive than the average bug bounty program. Not to mention the financial consequences of an actual security breach caused by a vulnerability.</p> 
 Results Timeline&nbsp;  
<p>Results can be obtained almost instantly. The researchers are usually highly motivated and working across multiple different time zones. Moreover, unlike penetration testing programs, which usually take place at specific points in time, bug bounty researchers test continuously. This allows you to constantly have an up-to-date understanding of your risk.</p> 
 Management and Scope  
<p>Bug bounty partner/platforms aid significantly when it comes to program management.</p> 
<p>Organizations hesitant to implement a bug bounty program can start by setting a private program that provides access to only a limited number of researchers. This gives organizations more control over the program and limits the number of reports they receive. A private program helps address concerns both about an overwhelming influx of reports and the cost of bug bounty rewards.</p> 
<p>Organizations can include production assets in the scope of their programs by disallowing certain types of testing. Common exclusions include denial of service attacks, social engineering, self-inflicting vulnerabilities, etc.</p> 
 Submissions Management  
<p>This is a more extensive topic that we will be covering in a future post, along with guidance on managing inadequate findings and researchers.</p> 
 Suggestions To Get Started  
 Preparing the Test Environment  
<p>For smaller organizations, it is usually easier to run a bug bounty program when the company only has one main core product or a limited number of offers. For larger companies that have hundreds of applications and thousands of endpoints, providing full access for testers can become a challenge.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Ideally, a new test environment that researchers can freely use to run all the needed tests will be provided. If this is not possible, most companies already have a testing environment without any real data, which can be used for providing access to researchers.</p> 
 Including Production Assets  
<p>It is recommended to include all production assets in scope for a bug bounty program, otherwise companies will likely miss vulnerabilities that are only applicable to production applications and configurations. This doesn’t necessarily mean encouraging load testing in production, rather, if somebody finds an issue in production, it must be rewarded.</p> 
<p>For example, wouldn't you like to know if a person with limited resources and an open source web scanner were able to bring down an entire production environment? That’s certainly something I’d like to fix if it happened.</p> 
<p>HYPR has made significant performance improvements by analyzing the scan patterns that researchers performed in production assets. Furthermore, even if these assets are not included under the scope, there’s usually nothing stopping actors on the internet from scanning assets that require authentication.</p> 
 Final Recommendations  
  
  Use an existing platform: Implementing a bug bounty program can be challenging and there are many recommended bug bounty platforms that can help your organization get started in no time, and they handle all the communications, accounts, payouts (especially international payments), etc.&nbsp;  
  Start with a private program: A private program will limit the amount of researchers and initial time invested.  
  Implement guardrails: If there are some assets/domains/vulnerabilities that shouldn’t be included, these can be marked as out of scope.  
  Define payouts: Bounties are a great way to motivate researchers to participate in a program. Consider increasing the bounties whenever possible — use other bug bounty participating companies in your space for guidance.  
  Include all assets in scope: Production-like environments can be added instead of production if there are concerns.

<p>Healthcare technology is rapidly evolving and digital healthcare is now the norm. In order to deliver healthcare online, payer and provider organizations need the ability to securely and seamlessly share member and patient data across their various digital healthcare systems. Interoperability and modern identity and access management (IAM) are what make this happen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2016, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology’s (ONC) 21st Century Cures Act Final Rule was enacted. A significant component of the ONC’s Cures Act is its focus on interoperability. Electronic Medical Record (EMR)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complying with the Cures Act for interoperability requires the use of two standards:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <p>&nbsp;SMART Health IT’s Substitutable Medical Applications Reusable Technologies (SMART) standard</p>
 
 <p>HL7’s Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard,&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together, these two standards are what’s known as SMART on FHIR.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the ONC’s Rule and SMART on FHIR the stage is set for a more connected, efficient, and patient-centric healthcare system where clinical data can be more readily shared and accessed by healthcare providers, payers, consumers, and app developers alike.​</p>

  <p>"The AI Pivot" session at EIC 2024 offers a deep dive into the transformative journey from traditional product- and vendor-centric (digital) business models to robust, networked and agents based platform ecosystems in the AI-driven digital landscape. This transition marks a critical inflection point, heralding a new era where the confluence of technology, data, privacy and network effects reshapes industry paradigms and redefines the way we interact with the world.</p>
<p>12 years ago, KuppingerCole launched a Research Note decribing "Life Management Platforms" (LMP) as user-centric tools to support every-day tasks such as storage for sensitive documents and information, personal finance, investment and insurance management with high privacy and security standards. LMPs by definition were able to manage permissions and gave users control over their information sharing.</p>
<p>Since then, a number of such platforms were launched by different vendors and organizations covering parts or the whole set of features described in KuppingerCole´s research. Meeco has been and still is one of the first vendors of LMPs with a focus on financial applications.</p>
<p>A lot has changed since release of the KuppingerCole LMP paper: Decentralized Identity, Gen AI, Wallets, GDPR, eIDAS (2)... and more technologies, standards, governance frameworks and legislation came up since then and is about time to rewrite this profound part of research in the area of human-digital interaction.</p>
<p>Today we describe the former LMP concept as multi-agent based life management ecosystems that help us humans in all aspects of our daily life. They store our documents, buy our food online, navigate our vehicle, help us reducing the our CO2 footprint to a minimum, help us to stay healthy and to get wealthy, be productive at work or in school, manage our calendars propose holiday destinations and make appointments. We talk about agents we let do things for us within such Life Management Ecosystems in a privacy-by-design, secure by default, decentralized, vendor agnostic way. Globally.</p>
 A rough description of such an Ecosystem: 
 Decentralized and Self-Sovereign 
<p>Decentralization is a key aspect of these ecosystems, ensuring that no single entity has control over the entire system. This is achieved through the use of multi-agent systems, where multiple autonomous entities (agents) interact with each other to achieve their goals<br>These agents can share resources, including knowledge, information, contracts, trust, benefits, and goals<br>Self-sovereignty is another important aspect, where individuals have control over their own data. This is in line with the privacy-by-design principle, which ensures that privacy considerations and protections are embedded into the design and operation of the system</p>
 Multi-Agent AI and Edge AI 
<p>Multi-agent AI systems are used to simulate the simultaneous operations and interactions of multiple agents in an attempt to recreate and predict complex phenomena<br>These systems are used in many scientific domains including biology, ecology, and social science<br>Edge AI refers to the process of moving AI algorithms from the cloud and implementing them locally on a hardware device. The algorithms are run locally on the hardware device, allowing for real-time processing and decision-making, which is crucial for many applications in a life management ecosystem.</p>
 Wallets 
<p>(Global) Wallets are digital wallets that allow users to store and manage their digital identities, assets, and data. These wallets are designed to be secure and privacy-preserving, aligning with the principles of privacy-by-design and secure by default.</p>
 Privacy-by-Design 
<p>Privacy-by-design is a principle that ensures privacy is seamlessly integrated into products, services, and system designs by default<br>It promotes transparency about data usage, fostering accountability for how user data is collected, processed, and stored<br>This approach aligns with ethical principles by respecting user autonomy and promoting responsible data usage</p>
 Secure by Default 
<p>Secure by default means that products are resilient against prevalent exploitation techniques out of the box without added charge<br>These products protect against the most prevalent threats and vulnerabilities without end-users having to take additional steps to secure them<br>Vendor Agnostic<br>Being vendor agnostic means that the ecosystem is designed to work with technologies and applications from any vendor<br>This ensures interoperability, where multiple departments, systems, technologies, and applications work together for the same goal</p>
 eIDAS 2 Compliance 
<p>eIDAS 2 is a set of regulations in the European Union that govern electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions. Compliance with eIDAS 2 ensures that the ecosystem adheres to the highest standards of security, privacy, and trust.</p>
<p>In conclusion, a multi-agent based life management ecosystem leverages a combination of advanced technologies and robust governance principles to provide a secure, privacy-preserving, and efficient system that can assist humans in various aspects of their daily life.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/the-ai-pivot-eic24"></a>

  <p>With the European Blockchain Service Infrastructure (EBSI) the European Union established an European DLT-infrastructure provided by the Member States. This means that the DLT nodes are in the responsibility of the Member States and so ensure a government trust anchor Since EBSI contains own governance and technical specifications together with conformance tests for wallet it provides a comprehensive framework for decentralized digital identities in Europe. EBSI is widely for use cases in education, public sector or traceability and with the eIDAS Bridge already useable within the eIDAS ecosystem.<br> As eIDAS 2.0 is technology neutral it provides the possibility to use the technical advantages of EBSI like distribution, crypto agility or performance (in comparison to existing TrustLists) on EUDI Alle,t QEAA but also trusted issuer registries, existing interoperability on decentralized identities based on established standards like W3CVC Data Model, ETSI ESI (especially reg. digital signatures as thexy are required for QEAA acc. eIDAS 2.0) also in eIDAS 2.0. As eIDAS 2.0 is not built on a green field EBSI also supports wide adoption of EUDI Wallet and related (qualified) trust services, as EBSI is already established infrastructure in Europe <br> With Section 11 the eIDAS 2.0 on the other hand introduce a dedicate qualified trust service for Electronic Ledger. This allows the provision of EBSI by fully liable QTSP under eIDAS 2.0 and allows the broad utilization of DLT for use cases like supply chain &amp; digital product passport (acc. EU Supply Chain Act), Organizational Digital Identity, Social Security, secure Data sharing etc. Within EBSI-VECTOR and EBSI-TRACE4EU more than 80 partners from all member states work on the establishment of a real decentralized and distributed ecosystem using EBSI as common infrastructure in Europe.<br><br> The session focus on the role of EBSI in the eIDAS 2.0 ecosystem so:</p>
 
 Legal Framework for EBSI within eIDAS 2.0 
 Needs on Governance in EBSI for adoption of eIDAS 2.0

  <p>SAML and OpenID started with a simple model of bilateral trust. Relying Parties register with Identity Providers and exchange trust information so that the RP can know that they are talking to Microsoft, Google, Facebook etc. We have also had Smart Cards (PIV/CAC) for authentication based on a certificate signed by someone that chains back to a known trusted root. The smart card approach avoids the RP needing to register but has significant user privacy issues. The research and education communities have long understood the scalability issues with these approaches. This led to the development of SAML2 and SAML metadata being used to represent more complicated trust relationships, where a single RP may allow identities from hundreds of Identity providers without needing to set up bilateral relationships.&nbsp;<br> <br> We are now entering a new world of Identity Wallets that look a lot more like multilateral federations than a simple one-to-one relationship. For these sorts of credentials to be scalable, we need to represent how a RP/Verifier can be part of perhaps hundreds of overlapping trust groupings.

  <p>As more governments promote online access and issue digital identity credentials for their populations, questions arise regarding just how portable those credentials are from one country to the next. While the EU has the benefit of eIDAS 2.0, other countries and regions still struggle with how to take advantage of digital identity credentials issued outside their borders. The challenges go beyond technical standards: it's not just about the structure of the data, it's also about how that data is verified, what level of assurance is offered, privacy considerations, and more. <br> <br> Making digital identity globally interoperable is a fundamental necessity for everything from education to finance and trade. It is the basis for social and financial inclusion as humans move around the world This session will review where efforts are underway to improve the global interoperability of identity and where there are still gaps, both in policy and technology, that need attention.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/global-interoperability-of-digital-identity-eic24"></a>

  <p>OIX has analysed eight Digital ID trust frameworks: US, Canada, EU, UK, Singapore, Thailand, MOSIP and Bank ID Sweden. The goal was to see if their policies could be expressed in a consistent way to enable interoperability of IDs across these eco-systems. The analysis found they share 75 common policy rule characteristics with 283 possible values. This is the DNA of Digital ID: trust frameworks are the same species but address the policy issues using a varied characteristics to meet local approaches to privacy, risk, security, and identity assurance. Our conclusion is that convergence of frameworks to a common set of policy criteria is unlikely, as they are necessarily different. Therefore, we have created a tool to allow policy criteria to be expressed and exchanged between trust frameworks and other parties.</p>
<p>This session will share:</p>
 
 An overview of our analysis of the eight trust frameworks 
 The contents of the DNA of Digital ID open criteria exchange framework 
 How the policy criteria will be used in a mixture of ‘static’ and ‘dynamic’ decision 
processes to enable roaming wallets
 How dynamic level of assurance assessments can be made. 
 A demo of a wallet adapting as it roams from framework to framework.

The “traditional way” of dealing with shadow admins is mapping all of them and letting the identity team decide what to do with it. This approach can work only if the number of shadow admins is small, however, our research, that is based on data of more than 50 organizations, reveals that in most of the big organizations there are hundreds of shadow admins and sometimes even more.<br><br>We will present a novel method that not only finds the shadow admins, but also recommends the identity team which permissions should be revoked to mitigate as many shadow admins as possible. For instance, we discovered that in most organizations more than 70% of the shadow admins can be resolved by revoking one single permission. Our method is based on algorithmic tools and AI. We will share the core concepts of it and show a few real-life examples.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ai-based-approach-shadow-admins-eic24"></a>

Luckily, AWS provides a very detailed and granular model of roles and predefined policies to define who (or which entity) may be granted to access to which object. All done - right? Unfortunately, either through lack of insight to actual role entitlements or by large number of relations, control over the infrastructure is easily lost.

  <p>In today's cybersecurity landscape, organizations are increasingly recognizing the importance of implementing robust Privileged Access Management (PAM) programs. This recognition is primarily driven by regulatory requirements and the growing pressure from malicious actors. However, despite the availability of mature baseline capabilities for PAM products in the market, the implementation of privileged access often falls behind leading practices in typical organizations.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will explore the world of PAM design patterns and anti-patterns, with a specific focus on major use cases. We will explore typical patterns such as isolating accounts, systems, credentials, and networks. Additionally, we will discuss the various options available for defining privileged assets and access, as well as the potential for running Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) projects in parallel with PAM.</p>
<p>A fundamental aspect to consider is the concept of tier models and security domains. We will explore the role of different intermediaries, including Jump Hosts, Privileged Access Workstations (PAWs), and Agents, and their varying security properties.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we will address the often overlooked aspect of managing Secure Shell (SSH) keys within PAM. Lastly, we will touch upon the importance of having robust procedures in place to handle critical situations in emergency mode.</p>
<p>By understanding these PAM design patterns, organizations can assess their current practices and identify areas for improvement. This talk aims to provide valuable insights and practical guidance for organizations seeking to enhance their PAM programs and align with leading industry practices.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/pam-design-patterns-eic24"></a>

How can we ensure digital identities are interoperable across borders? What do we need the G20 to do to help accelerate the work already underway? <br> <br> This MasterClass is will engage in these questions and more in the context of the Sustainable &amp; Interoperable Digital Identity (SIDI Hub) effort “to define what we need to achieve global interoperability for digital identity.” The SIDI Hub builds upon the OECD Recommendations on the Governance of Digital Identity (38 country adherents), and the “Human-Centric Digital Identity” whitepaper (cobranded by 13 non-profits). The first SIDI Summit was held last November, and convened experts from 21 non-profits, 22 countries, and 4 multilateral organizations (OECD, UN, World Bank, EU), to discuss whether to pursue interoperable digital identity, and if so how to achieve it? The findings of the first event were clear… 92% of attendees agreeing to continue the work in 2024, and the group achieved initial consensus on the tactics that can help the global community achieve digital identity interoperability in practice. <br> <br> During the MasterClass, participants will be asked to take part in an interactive survey. This data will be used to inform the SIDI Hub approach in 2024, and the G20 discussions.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/prepare-for-g20-eic24"></a>

  <p>eBay is a global marketplace that empowers hundreds of millions of buyers and sellers in more than 190 markets around the world, trading articles worth around 90 billion dollars every year. We provide new financial services to our sellers, such as keeping funds in the users' accounts for reusing them on eBay to purchase items or to buy shipping labels. In order to secure the accounts of our European sellers and to be compliant with the PSD2 regulation, eBay requires sellers in the EU and UK to use two-factor authentication on our marketplace. This talk describes the journey of eBay offering various two-factor authentications to our millions of users. In particular, eBay was among the first large tech companies offering FIDO2 passkey authentication. We also authenticate access to regulated APIs via eIDAS certificates for licensed third-party providers, as well as protect other sensitive APIs via digital signatures over the payload.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/ebays-identity-journey-eic24"></a>

  <p>Bots are a scourge on customer identity and access management systems before, during and after the login process. How can we use the power of AI to find malicious bots and protect users while minimizing friction? This session presents real-life examples of bot attacks, AI-based bot mitigation techniques, quantifies their efficacy, and explores what's next for AI in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>AI Chatbots can do your homework, but can they safeguard your users while ensuring a seamless user experience? During this session, we share our firsthand experiences in creating AI controls that strike a balance between robust user protection and minimal user friction.</p>
<p>First, you must know your enemy. Our session will provide a comprehensive perspective from the vantage point of a Customer Identity Access Management (CIAM) provider: geographical origins of bots, the networks they exploit, their targets (based on factors such as enterprise size and industry), their tactics to achieve their primary objectives, often revolving around financial gains.</p>
<p>With the backdrop of these threat actors' attempts to exploit CIAM systems, we compare three distinct approaches: a no-control baseline, rule-based controls, and AI-based controls.</p>
<p>AI-driven defenses demonstrate significant improvement from the rule-based baseline systems. Furthermore, an unexpected byproduct of a performing adaptive system like this one, is its quantifiable deterrent effect on bots (Like a lock on a bike, bots are deterred to easier targets).</p>
<p>But are AI-based bot mitigation techniques able to maintain a seamless user experience? The diminution of bot traffic has measurable advantages (more precise modeling of ‘normal’ traffic, ability to see higher quality/lower volume attacks), but AI-systems are probabilistic and cannot be perfect. False Positive Rates (How many humans are challenged by the security control) are a concern for many customers. We discuss tools and recommendations for customer-driven adjustment of risk/friction ratio. We wrap up this section with lessons learned from our journey implementing AI technology in protecting users.</p>
<p>We believe that AI controls will continue to improve user security while simultaneously minimizing friction for users. Then, what is the next challenge for AI-systems in CIAM? Our position is that upcoming challenges will demand paying attention to explainability, privacy and compliance. We are at the dawn of legislation on data privacy and ethics of AI systems, and AI-systems will need to be adequately explainable (deep neural networks aren’t, nor are LLMs) to meet compliance standards. Next year’s security systems will have to balance a third weight in the equation: Security vs Friction vs Explainability.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/minimizing-friction-with-ai-eic24"></a>

  <p>The next frontier of customer identity lies not in simply knowing who someone is, but in what they are allowed to do. This is more important than ever in the financial services industry, as the proposed Payment Services Directive 3 (PSD3) framework creates further opportunities to deliver highly personalised, secure, and scalable data-driven services through Open Banking. At the same time, customers are pushing their providers to give them the tools needed to delegate control of their finances to trusted persons, while doing more to secure their accounts against fraud.<br><br>The good news is that Dynamic Authorisation is purpose-built to address these industry problems. By centralising authorisation decisioning and enforcement, financial service providers can streamline authorisation workflows, ensure consistent and secure data sharing with third-party providers, improve loyalty and reduce fraud – all in one. Policy-based authorisation takes this even further by enabling dynamic rules that adapt to real-time context and risk factors.<br><br>Join authorisation experts Adam Rusbridge and Adam Preis of Ping Identity to learn how Dynamic Authorization can enable:<br><br></p>
 
 Fine-grained control: Define and enforce access controls for payments, transfers, account settings and data requests, minimising security risks and regulatory compliance headaches. 
 Enhanced user experience: Streamline API interactions and reduce friction for TPPs, accelerating Open Banking and Open Finance investments. 
 Data monetisation: Leverage granular control over data access opens doors for innovative data-driven services and revenue streams. 
 Agility and scalability: Respond swiftly to changing market needs and regulatory landscapes with adaptable authorisation policies.

However, it has historically been difficult to meet very high security and interoperability requirements when using OAuth. Daniel and Joseph have spent much of the last six years working to improve the state of the art and will present the latest developments in the field.<br> <br> There are challenges when trying to achieve high security and interoperability with OAuth 2: There are many potential threats, some not part of the original OAuth threat model. For seamless authorizations, optionality must be minimized in OAuth itself and also in any extensions used.<br> <br> Seven years ago, the IETF OAuth working group began work on the Security Best Current Practice document and more recently on OAuth 2.1. Meanwhile, the OpenID Foundation has created FAPI1 and FAPI2 security profiles.<br> <br> We will help you understand the focus of each document and when to use which. We show how to achieve on-the-wire interoperability and security using techniques like asymmetric client authentication and sender-constraining via DPoP and MTLS, discussing the benefits and potential disadvantages of each.

  <p>Deploying national federations is a complex task, requiring the integration of various protocols to build a secure, reliable, scalable, and interoperable ecosystem. This session will focus on the Italian experience in the design and deployment of national digital identity systems, SPID and CIE id, using OpenID Federation and OpenID Connect.</p>
<p>The discussion will delve into the Italian implementation profile of OpenID Federation and the onboarding system highlighting the challenges encountered during the deployment of these national federations, the solutions implemented, and the lessons learned in the process.</p>
<p>The aim is to share insights and practical knowledge that can guide other nations and organizations in their journey toward deploying their own national federations using similar federation protocols.</p>
<p>We are excited about the possibility of contributing to EIC and look forward to the opportunity to share our knowledge with fellow professionals from around the globe.

   Traditional federation agreements are relatively static. It takes some effort to onboard an IdP and RP to each other, but once that trust is established, it's good until some exceptional event breaks the federation.

  <p>Traditional federation agreements are relatively static. It takes some effort to onboard an IdP and RP to each other, but once that trust is established, it's good until some exceptional event breaks the federation.<br> <br> But what about a more dynamic world, one where trust comes and goes based on context? What if users could be provisioned dynamically into a space based on trust from elsewhere? What if an isolated space could still function in a disconnected state and still have powerful security properties? What if these isolated spaces could reconnect to the network and provide audit capabilities and security signaling to other components throughout the wide ecosystem? And what if all of this could be built on a layer of trusted software that didn't rely on pre-placing keys or accounts ahead of time?<br> <br> This isn't addressed by only using local accounts, or creating and distributing shards of a global truth. We need a world that expects things to move.<br> <br> Come to this talk to learn about Federation Bubbles, the proof of concept being built out on top of a suite of technology including OpenID Connect, OAuth, SPIFFE, Verifiable Credentials, and more.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/federation-bubbles-eic24"></a>

  <p>Starting from October 2024, all companies with critical infrastructure are mandated to grant access to their IT systems to customers and employees solely through secure multi-factor authentication. This requirement poses a significant challenge for businesses, especially in maintaining customer conversion rates. Implementing this regulatory obligation by adding a second factor (e.g., one-time password via SMS, email, or a separate authenticator app) incurs additional efforts for users and extra costs for companies.</p>
<p>Solution: PwC introduces the One-Click Login approach, a method that transitions existing authentication mechanisms, based solely on usernames and passwords, to a passwordless approach with an additional factor. Through a white-label SDK, which can be integrated into mobile customer and employee apps, the login process is simplified for the user to a single click by utilizing biometrics and device binding. The presentation will detail the necessary onboarding process and the integration with an existing IAM system, using the Ping Identity Suite (formerly Forgerock) as an example. It emphasizes simplifying the user flow and showcasing the advantages for businesses compared to other multi-factor authentication solutions.</p>
<p>Further Use: By linking the white-label SDK with an integrated wallet function, this use case also demonstrates how wallet-based solutions already provide value to businesses and users today (before the introduction of the EUDI Wallet). The presentation will further explore how additional attributes can be incorporated into the mobile wallet for use in single sign-on across various systems.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/mfa-according-to-nis2-eic24"></a>

  <p>What differentiates a digital identity wallet system from the currently widely deployed federated identity system is users' ability to be able to present attributes about themselves directly to the service provider, instead of being redirected to the Identity Provider who attests attributes about the users on their behalf. Anticipated advantages of digital identity wallets include, businesses can hope to lower their COGS by being able to perform user identification cheaper and faster, and users can hope to have a more seamless digital experience where they can more granularly control their digital personas.</p>
<p>The industry has come a long way understanding what it takes to build scalable and interoperable digital identity wallet systems. However, the work to make these wallets mainstream, where an ordinary user enjoys using the wallet and feels its benefits, remains.</p>
<p>This talk would discuss three key aspects needed to "cross the chasm": 1) build rails that issuers, wallets and verifiers can use to establish trust in each other; 2) agree on the incremental approach, agree on an 'initial' set of interoperable standards and stop pulling in multiple directions; 3) focus on a minimum set of wallet functions that users can easily understand the benefit and usability of.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/digital-identity-wallets-mainstream-eic24"></a>

  <p>There are serious challenges with our IAM environments. Year after year, we see identity-related attacks resulting in major breaches.</p>
<p>Technical baggage and assumptions from our past are holding us back. Zero Trust, rightly, advises us to verify trust again, and again. But, with current tools, this can be painful. To shore up weaker authentication systems, we sacrifice MFA user experience on the altar of security – mitigating newer attacks, but chipping away at workforce morale and productivity in the process. Passkeys are starting to help, but they're only the beginning; not the destination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can do better. We must do better. The IAM paradigm is already starting to shift.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this thought-provoking keynote address, Josh Green will dive deep into the chasm that separates our current IAM environments from our ideal. With a blend of realism and optimism, Green will unveil the painful pitfalls that bedevil our present systems, delineate actionable strategies we can deploy to fortify our defenses today, and chart a visionary course towards a future where robust identity security is not only viable, but pervasive.&nbsp;</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/future-of-iam-eic24"></a>

 need relevancy and clear value. A clear statement of benefits to win over the priorities of other stakeholders. 
 want to solve problems, not focus on technology components. Digital ID is a component not the outcome. 
 get confused and disengaged by jargon. 
 are aware of their social responsibilities and see digital ID as a way that these may be addressed. 
 see weakness and disconnected eco-system thinking. There’s much divergent thinking in the market at the moment which causes confusion and uncertainty. 
 want to know that their regulatory or industry body approves the use of digital identity.

  <p>In the realm of identity management within zero trust security frameworks, the "never trust, always verify" paradigm is critical. This approach, a departure from traditional IT security models, assumes no inherent trust in users, devices, or networks, regardless of their location or origin. It emphasizes continuous verification and authentication, fundamentally changing the way access and credentials are managed. <br> <br> In this context, the role of signature schemes in credential issuance is critical. Traditional methods that rely on a single issuing instance are incompatible with the Zero Trust philosophy. To align with this approach, threshold signature schemes become indispensable. These schemes distribute the responsibility of credential issuance across multiple parties (or isolated systems within a domain), thereby eliminating single points of failure in the process. <br> <br> The prominent BBS+ signature scheme stands out in this distributed approach. On the one hand, it offers compatibility with various zero-knowledge proof schemes, and on the other hand, it allows credential holders to selectively disclose certain attributes, thereby strengthening both privacy and security in line with zero-trust principles. However, when adapting schemes like BBS+ to a threshold setting, a key challenge arises: the issuance process becomes highly interactive, requiring continuous communication between all issuers during signing. This interaction creates bottlenecks for systems that need to issue large numbers of credentials and introduces potential security risks by providing additional attack vectors. <br> <br> To overcome these challenges, recent advances in the form of so-called "Pseudorandom Correlation Generators" offer an interesting approach. By facilitating a pre-processing phase, this new cryptographic primitive enables non-interactive credential issuance by schemes such as BBS+, eliminating the need for per-credential issuer communication. This development dramatically reduces communication overhead while ensuring complete isolation between issuing instances. <br> <br> This talk will provide a high-level overview of these advances and their implications for credential issuance in zero-trust environments, highlighting how they can potentially improve the security and efficiency of digital identity management systems.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/threshold-signature-schemes-eic24"></a>

  <p>Contemporary institutions and record keeping systems using paper co-arose. Institutions created systems to track interactions with people over time, creating a form of institutional memory by using a range of paper-based technologies such as file record keeping and index card systems. Over the last 60 years, digital identity systems have emerged and continue to improve, thus accelerating the capacity of organizations to form institutional memories. Now we have the emergence of AI and machine learning that will advance this further - making super institutional memory. <br> <br> This session explores a reframe of seeing digital identity systems as institutional memory and considers re-framing the question as how good we want institutional memory to be when building identity systems. This could be a resolution to the race between companies, partially driven by surveillance capitalism, to collect data and regulatory bodies imposing laws and regulations on data collection in the name of “privacy”, some of which have not adjusted for new technology. These two drives are inherently in tension with each other. <br> <br> Asking "how good should institutional memory be'' transcends these two different drives and shifts the challenge of data collection out of a "corporate alone" decision or responsibility. It also invites a broader conversation with the public who interact with institutions and policy makers that regulate them. The answers to this question may be different for different types of institutions, but they can create new norms that bring different sides together to figure out how things should work and understand trade-offs and limits in new technologies such as decentralized identity.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/identity-systems-as-institutional-memory-eic24"></a>

<p>In a modern Zero Trust based IT architecture, the IDP is one of the most central components and therefore one of the most critical ones.</p>
<p>As all the requests within the network need to be authenticated, its robustness directly correlates with the overall integrity and continuity of digital and therefore-business operations.</p>
<p>Not only the availability but also low latency is key in global distributed ecosystems.</p>
<p>As experience has shown, one hyperscaler can’t guarantee this high demand in availability on its own.</p>
<p>To fulfill all these needs from businesses, applications and corporate we – together with our partners – came up with an multi region - multi hyperscaler architecture.</p>
<p>This talk will provide insight into the design, benefits, and drawbacks as well as&nbsp;the journey we have taken to reach this goal.</p>

  <p>Non-human identities are getting more and more important. IAM has the challenge to manage them with the same standards as human identities. Over the last years many tools and best practices have been developed to improve the situation. However, the more those identities mimic behavior of humans the harder current concepts work without reducing security and governance. An example is Robot Process Automation (RPA), which aims to automate processes done by humans, often for application which do not offer APIs. Subsequently those tools are using UI automation to achieve this goal. However, zero trust and identity controls like MFA or least privilege will interrupt this business processes automation.

The correct balance between these factors brings peace of mind and enablement to the business. Hear some highlights of If P&amp;C Insurance's journey of defining and enforcing a Level of Assurance aligned with realities of insurance enterprise.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/a-foundation-for-proper-ciam-eic24"></a>

<p>In this session, we will consider the ways in which AI will affect the subset of human interactions associated with financial transactions. The reliability and predictability that is required of systems operating in the general area of “finance,” and the large scales over which it is conducted, depend heavily on more formal, objectively measurable system performance parameters than is the case in many other domains of human behavior.</p>
<p>In the 20 minute presentation by James Garza, the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) in finance will be discussed, particularly focusing on quantitative analysis and reinforcement learning, a subset of AI. Reinforcement learning can be more consistent than human traders, and this reliability allows for consistent and stable returns. Furthermore, reinforcement learning’s ability to rapidly process vast amounts of data helps identify patterns and insights humans might miss. Reinforcement Learning operates as a decision-making agent, learning from the consequences of its actions to maximise long-term rewards while minimising risks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI-powered information elements introduce both helpful and potentially harmful variables into the financial space. Also, the ways in which AI is integrated into finance can offer reproducible patterns for AI implementation in other domains, as well as lessons to be learned about potential system harms.</p>
<p>The session will offer just a glimpse of the potential AI holds for the future of finance. By harnessing AI responsibly, we can create a more inclusive, efficient, and secure financial system for all.</p>
<p>Let’s explore together:</p>
 
 
 
 Future of Personalized Finance: How might AI systems act as financial advisors that know you better than you know yourself? AI-powered algorithms can analyze your spending habits, financial goals, and risk tolerance to create personalized investment portfolios, budgeting plans, and even predict future financial needs. How will AI democratize access to financial advice, previously reserved for the wealthy. 
 Frictionless Transactions: The reliability of finance has historically been associated with endless paperwork to generate auditable paper trails for interaction accounting. AI-powered chatbots can handle routine tasks like account inquiries, fund transfers, and even loan applications, making financial transactions seamless and available 24/7. 
 Enhanced Fraud Detection AI will help to identify patterns of fraudulent activity in real-time, by analyzing massive datasets of transactions to help curb and prevent costly criminal activity. Greater reliability and confidence is a pathway to greater trust in financial systems. 
 Algorithmic Trading: With lightning-fast analysis and the ability to execute trades in milliseconds, AI-powered algorithms are already powering high-frequency trading. In the future, their impact could extend beyond Wall Street, potentially making automated investment management commonplace for individual investors. However, ethical considerations and potential market manipulation risks need careful attention. 
 Democratizing Access to Capital: AI can open doors for those traditionally excluded from traditional financial services. By assessing creditworthiness based on alternative data sources beyond credit scores, AI can enable lenders to extend loans to underserved communities, promoting financial inclusion and economic growth. This also comes with challenges, like ensuring fair and unbiased lending practices. 
 
 
 
<p>By the end of our session, attendees will have a broader perspective on the role of finance among a broad array of information systems, and how financial institutions and processes, and the many processes that are affected by finance, can be changed – for better and worse – with AI.</p>

   The statement that “to know you is to love you” has never been more true or relevant as we face more and more challenges from synthetic identity and AI-driven threats. Identity is no longer just an IT security issue but a key business enabler as businesses work to delight their consumers, partners and employees with frictionless user experiences that also improves the security of access to the data and resources IT works to protect. 
 
 We all know security is a choice people make, and if we make it difficult, people will not choose it. But if we make security seamless and put the control of what personal information can be shared, we can build trust over time and in the end get to know more about our users as we recognize them each time we engage with them.&nbsp; 
 
 In this session, I’ll introduce how IAM practitioners can establish trust through decentralized identity, leverage threat detection and mitigation tools to seamless engage users, and balance frictionless experience and security by implementing an adaptive trust model for governing access entitlements. 				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/evolution-of-identity-trust-eic24"></a>

Inspired by Clint Eastwood's iconic quote, "Go ahead, make my day!" – a testament to determination and confidence in confronting challenges – we metaphorically align CIAM with taking charge of our digital identities and standing resolute against potential threats.</p>
<p>CIAM emerges as a critical solution in addressing the contemporary digital landscape, ensuring user security and privacy while facilitating seamless and personalized interactions. It equips us with the means to handle user authentication and authorization, uphold their consent, and empower them with control over their data. Through CIAM, we envision a future where user security, privacy, and autonomy reign supreme in both B2B and B2C environments, fostering trust and loyalty among stakeholders.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) has significantly evolved over the past few years, moving beyond its traditional focus. Today, digital identities are integral to digital business, serving as the first touchpoint for customers, consumers, devices, and things.
Innovation in Identity Management, including AI, decentralized identity, modern authorization, and orchestration are transforming IAM into a more integrated and strategic component of digital business and cybersecurity.
The whitepaper will analyze these trends, discuss their impact on digital business, and provide recommendations for advancing IAM at the business, organizational, and technical levels.

But chances are, you’re under attack. So how do you know if you’re under attack? Well, the safe bet is to simply assume you already are. But, there are other indicators.

<p>As your trusted IAM partner, Ping has a vested interest in helping you protect your business. Our experience with the largest enterprises in the world has shown us that fraudsters, as big and scary as they can be, are also human and follow the path of least resistance. They mostly target the weakest links – your users. With the increasing sophistication and quality of attacks, users often fall victim to credential theft via phishing, vishing, smishing, and man-in-the-middle attacks, precisely because it is so challenging to differentiate malicious messages from genuine ones.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In an era marked by rapid technological advancement and global upheaval, understanding the landscape of AI regulation is more critical than ever. This session aims to unravel the complexities of AI regulation, focusing on Europe's nuanced, risk-based approach while casting a wider net to examine global strategies in a multipolar world.</p>
<p>The session will dissect the multifaceted nature of AI regulation. We begin with Europe’s methodical framework, which assesses AI applications through a risk-based lens, aiming to foster innovation while safeguarding ethical standards. This approach, encapsulated by initiatives like the GDPR and the proposed AI Act, sets a precedent in balancing technological progress with individual rights and societal values.</p>
<p>Our exploration then expands to the global stage, where diverse regulatory philosophies reflect the multifaceted challenges and priorities of different nations and cultures. In a world facing myriad crises and conflicts - each with a substantial information component - these regulations are not just legal frameworks to guide AI system growth but also mirrors of broader geopolitical dynamics. The session will provide:</p>
 
 A Detailed Examination: Insight into Europe's risk-based regulatory strategy for AI, highlighting its principles, challenges, and influence on global norms. 
 Global Perspectives: An analysis of how various countries approach AI governance, reflecting the broader geopolitical landscape and its implications for international relations and tech leadership. 
 Industry and Societal Impact: Consideration of how these AI regulatory frameworks shape industry innovation, ethical AI development, and the balance between technological growth and societal well-being. 
 Strategic Foresight: Engaging discussions on the future trajectory of AI regulation, considering the impact of ongoing global crises and the shift towards a multipolar world order. 
 
<p>This session offers policymakers, industry stakeholders, and tech enthusiasts a comprehensive understanding of AI regulation's current state, fostering informed strategies to navigate the intricacies of AI governance in a rapidly evolving world.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/approaches-to-ai-regulation-eic24"></a>

  <p>With the growing exposure of digital services and assets through application programming interfaces (APIs) and the emergence of the API Economy, entire business models are starting to be built around APIs. Increasingly, APIs are designed to be used externally as part of an organisation’s service delivery model.</p>
<p>The adoption of the OAuth protocol has allowed consumer-to-business (C2B) integrations to authorise access to APIs in a standardised way. However, business-to-business (B2B) integrations using OAuth are now rapidly growing, and as API ecosystems become more complex, there is an urgent need for further standardisation. Although OAuth supports direct B2B integration, there is no standard way to implement delegated B2B authorisation because OAuth delegation was primarily designed for C2B integration where the resource owner is an individual consumer.</p>
<p>There are use cases where, for an online business to provide services to their customers, they need authorised access to resources owned by the customer organisation at third-party resource providers.</p>
<p>In this session, we will explore how OAuth and its extensions, such as rich authorisation requests and token exchange grant types, can be used to allow a resource owner client to dynamically delegate access to its resources to another client using delegated B2B authorisation.</p>
<p>The presentation will cover the following topics:</p>
 
 Business use case for B2B delegated authorisation 
 Brief overview of the OAuth 2.0 protocol 
 Proposed enhancements to the OAuth 2.0 standard to achieve interoperable B2B delegated authorisation 
 Security considerations

However, AI agents are often hampered by the lack of necessary context to complete critical tasks. Sharing unrestricted access to personal data with an AI agent leads to serious privacy concerns. <br> <br> This presentation seeks to address these challenges by introducing a novel approach utilizing verifiable credentials and identity wallets to give an AI agent selective access to personal data in a privacy preserving manner. Trinsic’s CEO, Riley Hughes, will share a never-before-seen demo of how a user can create a trusted identity in the form of a verifiable credential, then utilize the identity attributes to allow an AI agent to act on his behalf in a personalized manner. While the actions are performed by the AI agent, there will be a trusted link back to a real human who has given verifiable permission to the AI agent to access their data.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/preserving-privacy-data-sharing-eic24"></a>
