<p>With our bleeding-edge <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/go-inside-version-3-0-of-the-most-advanced-mobile-wallet-sdk-on-the-market/">3.0 release</a> of the Anonyome Labs decentralized identity (DI)&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/">mobile wallet SDK</a>&nbsp;just coming hot off the press, we’re excited to announce that we’ve already pushed the version 3.1 release out the door, packing new features to enhance the SDK even more.</p>



<p>As a refresher, our DI&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/">mobile wallet SDK</a>&nbsp;lets our customers easily integrate DI and verifiable credential (VC, or reusable credential) solutions into their applications. The DI <a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/">mobile wallet SDK</a>&nbsp;is a native SDK for both iOS and Android and notably does not rely on any third-party frameworks such as JavaScript frameworks.</p>



<p>Our <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/go-inside-version-3-0-of-the-most-advanced-mobile-wallet-sdk-on-the-market/">3.0 release</a> primarily brought in European Union Digital Identity (EUDI) aligned standards, such as OpenID4VC (<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0-13.html">OpenID4VCI</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-21.html">OpenID4VP</a>) and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/">IETF SD-JWT VCs</a>. Our 3.1 release continues this trajectory by adding support for the modern industry-leading DI trust infrastructure, <a href="https://cheqd.io/">Cheqd</a>.</p>



 Consumers now have more choice of decentralized and scalable infrastructure to underpin their DI operations 



<p>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) provide cryptographic infrastructure to many of the credential formats in the DI ecosystem. As such, it’s crucial that Anonyome supports a wide range of DID types (methods), so our customers can choose the best method for their use case.</p>



<p>Within the 3.1 release of the mobile wallet SDK, we bundle in new support for resolving three DID methods that are gaining mass adoption: <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/product/architecture/adr-list/adr-001-cheqd-did-method">Cheqd</a>, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">Web</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/quartzjer/did-jwk/blob/main/spec.md">JWK</a>.</p>



<p>With this integration, consumers now have more options for a decentralized and scalable infrastructure to support their DI operations. This is particularly timely because Sovrin, one of the original DI ledgers our edge agent supported, unfortunately <a href="https://us14.campaign-archive.com/?u=b2c2f50b93f0ad7684f55ccde&amp;id=97dcc86838">announced it will probably end operations in 2025</a>. Cheqd is a comparable modern alternative.</p>



<p>We’ve also added support for the <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/product/advanced/anoncreds">Cheqd Anoncred method</a>, allowing the mobile wallet SDK to receive <a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/">Anoncred</a>-formatted VCs, in addition to <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/">IETF SD-JWT VCs</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C VCDM</a> VCs, secured by Cheqd Trust Infrastructure. This work is in tandem with <a href="https://cheqd.io/blog/expanding-cheqd-into-aca-py/">Cheqd’s recent efforts in ACA-Py</a>, which allows ACA-Py cloud agents to issue and verify VCs backed by Cheqd.</p>



<p>As usual, we’ve actively tested our SDK solution against the issuer and verifier open source software in the DI ecosystem, <a href="https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/acapy">ACA-Py</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/credo-ts">Credo-ts</a>, to ensure we remain interoperable with other agents.</p>



<p>Best of all, Anonyome has open sourced these new DID resolvers within VCX, a codebase we <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/aries-vcx-anonyomes-commitment-to-decentralized-identity/">contribute to and maintain</a>.</p>



 Where to next? 



<p>We are excited to have checked off these new DID suites from the roadmap outlined in our recent <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/go-inside-version-3-0-of-the-most-advanced-mobile-wallet-sdk-on-the-market/">3.0 release announcement</a>. Looking ahead, we will continue to pursue the features on that roadmap, including enhancements to the OpenID4VC protocol suite—particularly as OpenID approaches 1.0 releases of these standards—and the ongoing expansion of DID methods, such as <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didwebvh">did:webvh</a> (formerly did:tdw).</p>



<p>What’s more, we are actively developing a security enhancement to allow SDK consumers to leverage hardware security modules (HSMs), such as those built into modern mobile phones, for performing the cryptography that secures their DI use cases. This feature is in alignment with EUDI regulations, which you can <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/can-an-existing-digital-identity-wallet-leverage-a-hardware-security-module-to-meet-new-eu-standards/">read more about here</a>.</p>



<p>Stay tuned for our next DI mobile wallet SDK announcement.</p>



<p><a href="http://anonyome.com/businesses">Anonyome Labs</a>’ business solution&nbsp;combines a scalable identity foundation and menu of enterprise-ready APIs and SDKs, so you can quickly build and deploy next-generation privacy, cyber safety, and decentralized identity apps to help your customers communicate privately, navigate online safely, and transact securely in an increasingly connected world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Block Settles for $80 Million Over Cash App BSA/AML Violations and Commits to Compliance Overhaul</p>



<p>Block has agreed to pay an $80 million fine and implement corrective measures after 48 state financial regulators alleged its Cash App service violated Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and anti-money laundering (AML) laws.

<p>Supreme Court to Decide Proper Legal Standard for Texas Pornography Age-Verification Law</p>



<p>The Supreme Court is reviewing the constitutionality of Texas’ 2023 age-verification law for pornography websites, which requires “reasonable age verification methods” for content harmful to minors. Opponents, including the Free Speech Coalition, argue it infringes on adults’ First Amendment rights and raises privacy concerns through mandatory digital or government ID checks. A district court blocked the law using “strict scrutiny,” but the 5th Circuit reversed, applying “rational-basis review” and allowing it to take effect. The Supreme Court will decide whether strict scrutiny applies, potentially sending the case back for reconsideration, or affirm the 5th Circuit’s decision. The Biden administration supports strict scrutiny while acknowledging states’ ability to protect children online. <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-texas-age-verification-requirement-for-pornography-websites/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz---1apKUxqEpEnfTmIDCjzWnTl4IRukl24nGNbF5aa7-unlxUvUxCv4guLPhUGtiu7yJecm">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>UK Government Proposes Ban on Ransomware Payments for Public Sector and Critical Infrastructure</p>



<p>The U.K. government has proposed banning public sector and critical infrastructure organizations from paying ransomware demands to deter cybercriminals. The move follows major attacks, such as one on the NHS that disrupted patient care. The proposal includes mandatory reporting of ransomware incidents and safeguards to prevent payments to sanctioned entities. The National Cyber Security Center reports a rise in ransomware attacks, often by Russia-linked groups targeting critical infrastructure. A public consultation on the proposals runs until April 2025, though there are no immediate plans to present the measures to Parliament. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/uk-plans-to-ban-public-sector-organizations-from-paying-ransomware-hackers/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9_0riV7lddUMqCzcf1sEWmwvCz8CtwM3dOvcz4IRJssiVgB1Iy0jHS4uRLncXSbbwzrm-s">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>U.S. Disrupts Chinese State-Backed Hacking Campaign Using PlugX Malware</p>



<p>U.S. authorities have disrupted a Chinese state-backed hacking group, “Twill Typhoon” (aka “Mustang Panda”), which used the malware “PlugX” to infiltrate millions of computers worldwide in a long-term espionage campaign. On January 9, 2025, the Department of Justice revealed that, with court approval, the FBI removed PlugX malware from thousands of U.S. systems during an August 2024 operation led by French authorities with support from cybersecurity firm Sekoia. Active since 2014, PlugX, often installed via USB ports, was used to steal sensitive files, targeting European shipping firms, Indo-Pacific governments, and Chinese dissident groups. Despite allegations of funding the group, the Chinese government denies involvement. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/14/doj-confirms-fbi-operation-that-mass-deleted-chinese-malware-from-thousands-of-us-computers/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9_0riV7lddUMqCzcf1sEWmwvCz8CtwM3dOvcz4IRJssiVgB1Iy0jHS4uRLncXSbbwzrm-s">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Gravy Analytics Data Breach Exposes Sensitive Location Data of Millions Worldwide.</p>



<p>A breach at Gravy Analytics exposed millions of location data points from apps like fitness trackers and dating platforms, revealing movements through sensitive sites and private homes. Stolen via a misused Amazon cloud key, the data risks deanonymization, endangering vulnerable groups like LGBTQ+ individuals. Following an FTC ban on its data practices, Gravy’s reliance on real-time ad bidding highlights privacy risks. Experts advise using ad blockers, limiting location permissions, and disabling app tracking. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/13/gravy-analytics-data-broker-breach-trove-of-location-data-threatens-privacy-millions/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8hmq0cc5zBAkNb8S6v44H-FOeWGtNkh-69m9Ul4000AkAYuO2IQ_eRI6hgiCfAPGYAGY6l">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Supreme Court Weighs TikTok Ban Amid National Security Concerns and First Amendment Debate</p>



<p>The U.S. Supreme Court is reviewing TikTok’s challenge to a law requiring it to sever ties with ByteDance or face a U.S. app store ban by January 19, 2025. The government cites national security concerns over potential data misuse and disinformation, while TikTok argues the ban violates First Amendment protections. If enforced, TikTok would lose app store access, updates, and functionality. President-elect Donald Trump supports delaying the ban for negotiations, but legal and legislative issues persist. The U.S. would be the first Western democracy to impose a full ban, following India’s example, while NATO and European nations have limited restrictions. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/tiktok-ban-supreme-court-arguments-65506b1f?mod=tech_more_article_pos2&amp;utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8hmq0cc5zBAkNb8S6v44H-FOeWGtNkh-69m9Ul4000AkAYuO2IQ_eRI6hgiCfAPGYAGY6l">(Source)</a></p>

<p>Biden Administration’s Cybersecurity Order to Promote Mobile Digital Identity Adoption in Public Programs</p>



<p>An upcoming Biden administration cybersecurity executive order will promote digital identity documents like mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) for public benefit verification. In development for seven months, the order focuses on interoperability, data minimization, and potential funding for state mDL adoption, guided by NIST standards. It also addresses privacy, bias, and identity proofing challenges while reducing reliance on data brokers and credit bureaus. A pilot notification system will alert individuals when their identity is used in benefit applications. <a href="https://www.nextgov.com/digital-government/2025/01/coming-cyber-executive-order-includes-push-mobile-drivers-licenses/402031/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--lTjB4EidvqmXVHJSf7KaBjOseusJZaIKOqINf1-nkn2ZRz7WMkdCZMWAIWzDaNY92iPLH">(Source)</a></p>

			 Christian Stricker is Digital Marketing Intern at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself!  
<p>I’m Christian Stricker, born in Luxembourg to Danish parents. Currently finishing a Bachelor’s Degree in Media Design in Eindhoven, which is the latest on my big list of projects/problems to solve. Having something to work towards always keeps me motivated, and that can be something simple like creating my favorite dish, to more complex projects where I utilize my full potential.</p>
<p>I have a few hobbies but the main ones are motorsports and fitness. I often participate in virtual sim racing competitions in cars which I have designed myself. A perfect way to blend my professional skills and hobbies into one. For the fitness side, I play touch rugby with the Luxembourgish team every week, go on runs in the forest, and ski.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Before Tokeny, while I was completing my bachelors degree, I was involved in a global project of building and managing a website overhaul for a factory automation company. This taught me a lot about web development, project management and marketing. I thoroughly enjoyed this, so when the opportunity to join Tokeny arose I was ecstatic. Especially since I have been looking at working in the web3 industry.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Innovative, challenging but very rewarding. The team is very motivated and everyone working here has a strong belief in what Tokeny is doing for the future. I am not just a number here, my inputs are valued and working alongside the others has taught me a huge amount about myself, and the web3 industry.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>If I were to condense all my passions into one it would be: Learning and Improving. My main passion is racing. Ever since I was a kid, I always wanted to be a driver and as I grew up I tried making this a reality. I spent countless hours learning racecraft and how to handle a car, then I would apply my learnings to the track in karts. I have taken part in a few karting races and won 2 of them. Beating the competition is the motivation, and nothing is more rewarding than finally earning the top spot of the podium.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>To live a life knowing I did my best, even if I don’t achieve all my goals. As long as I have given it my best shot, I will never have to think, what if?</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>Don’t be afraid of accepting new challenges, keep an open mind, and the team is always there to help you improve. Your hard work will be recognized.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>We are at the beginning of something that can completely change the way we do finance in the future. Opening up a whole new world of opportunities for institutions and investors. I am excited to be part of this journey and see where it leads us.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Paul Fisher</a></p><p>January 17, 2025 marks a milestone for the EU’s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA), as financial entities across the EU must now fully comply with its requirements. While no longer in the EU, UK financials still need to comply for any cross border activity. Once again, Brexit doesn’t really mean Brexit when it comes to GRC! <br>But while DORA aims to bolster operational resilience, it hasn’t yet convinced senior cybersecurity professionals that their weakest link—supply chain security—is any stronger. A recent study by <a href="https://www.greenravenlimited.com/downloads/">Green Raven Limited</a>, conducted in partnership with Censuswide, reveals insights into the state of supply chain cybersecurity. Despite the extensive preparations financial entities have made for DORA, confidence in the resilience of supply chains remains tepid at best.</p>
 The Numbers Don’t Lie 
<p>The research surveyed 200 senior cybersecurity professionals, including 21 from the financial sector, all representing UK organisations with over 1,000 employees. The findings are clear:</p>
 
 44% of all respondents acknowledged their supply chain is the weakest part of their cybersecurity. 
 In the financial sector, the figure was 43%, virtually identical to the broader sample. 
 
<p>Source: Censuswide 2025</p>
<p>What’s concerning&nbsp; is that even after preparing for DORA, so many still see their supply chains as the weakest link. This raises an important question: if supply chain security isn’t their greatest concern, what is? Could it mean some financial organisations have addressed supply chain risks effectively during their DORA preparations, or does it indicate other areas of cybersecurity are more precarious? On the other hand, 87% of the UK businesses surveyed said they were compliant by October 17th for the related EU NIST 2 deadline.&nbsp;</p>
 Supply Chain Risk: Still Top of Mind 
<p>For banks and other financial institutions, Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) has long been a priority, and DORA’s provisions specifically mandate enhanced oversight of ICT suppliers. Yet Green Raven’s research found that an even higher proportion—53% of senior cyber professionals working in supply chain-related roles—identified supply chains as their weakest link.</p>
<p>This doesn’t necessarily mean these organisations lack confidence in their overall cybersecurity posture. Rather, it underscores the complex, multifaceted risks supply chains pose—risks that remain a dominant concern, even with frameworks like DORA in place.</p>
 The Takeaway 
<p>DORA compliance is a step forward for operational resilience, but it’s clear the journey is far from over. Supply chains remain a critical vulnerability, and addressing this requires more than ticking regulatory boxes—it demands proactive, continuous oversight and investment in robust monitoring solutions.</p>
<p>As financial organisations adapt to DORA, the real question isn’t whether compliance alone will reduce risk, but whether these efforts will translate into a stronger, more resilient supply chain.</p>
<p>The bottom line for all business, UK or otherwise, is that being compliant doesn’t protect you from a cyberattack. It just means that the minimum legal requirements have been met, and a penalty may be avoided (but not guaranteed). Finally, compliance legislation is always playing catch up with current cyberattack methods and trends and is often years behind once it finally becomes law.</p>

<p>2024 was a year of immense growth for Bluesky. We launched the app publicly in February and gained over 23M users by the end of the year. With this growth came anticipated challenges in scaling Trust &amp; Safety, from adding workstreams to adapting to new harms.</p>
<p>Throughout 2024, our Trust &amp; Safety team has worked to protect our growing userbase and uphold our community standards. Our approach has focused on assessing potential harms based on both their frequency and severity, allowing us to direct our resources to where they can have the greatest impact. Looking ahead to 2025, we're investing in stronger proactive detection systems to complement user reporting, as a growing network needs multiple detection methods to rapidly identify and address harmful content. In Q1, we'll be sharing a draft of updated <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/community-guidelines">Guidelines</a> as we continue adapting to our community’s needs.</p>
 Overview 
<p>In 2024, Bluesky grew from 2.89M users to 25.94M users. In addition to users hosted on Bluesky’s infrastructure, there are over 4,000 users running their own infrastructure (Personal Data Servers), self-hosting their content, posts, and data.</p>
<p>To meet the demands caused by user growth, we’ve increased our moderation team to roughly 100 moderators and continue to hire more staff. Some moderators specialize in particular policy areas, such as dedicated agents for child safety. Our moderation team is staffed 24/7 and reviews user reports around the clock. This is a tough job, as moderators are consistently exposed to graphic content. At the start of September 2024, we began providing psychological counselling to alleviate the burden of viewing this content.</p>
 Reports 
<p>In 2024, users submitted 6.48M reports to Bluesky’s moderation service. That’s a 17x increase from the previous year — in 2023, users submitted 358K reports total. The volume of user reports increased with user growth and was non-linear, as the graph of report volume below shows:</p>

  
  Report volume in 2024

<p>In late August, there was a large increase in user growth for Bluesky from Brazil, and we saw spikes of up to 50k reports per day. Prior to this, our moderation team handled most reports within 40 minutes. For the first time in 2024, we now had a backlog in moderation reports. To address this, we increased the size of our Portuguese-language moderation team, added constant moderation sweeps and automated tooling for high-risk areas such as child safety, and hired moderators through an external contracting vendor for the first time.</p>
<p>We already had automated spam detection in place, and after this wave of growth in Brazil, we began investing in automating more categories of reports so that our moderation team would be able to review suspicious or problematic content rapidly. In December, we were able to review our first wave of automated reports for content categories like impersonation. This dropped processing time for high-certainty accounts to within seconds of receiving a report, though it also caused some false positives. We’re now exploring the expansion of this tooling to other policy areas. Even while instituting automation tooling to reduce our response time, human moderators are still kept in the loop — all appeals and false positives are reviewed by human moderators.</p>
<p>Some more statistics: The proportion of users submitting reports held fairly stable from 2023 to 2024. In 2023, 5.6% of our active users<a>1</a> created one or more reports. In 2024, 1.19M users made one or more reports, approximately 4.57% of our user base.</p>
<p>In 2023, 3.4% of our active users received one or more reports. In 2024, the number of users who received a report were 770K, comprising 2.97% of our user base.</p>
<p>The majority of reports were of individual posts, with a total of 3.5M reports. This was followed by account profiles at 47K reports, typically for a violative profile picture or banner photo. Lists received 45K reports. DMs received 17.7K reports. Significantly lower are feeds at 5.3K reports, and starter packs with 1.9K reports.</p>
<p>Our users report content for a variety of reasons, and these reports help guide our focus areas. Below is a summary of the reports we received, categorized by the reasons users selected. The categories vary slightly depending on whether a report is about an account or a specific post, but here’s the full breakdown:</p>
 
 Anti-social Behavior: Reports of harassment, trolling, or intolerance – 1.75M 
 Misleading Content: Includes impersonation, misinformation, or false claims about identity or affiliations – 1.20M 
 Spam: Excessive mentions, replies, or repetitive content – 1.40M 
 Unwanted Sexual Content: Nudity or adult content not properly labeled – 630K 
 Illegal or Urgent Issues: Clear violations of the law or our terms of service – 933K 
 Other: Issues that don’t fit into the above categories – 726K 
 
<p>These insights highlight areas where we need to focus more attention as we prioritize improvements in 2025.</p>
 Labels 
<p>In 2024, Bluesky applied 5.5M labels, which includes individual post labels and account-level labels. To give an idea of volumes, in Nov 2024, 2.5M videos were posted on Bluesky<a>2</a>, along 36.14M images. This comes primarily from automation where every image as well as frames from each video is sent to a provider for assessment, they return verdicts that match to our specific labels, and those are the ones you see from Bluesky Moderation. None of the images or videos are retained by the vendor or used for training generative AI systems. In June 2024, we analyzed the effectiveness of this system and concluded that the overall system was 99.90% accurate (i.e. it labeled the right things with the right labels). Human moderators review all appeals on labels, but due to backlogs, there are currently delays.</p>
<p>The top human-applied labels were:</p>
 
 Sexual-figurative<a>3</a> - 55,422 
 Rude - 22,412 
 Spam - 13,201 
 Intolerant - 11,341 
 Threat - 3,046 
 
 Appeals 
<p>In 2024, 93,076 users submitted at least one appeal in the app, for a total of 205K individual appeals. For most cases, the appeal was due to disagreement with label verdicts.</p>
<p>We currently handle user appeals for taken-down accounts via our moderation email inbox.</p>
<p>In 2025, we will transition to responding to moderation reports directly within the Bluesky app, which will streamline user communication. For example, we’ll be able to report back to users what action was taken on their reports. Additionally, in a future iteration, it will be possible for users to appeal account takedowns directly within the Bluesky app instead of having to send us an email.</p>
 Takedowns 
<p>In 2024, Bluesky moderators took down 66,308 accounts, and automated tooling took down 35,842 accounts for reasons such as spam and bot networks. Mods took down 6,334 records (posts, lists, feed etc.) while automated systems removed 282.</p>
<p>This month (January 2025), we’ve already built in policy reasons to Ozone, our open-source moderation tool. This will give us more granular data on the takedown rationale moving forward.</p>
 Legal Requests 
<p>In 2024, we received 238 requests from law enforcement, governments, legal firms, responded to 182, and complied with 146. The majority of requests came from German, U.S., Brazilian, and Japanese law enforcement.</p>
<p>In the chart below, User Data Requests are requests for user data; Data Preservation Requests are requests for Bluesky to store user data pending legal authorization to transfer the data; Emergency Data Requests are extreme cases where there’s a threat to life (i.e., someone actively discussing their own suicide with a time and date given for an attempt); Takedown Requests are requests for content removal; Subpoena Requests are largely user data requests, but if Bluesky fails to provide the data in a timely manner, it has to physically show up in court to defend not providing the data.</p>

 Copyright / Trademark 
<p>In 2024, we received a total of 937 copyright and trademark cases. There were four confirmed copyright cases in the entire first half of 2024, and this number increased to 160 in September. The vast majority of cases occurred between September to December.</p>
<p>We published a <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/copyright">copyright form</a> in late 2024, which provided more structure to our report responses. The influx of users from Brazil meant that professional copyright companies began scraping Bluesky data and sending us copyright claims. With the move to a structured copyright form, we expect to have more granular data in 2025.</p>
 Child Safety 
<p>We subscribe to a number of hashes (digital fingerprints) that match known cases of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). When an image or video is uploaded to Bluesky and matches one of these hashes, it is immediately removed from the site and our infrastructure without the need for a human to view the content.</p>
<p>In 2024, Bluesky submitted 1,154 reports for confirmed CSAM to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). Reports consist of the account details, along with manually reviewed media by one of our specialized child safety moderators. Each report can involve many pieces of media, though most reports involve under five pieces of media.</p>
<p>CSAM is a serious issue on any social network. With surges in user growth also came increased complexity in child safety. Cases included accounts attempting to sell CSAM by linking off-platform, potentially underage users trying to sell explicit imagery, and pedophiles attempting to share encrypted chat links. In these cases, we rapidly updated our internal guidance to our moderation team to ensure prompt response times in taking down this activity.</p>

				  The Biden administration’s latest Executive Order (EO), on <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2025/01/16/executive-order-on-strengthening-and-promoting-innovation-in-the-nations-cybersecurity/">“Strengthening and Promoting Innovation in the Nation’s Cybersecurity,”</a> focuses on preventing digital identity theft as a critical component to reducing cybercrime and fraud.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By: Tim Spring</p>
<p>Stronger digital identities</p>
<p>The White House released the final Executive Order from the Biden administration today calling for strong cybersecurity measures, and one measure they pointed out specifically was “the acceptance of digital identity documents to access public benefits programs that require identity verification, so long as it is done in a manner that preserves broad program access for vulnerable populations and supports the principles of privacy, data minimization, and interoperability.”</p>
<p>This effectively means replacing the current account and password systems that most online portals use. While these current systems offer a convenient, quick way to gain access, they have been known to be insecure for years.</p>
<p>So what would these “digital identity documents” actually look like?</p>
<p>At the most basic level a digital identity document is a combination of personally identifiable information that you can tie to an individual to prove who they are online. One example that you might have heard of is a Mobile Driver’s License or mDL, which are also referenced in the order as a potential way to gain access to public benefit programs.</p>
<p>Moving past the basics, to get the most functionality and security out of these documents they will need a few additional features.</p>
<p>They need to be stored locally with the end user</p>
<p>Third party storage of personal data for identity authentication is always at risk of a data breach</p>
<p>They need to be tamper-proof and un-copyable</p>
<p>The integrity of the information must be verifiable and it must be bound to the person it belongs to in a way that someone else can’t use it.</p>
<p>They need to be interoperable</p>
<p>Being locked out because you’re on a mac and the other party is on PC and they don’t play well together won’t work at this scale, we need a universal solution</p>
<p>The Executive Order also stresses the privacy preserving nature of these documents, saying they should “support user privacy and data minimization by ensuring only the minimum information required for a transaction — often a “yes” or “no” response to a question, such as whether an individual is older than a specific age — is requested from the holder of the digital identity document.”</p>
<p>Decentralized identity</p>
<p>Decentralized identity is the solution to the White House Executive Order. Everyone controls their own personal data and that data can be verified as authentic, as bound to the person it rightfully belongs to, and that it has not been manipulated.</p>
<p>The benefit of decentralization is portable trust. Any information —&nbsp;and not just personal data —&nbsp;can be sealed in a digital container called a Verifiable Credential. The way that container is created means you always know where it came from. The way the data is sealed means that any attempt to tamper with it breaks the seal.</p>
<p>As an architecture for our information economy, decentralized identity takes out the weak points of our current system —&nbsp;centralized databases filled with personal data for verifying identity — and replaces them with a much simpler, resilient, seamless way of proving who we are to each other.</p>
<p>The result is that information can go from anywhere to everywhere and be immediately acted on — and of course, by providing a reliable method for individuals and organizations to prove their identities online, verifiable credentials help reduce the risk of identity theft and unauthorized access to sensitive systems.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity frameworks offer a transformative approach to identity management. Unlike traditional centralized systems, decentralized identity places control of personal data back in the hands of individuals. This model not only enhances privacy and security but also reduces the risk of large-scale data breaches that have plagued centralized databases.</p>
<p>The Executive Order’s promotion of innovative developments and use of emerging technologies is an acknowledgment of the potential of decentralized identity to strengthen the nation’s cybersecurity infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To better see how these technologies work, you can see a demonstration of using Verifiable Credentials to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvCNvWud3Ys">access your bank account</a>, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StRH7uOqxQA">fly internationally</a> in a joint effort between Indicio, SITA, Delta Airlines, and the Government of Aruba.</p>

  SpruceID is advancing privacy-preserving Verifiable Digital Credentials (VDCs) to enhance security, streamline verification processes, and protect user privacy in international travel and immigration.

<p>Digital credentials are on the road to broad availability in the U.S. These cryptographically signed digital documents are one variety of VDC, or Verifiable Digital Credential. They enhance user privacy while making credential checks faster and more trustworthy, using unforgeable cryptographic signatures to prove their authenticity and accuracy.</p><p>As VDC usage continues to grow within the United States and other nations, a new challenge rises ahead: creating digital versions of passports and international travel documents with the same privacy and security benefits as the mobile driver’s license. SpruceID is now<a href="https://spruceid.com/customer-highlight/dhs-highlight?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> contributing to the effort</a> to push VDC-based digital identity beyond U.S. borders. Read on to learn more about the benefits of digital identity for travelers, immigrants, and the world.</p> User Privacy and National Security <p>Digital passports, immigration, and work authorization documents are still almost entirely analog documents – paper, usually backed up by a database. The next generation of these credentials, though, will be able to “live” on your smartphone or other mobile device. <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/mobile-drivers-licenses-technology/digital-signatures?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Cryptographic signatures</a> will prevent them from being copied or altered while making it possible to verify them without checking a separate database.</p><p>Read More:<a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/mobile-drivers-licenses-technology/digital-signatures?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> Digital Signatures</a></p><p>These Verifiable Digital Credentials (VDCs) are sometimes also known as privacy-preserving digital credentials (PPDCs), highlighting how central privacy is to their technical design. One major privacy benefit of travel and immigration documents based on VDCs is <a href="https://spruceid.com/learn/increased-privacy-in-identity-checks?ref=blog.spruceid.com">selective disclosure</a> – proving your citizenship, for instance, without sharing less relevant data like your spouse’s name. Similarly, part of the stated goal of the push for digital travel documents is to minimize the system’s reliance on biometrics, such as face-scanning, which can generate high-risk data. The potential to verify digital credentials without contacting a central server for confirmation also means VDCs can be used without leaving “footprints” that <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/the-importance-of-protecting-digital-id-users-from-phone-home-surveillance/">could be used for surveillance</a>.</p><p>This doesn’t just serve individual privacy: the broader stakes for national security have also become increasingly clear. State-affiliated hacks targeting infrastructure and data are becoming <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/cisa-releases-mobile-security-guidance-after-chinese-telecom-hacking/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">larger, more frequent, and more pernicious</a>. Though it sounds extreme, it’s not difficult to imagine a long-term compromise of digital travel control systems giving a foreign enemy or other bad actors detailed visibility into the movements of government officials or high-ranking business leaders.</p><p>Such a compromise could be a very powerful intelligence advantage for America’s enemies. That’s one reason for a recent U.S. government <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Strategy-to-Advance-Privacy-Preserving-Data-Sharing-and-Analytics.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">push for privacy-preserving data tools</a>. If travel systems are digitized in a privacy-first way, the current moment is an opportunity to spread the privacy advantages of digital credentials around the world.</p> More Secure Processes and Borders <p>In addition to enabling more private verifications, VDCs are also more trustworthy compared to paper documents – particularly in situations where remote verification isn’t available or practical. Fully verifying a paper document generally requires access to a central database, but access to that database is often restricted. Just as regional driver’s license databases are often <a href="https://dmv.ny.gov/records/sharing-your-information?ref=blog.spruceid.com">restricted to law enforcement, insurers</a>, and a handful of other entities, passport information is even more strictly limited – in the U.S., to the <a href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Passport-Records-Imaging-System-Management-PRISM-PIA.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">State Department</a> and Department of Homeland Security.&nbsp;</p><p>Somewhat surprisingly, passports have in recent years been the<a href="https://identityweek.net/trends-in-fraudulent-identity-documents-in-2022?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> most frequently forged identity documents</a> around the world, according to Identity Week. This is driven not by individuals hoping to travel on a fake passport, as airport security checkpoints are far more likely to use a remote database for confirmations. Instead, forged passports are most often used to deceive employers trying to determine a job applicant’s work eligibility. For instance, forged British and Irish passports are widely used to <a href="https://identityweek.net/trends-in-fraudulent-identity-documents-in-2022?ref=blog.spruceid.com">circumvent eligibility requirements</a> to work in France and mainland Europe – a situation where the document itself must stand as the final source of trust.</p><p>Thanks to physical security features, paper passports are difficult to forge—but clearly, not impossible. In fact, it appears that we are on the cusp of a potential flood of fake paper documents unleashed by AI: reports in 2024 found that AI is making forged identity documents much less expensive to produce.</p><p>Read More: <a href="https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/03/28/ai-is-the-final-blow-for-an-id-system-whose-time-has-passed/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">AI is the Final Blow for an ID System Whose Time Has Passed</a></p><p>The signature scheme behind VDCs is vastly superior to paper documents in this and similar cases. While identity database access is constricted, a directory of valid signatures on a digital document can be entirely public, and the signature cannot be forged by anything short of a physical attack on the servers where a document issuer’s digital “keys” are securely stored.</p> Faster and More Convenient – Online and Off <p>Using digital signatures instead of paper documents to verify passports can also dramatically speed travel processing. Without access to a central database, individual screeners will often have to devote considerable time to evaluating individual documents. Verification of a digital document using cryptographic signatures is near-instant while also eliminating the ambiguities and risks of physical document review.</p><p>Another emergent benefit of digital credentials for migrants and travelers is the ability to store and manage virtual documents on the mobile phone you already carry. In regions where payments and identity tools are already available on smartphones, consumer preference is quickly shifting towards being able to leave the house with a phone but without physical credit cards or ID. While it’s a radical shift from as little as a decade ago, smartphones have become ubiquitous enough that the same habit is likely to become common worldwide. It seems likely to be particularly appealing for refugees or other migrants in unstable situations when keeping track of one smartphone is easier than a large sheaf of paperwork.</p><p>Finally, VDCs are a step-change in the accuracy and ease of verifying documents online. Physical documents are particularly vulnerable to forgery when presented online, particularly in the post-AI era. Presenting a passport as a digital photo, for instance, makes it impossible to accurately check physical security features like a hologram. A digital signature, by contrast, can be confirmed by a website or kiosk as quickly and accurately as by a human operating a scanning device. This dramatically increases the reliability of immigration and travel management through remote online portals.</p> A Safer, Freer World <p>The United States is pursuing VDC-based international travel systems in significant part because the technology comports with Western democratic values. VDC technology is easy to use to work outside of omnipresent surveillance while surpassing the trustworthiness of paper documents.</p><p>SpruceID’s work with the Department of Homeland Security is part of a broader U.S. national strategy to <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/National-Strategy-to-Advance-Privacy-Preserving-Data-Sharing-and-Analytics.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">push VDCs</a> and other privacy-preserving digital technology forward. We hope to help drive adoption outside of the U.S. as well, with potentially substantial benefits for privacy and security worldwide.</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/customer-highlight/dhs-highlight?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Learn About SpruceID’s Work With DHS</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) has long been a cornerstone of effective access management in enterprises. However, in the Digital Era, where every business is increasingly a software business, relying on digital services as competitive differentiators, traditional IGA approaches fall short. Organizations must rethink IGA to address the complexities of diverse workforces, fast-evolving application landscapes, and stringent compliance requirements.</p>
 Why Traditional IGA Falls Short 
<p>Adapting to a digital-first and fast-changing environment</p>
<p>Traditional IGA was designed for stable, hierarchical organizations with predictable application environments and largely static workforces. Its core components—role-based access control (RBAC), periodic access certifications, and manual entitlement management—were sufficient in the era of on-premises IT and long development cycles. But today’s reality is fundamentally different.</p>
 
 A dynamic workforce:&nbsp;Employment models now include contractors, freelancers, and remote workers. Many of these users require temporary, highly specific access to systems, making static role models impractical. 
 Changing work environments:&nbsp;Remote work has become a standard. Even as some companies attempt to bring employees back to offices, the flexibility demanded by workers is here to stay. 
 Rapid application turnover:&nbsp;Cloud services dominate, with applications being procured, retired, and updated at unprecedented speeds. The rise of shadow IT—applications purchased without IT oversight—further complicates governance. 
 Autonomous agents:&nbsp;AI-powered bots and other automated components are increasingly acting on behalf of users, requiring precise governance of their access rights. 
 
<p>The slow, manual processes of traditional IGA—like assigning roles and performing access reviews at six-month intervals—cannot keep up with this rapid pace of change.</p>
 The Need for Modernized IGA 
<p>Agility, automation, and compliance for the digital enterprise</p>
<p>Modern IGA must be reimagined with agility and automation at its core. Businesses need solutions that enable rapid responses to changing needs while maintaining compliance with ever-stricter regulatory requirements, such as those governing sensitive financial data and personally identifiable information (PII).</p>
<p>Key characteristics of modern IGA include:</p>
 
 Policy-based entitlements:&nbsp;Moving away from static role models to automated, policy-driven assignment of access rights. This ensures that access is dynamically adjusted based on contextual factors, such as job function or project requirements. 
 Time-restricted access:&nbsp;Temporary access rights, particularly for contractors or project-based work, reduce the risk of lingering permissions and simplify access management. 
 Rapid onboarding and offboarding:&nbsp;Automated onboarding processes ensure that new applications and users are integrated into governance frameworks quickly and securely, minimizing manual intervention. 
 GenAI-backed tools:&nbsp;Leveraging generative AI for tasks such as application onboarding and policy configuration can significantly enhance efficiency while reducing errors. 
 Continuous access certifications:&nbsp;Transitioning from periodic reviews to ongoing monitoring and validation of access rights ensures compliance without the lag of traditional approaches. 
 
 Balancing Speed with Compliance 
<p>Ensuring secure access to sensitive data in real time</p>
<p>While agility is a central tenet of modern IGA, compliance remains a critical priority. Regulators are increasingly focused on ensuring robust controls over access to sensitive data, with substantial penalties for non-compliance. A modern IGA solution must:</p>
 
 Support granular access controls, ensuring only authorized users and entities can access sensitive resources. 
 Provide clear, auditable records of access, ensuring compliance with laws such as GDPR or SOX. 
 Enable proactive risk management through AI-driven insights into potential access violations or unusual patterns. 
 
 Conclusion: IGA for the Digital Future 
<p>Building resilience in a fast-moving, digital-first world</p>
<p>Modernizing IGA is not merely an operational necessity—it’s a competitive advantage. By embracing agile, policy-driven solutions, businesses can ensure that their access management systems are as dynamic as their digital landscapes. This not only strengthens security but also empowers organizations to innovate without fear of non-compliance or inefficiency.</p>
<p>For enterprises aiming to thrive in the Digital Era, rethinking IGA is no longer optional. It’s time to move beyond the traditional and embrace a future-ready approach that aligns with the speed, complexity, and regulatory demands of today’s digital-first world.</p>

<p>Amid the constant changes that organizations endure — whether through personnel decisions, new vendor selection, tech stack updates, or department restructuring — they must ensure sensitive company resources and applications remain secure and are only accessible by authorized users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Managing employee and third-party access privileges to enterprise applications, data, and networks is no easy feat, though it’s crucial to overall security, compliance, and operational efficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, automated user access reviews with <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/identity-fundamentals/identity-and-access-management.html">identity and access management (IAM)</a> systems allow organizations to verify proper user privileges and prevent unauthorized access.</p>

<p>As we enter 2025, data privacy and identity protection will remain some of the hottest topics around. Watch out for the continued meteoric rise of digital identity verification and management, more data privacy laws, tighter regulations around artificial intelligence, and the continued emergence of quantum computing. Here’s our take on what lies ahead:</p>



 
 Digital identity verification and management will take centre stage<br><br>Impersonation and fraud, particularly in banking and finance, have become so prevalent and sophisticated that digital identity verification and management will fast become the go-to solution for protecting customers and building trust, replacing paper-based and other vulnerable systems. We agree with <a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/blog/access-management/iam-predictions-for-2025#:~:text=Deepfake%20risks%20will%20drive%20IAM,lifestyle%20information%2C%20and%20social%20data.">industry predictions</a> that identity will be the “linchpin of business resilience” going forward, and that <a href="https://www.scworld.com/perspective/digital-identity-verification-will-have-a-breakout-year-in-2025">“digital identity verification will have a breakout year in 2025”</a>. There’s likely to be a rush to digital identity wallets and digital and biometric credential verification methods, particularly since regulations like eIDAS 2.0 in the EU are driving the transition to decentralized identity technologies. <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/go-inside-version-3-0-of-the-most-advanced-mobile-wallet-sdk-on-the-market/">Go Inside Version 3.0 of the Most Advanced Mobile Wallet SDK on the Market</a>. Explore our <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/guides/">guides</a>.<br><br> 



 The US will get more state privacy laws, but no federal privacy law<br><br>In an unsurprising development, most pundits agree that the United States’ chances of finally achieving a comprehensive federal privacy law are slim to none in 2025. <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/what-the-us-election-results-may-mean-for-digital-policy">IAPP</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/cyber-security/what-a-new-trump-mandate-could-mean-for-american-data-privacy-rights">TechRadar</a> commentators believe securing bipartisan agreement on such a law is likely to remain elusive under the Republican-controlled Congress, which TechRadar suggests “could leave Americans relying on digital tools to claim back their online privacy for themselves.” Anonyome Labs’ <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo</a> and <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/reclaim/">RECLAIM</a> apps are great examples of proactive consumer privacy tools.<br><br>As always, stepping into the breach from an absent federal privacy law will be state privacy laws, and we’ll see many more of those in 2025. Twenty-six of the 50 US states now have a state privacy law, expanding consumer rights and ratcheting up compliance obligations on business. In 2024, four more state laws came into effect:<br><br><a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/consumer-protection/file-consumer-complaint/consumer-privacy-rights/texas-data-privacy-and-security-act">Texas Data Privacy and Security Act&nbsp;(TDPSA)</a>, effective July 1, 2024<br><a href="https://www.dwt.com/blogs/privacy--security-law-blog/2023/06/florida-digital-bill-of-rights-data-privacy#:~:text=As%20with%20other%20state%20privacy,in%20a%20portable%20and%20readily">Florida Digital Bill of Rights (FDBR)</a>, effective July 1, 2024&nbsp;<br><a href="https://www.doj.state.or.us/media-home/news-media-releases/oregonians-gain-significant-new-consumer-privacy-protections/">Oregon Consumer Privacy Act (OCPA)</a>, effective on July 1, 2024<br><a href="https://archive.legmt.gov/bills/2023/billpdf/SB0384.pdf">Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act (MCDPA)</a>, effective October 1, 2024.<br><br>January 2025 saw four more state privacy laws come into effect—<a href="https://legis.delaware.gov/json/BillDetail/GenerateHtmlDocument?legislationId=140388&amp;legislationTypeId=1&amp;docTypeId=2&amp;legislationName=HB154">Delaware</a>, <a href="https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/alerts/iowa-data-protection-act-what-businesses-need-to-know">Iowa</a>, <a href="https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/new-hampshire-enacts-comprehensive-data-privacy-law">New Hampshire</a>, and <a href="https://www.cliffordchance.com/insights/resources/blogs/talking-tech/en/articles/2024/02/the-new-jersey-data-privacy-law-an-overview.html">New Jersey</a>—and later in 2025, <a href="https://www.akingump.com/en/insights/blogs/ag-data-dive/tennessee-information-protection-act-what-businesses-need-to-know">Tennessee</a> and <a href="https://www.whitecase.com/insight-alert/maryland-enacts-comprehensive-data-privacy-law#:~:text=The%20Maryland%20Online%20Data%20Privacy%20Act%20prohibits%20Controllers%20from%3A,service%20requested%20by%20the%20consumer.">Maryland</a> will introduce theirs.<br><br> 



 Regulation around AI will tighten but privacy and security issues will remain<br><br>Generative AI will be the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2025/01/12/5-generative-ai-trends-to-watch-out-for-in-2025/">thing to watch in 2025</a>, with artificial intelligence becoming integral to core application design and service delivery for its efficiency, UX and cost-saving benefits. But this emerging tech will also remain acutely challenging, particularly from a data privacy and security perspective.<br><br>Regulation around AI will tighten in 2025, but the <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/shaping-the-future-a-dynamic-taxonomy-for-ai-privacy-risks">IAPP</a> puts a good question: “While there is a consensus AI should be regulated, and there are increasing efforts in this sense — such as the highly anticipated EU AI Act [and <a href="https://www.skadden.com/insights/publications/2024/06/colorados-landmark-ai-act">Colorado’s AI Act</a>] — the fact is AI privacy risks remain uncharted waters, leaving both AI practitioners and privacy professionals with a feeling of unease. After all, since AI technologies are advancing faster than regulation, how should privacy pros approach AI privacy risks in a way that makes new products viable, while safeguarding data subjects’ rights?” It’s a question that may linger well beyond 2025.<br><br>The <a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/shaping-the-future-a-dynamic-taxonomy-for-ai-privacy-risks">IAPP</a> highlights these 12 risks from AI, which come from Carnegie Mellon University and Oxford University’s adaptation of earlier work by <a href="https://www.danielsolove.com/">Professor Daniel Solove</a>:<br><br>Surveillance:&nbsp;AI exacerbates surveillance risks by increasing the scale and ubiquity of personal data collection.<br>Identification:&nbsp;AI technologies enable automated identity linking across various data sources, increasing risks related to personal identity exposure.<br>Aggregation:&nbsp;AI combines various pieces of data about a person to make inferences, creating risks of privacy invasion.<br>Phrenology and physiognomy:&nbsp;AI infers personality or social attributes from physical characteristics, a new risk category not in Solove’s taxonomy.<br>Secondary use:&nbsp;AI exacerbates use of personal data for purposes other than originally intended through repurposing data.<br>Exclusion:&nbsp;AI makes failure to inform or give control to users over how their data is used worse through opaque data practices.<br>Insecurity:&nbsp;AI’s data requirements and storage practices risk of data leaks and improper access.<br>Exposure:&nbsp;AI can reveal sensitive information, such as through generative AI techniques.<br>Distortion:&nbsp;AI’s ability to generate realistic but fake content heightens the spread of false or misleading information.<br>Disclosure:&nbsp;AI can cause improper sharing of data when it infers additional sensitive information from raw data.<br>Increased accessibility:&nbsp;AI makes sensitive information more accessible to a wider audience than intended.<br>Intrusion:&nbsp;AI technologies invade personal space or solitude, often through surveillance measures.<br><br>Debate and developments around these 12 risks from AI (and potentially others) will be a hallmark of 2025.<br><br> 



 Quantum computing will make more headlines<br><br>We were interested to see <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/will-quantum-computers-break-the-internet-4-things-to-know/">quantum computing</a> moving onto the “trends to watch” lists for 2025. The race to quantum computing has been going on for a while now, and things are definitely heating up.<br><br>Many industries have <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/tip/Explore-future-potential-quantum-computing-uses">use cases</a>&nbsp;for quantum computing for simulations (e.g. simulating molecular structures in drug discovery or climate modelling) and optimization (e.g. optimizing shipping routes and flight paths, enhancing machine learning algorithms, or developing advanced materials).&nbsp;But as <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/will-quantum-computers-break-the-internet-4-things-to-know/">we’ve said before</a> the quantum age does present some real <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/will-quantum-computers-break-the-internet-4-things-to-know/">threats</a>, particularly the looming arrival of quantum computers that are sufficiently powerful and error-resistant to break conventional encryption algorithms (RSA, DSS, Diffie-Hellman, TLS/SSL, etc.) and expose the world’s vast stores of secured data.&nbsp;The race is on to <a href="https://www.govtech.com/blogs/lohrmann-on-cybersecurity/quantum-computers-what-is-q-day-and-whats-the-solution">Q-Day</a> and we’ll likely see more about that in 2025.&nbsp;<br><br>The US Government has issued a <a href="http://chrome-extension/efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/media.defense.gov/2023/Aug/21/2003284212/-1/-1/0/CSI-QUANTUM-READINESS.PDF">quantum readiness guide</a> to developing and building capabilities to secure critical information and systems from being compromised by quantum computers.&nbsp;<br><br> 



 More people will worry about data privacy and act to protect their personal information<br><br>Consumers are growing increasingly worried about the safety of their personal information, particularly on social media and around AI. With <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/2024-was-the-biggest-year-for-data-breaches/">2024 recording the biggest and most destructive data breaches</a>, and <a>new stats </a><a>[NB1]</a>&nbsp;showing most people worldwide have already had their personal information stolen, it’s not surprising that people fear <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-data-brokers-find-and-sell-your-personal-information/">data surveillance </a>and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-top-10-ways-bad-actors-use-your-stolen-personal-information/">scammers</a>. Cisco’s annual <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/consumer-privacy-survey.html#~about-the-study">privacy study</a> did, however, reveal that all this worry is making people more proactive about protecting their own data, which can only be a good thing, and tools like Anonyome Labs’ consumer apps <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo</a> and <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/reclaim/">RECLAIM</a> make it easy. <a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/">Anonyome also offers businesses a suite of next generation digital identity and privacy tools.</a>

Whether you're preparing for an employee self-assessment, <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/a-guide-for-salary-negotiation">salary negotiation</a> or conducting a self-appraisal of your own performance, looking inwards objectively feels almost impossible sometimes.</p><p>From formal performance evaluations where job performance needs assessment, to informal self-reflection about workflow and work ethic, seeing outside objectively can be challenging.</p><p>In fact, according to the Harvard Business Review, while 95% of people believe they have strong self-awareness, only 10-15% actually demonstrate true competencies in self-evaluation during behavioral studies. <a>1</a></p><p>So, how can actual self-awareness be increased to match what many people believe they have? </p><p>Read on to explore some performance management skills, and how AI like Kin can help support their growth.</p><p>There are also some example self-evaluation questions at the end, so stay tuned!</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fde8f1809-b778-47af-8437-a2ef09260ec9_1600x1066.jpeg">          </a>Image courtesy Unsplash by Sven Mieke  Understanding the Evaluation Process <p>Self-evaluation, also known as self-review, self-appraisal, or self-assessment, is more than just casual self-reflection—it's a systematic process of assessing individual performance against specific KPIs and competencies, either outlined in a job description, or of personal choosing.</p><p>In short, it’s a way to determine how well someone is meeting their goals.</p><p>While a professional performance evaluation might focus on measurable metrics of job performance like project management outcomes or leadership skills development, personal self-evaluation delves into areas of improvement in behavioral patterns, decision-making abilities, and interactions with friends, family, and team members.</p> Professional Self-Evaluations <p>For a professional evaluation, employees are often asked to consider a review period of the last year's achievements, though some organizations’ performance review processes may be shorter- or longer-term than the past year.</p><p>Human Resources departments often provide a template to guide the employee self-evaluation process, which ensures company-critical questions are answered by team members while allowing for constructive feedback about individual skill sets and core competencies.</p><p>This process is usually accompanied by regular one-on-one meetings with supervisors throughout the year to discuss progress, identify any discrepancies between self-assessment and manager perception, and plan new projects that align with demonstrated strengths.</p> Personal Self-Evaluations <p>On the other hand, personal self-evaluations are often undertaken independently—though some companies do ask their employees to do them. These measure how well personal goals are being reached, often in the context of personal life, such as managing anxiety, learning a new hobby, or building a new habit.</p><p>Templates are available online, but given the personal nature of these evaluations, they don’t need to use standardized worksheets.</p> People are Professional and Personal <p>These two domains—professional and personal evaluation—aren't separate, but instead are inherently connected. According to McKinsey, executives who demonstrate high levels of self-awareness of their personal actions and goals are up to four times more likely to demonstrate strong leadership capabilities. <a>2</a></p><p>This connection exists because the core competencies built by proper self-evaluation, like problem-solving skills, a positive attitude, and teamwork, benefit both areas of life.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fffb55fb9-6e76-4658-8f40-6f14a457c0d3_1600x1200.jpeg">          </a>Image courtesy Unsplash by Nick Morrison  Why Self-Evaluation is Important <p>Self-evaluations help people understand how well they’re doing the things they want to be doing, and how they can improve. This makes it much easier for people to adjust their behavior to reach their goals, whether those goals are professional or personal.</p><p>As such, self-evaluations build the following skills:</p>  <p>Self-Awareness: Understanding personal strengths, weaknesses, and patterns is perhaps the biggest benefit of self-evaluation.</p>  <p>Increased Accountability: Regular evaluation helps show personal control over growth, encouraging people to harness it.</p>  <p>Decision-Making: Regular self-reflection increases self-awareness, which makes appropriate choices about career paths and personal development easier to identify.</p>  <p>Better Goal Setting: Clear self-assessment leads to more realistic and achievable objectives based on skill, money, and time levels.</p>  <p>Stronger Relationships: Greater self-awareness often leads to better communication and collaboration with colleagues, friends, and family alike.</p>  <p>Stress Reduction: Understanding personal patterns and triggers, and having plans in place to support them, helps manage day-to-day pressures more effectively.</p>   The Impact on Professional Growth <p>In professional settings, strong self-evaluation skills can dramatically impact career trajectory. According to Gallup's 2023 State of the Global Workplace report, employees who regularly participate in self-evaluation and feedback processes are 3.6 times more likely to be engaged at work and 2.5 times more likely to report being satisfied with their career progression. <a>3</a></p><p>This advantage comes from multiple factors. Self-aware professionals better understand their strengths and areas of improvement, leading to more targeted skill development. They're also more receptive to constructive feedback during one-on-one meetings, as they've developed the ability to process criticism constructively. Additionally, their enhanced self-awareness often translates to better project management and more effective workplace relationships.</p><p>The impact extends to workflow optimization as well. When employees regularly evaluate their processes and competencies, they can better identify inefficiencies and propose improvements.</p><p>This proactive approach not only enhances individual performance, but as employee engagement and retention are crucial metrics for organizational success today, employee self-awareness benefits companies by maintaining productive workflows and reducing turnover through better job satisfaction.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb66abc5-9412-45ca-8b0d-b25e34ae3cc5_1600x1066.jpeg">          </a>Image courtesy Unsplash by Christian Wiediger  Barriers to Self-Evaluation <p>Because self-evaluation is done by oneself, it faces a unique set of challenges.</p><p>Discrepancies between perception and reality can lead to confirmation bias, causing people to seek information that supports their existing beliefs about their own work, and ignore information that proves them wrong.</p><p>Similarly, emotional attachment to outcomes can cloud judgment of overall performance, as people seek to protect who they love and punish who they don’t.</p><p>And perhaps most challenging, people often lack the structured approach needed to make self-assessment a consistent, productive practice.</p> The Five Core Areas of Self-Evaluation <p>Before diving into actionable guides, it's important to understand the five key areas that a comprehensive, high-performance self-evaluation should cover:</p><p>1. Skills and Knowledge: Assess both technical capabilities and soft skills, identifying areas of expertise and knowledge gaps. For example, a marketing manager might evaluate their proficiency in digital analytics tools, alongside their team leadership abilities and understanding of their actions.</p><p>2. Performance and Achievements: Review specific accomplishments against set goals, including both quantitative metrics (like sales numbers or amount of social outings) and qualitative outcomes (such as improved team dynamics or stronger relationships).</p><p>3. Habits and Behaviors: Examine daily practices, <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/mastering-time-management-a-guide">time management skills</a>, collaboration styles, and both professional and personal conduct. This might include analyzing how a deadline is met, and what <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-continuous-learning-in-your-career">continuous learning</a> strategy is being used, if any.</p><p>4. Personal Growth and Development: Evaluate progress in career development goals, new skill acquisition, and both professional and personal relationships. Consider both formal learning opportunities and <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/the-importance-of-honesty-in-the-workplace">mentoring experiences</a>, whether as a mentor or mentee. This includes assessing how effectively you've engaged with mentoring relationships and contributed to others' personal and professional development while advancing your own.</p><p>5. Values and Satisfaction: Assess alignment between personal values, personal actions, and current role; overall job satisfaction; and work-life balance. This includes examining whether a current position and trajectory <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-a-career-coaching">matches long-term career goals</a>, or whether recent actions build the relationships desired with others.</p> Other Essential Components of Effective Self-Evaluation <p>There are a few more important points to make:</p>  <p>Objectivity is crucial but challenging. The key is focusing on observable behaviors and measurable outcomes rather than interpretations. Instead of thinking "I'm bad at presentations," consider the specific aspects that prompt that thought, like "My last three presentations went over time by an average of 10 minutes." This will make it easier to tackle.</p>  <p>Evidence-based assessment requires collecting concrete data. This might mean tracking project completion times at work, or monitoring emotional responses to specific situations in personal life.</p>  <p>Self-evaluations are most useful when accompanied by <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/guide-to-achievable-effective-goal-setting">effective goal-setting </a>and dedication to creating a plan to reach those goals. The evaluations help people understand where they are in that plan, and what they need to adjust to advance further.</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F67cb31a2-fb93-428b-87ae-a5af3d558232_1600x1202.jpeg">          </a>Image courtesy Unsplash by Imagine Buddy  How to Write Effective Self-Evaluations <p>Now, as promised. Writing a self-evaluation for any purpose requires a structured approach, similar to the one below:</p>  <p>Decide What’s Being Evaluated: Whether it's professional performance, or a personal goal to learn crochet, ensure what’s being examined is clear.<br></p>  <p>Start with Data: Gather concrete examples and metrics of personal and/or professional performance. Include project outcomes, feedback received, conversations, and situations that feel indicative of performance.<br></p>  <p>Use the STAR Method: When describing achievements, use the Situation, Task, Action, Result format to make it easier to understand. For example:</p>  <p>"When our team faced a 20% decline in social media engagement (Situation), I was tasked with improving our content strategy (Task). I implemented a new content calendar and engagement tracking system (Action), resulting in a 45% increase in engagement over three months (Result)."<br></p>    <p>Be Specific and Honest: Instead of evaluating communication skills as ‘good’, write down the reasoning behind that—e.g. '“led 12 client presentations, was well-received by 9, and had three complain about the talking speed and lack of slide detail.”<br></p>  <p>Consider Meanings: Self-evaluations exist to promote thought. Consider why things went the way they did, and how the good things can be maintained and improved, as well as how the bad things can be avoided.</p>   Building a Self-Evaluation Routine <p>Second only to a good evaluation structure is a good evaluation routine. Without regular revisiting and re-application, self-evaluations are not being used to their full potential.</p><p>Start by choosing specific times for evaluation—perhaps Sunday evenings for weekly reviews and the last day of each month for broader assessments. Based on the goal progress being evaluated, create templates or frameworks to guide these sessions,</p><p>Regular one-on-one meetings with mentors or supervisors should be considered if possible, too. These can help identify any discrepancies between self-perception and reality, while also offering opportunities to discuss new projects and learning opportunities.</p><p>For more tips on building routines, check out our guides on <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/mastering-time-management-a-guide">time management</a> and <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/guide-to-achievable-effective-goal-setting">effective goal-setting</a> guides.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b4070dc-ab9a-4585-a0dd-39467dc01f92_1600x1064.jpeg">          </a>Image courtesy Unsplash by Aaron Burden  How Technology Enhances Self-Evaluation <p>Today, technology has made effective and regular self-evaluation easier than ever. Phones and laptops mean digital calendars, reminders, and personal assistants can track events and provide reminders at any time or place, while AI tools like personal AI can prompt and even assist in self-evaluation based on a user’s data.</p><p>Online project management tools can even allow tracking of personal and professional progress in real-time across <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/5-ways-to-build-trust-in-digital-workplaces">remote teams</a>, so anyone can understand their workflow from anywhere.</p> How Kin Supports Self-Evaluation  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F276d1ef0-8128-4250-8c64-cb47d4f9331f_849x1591.png">          </a> <p>Personal AI has emerged as a particularly powerful tool for self-evaluation, and we feel <a href="https://mykin.ai/">Kin </a>is a great example of that.</p><p>Kin's ability to provide emotionally intelligent conversation and guidance for its users during self-evaluation makes these introspections less biased, judgment-free, and more profound, while its advanced memory system recalls every past situation and self-evaluation shared with it.</p><p>This allows Kin to build a comprehensive, visual picture of someone’s personality, and, unlike traditional journaling or note-taking apps, Kin actively evaluates this information against a user’s stated goals to estimate progress, identify trends, provide insights, and highlight potential areas and solutions for improvement.</p><p>Users can even ask Kin to create notification reminders for things they might forget, or the next time they’d like to evaluate themselves.</p><p>And, all of this happens with <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/privacy-kin-personal-ai">strict data privacy</a>, as Kin stores and processes information local-first. This means it stores everything on the user’s device unless a process must use a Kin-approved third party in the cloud. That ensures that the personal data and insights Kin stores remain secure and private.</p> Get Started Today <p>Sound helpful?

<p>If you're reading this article you're more than likely familiar with decentralized finance (DeFi) and decentralized exchanges (DEX). And you may even be familiar with DEX aggregators who essentially search DeFi platforms like Uniswap for the optimal price on your trade and finalize the trade without navigating to the platforms themselves. DEX Ags also enable what's known as a non-custodial trading experience whereas trades are executed directly from the users wallet rather than being required to deposit the funds to the aggregators wallet. </p><p>In addition to optimal pricing and shear convenience, DEX Ags provide price impact protection by dividing trades of illiquid pairs across multiple exchanges thereby reducing price impact and affording better prices. Intent based aggregators are the most advanced form of DEX Ags and provide protection from a type of bot induced price exploitation called maximum extractable value (MEV) that has cost unaware traders over 1 billion $USD. </p><p>Intent Based Ags not only aggregate on-chain liquidity across exchanges and other aggregators, they also delegate execution to third parties referred to as "solvers". Solvers provide additional sources of liquidity by holding private inventory and matching trades peer-to-peer. This method avoids protocol fees and provides some of the best trades in DeFi.  </p><p>CoW Swap is an Intent Based Meta DEX aggregator that utilizes solvers and additional features including MEV protection. Any time you make a DeFi trade whether its in the form of trading token pairs or NFTs or lending tokens to a liquidity pool, opportunistic users, typically known as "searchers", may manipulate your trades resulting in poor prices, failed execution, and missed opportunities.  CoW Swap eliminates this issue as it's engineered and built with MEV protection. CoW Swap also provides users with an array of order types to choose from including:</p>  Market orders  Limit orders   TWAP orders - allow trades to be distributed over time   Programmatic orders - customizable, conditional orders that fire when certain on-chain conditions are met including asset prices, wallet balances, elapsed time and more.  CoW Hooks - allows users to pair any Ethereum action or set of actions with an order on the CoW Protocol while leveraging solvers to execute the actions together in sequence.   <p>CoW Swap is not only the largest Intent Based Aggregators, it's also one of largest DEX Ag's in the world and in November 2024 settled $6.2 billion USD of trades - more than twice as much volume as all intent based aggregators combined. Yet with a market cap of $236 million USD, CoW Swap (ticker COW) remains relatively unknown to the market and undervalued. Even with its recent move from around $0.25 to its current price of $0.78, there is plenty of upside potential from here especially considering the nearly $8 billion USD market cap touted by Uniswap.

This is due to the massive impact of security and governance risks arising due to issues in managing access controls such as over-entitlements and gaps in enforcing the least privilege principle, Segregation of Duties (SoD) violations, and access governance controls. There are several access-related security risks in today’s organizations that have a direct impact on business, including but not limited to, intellectual property theft, business fraud in ERP systems including SOD conflicts and other policy violations, reputational damage due to the loss of customer information and privacy-related data, and many more. Thus, an adequate access governance framework is essential for organizations dealing with continually changing paradigms of security and risk management.

            <p>Thales reaffirms its commitment to gender equality and diversity by signing up to the 7 “<a href="https://www.weps.org/">Women’s Empowerment Principles</a>” established by the United Nations Global Compact and UN Women, to promote women’s roles in the business world and ensure gender equality.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We must continue to encourage more women to pursue careers in science and mathematics – starting at an early age – to provide them with the same career opportunities as men and enable them to thrive in a safe and inclusive working environment. Thales has made encouraging progress, but we need to accelerate our efforts to achieve gender equality at all levels,” said Patrice Caine, Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer of Thales.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since 2017, Thales has implemented a Gender Diversity Action Plan to accelerate the recruitment of women across all its professions, support their development through dedicated mentoring programmes, and enhance their promotion to the highest levels of responsibility while increasing their representation on Management Committees.</p>
<p>By the end of 2023, women held 20.4% of leadership positions at Thales, compared to 16.5% in 2018. In parallel, 86.8% of the company’s Management Committees included at least three women, up from 49% in 2018.</p>
<p>The company’s target for 2026 is to have 22.5% of leadership roles filled by women and at least 75% of Management Committees comprising at least four women. For more information on Thales's initiatives supporting gender equality and diversity, please consult <a href="https://www2.thalesgroup.com/2024/rapport-integre/index-en.html">the 2023-2024 Integrated Report.</a></p>

<p>Imagine needing to notarize an important document, but the nearest notary is miles away. The alternative? Sending a photo of your ID via email or uploading a selfie to a platform. While convenient, these methods are rife with vulnerabilities—photos can be stolen, identities forged, and trust compromised. Enter liveness detection, a technology that ensures the person verifying their identity is physically present and not a spoof created with static images or videos.</p>



<p>Here’s a look at how liveness detection transforms workflows like notarizing identity documents and why businesses should move beyond outdated methods like selfie uploads or emailed IDs.</p>



 



 The Traditional Workflow: Notary Visits and Emailed IDs 



<p>In a manual identity verification process, a customer gathers their identity documents and heads to a notary. The notary inspects the ID, validates it against the customer’s appearance, and notarizes the document.</p>



<p>Alternatively, some platforms ask customers to email a photo of their ID and a selfie for verification. While these steps eliminate travel, they introduce new risks:</p>



 
 Photo Spoofing: Fraudsters can easily find or fabricate a customer’s image from online searches. 



 Static Verification Flaws: Static selfies and emailed images lack the depth to confirm whether the person is present. 



 Trust Erosion: Customers are increasingly wary of sharing sensitive documents via unsecured emails. 
 



<p>These workflows can be time-consuming, risky, and frustrating for customers and businesses alike.</p>



 



 The Liveness Detection Revolution 



<p>Liveness detection changes the game by verifying that an individual is physically present during the identity verification process. Unlike static photos or emails, this technology uses advanced algorithms to detect subtle, dynamic cues—like blinking, head movement, or depth perception—to confirm the presence of a real person.</p>



<p>Here’s how this plays out in a modern, digital verification process:</p>



 Step 1: Customer Initiates Verification 



<p>Using a secure KYC or KYB portal, the customer is prompted to upload a government-issued ID and participate in a quick liveness detection session.</p>



 Step 2: Liveness Detection in Action 



<p>The system guides the customer through simple actions, such as turning their head or blinking, while simultaneously scanning their biometric features. These real-time movements make it nearly impossible for fraudsters to use photos, videos, or masks to spoof the system.</p>



 Step 3: Automated Cross-Checks 



<p>Advanced AI validates the ID’s authenticity, matches it to the live biometric data, and cross-references the information against global sanctions lists or other risk databases.</p>



 Step 4: Instant Results 



<p>Within seconds, the verification is complete, and the business receives a secure, detailed report confirming the customer’s identity.</p>



 



 Why Selfie Uploads and Emailed IDs Are Risky 



<p>While selfie uploads and emailed IDs are still common, they’re increasingly insufficient in today’s threat landscape:</p>



 
 Easy to Spoof: With a simple Google search or basic editing tools, fraudsters can create convincing forgeries. 



 Lack of Depth Analysis: Static photos can’t confirm whether a person is physically present. 



 Data Security Concerns: Sensitive documents sent via email are prone to breaches and unauthorized access. 
 



<p>For businesses focused on security, compliance, and trust, relying on these outdated methods is no longer viable.</p>



 



 The Role of KYC and KYB Portals 



<p>With integrated KYC and KYB portals, businesses can deliver secure, seamless identity verification at scale. Here’s how these solutions enhance the liveness detection process:</p>



 
 Scalability: Both individual customers and businesses can verify identities in real-time without the need for physical presence. 



 Privacy-First Architecture: Biometric data is processed securely, adhering to regulations like GDPR. 



 Ease of Use: Customers enjoy a frictionless experience, completing verification from their smartphone or computer in minutes. 



 Compliance Made Simple: Built-in checks for AML regulations and global sanctions ensure adherence to the highest standards. 
 



<p>Whether verifying a customer for a financial transaction or conducting due diligence on a new business partner, these portals provide an all-in-one solution for secure identity verification.</p>



 



 Building Trust Through Better Verification 



<p>Liveness detection isn’t just about meeting regulatory requirements—it’s about building trust in every interaction. When customers know that their identities are verified securely, they’re more likely to engage confidently with your business.</p>



<p>For businesses, adopting advanced liveness detection technologies through KYC and KYB portals reduces fraud, streamlines workflows, and protects sensitive data. It’s a win-win for compliance and customer satisfaction.</p>



 



 The Future of Secure Verification 



<p>As fraudsters become more sophisticated, businesses must stay one step ahead. Liveness detection, paired with robust KYC and KYB solutions, offers a secure, scalable way to verify identities while delivering a seamless user experience.</p>



<p>Gone are the days of emailing IDs or relying on static selfies. The future of identity verification is dynamic, secure, and designed to build trust at every step. Whether notarizing an identity document or verifying a business partner, liveness detection ensures that the person on the other side of the screen is exactly who they claim to be.</p>

  <p>The Identity Fabric paradigm has established as the guiding principle for building modern Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) infrastructures. Since the introduction by KuppingerCole Analysts more than five years ago, many organizations have adopted this concept to streamline their IAM architecture, portfolio, and investments. With the newest release of the Identity Fabric, KuppingerCole Analysts provides an updated framework that not only reflects the evolution of IAM with respect to supported identity types and technologies, but also provides additional perspectives and layers to help organizations shape their own Identity Fabric for human and non-human identities. The Reference Architecture as second major framework of KuppingerCole Analysts adds more detail to the Identity fabric by going more into detail on IAM.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will look back at the evolution of the Identity Fabric and provide insights into the guiding principles of the Identity Fabric, serving both as a fabric producing identity services and a mesh connecting different elements within the IAM infrastructure of organizations.</p>
<p>Dr. Phillip Messerschmidt, Lead Advisor at KuppingerCole Analysts, will dive deeper into the most recent versions of the Identity Fabric and the Reference Architecture, providing insights into what is new, why we’ve added and changed certain elements, and how this helps organizations on their IAM journey. He also will elaborate on why and how the Identity Fabric and the Reference Architecture help future-proofing your Identity Security environment.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/future-proofing-your-iam"></a>

				  One of the key benefits of Verifiable Credentials is the time savings from reduction in repetitive, manual data entry. Here we will examine just how much time can be saved by using decentralized identity to automatically fill in information for us.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By: Tim Spring</p>
<p>The time cost of forms</p>
<p>How many hours a year do you spend filling out forms? While it might seem like an annoyance that comes up every now and then, the <a href="https://americaninnovators.com/">US Chamber of Commerce Technology Engagement Center</a> released a report in 2022 that found that the government has <a href="https://americaninnovators.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Government-Digitization-Transforming-Government-to-Better-Serve-Americans.pdf">9,881 unique forms</a>, which took an estimated 10.3 billion hours to complete.</p>
<p>And these numbers are only increasing, if you use the tool provided by the <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAReport?operation=11">Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs</a> and apply it to 2024 numbers, you can see that we are up to almost 12.3 billion hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are five stand out departments with the most forms and impact. 2022 numbers provided by the <a href="https://americaninnovators.com/">US Chamber of Commerce Technology Engagement Center</a> report:</p>
<p>Department of the Treasury: 1,838 forms&nbsp;</p>
<p>Department of Health and Human Services 1,242 forms&nbsp;</p>
<p>Department of Agriculture 553 forms&nbsp;</p>
<p>Department of Commerce 437 forms&nbsp;</p>
<p>Federal Communications Commission 436 forms</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why there is so much paperwork to see a doctor? Or why you need to fill it in every time? It could have something to do with the 1,242 federal forms that the hospital or clinic will need to fill out to comply with the department of Health and Human services, not to mention updating your own charts and patient data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accuracy and user experience improvement</p>
<p>What we could all benefit from is a way to create authenticated data once and reuse it often —&nbsp; instantly, conveniently, with the touch of a button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is where Verifiable Credentials come to the rescue, the thing that will make you say “why haven’t we been doing this before?” Verifiable credentials can store any authenticated data (and especially personal data) in a tamper-proof way and allow the user to share it without the need for the verifier to check in with the source. Think of your web browser’s autofill function that remembers your name, email address, phone number, etc, but for the real world. These credentials can store any information that could be on that doctor’s form, such as height, eye color, name, address, or medical history, and share it accurately, instantly. Which is particularly handy because if you need a doctor, you’re probably not in the mood to do paperwork.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The usefulness grows exponentially when you take a look at what this technology can do for organizations. An <a href="https://www.aha.org/">American Hospital Association</a> survey found that there are 6,120 hospitals in the United States, and between them had admitted <a href="https://www.aha.org/statistics/fast-facts-us-hospitals">33,679,935 patients</a> in 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fraud reduction</p>
<p>Aside from the time saved from not having to manually enter all this patient data, businesses can benefit in the form of eliminating human error and reducing fraud. If you have almost 33.7 million forms to fill out annually, there are going to be some errors or fraudulent information, which often take time and money to correct. By sharing pre-authenticated data digitally (which is what is inside a Verifiable Credential) you can instantly trust the data and use it however you need, such as verifying a patient’s identity and medical history to begin treatment. This technology also enables biometric patient check-in, which reduces fraud (getting treated under someone else’s name) or giving the incorrect medications due to not reliably identifying the patient as they leave the waiting room for treatment.</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials have already seen traction in several industries for their ability to fast-track processes. An excellent example of this is in airports and travel, where their authenticated data can be used for pre-authorization for each traveler and leads to significantly faster international border and border crossing. To learn more about this use case you can read a <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-landmark-in-digital-travel-aruba-indicio-and-sita-combine-a-dtc-and-iata-oneid-for-international-flights/">recent article from Indicio.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one enjoys paperwork, it is a necessary part of life, but it doesn’t need to be such a big part.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Osman Celik</a></p>Organizations of all sizes, from small businesses to large enterprises and government agencies, are responsible for managing complex networks. These networks often include a combination of on-premises infrastructure, cloud services, and hybrid environments, which can make them more challenging to monitor and secure. For these organizations, ensuring network performance is critical for maintaining business operations and for detecting and responding to potential security threats. Failing to monitor and analyze network traffic can lead to undetected performance issues, bottlenecks, and security vulnerabilities. The growing use of encryption at the network layer, while necessary for protecting sensitive data, presents additional challenges for network visibility and security. This is particularly concerning as emerging cybersecurity threats, such as ransomware, advanced persistent threats (APTs), and zero-day exploits, continue to evolve and target network infrastructures. Additionally, organizations must navigate a stringent regulatory environment, where compliance with data privacy and security standards is mandatory. Failure to comply with these regulations not only increases the risk of penalties but also exposes the organization to reputational damage. Today, the majority of organizations rely on firewalls, security information and event management (SIEM), and endpoint protection detection and response (EPDR) tools to prevent threats from accessing the network. However, in many cases, these solutions are inadequate in one or more of the following areas.

<p>Bitcoin traded below $90,000 for the first time in more than 3 weeks and below it's 50-day monthly EMA around $93,000. Opportunistic bulls more than likely added to their holdings in this range while short term bears and momentum traders cover their shorts to lock in profits. For those looking for an entry point, this may be a solid opportunity to wade into the market. </p><p>If you take a look at the daily Coinbase chart for January 13th 2025, you'll see a long wick rising from the lows of the day below 90,000 to nearly turn positive for the day. Similar action occurred during the two days prior possibly indicating the formation of a triple bottom. </p><p>The 6-hour chart below shows the rise from the lows on heavy volume with nearly twice the amount trading hands compared to the prior 6 hour window. </p><p>Over the next 24 to 48 hours, the price should continue to rise to at least test $95-$96K and may rapidly accelerate back over $100K and on to new all-time highs.

Aquí te compartimos 5 tendencias clave para este año:</p>



 1. Ecosistemas integrados con identidades verificables 



<p>Imagina a un estudiante universitario que utiliza su credencial digital emitida por su institución para acceder a una cuenta fintech, contratar un seguro médico, alquilar una vivienda de confianza, resolver situaciones académicas y disfrutar de beneficios exclusivos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Esta interoperabilidad ya es una realidad gracias a soluciones basadas en SSI, como IDConnect de Extrimian, que resuelven problemas de identidad y verificación al conectar múltiples verticales en un solo ecosistema. Durante este año, veremos más adopción, más atracción y mayor sinergia entre actores e industrias.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p> Not with a bang but a whimper&nbsp; 
<p>The department said it was alerted to the <a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/remote-support-saas-service-security-investigation">incident</a> on December 8th by BeyondTrust, an identity security services provider that offers remote technical support to Treasury employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further investigation revealed that the breach originated within BeyondTrust's systems, where attackers infiltrated some of the company's Remote Support SaaS instances by making use of a compromised Remote Support SaaS API key. As a result, the attackers were able to bypass the service's security and access employee workstations and unclassified documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On January 6th, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/cisa-update-treasury-breach">announced</a> that there was no indication that the cyberattack had affected other federal agencies. However, this is one of the latest examples of cybersecurity breaches attributed to Chinese state-sponsored groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 "Dripping water penetrates the stone, not by force but by persistence." – Chinese proverb&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>Last year, agencies from the United States (CISA, NSA, FBI), Australia (ACSC), Canada (CCCS), and New Zealand (NCSC-NZ) <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhanced-visibility-and-hardening-guidance-communications-infrastructure">warned</a> that Chinese hackers were targeting global telecommunications providers. According to Deputy National Security Advisor Anne Neuberger revealed, the federal government launched an investigation into a major incident, revealing that the Chinese campaign targeted the networks of AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and other telecoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>FBI Director Christopher Wray <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/director-wrays-remarks-for-the-fbi-all-employee-town-hall-address">described</a> the telecom breach as China’s “most significant cyber espionage campaign in history.” Officials believe that a large number of Americans (mostly from the Washington-Virginia area) may have had their metadata compromised, including users' calls, text messages, date and time stamps, source and destination IP addresses, and phone numbers. The Chinese government has denied the allegations, and its Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Beijing condemns all forms of hacking and foreign interference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Globally, the incident serves as a wake-up call for public and private organizations that manage sensitive or critical data. The increasing frequency of state-sponsored attacks demonstrates the need to adopt advanced cybersecurity architectures, such as Zero Trust, combined with real-time threat intelligence sharing and cross-border incident response capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 The pragmatic approach&nbsp; 
<p>To improve cybersecurity in key industries, organizations need to be prepared for an increased level of malicious activities. When an incident occurs, business <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/business-continuity-cloud">continuity</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/business-resilience/business-resilience-guide">resilience</a> are essential. The former is about preventing or minimizing the impact of adversity on the normal state of operations, while the latter is about addressing challenges and adapting to changing conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As analysts, our goal is to provide practical advice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some recommendations:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Network Segmentation: Use network segmentation to limit an attacker's lateral movement. Keep sensitive data and systems isolated.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Implement Zero Trust Architecture: This <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80826/zero-trust-network-access">model</a> treats every user, application, or resource as untrusted and enforces strict security, access control, and comprehensive auditing to ensure visibility and accountability of all user activities.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Leverage ITDR: ITDR is a crucial component of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, as identities have become the primary targets of attackers looking to gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems and information. For more on <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80828/identity-threat-detection-and-response-itdr-iam-meets-the-soc#heading5">ITDR</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Prioritize Monitoring and Threat Detection: Organizations can use advanced monitoring tools such as <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81117/endpoint-protection-detection-response-epdr">EPDR</a> and <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80923/extended-detection-and-response-xdr">XDR</a> to detect unusual activity and respond to emerging risks proactively.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Supply Chain Security: Verify that vendors and partners meet stringent cybersecurity requirements. Find more on SSCS <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81221/software-supply-chain-security">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Mobile Network Security Frameworks: If you're a telecom, adopt industry-recognized security frameworks and collaborate on shared standards with global <a href="https://www.gsma.com/about-us/">organizations</a>.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Engage in Public-Private Partnerships: Work closely with government agencies to access resources and expertise.&nbsp; 
 
<p>Since we all face the same threats, the private sector must embrace transparency and mutual support. As discussed in this previous KuppingerCole <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/neuenschwander/reflections-on-the-okta-breaches">blog</a> post, the culture of silence must be left behind - we must share insights, exchange knowledge and work together to strengthen our collective defenses. Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. No single organization can predict where the next threat will emerge or how far it will spread. As Horace, the Roman poet, wisely said, "It is your business when your neighbor's wall is on fire."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In today's interconnected world, to protect one is to protect all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Non-Human Identities (NHIs) are finally making friends and influencing people—or at least they seem to be, given how much people are talking about them! This is great. People need to have a better sense of this brave new world of workloads, bots, and services. But this also means people need to have a better sense of what NHIs are not.</p>



<p>Whether you’re navigating workloads, APIs, or automated systems, the buzz around NHIs reflects their growing significance in everything from cloud computing to academic research. But as with any hot topic, there’s some confusion and waaaaaay too much marketing hype. I’ve written about NHIs <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/04/05/the-evolving-landscape-of-non-human-identity/">before</a>; today’s focus is on some of the main areas NHIs are different from human identities. The distinctions matter. </p>



 What NHIs Are Not 



<p>NHIs aren’t just API keys or OAuth tokens. Treating them as such would be like calling a password or a passkey a person’s digital identity—it oversimplifies their function and importance. Tokens, keys, and even credentials like X.509 certificates might help manage access, but they’re tools in the more extensive toolkit of workload identity management. (<a href="https://www.natoma.id/">Natoma</a> has published an interesting <a href="https://www.natoma.id/library/machine-to-machine-identity-maturity">white paper</a> on machine-to-machine authentication if you’re interested in more detail.)</p>



<p>NHIs represent software entities like batch processes, machine learning training models, or microservices operating independently of human identities. They operate at different speeds and have different selective disclosure requirements (yes, NHI <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-prorock-spice-use-cases/">use cases</a> may include the need for selective disclosure). Proving who they are to access other systems or resources goes beyond simple authentication. Unlike human authentication, which often revolves around confirming a single user’s identity via passwords, passkeys, or biometrics, NHIs must establish trust and authorization in highly dynamic, machine-driven environments.</p>



 Comparing NHIs and Human Identities 



<p>Part of what makes understanding that NHIs are different is that, if you tilt your head just right, their requirements sound very familiar. They need to demonstrate their identity and the purpose and scope of their request. They benefit from cryptographic proofs, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) or X.509 certificates, to securely bind their identity to a specific action. They have a lifecycle that must be managed. And let’s not forget they may need to cross trust boundaries in a federated workflow.</p>



<p>I’ll go into more detail next, but here’s the summary for those who want to get straight to the good stuff.</p>



LayerHuman IdentitiesNon-Human Identities (NHIs)Contextual ValidationRole-based access; occasional risk checksTask-specific; continuous granular checksCryptographic AssurancePasswords, passkeys, MFAJWTs, OAuth tokens, mTLS, certificatesDynamic/Ephemeral IdentitiesPersistent, lifecycle-drivenTransient, task-drivenCross-Boundary TrustSSO, federation (SAML, OIDC)Federated workload identities, SPIFFE



 Contextual Validation 



<p>For Human Identities:</p>



 
 Humans typically authenticate using static credentials like passwords, passkeys, or biometric scans. 



 Access is often role-based, with permissions tied to organizational hierarchies or specific job functions (e.g., an employee accessing their email). 



 Context, like geolocation or time of access, may be used for risk-based decisions (e.g., blocking a login attempt from an unusual location). 
 



<p>For NHIs:</p>



 
 NHIs rely on detailed, task-specific validation. For example, a microservice might only <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol/">access</a> a database during specific operational windows and for specific query types. 



 Permissions are highly granular and tied to the NHI’s role in a larger process, such as allowing read-only access to one API endpoint while granting full control over another. 



 Unlike humans, NHIs may operate across various environments, requiring continuous validation at scale. 
 



 Cryptographic Assurance 



<p>For Human Identities:</p>



 
 Credentials often include usernames, passwords, or passkeys, validated via a central authentication server. 



 Additional layers like multi-factor authentication (MFA) involve OTPs or hardware tokens, but the process remains human-centric. 
 



<p>For NHIs:</p>



 
 NHIs use cryptographic credentials, such as JWTs, OAuth tokens, or X.509 certificates, to prove their identity and integrity. 



 These credentials are <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-wimse-arch/">typically</a> short-lived and dynamically issued, ensuring they can’t be reused if intercepted. 



 Cryptographic proofs (e.g., mutual TLS) are used to establish secure, trust-bound connections between services. Unlike humans, NHIs don’t rely on password-based authentication, making credential management more complex and secure when implemented correctly. 
 



 Dynamic and Ephemeral Identities 



<p>For Human Identities:</p>



 
 Human identities are persistent and change only during significant lifecycle events, such as onboarding, promotions, or terminations. 



 Joiner/mover/leaver workflows handle these transitions in directories like Active Directory or IAM systems. 
 



<p>For NHIs:</p>



 
 NHIs are transient and may exist for just seconds or minutes, such as a containerized workload in Kubernetes that spins up to handle a specific task. 



 Unlike human-centric workflows, they require dynamic provisioning and de-provisioning of identities without manual intervention. (It would be nice if human-centric flows did this, too, but that’s not common. Yet.) 



 The absence of a natural lifecycle like “hiring” or “firing” makes traditional directory models ineffective for NHIs. 
 



 Cross-Boundary Trust 



<p>For Human Identities:</p>



 
 Trust boundaries for humans are typically managed within a single organization or via federated identity systems like SAML or OpenID Connect. 



 Federated access is often used to enable single sign-on (SSO) across organizational or application boundaries. 
 



<p>For NHIs:</p>



 
 NHIs frequently operate in multi-cloud or hybrid environments, where they must authenticate across disparate trust domains. 



 Identity federation for NHIs requires advanced mechanisms, such as SPIFFE or OAuth token exchanges, to securely share identity and permissions between services in different ecosystems. 



 Unlike humans, NHIs may not have a single source of truth (like an HR system), necessitating more robust and decentralized trust models. 
 



 A Better Way to Think About NHIs 



<p>If you’re still thinking that NHIs belong in your human identity systems, I’m just not sure what to tell you. I would say we can agree to disagree, but getting this wrong has implications for how everyone interacts online, so I will continue to make a stand on this hill. NHIs require a different approach to identity management, including:</p>



<p>• Workload Identity Federation: To seamlessly authenticate across cloud providers.</p>



<p>• Dynamic Secrets and Token-Based Authentication: To enhance security and minimize exposure risks.</p>



<p>• Standards Efforts Like <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/wimse/about/">WIMSE</a> and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/spice/about/">SPICE</a>: To ensure consistent, secure service interactions.</p>



 Final Thoughts 



<p>Embracing NHIs means rethinking your identity systems and recognizing that traditional identity paradigms need to evolve. I know it’s hard work and requires even more resources for your IAM programs, but NHIs are not magic. They cannot bring security and efficiency to your organization without investment. There are vendors out there (I am not one of them) who can guide you through designing or redesigning your systems to account for NHIs. You’ve got this.</p>



<p>If you or your organization <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/07/07/introducing-digital-identity-standards-development-service-for-executives/">need support</a> with standards development, let me know. With my experience across various SDOs, I’m here to help guide you through the complexities of Internet standards development.</p>

<p>What is a Validator? If you’ve ever wondered about the role of validators in blockchain networks, you’re not alone. Validators are the backbone of Proof of Stake (PoS) systems, ensuring security, consensus, and reliability. They verify transactions, propose blocks, and uphold the network’s rules. As the blockchain ecosystem evolves, understanding validators is key to appreciating how decentralized systems function efficiently and sustainably.</p>

 What is a validator?&nbsp; 



<p>A validator is a crucial participant in blockchain networks, responsible for verifying transactions, maintaining consensus, and ensuring the network’s security. In Proof of Stake (PoS) systems, validators are chosen based on the tokens they stake as collateral. The more they stake, the higher their chances of validating new blocks.</p>



<p>Validators verify transactions, propose new blocks, and uphold the network’s rules. They are rewarded for honest actions but risk losing their staked tokens if they act maliciously. This system ensures network security and fairness.</p>



<p>Validators play a vital role in maintaining the decentralization, security, and reliability of blockchain networks, making them essential to the system’s success.</p>

 What does being a validator mean? 



<p>Being a validator means becoming a cornerstone of a blockchain network, tasked with upholding its security, efficiency, and trustworthiness. Validators are essential for ensuring the smooth operation of decentralized systems. Here’s what the role involves:</p>



 
 Verifying Transactions: Validators check that each transaction meets the network’s rules, such as having valid signatures, sufficient account balances, and no double-spending. For instance, Ethereum 2.0 requires validators to process thousands of transactions daily to keep the network functional.<br> 



 Validating Blocks: They review and approve new blocks by verifying the transactions within them. Once approved, these blocks are added to the blockchain permanently. Validators ensure these blocks adhere to the consensus protocol, whether it’s Proof of Stake (PoS) or Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS).<br> 



 Maintaining Consensus: Validators participate in consensus mechanisms like Ethereum’s PoS, where they use staked tokens to confirm the blockchain’s current state. This process ensures all participants agree on the network’s data and prevents malicious activities like creating conflicting chains.<br> 



 Ensuring Network Security: Validators act as the first line of defense against cyberattacks, such as 51% attacks or double-spending. Their diligence protects the blockchain from being compromised. For example, on networks like Solana, validators contribute to processing over 65,000 transactions per second, showcasing their critical role in network performance. 
 



<p>Being a validator also comes with incentives—validators earn rewards like transaction fees or newly minted tokens for their work. However, the role demands responsibility: validators in PoS systems risk losing their staked tokens if they act dishonestly, ensuring they always operate in the network’s best interest.</p>



<p>Ultimately, being a validator is not just about technical tasks – it’s about ensuring the blockchain remains decentralized, transparent, and trustworthy for everyone.</p>

 Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake (PoW vs. PoS) 



<p><a href="https://blog.herond.org/proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-what-is-different/">Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS)</a> are the two most popular consensus mechanisms in blockchain. Both play a crucial role in securing networks and maintaining operations, but they differ significantly in their approaches, energy consumption, and efficiency.</p>



 Proof of Work (PoW) 



<p>PoW is the original consensus mechanism, used by blockchains like Bitcoin.</p>



 
 How it works: Miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems using computational power. The first to solve the problem adds a new block to the blockchain. 



 Rewards: Miners earn cryptocurrency and transaction fees for their efforts. 



 Challenges: PoW is highly energy-intensive and requires expensive hardware, leading to high operational costs and significant environmental impact. 
 



<p>Example: According to Digiconomist, Bitcoin’s annual energy consumption is comparable to that of small countries like Argentina.</p>



 Proof of Stake (PoS) 



<p>PoS is a more modern and energy-efficient consensus mechanism, used by blockchains like Ethereum 2.0 and Cardano.</p>



 
 How it works: Validators “stake” a certain amount of cryptocurrency to gain the right to verify transactions and propose new blocks. 



 Rewards: Validators earn rewards based on the amount they stake. 



 Advantages: PoS is far more energy-efficient and scalable than PoW, making it more environmentally friendly and suitable for large-scale applications. 
 



<p>Example: After Ethereum transitioned from PoW to PoS (known as the Ethereum Merge), its energy consumption decreased by 99.95%, highlighting PoS’s sustainability.</p>



 Key Comparisons 



CriteriaProof of Work (PoW)Proof of Stake (PoS)Energy ConsumptionHighLowMechanismBased on computational powerBased on staked tokensScalabilityLimitedHighOperational CostsExpensiveAffordable



<p>Both PoW and PoS have their strengths and weaknesses, serving different purposes. While PoW laid the foundation for blockchain technology, PoS is emerging as the preferred choice for its energy efficiency and scalability. The transition of Ethereum from PoW to PoS exemplifies the industry’s move toward more sustainable solutions for the future of blockchain.</p>


 
 


 Validators Vs. Miners: What’s the Difference? 



<p>In blockchain networks, validators and miners serve different purposes depending on the consensus mechanism used. Here’s a simple breakdown of their roles and differences:</p>



 Validators: The Backbone of Proof of Stake (PoS) 



<p>Validators are responsible for verifying transactions and approving blocks in Proof of Stake (PoS) systems. Instead of relying on computational power, they “stake” tokens as collateral to gain the right to validate transactions. Their tasks include:</p>



 
 Ensuring transactions follow network rules. 



 Proposing and validating new blocks. 



 Maintaining the blockchain’s consensus efficiently. 
 



<p>Validators are rewarded with transaction fees or newly minted tokens, but they risk losing their staked tokens if they act dishonestly. PoS mechanisms, used by networks like Ethereum 2.0 and Solana, are known for being energy-efficient and scalable.</p>



 Miners: The Workhorses of Proof of Work (PoW) 



<p>Miners, on the other hand, play a crucial role in Proof of Work (PoW) systems. They compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles using computational power, and the first to solve the puzzle gets to add a new block to the blockchain. Their rewards include:</p>



 
 Newly minted cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin block rewards). 



 Transaction fees for processing transactions. 
 



<p>However, mining is resource-intensive and requires significant energy, making it less sustainable than PoS systems. PoW mechanisms, like those used in Bitcoin, rely on high computational power to maintain security and decentralization.</p>



 Key Differences 



 
 Energy Usage: Validators (PoS) use far less energy compared to miners (PoW). 



 Mechanism: Validators stake tokens, while miners rely on solving puzzles. 



 Efficiency: PoS systems are faster and more scalable, while PoW systems are more energy-intensive but highly secure. 
 



 Insightful Example 



<p>The shift from PoW to PoS, as seen in Ethereum’s Merge update, highlights the growing preference for validator-based systems. Ethereum reduced its energy consumption by 99.95% after transitioning to PoS, showcasing how validators are a more sustainable alternative to miners.</p>



<p>In summary, both validators and miners are essential in blockchain networks but serve different functions based on the consensus mechanism. While miners laid the foundation for early blockchain systems like Bitcoin, validators are shaping the future of blockchain with efficient and eco-friendly systems like PoS.</p>


 
 


 How much can you get as a Validator? 



<p>The earnings of a validator in a blockchain network can vary significantly based on several factors, including the network, the number of tokens staked, and the reward mechanism. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how validator rewards work:</p>



 Types of Rewards 



<p>Validators earn rewards through two primary sources:</p>



 
 Newly Minted Tokens: Many blockchain networks, like Ethereum and Solana, distribute newly minted tokens to validators as an incentive. 



 Transaction Fees: Validators also earn a share of the transaction fees collected from users on the network. 
 



<p>For example, Ethereum 2.0 validators can earn an average annual yield of 4-10%, depending on the total amount of ETH staked on the network.</p>



 Factors That Affect Rewards 



<p>The amount a validator earns is influenced by:</p>



 
 Staked Tokens: The more tokens you stake, the higher your chances of being selected to validate transactions and earn rewards. 



 Network Inflation: Some blockchains have fixed inflation rates that determine the amount of newly minted tokens distributed. 



 Performance: Consistently validating transactions accurately ensures maximum rewards, while downtime or mistakes can lead to penalties or slashed tokens. 



 Competition: As the number of validators increases, the rewards are distributed among more participants, which can reduce individual earnings. 
 



<p>For instance, Cosmos validators earn an average annual reward of 7-20%, depending on network parameters and their staking pool size.</p>



 Potential Risks 



<p>While the rewards can be lucrative, becoming a validator comes with risks:</p>



 
 Token Volatility: Rewards are paid in cryptocurrency, so their value can fluctuate with market conditions. 



 Slashing Penalties: Validators can lose a portion of their staked tokens for malicious activities or extended downtime. 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Validators are at the heart of blockchain innovation, particularly in the transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS). By staking tokens, they maintain security, achieve consensus, and drive decentralization—all while earning rewards for their efforts. Whether you’re a blockchain enthusiast or a potential validator, understanding their role highlights the trustless, secure, and energy-efficient future of blockchain technology.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>Oh, how time flies! Can you believe that we’ve been living with ransomware for over a decade already? Sure, a pedantic historian could explain that the first occurrences of malware encrypting files and asking for a ransom to restore access were recorded all the way back in 1989. Yet, it took another couple of decades for IT infrastructures and cryptocurrencies to evolve to a stage when ransomware truly became profitable and turned into a major risk with global impact.</p>
<p>The public probably experienced it for the first time in 2013, when the CryptoLocker ransomware was able to infect over 250,000 systems and netted its creators over $3 million in ransom payments. By 2017, strains like WannaCry and NotPetya became notorious for causing billions in damage around the world, with the latter showing the true weaponization potential of ransomware. In fact, NotPetya’s creators were not even interested in collecting ransom, they just wanted to cause long-lasting damage to their victims.</p>
<p>And ever since, the entire world has been living under the constant fear of a ransomware attack. For many organizations, it has become the existential threat number one, surpassing all other known cybersecurity risks. It’s the combination of immediacy, unpredictability, and the severe consequences of even a single attack that makes it so scary, amplified even further by the lack of a single comprehensive solution to reliably prevent them in the future.</p>
<p>A proper strategy for ransomware prevention must include a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/wp80939/considerations-for-reducing-the-risk-of-ransomware">broad range of measures</a>, proactive and reactive, technology- and process-based, covering a multitude of attack vectors. These include everything from e-mail and web monitoring to endpoint detection and response to network security and identity governance. And yet, for most victims, the most viable scenario of surviving a ransomware attack is not to prevent it, but to contain the damage, restore their disrupted processes, and recover business-critical data as quickly and painlessly as possible…</p>
<p>With this realization, now is the right time to stop thinking about ransomware as malware that just encrypts or steals your files. In fact, it does much more direct and indirect damage than that – and to start thinking of new tools to augment your existing anti-ransomware toolkit. This is especially relevant for backup and disaster recovery. For example, a lot has been written recently about immutable backups as a crucial factor for ransomware resilience. It is a well-known fact that modern ransomware specifically targets backup locations to make the recovery more difficult, but are you sure that you are even doing your backups properly in the first place?</p>
<p>Recently, I attended a presentation of <a href="https://www.oracle.com/engineered-systems/zero-data-loss-recovery-appliance/">Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance</a>, Oracle’s specialized solution for backing up mission-critical databases. While I was familiar with the product already, I was somewhat surprised that the company now positions it as a premier solution for ransomware protection. Wait, what? Do ransomware groups even consider relational databases a viable target? And isn’t Oracle’s own <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/ev70964/oracle-autonomous-database">Autonomous Database</a> with all its built-in security control supposed to be 100% resilient against these attacks anyway? However, the more I was thinking about it, the more sense it all started to make.</p>
<p>First, not even the most hardcore Oracle customers have all their data stored in the Autonomous Database, which is, after all, a managed cloud service. For many industries and applications, sensitive data has to stay on premises at all times. Second, even when the database itself is managed by a service provider, their responsibility does not extend to protecting the integrity of the customer’s data. And finally, ransomware attacks specifically targeting databases (relational and NoSQL) <a href="https://www.imperva.com/blog/postgresql-database-ransomware-analysis/">are not</a> <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/ics-ot-security/turkish-cyber-threat-targets-mssql-servers-mimic-ransomware">unheard</a> of, especially when targeting specific high-profile victims! In the end, having a secure, reliable, and high-performant solution for backing up business-critical data from enterprise databases does make a lot of sense, since it can substantially speed up recovering from a ransomware attack.</p>
<p>Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance (Recovery Appliance) is an engineered system for comprehensive data protection of Oracle databases, ensuring backup immutability, continuous validation, and rapid recovery without data loss, even in the event of a ransomware attack. It integrates natively with Oracle databases to consistently validate backup data, detect anomalies, and enforce retention policies, offering recovery up to the last sub-second before a data loss incident. The appliance supports flexible deployment architectures, including air-gapped Cyber Vaults, to enhance data protection and resilience. By consolidating incremental backups into space-efficient virtual full backups, Recovery Appliance minimizes recovery time while maintaining the highest data integrity and security standards.</p>
<p>Since the appliance is built on Oracle Exadata engineered system that customers leverage today for running the most critical enterprise Oracle databases, it inherits the underlying platform’s performance, scalability, and availability characteristics. And since it natively supports all the internal data structures and protocols of an Oracle Database, it offers unique capabilities that no third-party, especially file-based, backup tool can provide. It can operate in “incremental forever” mode, only capturing small data changes in real time during backup but will reassemble (“materialize”) them into a consistent full copy on the fly when needed for restoration.</p>
<p>Of course, all the backup copies stored by the appliance are immutable, but in addition to that, they are continuously validated for recovery integrity, down to the transaction level. Whenever you need to restore data, you can have peace of mind knowing that it will be free from any tampering or anomalies, whether caused by ransomware or other data compromise, encryption, or corruption scenarios.</p>
<p>To boost the level of security and compliance even further, while still meeting the RTO/RPO requirements, it is possible to deploy the appliance in an “<a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/infrastructure/post/zdlra-logical-airgap">air gap</a>” configuration, further separating backup copies from production data. Whenever a full physical isolation is impossible or impractical, the combination of ZDLRA’s security features (immutable backups, end-to-end encryption, strict access controls, integrity checks) with network segmentation provides a strong level of “logical air-gapping” consistent with NIST best practices.</p>
<p>Recently, Oracle announced Zero Data Loss Autonomous Recovery Service, a cloud-native, Oracle managed counterpart of the on-premises appliance. It offers the same capabilities but in the cloud; in fact, the service is available in all clouds currently partnered with Oracle: Azure, GCP, and AWS. Cloud backups also have a significant advantage of being natively distributed across multiple availability zones, so they remain available even if a zone goes offline. It is even possible to quickly restore a backup to a different region or tenant to deal with catastrophic failures – not just ransomware but natural disasters, like earthquakes or tornadoes.</p>
<p>The company is now working on integrating these two offerings to support hybrid deployments in the future. But even now, according to Oracle, the Recovery Service is projected to become their largest cloud service by total storage volume.</p>
<p>So, will it really protect your organization from ransomware attacks? I’m afraid that asking this kind of question is misleading and even somewhat dangerous. There is simply no single tool or technology that can provide complete protection, given the broad range of vulnerabilities and threat vectors that can be exploited by malicious actors. What it can offer though is a turn-key solution for a specific kind of risk – a risk of losing access or compromising your critical sensitive data.</p>
<p>In a world where ransomware evolves faster than defenses, solutions like Oracle's Recovery Appliance are not just useful tools – they’re lifelines, turning catastrophes into recoverable incidents and keeping your business resilient when it matters most.</p>

 What is social login? 



<p>Social Login is a quick and easy way for users to access websites or apps using their existing social media accounts, like Facebook, Google, or Twitter. Instead of creating new accounts or remembering extra passwords, users can log in with just one click. This not only saves time but also simplifies the user experience, making it easier for platforms to attract and retain users.</p>



<p>In the context of Web3, Social Wallet Login is still a new concept. Traditionally, Web3 users log in using wallet passphrases or private keys, which are long and complex. By integrating Social Login, crypto platforms can bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3, paving the way for broader adoption of blockchain technology.</p>


 
 


 4 popular forms of social wallet logins 



<p>Social wallet logins are becoming increasingly common as they simplify access to platforms. Here are four widely used types:</p>



 
 Facebook Login: With over 2.9 billion monthly users worldwide, Facebook Login is one of the most popular options. It allows users to sign in quickly using their Facebook accounts, making the process seamless and widely accessible. 



 Google Login: Leveraging Google’s vast ecosystem, this method enables users to log in securely and effortlessly with their Google accounts. It’s a convenient option for platforms aiming to tap into Google’s trusted services and user base. 



 Apple ID Login: Tailored for Apple users, this method offers a simple and fast login experience. However, it’s mainly suitable for users within Apple’s ecosystem, like iPhone or MacBook owners. 



 LinkedIn Login: Often used in professional settings, LinkedIn Login is perfect for platforms requiring professional profiles or credentials. It’s ideal for job portals, networking sites, and other career-focused applications. 
 



<p>Each form of social wallet login offers unique benefits, helping users connect to platforms effortlessly while enhancing overall user experience.</p>

 The importance of integrating Social Wallet Login into Crypto Web3 Wallets 



<p>Integrating Social Wallet Login into Web3 wallets is a game-changer, especially in the crypto world where user adoption still faces hurdles. Here’s why it’s important:</p>



 
 Simplifying User Experience: Traditional Web3 wallets require users to manage complex private keys or passphrases, which can be intimidating. Social Wallet Login simplifies this by allowing users to log in with familiar social media accounts, making the process faster and less overwhelming. 



 Recovering Access Made Easy: Losing private keys can lead to losing access to crypto assets permanently. Social Login ties wallets to recoverable social accounts, ensuring users can regain access if they forget their credentials. 



 Encouraging Adoption: By offering a seamless and familiar login process, Social Wallet Login lowers the barrier to entry for new users, encouraging broader adoption of crypto wallets and decentralized apps (dApps). 



 Enhanced Identity Verification (KYC): Social media accounts often have built-in identity verification. Integrating these into Web3 wallets can streamline KYC processes, especially for decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms that require compliance. 
 



<p>This integration not only boosts convenience but also paves the way for mass adoption of Web3 by bridging the gap between traditional users and the complexities of blockchain technology.</p>

<p>Metaverse real estate is here and changing the game. Imagine owning virtual land where you can create anything like stores, offices, or even theme parks – in a limitless digital world. Secured as NFTs on the blockchain, these properties are transparent, secure, and full of potential. Whether you’re an investor or just exploring, let’s dive into how metaverse real estate is shaping the future.</p>



<p>Learn more: <a href="https://blog.herond.org/everything-you-need-to-know-about-non-fungible-tokens-nft/">Everything You Need to Know About Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)</a></p>



 What is Virtual Real Estate? 



<p>Virtual real estate is exactly what it sounds like – digital land and properties that exist in the metaverse, a growing network of 3D virtual spaces. Think of it as the online version of real-world real estate, where you can buy, sell, lease, or even build on digital plots of land. These properties can host anything from virtual events and storefronts to galleries, offices, or even homes, creating spaces where people can connect and interact.</p>



<p>What makes virtual real estate unique is that it’s secured on the blockchain, with ownership recorded as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). This means every transaction is transparent, secure, and impossible to tamper with. Just like in the physical world, the value of these properties depends on location, utility, and how much engagement they attract. For example, virtual plots in high-traffic areas of the metaverse are like owning prime real estate on a busy city street.</p>



<p>As more people and businesses embrace the metaverse, virtual real estate is becoming a new frontier for investment and creativity. It’s not just about owning digital land – it’s about reimagining how we use space in a virtual world, with the only limit being your imagination.</p>

 5 differences between Metaverse Real Estate and Traditional Real Estate 



<p>Metaverse real estate is reshaping how we think about property ownership. Unlike physical land, virtual properties exist entirely in a digital world, offering new opportunities and challenges. Here’s a closer look at how metaverse real estate differs from traditional real estate.</p>



 Digital vs. Physical Space 



<p>Traditional real estate is tangible—it’s land, buildings, and spaces you can physically see and touch. Metaverse real estate, on the other hand, exists in a virtual environment. These digital plots of land are represented as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on the blockchain, giving them a unique identity and ownership record. While you can’t step on virtual land, it can host everything from virtual concerts to digital storefronts.</p>



 Unlimited Creativity 



<p>Physical properties are often bound by zoning laws, structural limitations, and geographic constraints. In the metaverse, your imagination sets the boundaries. A small virtual plot can become a sprawling digital park or a towering skyscraper. There are no construction permits to worry about—just the platform’s technological capabilities and your vision.</p>



 How Value Is Determined 



<p>The value of physical real estate depends on factors like location, infrastructure, and nearby amenities. In the metaverse, value is driven by virtual foot traffic, proximity to popular digital spaces, and platform demand. A virtual plot next to a well-known NFT gallery or popular digital event venue can be worth significantly more than a less trafficked location.</p>



 Buying and Selling 



<p>Traditional real estate transactions involve lawyers, agents, and mountains of paperwork. In the metaverse, buying or selling property is fast, secure, and transparent. Transactions are handled on the blockchain, often using cryptocurrencies, and ownership is represented by NFTs. There’s no need for middlemen, making the process quick and hassle-free.</p>



 Maintenance and Upkeep 



<p>Owning physical property comes with ongoing responsibilities like repairs, renovations, and property taxes. Virtual real estate, however, requires digital upkeep, such as updating software, securing against hacks, or improving user experience. It’s generally less costly and time-consuming compared to maintaining a physical property.</p>

 The future of Metaverse real estate: is it the next big investment? 



<p>Mark Zuckerberg, one of the most prominent advocates for the metaverse, stated in 2022:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The metaverse will not be built by one company. It will be built by creators and developers making new experiences and digital items that are interoperable and unlock a massively larger creative economy than anything we see today.”</p>



<p>This highlights the potential of metaverse real estate as a collaborative ecosystem where virtual spaces will serve as hubs for interaction, commerce, and innovation.</p>



<p>Unlike physical real estate, virtual properties are free from geographic constraints, offering unique ways to host events, build experiences, and engage audiences. However, the technology is still evolving, with challenges like simplifying property transactions and improving user interfaces. Despite these hurdles, the growing interest in web3 and the metaverse indicates strong potential for future growth.</p>



<p>For investors, metaverse real estate offers both opportunities and risks. While early adopters have seen impressive returns, the market remains speculative and heavily reliant on technological advancements. Whether it becomes the “next big thing” or stays niche will depend on how quickly society embraces this digital frontier.</p>


 
 


 What was the biggest metaverse real estate purchase to date? 



<p>The largest metaverse real estate transaction to date took place in May 2022, when Curzio Research acquired 19 commercial properties in TCG World for a staggering $5 million. This record-breaking purchase eclipsed previous high-profile deals, such as Republic Realm’s $4.3 million investment in The Sandbox in November 2021. These monumental transactions underscore the surging interest and value in virtual real estate, as the metaverse increasingly becomes a viable frontier for business and investment opportunities.</p>



 Notable Success Stories in Metaverse Real Estate 



<p>Beyond these headline-grabbing transactions, several projects have demonstrated the practical utility and profitability of virtual real estate, showcasing the diversity and possibilities within the metaverse:</p>



 Decentraland’s Genesis Plaza: A Gateway to the Metaverse 



<p>Located at the center of Decentraland, Genesis Plaza is more than just a landmark—it’s a community hub. With interactive exhibits and art installations, this space serves as a welcoming zone for newcomers to the platform. It highlights the potential of creating virtual communal areas that foster engagement, creativity, and exploration in the metaverse.</p>



 CryptoVoxels’ Neon District: A Commercial Hotspot 



<p>The Neon District in CryptoVoxels is a vibrant, bustling zone filled with galleries, shops, and entertainment hubs. Known for its unique blend of blockchain technology and virtual reality, it attracts significant digital foot traffic, making it one of the most sought-after locations for virtual properties. It’s a testament to how commercial zones can thrive in virtual spaces by offering immersive experiences.</p>



 The Sandbox’s Atari Theme Park: Where Gaming Meets Real Estate 



<p>A collaboration between The Sandbox and the legendary gaming brand Atari, this virtual theme park redefines entertainment in the metaverse. With virtual roller coasters, arcade zones, and other attractions, it highlights the lucrative potential of partnerships between traditional brands and virtual platforms, drawing both investors and users alike.</p>



 Program-Ace’s MetaOffice: Redefining Corporate Collaboration 



<p>MetaOffice, developed by Program-Ace, brings a revolutionary approach to corporate workspaces in the metaverse. Designed for both PC and VR users, it supports presentations, collaborations, and even casual relaxation in immersive environments. With advanced features like full-body tracking, facial animations, and the capacity to host up to 32 participants per server, MetaOffice showcases how virtual real estate can transform professional interactions, making them more dynamic and engaging.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Metaverse real estate isn’t just a trend – it’s a digital revolution. While risks exist, the opportunities for creativity, profit, and innovation are endless. As the metaverse grows, owning virtual property could become as valuable as physical land. Ready to explore this new frontier?</p>

<p>Yield farming, often called “liquidity mining,” is a DeFi strategy that lets you earn rewards by putting your crypto assets to work. By providing liquidity to platforms like Uniswap or Curve Finance, you can earn passive income in the form of interest, fees, or tokens. This guide breaks down how yield farming works, the best platforms to use, and the risks you should watch out for before getting started.</p>

 What Is Yield Farming? 



<p>Yield farming, often referred to as “liquidity mining,” is a strategy within the world of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) that enables users to maximize returns on their cryptocurrency holdings. By supplying liquidity to DeFi protocols, participants can earn rewards, typically in the form of governance tokens specific to that platform.</p>



<p>In simple terms, yield farming can be compared to “farming” with crypto assets. Users “plant” their cryptocurrencies into DeFi platforms such as decentralized exchanges (DEXs), lending protocols, or staking pools to “harvest” rewards. These rewards might include interest, transaction fees, or newly minted tokens.</p>



 The role of Yield farming in DeFi ecosystem 



<p>Beyond being a way to generate passive income, yield farming plays a crucial role in fostering the growth and sustainability of the DeFi ecosystem. Platforms rely on liquidity providers (LPs) to keep the system operational, ensuring there is sufficient liquidity for borrowing, lending, and trading activities. For users, this offers an opportunity to not only earn but also actively support decentralized financial innovation.</p>



<p>Interesting to note is how yield farming rewards have transformed over time. Initially, governance tokens like COMP (from Compound) or CRV (from Curve Finance) dominated the rewards landscape. Today, some platforms experiment with hybrid incentives, including stablecoins, cross-chain rewards, or even NFT collectibles, further diversifying yield farming’s appeal and applicability.</p>

 How Does Yield Farming Work? 



<p>Yield farming operates on the foundation of the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model, where Liquidity Providers (LPs) play a central role. LPs provide liquidity by depositing their cryptocurrency assets into liquidity pools—smart contracts that hold funds to facilitate decentralized financial activities such as lending, borrowing, and token trading.</p>



 The Basic Process: 



 
 Providing Liquidity to a Pool:<br>Users deposit their crypto assets (e.g., ETH or USDT) into liquidity pools. In return, they receive a share of the transaction fees generated within the pool, such as those from token swaps or lending activities. 



 Earning Rewards:<br>Beyond transaction fees, many protocols incentivize liquidity provision by distributing additional rewards, often in the form of governance tokens or newly issued platform tokens (a process known as Liquidity Mining). These rewards encourage LPs to continuously supply liquidity, thereby supporting the platform’s growth. 



 Smart Contract Coordination:<br>Smart contracts manage the entire process, including locking LPs’ assets, calculating their share of rewards, and automating transactions within the pool. These contracts ensure transparency, security, and efficiency. 
 


 
 


 Which Platforms Are Best for Yield Farming? 



<p>Choosing the best yield farming platform depends on individual goals and investment strategies. Below are some of the most prominent platforms, known for their stability, attractive yields, and advanced features:</p>



 Uniswap 



<p>Uniswap, one of the most popular platforms in DeFi, is renowned for its Automated Market Maker (AMM) model. Users supply liquidity to pools and earn rewards through transaction fees. It’s an ideal choice for those seeking a transparent, user-friendly, and straightforward solution.</p>



 Curve Finance 



<p>Focused on stablecoins, Curve Finance minimizes price volatility risks. Liquidity providers earn interest, transaction fees, and CRV tokens as rewards. This platform is perfect for investors favoring stability and long-term returns.</p>



 Compound 



<p>Compound offers competitive interest rates for lending and borrowing crypto assets. Liquidity providers earn dual rewards: interest from loans and COMP tokens, creating a lucrative dual-income stream.</p>



 Aave 



<p>Aave stands out for its flash loans and flexible lending protocols. The platform also features rate switching, allowing users to toggle between fixed and variable interest rates, providing greater control over asset management.</p>



 Beefy Finance 



<p>As a yield optimizer, Beefy Finance aggregates over 600 vaults to maximize APY (Annual Percentage Yield) automatically. Its automated harvesting process minimizes gas fees, making it an efficient option for yield maximization.</p>



 yEarn Finance 



<p>yEarn Finance optimizes profits by automatically reallocating assets to the most profitable protocols. This hands-free approach is perfect for users who want high returns without actively monitoring the market.</p>



 Synthetix 



<p>Synthetix enables users to mint synthetic assets like sUSD and use them to provide liquidity on other platforms. This allows for multi-source income optimization across various protocols.</p>



 Radix 



<p>A rising blockchain platform, Radix offers yield farming opportunities with APR rates up to 50%. However, users should note that some Radix protocols require KYC (Know Your Customer) verification for bridging, making it more restrictive than other platforms.</p>



 5 Risks to Watch Out for in Yield Farming 



<p>Yield farming offers an enticing opportunity to maximize profits from crypto assets, but it also comes with significant risks. Here are the top 5 risks users should consider before diving in:</p>



 Smart Contract Vulnerabilities 



<p>Yield farming heavily relies on smart contracts, which are not always thoroughly audited. Projects developed by smaller teams with limited budgets are particularly prone to bugs and security breaches. Even audited protocols like Curve Finance and Bzrx have faced exploitation, highlighting the importance of understanding contract risks.</p>



 Impermanent Loss 



<p>Impermanent loss occurs when token prices in a liquidity pool fluctuate significantly, reducing the total value of assets compared to simply holding them. This risk is common in platforms like Uniswap and Balancer, especially during periods of high market volatility.</p>



 Price Volatility and Liquidation Risks 



<p>DeFi assets used as collateral can be liquidated if their value drops sharply due to market volatility. Users must closely monitor collateral ratios to avoid losing their positions.</p>



 Rug Pull Scams 



<p>Rug pulls involve project developers launching a token, attracting liquidity from users, and then selling off their holdings, draining the pool’s funds and rendering the token worthless. This is a major risk with unverified or low-reputation projects.</p>



 Liquidity Depletion 



<p>Liquidity in pools can vanish quickly if many users withdraw their assets simultaneously. This creates high slippage, where users receive less than expected when exchanging tokens. Additionally, locking tokens in pools reduces flexibility to respond to market changes.</p>


 
 


 Conclusion 



<p>Yield farming offers an exciting way to grow your crypto assets while supporting the DeFi ecosystem. By understanding the risks and choosing the right platforms, you can make the most of this innovative investment strategy. As always, careful research and risk management are key.</p>

 DeFi vs. TradFi: A Tale of Two Workforces (and a Whole Lot More) 
<p>As an avid blockchain user and developer, one of the more common questions I reecive from non-technical family and friends is "where and how does blockchain technology make money?". The answer to this very valid question could be explained using complex blockchain vernacular or boiled down to a few familiar business metrics and statistics. In this article we'll look at the impact legacy and blockchain technologies have on employment in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Traditional Finance (TradFi) industries. The numbers may surprise some and be a cause for concern for others, especially for those in the TradFi industry.</p>
<p>DeFi has emerged as a disruptive force in the financial world, challenging the established norms of traditional finance (TradFi). While many discussions focus on the technological underpinnings and financial mechanisms, a key differentiator often overlooked is the stark contrast in organizational structure and the number of employees required to operate. This difference has profound implications for efficiency, accessibility, and the overall nature of financial services.</p>
<p>Let's explore this contrast by comparing a DeFi giant like Uniswap with a traditional centralized exchange operating within the US banking system.</p>
<p>Uniswap: The Lean, Mean, DeFi Machine</p>
<p>Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Ethereum blockchain. It operates using automated market makers (AMMs), which rely on smart contracts to facilitate trading. These smart contracts automatically execute trades based on pre-defined algorithms and liquidity pools provided by users.</p>
 
 Minimal Human Intervention: The core functionality of Uniswap requires virtually no human intervention for day-to-day operations. There's no need for order books managed by human traders, no settlement processes requiring back-office staff, and no need for extensive customer support teams to handle trade execution issues. 
 Small Core Team: Uniswap Labs, the company initially behind Uniswap's development, focuses primarily on protocol development and upgrades. The core team is relatively small compared to traditional financial institutions. The protocol itself operates autonomously once deployed. Uniswap employs approximately 140-190 people. 
 Community Governance: Governance of the Uniswap protocol is largely decentralized, with UNI token holders having voting rights on proposals for protocol changes. This further reduces the need for a large internal management structure while extending the arm of decentralized opportunity across the globe. 
 
<p>Traditional Exchanges: The Workforce Heavyweights</p>
<p>In contrast, traditional centralized exchanges and other financial institutions within the US banking system require significantly larger workforces. Consider a typical stock exchange or a large bank:</p>
 
 Extensive Operations Staff: These institutions require numerous employees for various functions, including:
 
 Trading Desk: Traders execute orders, manage risk, and ensure market stability. 
 Back Office: Settlement, clearing, and reconciliation processes require substantial human oversight. 
 Compliance and Legal: Strict regulatory requirements necessitate large compliance and legal teams. 
 Customer Service: Handling customer inquiries, resolving issues, and providing support requires a large customer service department. 
 IT and Security: Maintaining complex IT infrastructure and ensuring security requires dedicated teams. 
 
 
 Hierarchical Structure: Traditional financial institutions typically have complex hierarchical structures with multiple layers of management, further increasing the number of employees. The average TradFi company listed on the NASDAQ employs 5000+ People. 
 
<p>The Implications of Workforce Size</p>
<p>The difference in workforce size between DeFi and TradFi has several important implications:</p>
 
 Efficiency: DeFi protocols like Uniswap can operate with significantly lower overhead costs due to their minimal staffing needs. This can translate to lower fees for users. 
 Accessibility: Decentralization and automation can make financial services more accessible to a wider audience, as there's less reliance on physical branches and human interaction. 
 Transparency: Smart contracts are publicly auditable, offering greater transparency compared to the often opaque operations of traditional financial institutions. 
 Security Considerations: While DeFi offers transparency, it also introduces new security challenges related to smart contract vulnerabilities and exploits. The smaller teams may have limited resources to address these issues compared to the larger security teams of TradFi. 
 Regulatory Scrutiny: DeFi's decentralized nature makes it challenging for regulators to oversee. This lack of regulatory clarity created a period of uncertainty and slowed wider adoption until the SEC, CFTC and Central Banks worldwide began to relax their stance a few months prior to approving BitCoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) on January 10, 2024.  With 2024 in the rearview along with Bitcoin $100K, regulatory headwinds have clearly shifted to tailwinds while the largest investment banks are slated to invest trillions of $USD in blockchain technology and begin tokenizing real world assets (RWA) in earnest. 
 Estimating the Value: Reports suggest that blockchain deployments could enable banks to save billions on operational costs. For example, one study estimated potential savings of up to $27 billion annually on cross-border settlement transactions by 2030.
 
 Faster Transactions: Blockchain transactions can settle much faster than traditional systems, especially for cross-border payments that can take days to process. 
 24/7 Availability: DeFi markets operate continuously, unlike traditional markets with limited trading hours. This increases capital utilization and allows for greater flexibility. 
 
 
 
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The contrast in workforce size between DeFi platforms like Uniswap and traditional financial institutions highlights a fundamental difference in their operational models. DeFi's reliance on automation and smart contracts allows for lean operations and greater efficiency, while TradFi's complex structures require substantial human capital. This difference has profound implications for the future of finance, with DeFi potentially offering greater accessibility and lower costs, while TradFi continues to provide established regulatory frameworks and well-defined security protocols. As both sectors continue to evolve, it's likely that they will influence and learn from each other, shaping the future of finance in ways we are only beginning to understand. Blockchain technology has incredible potential to foster economic dynamics that result in a much needed modernization of nearly every industry from supplain chain logistics to healthcare to waste management infrastructure and many more.</p>

				  Verifiable credentials are transforming how organizations verify, share, and manage data in new and powerful ways. Discover the top industries where verifiable credentials are reshaping digital interactions and unlocking new possibilities for individuals, businesses, and governments worldwide.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By: Ken Ebert</p>
<p>In the rapidly evolving digital identity landscape, Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are becoming more than just an emerging technology — they are establishing themselves as essential tools for secure, privacy-respecting identity verification. Organizations around the world are deploying this technology to simplify processes, enhance security, and give users control over their data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This blog looks at five of the top use cases for Verifiable Credentials that we see for 2025, providing insight into how this technology is driving efficiency, transparency, and trust. Each example highlights how industries are using VCs to meet the increasing demand for secure, interoperable, and user-centric identity solutions. From improving how we manage biometric data to enabling seamless travel and streamlining compliance in finance, VCs are proving their versatility and value.</p>
<p>International Travel</p>
<p>Using digital identities for domestic proof of identity and travel has already seen some adoption, see our recent article on <a href="https://indicio.tech/what-you-need-to-know-about-mobile-drivers-licenses/">Mobile Driver’s Licenses.</a> But the next step is being able to travel internationally faster and more conveniently. Michael Zureik of SITA recently presented the findings of a proof of concept for <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-landmark-in-digital-travel-aruba-indicio-and-sita-combine-a-dtc-and-iata-oneid-for-international-flights/">flying internationally using a Digital Travel Credential (DTC) and the IATA One ID</a> in collaboration with Indicio, the Government of Aruba, and Delta Airlines. Aruba plans to have their solution operational to all travelers to the island in 2025, but keep an eye out for a quick adoption by other countries and airports.</p>
<p>Biometric Authentication</p>
<p>Biometric authentication solves the problem of passwords and logins for many organizations and users; unfortunately, it still relies on the underlying problem that passwords face: reliance on a centralized database. The solution to removing this reliance on a database is what we call “Bring Your Own Biometrics.” Once a biometric is authenticated, it is issued as a Verifiable Credential. When a person presents for a liveness check, they also present their biometric VC and the relying party compares the liveness check with the biometric in the VC. This solution keeps all of the benefits of biometric authentication, while removing the risk of data breach and reducing liability for the organization. Indicio Deputy CTO Sam Curren recently held an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AgdjIhVw24">in-depth discussion</a> on this topic with real world examples and implementations if you would like to learn more. As data breaches continue to rise and more systems switch to biometric authentication to combat fraud, we see this use case for eliminating databases for sensitive personal information being critical.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<p>Schools of all levels are currently generating a mountain of paperwork per student per year. They need records of each student’s grades, transcripts, awards won, participation in sports or activities, and the list goes on. The current process to verify a student’s accomplishments requires the student to go back to the school and get the documents, and present them to the verifying party, either an employer or a higher education institution, and then for that part to also check in with the school to ensure they are authentic, resulting in a time consuming, manual process. The use of Verifiable Credentials and Open badges 3.0 will allow everyone to skip the wait and be able to immediately verify the student’s accomplishments without the need to check in with the school or a third party system. Students and faculty would also be able to use Verifiable Credentials for identity and access management, allowing users to access their accounts and documents in a faster, more secure, passwordless way. Indicio is already working on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7aOEfmX_BE">implementing this solution for the United School Administrators of Kansas,</a> but this issue applies to everyone in education, and we see the entire industry being quick to adopt once they see the time and cost savings to be had.</p>
<p>Agriculture&nbsp;</p>
<p>Farmers have a lot of data to share. From organic growing practices to emissions data or water usage, they have a lot to keep track of and share with a variety of stakeholders, including regulators, governments, suppliers, and consumers. Historically they have relied on third-party identity providers and centralized databases, which have proven complex to integrate and slow to operate, and can share the farmer’s data without their knowledge or permission. With a decentralized identity approach their information can be shared directly, and can also create a more transparent supply chain and prove provenance. Recently, the Trust Alliance New Zealand in partnership with Indicio and Anonyme Labs has showed that all of this information can be securely held locally in a digital wallet and shared in a decentralized way, offering a faster, simpler approach to data management that saves time and money for everyone that relies on farming data. This solution won the Constellation Research <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-co-developed-digital-farm-wallet-wins-constellation-research-supernova-award/">2024 SuperNova Award</a> for “Digital Safety, Governance, Privacy, and Cybersecurity.” Agriculture and farming is a data intensive activity and we see growing interest and applications for digital farm wallets in 2025.</p>
<p>Finance</p>
<p>No one is targeted more by fraudsters than financial institutions. In fact, it’s likely that your bank receives <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/30/business/voice-deepfakes-bank-scams.html">thousands of deepfake scam phone calls per year</a> trying to gain access to customer accounts. Decentralized identity can stop this problem at its source by providing mutual authentication through DIDComm to both banks and the customers they service before every interaction or transaction, removing the ability for any party to be impersonated. Historically banks have had to identify customers through passwords and MFA, while customers had no way to truly identify their bank without extra due diligence on their part. Fraud prevention and faster customer interactions will be a driving force for finance being a big adopter of Verifiable Credentials and decentralized identity in 2025.</p>

<p>Thales in the UK, in collaboration with the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD), hosted multiple international partners to display the Lightweight Multi-role Missile (LMM) and its capabilities in an air defence and surface attack role.</p>
<p>The demonstration, which took place at Manorbier, successfully delivered a consecutive firing by Thales UK of LMMs at both an air and a sea target. This firing was a first of its kind and demonstrates Thales’ expertise in the air defence and surface attack domain, with LMM pioneering the way in short range defence, providing a seamless back-to-back engagement of incoming threats, proving once again the true versatility and multi-role applications of the missile.</p>
<p>Both the air target (Banshee UAV) and sea target (fast inshore attack craft - FIAC) were successfully destroyed in the engagement which saw two missiles fired within less than 60 seconds, one for each specific target, demonstrating the lethality, agility and technical achievements of the missile. LMM was fired from a vehicle-mounted, lightweight fire control and launching system, produced by Thales in the UK.</p>
<p>The demonstration day was supported by the British Army and Royal Navy, including displays of static equipment such as shoulder and tripod launchers, as well as a Wildcat helicopter that can carry 20 LMM at a time, known as Martlet in the naval domain.</p>

<p>Anonyome Labs has the most advanced&nbsp;decentralized identity&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/">mobile wallet SDK</a>&nbsp;on the market—and the newly released version 3.0 is packed with features that customers can apply to their own products.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new features in the latest version of our DI Mobile Edge Agent SDK represent the bleeding edge of decentralized identity (DI), align with European Union Digital Identity (EUDI) regulations, and maintain the modularity, reliability, and security of <a href="http://anonyome.com/businesses">Anonyome Labs</a>’ products.</p>



<p>Our DI Mobile Edge Agent SDK currently allows customers to easily integrate DI and verifiable credential (VC, or reusable credential) solutions into their applications and now, with version 3.0, these capabilities go even further. The DI Mobile Edge Agent SDKis a native SDK for both iOS and Android, and does not rely on any third party frameworks such as Javascript frameworks.</p>



<p>In nutshell:</p>



 
 Anonyome Labs Edge Agent SDK 3.0 adds support for OpenID4VC (<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0-13.html">OpenID4VCI</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-21.html">OpenID4VP</a>), expanding its suite of protocols for receiving and presenting credentials, in addition to the already supported Aries protocols. 



 Anonyome Labs Edge Agent SDK 3.0 builds on its collection of supported credential formats (Anoncreds and W3C) with the addition of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/">IETF SD-JWT VCs</a>, increasing interoperability and supporting new privacy-preserving use cases. 



 Anonyome Labs Edge Agent SDK 3.0 updates its supported Aries protocols, maintaining interoperability with the latest Aries agents in the ecosystem. 



 Anonyome Labs Edge Agent SDK continues to exist in the ecosystem of Anonyome’s DI offerings, such as in the Anonyome Labs Cloud Agent Service and the Anonyome Labs Decentralized Identity Relay. 



 Having accomplished what was on the roadmap we set out in our <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/5-ways-anonyome-has-improved-its-market-leading-di-mobile-wallet-sdk/">previous article</a>, we’ve outlined our new enhanced roadmap, including continued investment into OpenID4VC capabilities, and expansion for new DID Methods (such as <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/product/architecture/adr-list/adr-001-cheqd-did-method">Cheqd</a>). 
 



<p>Let’s break these down:</p>



 Adds support for OpenID4VC protocols 



<p>With our DI Mobile Edge Agent SDK already having support for Aries protocols for receiving and presenting VCs (<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0453-issue-credential-v2/README.md">Issue Credential</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/401acf391b1470fd0b7bc58b94c1b05588b811b7/features/0454-present-proof-v2/README.md#L4">Present Proof</a>), version 3.0 ventures into the new OpenID4VC protocol suite (<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0-13.html">OpenID4VCI</a> and <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0-21.html">OpenID4VP</a>).</p>



<p>This move allows for wider interoperability with the DI ecosystem, including within the EUDI ecosystem where these protocols are being used in technical specifications (such as the <a href="https://eu-digital-identity-wallet.github.io/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/latest/arf/">Architecture Reference Framework</a>) and pilot deployments.</p>



<p>These new protocols also help achieve new use cases and wallet UX flows alongside the existing Aries protocol’s use cases. A few of the notable differences are:</p>



 
 Being rooted in industry-standard OAuth 2.0 flows, OpenID4VC allows standard OAuth authorization flows to be used in credential issuance flows. 



 Multiple credentials can be offered in the same flow, where the Edge Agent SDK consumer can browse and request the desired credential. 



 The issuer now conveys support for UI display data in the credential exchange, including issuer and credential colors, text, and logos. 



 There’s no prerequisite to establish an existing DIDComm connection. Credential and presentation exchange flows can begin immediately from an initial QR code scan or deep link click. 
 



<p>The possibilities and protocol variations in OpenID4VC are vast. To home in on the variations the Edge Agent SDK will support in this release, we’ve targeted interoperability with the OpenID4VC verifier and issuer capabilities of the popular open-source projects <a href="https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/credo-ts/tree/main/packages/openid4vc">credo-ts</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/acapy-plugins/tree/main/oid4vc">ACA-Py</a>.</p>



 Builds on supported VCs formats, with <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/">IETF SD-JWT VCs</a> 



<p><a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">IETF’s SD-JWT VC</a>s is the latest credential format to enter our Edge Agent’s suite of supported formats, alongside <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C VCs</a> and <a href="https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/">Anoncreds</a>.</p>



<p>Like the new OpenID4VC features, this new credential format enables new use cases and wider interoperability with the DI ecosystem, since SD-JWT VC is a preferred format in the EUDI ecosystem.</p>



<p>SD-JWT VCs are designed with selective disclosure in mind, allowing for the building of user-centric privacy-preserving use cases. Using SD-JWT VC, the holder can selectively choose to hide certain attributes of their credential (if the issuer permits it), so that when they present their credential in some use cases, they present only the bare minimum to satisfy that use case. By default, our Edge Agent SDK will always disclose as little as possible when presenting SD-JWT VCs, protecting the privacy of our consumers.</p>



<p>Our Edge Agent SDK could already support some of these use cases via Anoncreds and the BBS-variant of W3C VCs, but SD-JWT VCs differ from these formats in that they use <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/files/pubs/fips/140-2/upd2/final/docs/fips1402annexa.pdf">NIST FIPS</a>-compliant cryptography—an attractive feat for EUDI regulation.</p>



 Updates supported Aries protocols 



<p>In addition to our major venture into the new OpenID4VC protocol suite, we continue to maintain and expand our Aries protocol suite. Since <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/5-ways-anonyome-has-improved-its-market-leading-di-mobile-wallet-sdk/">2.0</a>, the Edge Agent SDK has added support for the latest Aries connection protocol, <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/features/0023-did-exchange/README.md">DID Exchange</a>.</p>



<p>This new protocol has new UX optimizations for Edge Agent SDK consumers where DIDComm connections can be re-used if a duplicate connection is detected when receiving a DIDComm invitation. But, just as importantly, this feature ensures the Edge Agent SDK remains aligned with the latest Aries Interoperability Profile (AIP).</p>



 Exists in the ecosystem of Anonyome’s DI offerings 



<p>As a market leader in innovative&nbsp;decentralized identity (DI)&nbsp;technology offerings, Anonyome Labs continues to advance its&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/">DI solutions</a>, supporting a wide range of use cases. Our Edge Agent SDK continues to seamlessly integrate with our highly scalable DI message relay solution, the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-relay/">Sudo DI Relay SDK</a>, allowing the edge agent to reliably receive messages from the DIDComm peers it connects with. What’s more, we continue to thoroughly test our Edge Agent against our&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.sudoplatform.com/guides/decentralized-identity/cloud-agent">Cloud Agent Service</a>&nbsp;offering (in addition to a suite of open source DI agents) to make sure all our features remain interoperable in the DI ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



 Rich roadmap ahead 



<p>With this extensive third release, Anonyome’s DI Mobile Edge Agent SDK has once again exceeded its roadmap, going beyond the plan laid out since the <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/5-ways-anonyome-has-improved-its-market-leading-di-mobile-wallet-sdk/">previous release announcement</a>. But we are not slowing down: we plan to keep adding features to every new release of the SDK so our customers’ applications can stay up to date with the latest and greatest in the DI ecosystem.</p>



<p>Going forward for the SDK, we plan to continue updating our OpenID4VC protocol suite. Despite being deployed in many EUDI pilots, OpenID4VC protocols are still in draft status. We plan to stay up to date with these protocols as they approach their official 1.0 release, aligning with the EUDI. We also plan to:</p>



 
 Enhance our OpenID4VC protocol implementations with new capabilities, such as OpenID4VCI’s “Authorization code flow”, enabling use cases where users must perform a standard OAuth login to access a credential

			<p>Luxembourg, 8 January 2025 – <a href="http://tokeny.com">Tokeny</a>, a leading provider of onchain finance solutions, has partnered with <a href="https://ditobanx.com/">Ditobanx</a>, a licensed Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) in El Salvador, to help the country build a standardized framework for tokenized regulated assets and position the nation as a leader in the tokenization era.</p>
<p>By leveraging Tokeny’s proven technology, Ditobanx has successfully overcome the challenges of launching a robust platform to issue, manage, and distribute tokenized assets in a seamless and compliant way, without recreating operational silos. The company plans to issue $300 million in tokenized assets in 2025, with a pipeline of 22 clients ready to onboard.</p>
<p>Ditobanx’s mission goes beyond simplifying investment access through tokenization. The team is committed to building an ecosystem that extends the reach of El Salvador’s securities and enhances liquidity in private markets. This ecosystem vision hinges on collaboration and standardization, ensuring that participants across the financial landscape can connect and operate seamlessly.</p>
<p>Ditobanx, Tokeny, and over 90 industry players are collaborating through the non-profit ERC3643 Association to ensure the adoption of the market standard ERC-3643 (“T-REX”) for compliant tokenization. This standard defines how compliance, permissions, data, and onchain workflows are managed, enabling participants to interact effortlessly within a standardized framework.</p>
<p>However, the lifecycle management of tokenized securities remains complex, involving the integration of both on-chain and off-chain processes and data. Developing an orchestrated platform from scratch is both time-intensive and costly, often taking years to complete. To overcome these challenges, Ditobanx chose Tokeny’s onchain operating system, which enabled them to launch their platform within weeks. This swift deployment allows Ditobanx to focus on their core business while benefiting from a proven and scalable solution.</p>
<p>To ensure that other licensed providers in El Salvador can overcome similar challenges and adopt the market standard, Ditobanx will offer tailored guidance and access to its expertise and tools. By supporting these providers in implementing the ERC-3643 T-REX standard, Ditobanx aims to create a more streamlined and standardized ecosystem across the country, eliminating silos and unlocking the full potential of tokenization through seamless interoperability and open distribution.</p>

		 
	 
    Launching tokenized assets is a complex process, but it is essential for the future of our industry. We believe in making this journey easier for others by sharing what we’ve learned and providing access to proven solutions. Standardization is critical for creating a more connected, liquid, and innovative market, and we are committed to making this vision a reality for El Salvador and beyond.  Guillermo ContrerasCEO of Ditobanx       El Salvador has been a trailblazer in adopting and regulating digital assets, demonstrating an active and forward-thinking approach to innovation. The country is uniquely positioned to take full advantage of the opportunities that tokenization offers. With a visionary partner like Ditobanx, making significant strides toward nationwide standardization, we are proud to support their efforts. By providing the right tools and expertise tailored to local jurisdictions and specific needs, we are enabling institutions across El Salvador to confidently and efficiently embrace tokenization.  Luc FalempinCEO of Tokeny    
	 
		 
			<p>With Tokeny and Ditobanx working together, El Salvador is taking another major step toward making tokenized assets a core part of its economy. This partnership not only creates a clear path for licensed providers to succeed but also builds the foundation for a stronger, more efficient tokenization market that benefits issuers, investors, distributors, and the nation as a whole.</p>

		 
	 
   
	 
		 
			 About Ditobanx 
<p>Ditobanx is a digital financial solutions company dedicated to transforming the way individuals and businesses interact with their finances. With a strong presence in Latin America and plans for expansion, Ditobanx continues to innovate to provide the best financial tools on the market.</p>

For example, regulatory obligations and rising fraud add requirements to an onboarding experience that customers already have strong opinions about. Balancing the growing threat of fraud with the high customer demand for seamless, secure digital experiences creates a challenging environment for institutions trying to evolve their digital services.

  Revolutionizing Customer Identification Procedures (CIP) in 2025

Discover how technology is transforming CIP, enabling businesses to achieve seamless customer experiences, enhance security, and ensure global regulatory compliance.

<p>Customer Identification Procedures (CIP) have long been a cornerstone of regulated industries like financial services and real estate. But for the businesses implementing them, the experience can feel like a balancing act—managing compliance obligations, maintaining security, and delivering a seamless customer experience.</p>



<p>Fast forward to 2025, and technology is reimagining how businesses handle CIP. By replacing manual workflows with scalable, digital-first solutions, companies can verify customers more efficiently, prevent fraud, and ensure global regulatory compliance—all while keeping the customer journey smooth and secure.</p>



 



 The Manual Method: A Customer’s Perspective 



<p>Imagine this: a customer walks into a branch office to verify their identity. They’re armed with multiple documents—government-issued ID, proof of address, and perhaps even supplementary paperwork. A staff member painstakingly photocopies each piece, manually inputs the data into a system, and cross-references it with additional sources.</p>



<p>For the customer, the process is tedious and time-consuming. For the business, it’s an operational bottleneck. Manual CIP methods are prone to:</p>



 
 Delays: Processing times can stretch from hours to days. 



 Errors: Manual data entry increases the risk of inaccuracies. 



 Fraud Risks: Human oversight often fails to detect sophisticated forgery or tampering. 
 



<p>This traditional approach, while once sufficient, is increasingly out of step with modern customer expectations and regulatory demands.</p>



 



 The 2025 CIP Experience: Seamless and Scalable 



<p>Now, imagine a different scenario. The same customer initiates the process from their smartphone. They upload a photo of their government-issued ID and snap a quick selfie. Within seconds, advanced technology verifies the document’s authenticity, matches the selfie to the ID, and cross-checks the data against trusted sources like global sanctions lists.</p>



<p>For businesses managing hundreds—or thousands—of customer verifications, this shift to digital CIP is transformative. Two key innovations are leading this change:</p>



 Turnkey Solutions for KYB and KYC 



<p>Modern CIP platforms are built to handle both Know Your Business (KYB) and Know Your Customer (KYC) needs. These solutions are designed to scale, offering:</p>



 
 Automated Data Validation: Verifications are completed in seconds, reducing wait times and manual effort. 



 Multi-Jurisdictional Support: Compliance with global regulations becomes seamless, even for businesses operating across multiple regions. 



 Biometric Verification: Facial recognition or fingerprint matching adds an extra layer of security, ensuring that identity fraud is mitigated at the source. 
 



 Scalability Without Complexity 



<p>Unlike legacy systems, digital CIP solutions don’t require complex custom builds. Turnkey options like iComply’s KYB and KYC modules allow businesses to roll out fully compliant identity verification systems quickly, without sacrificing flexibility or security.</p>



 



 Building a Smarter CIP Process 



<p>A smarter CIP process isn’t just about speed—it’s about trust, security, and adaptability. In a digital-first approach, businesses can:</p>



 
 Enhance Security with Advanced Technology: AI and biometric tools identify anomalies, verify documents, and flag high-risk profiles in real-time. 



 Ensure Data Privacy Compliance: Privacy-first architectures, such as edge computing, process sensitive customer data locally, meeting regulatory standards like GDPR and CCPA. 



 Reduce Costs and Complexity: By automating processes, businesses can lower operational expenses and eliminate redundant workflows. 
 



<p>For companies like Dye &amp; Durham, where large-scale customer verifications are routine, these advancements make CIP not only a compliance task but also a strategic advantage.</p>



 



 CIP as a Customer-Centric Opportunity 



<p>The days of viewing CIP solely as a regulatory hurdle are over. In 2025, businesses recognize that customer identification is a touchpoint to build trust and loyalty. A seamless onboarding experience shows customers that their data is secure and their time is respected.</p>



<p>By adopting scalable, digital solutions, organizations can enhance their CIP processes without compromising on compliance or the customer experience. The result? Faster, safer, and more reliable identity verification that aligns with both business goals and customer expectations.</p>



<p>In an industry where trust is paramount, turning CIP into a streamlined, secure process is a powerful way to differentiate your business and build lasting relationships.</p>

				  The economic benefits from streamlining cross-border transactions are massive — and decentralized identity provides the digitally transformative infrastructure to do so.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth and Tim Spring</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html">European central bank,</a> global cross-border payments are expected to increase from <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2023/html/ecb.blog231031~85a4bcdee0.en.html">190 trillion USD in 2023 to 290 trillion USD</a> by 2030 as global commerce becomes more digitally integrated.</p>
<p>Yet in practice, cross border payments are complex and difficult for businesses to execute and often punishing for individuals. Currency conversion rates, fees, and regulatory compliance all conspire to slow down and increase the cost of payments in real time; and for remittances —&nbsp;people sending money from one country to another (typically a foreign worker sending money to relatives) — these fees are brutal. According to the World Bank, the <a href="https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/rpw_main_report_and_annex_q224.pdf">average cost</a> of sending a remittance is 6.65% of the amount sent,&nbsp;rising to 8.37% for Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>As a recent World Bank report <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/migration/brief/remittances-knomad">notes</a>, “In more than 60 countries, remittances account for 3 percent or more of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and small/fragile states are more heavily dependent on remittances. As such, it is critical that both remittance senders and receivers have access to a multitude of payment methods and channels in order to deliver and receive remittances in an affordable and fast manner.”</p>
<p>Even a modest 1 percentage point reduction in fees, <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/blog/date/2023/html/ecb.blog231031~85a4bcdee0.en.html">says</a> the European Central Bank’s Fabio Panetta, “would leave those most in need with USD 6 billion in their pockets every year.”</p>
<p>Everyone’s looking for better solutions, with the goal of making cross border payments cheaper, faster, more flexible, and more secure. Here’s how we believe Decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials can deliver those solutions, fast.</p>
 
  Validating account ownership and status 
 
<p>Identity fraud is the specter haunting all financial transactions. The key benefit of a Verifiable Credential solution is cryptographic trust: If you trust the source of a Verifiable Credential, you can trust the contents, and immediately act on the data.</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials enable people or organizations to hold data about themselves, such as the financial account data required to meet “know your customer” and AML requirements. Verifiable Credentials enable people to share and reuse that data in a way that doesn’t require checking in with the original issuer of the information or storing the same data in order to cross check it.</p>
<p>Authentication is seamless because the origin of the credential is instantly verifiable through cryptography. The information in a credential is digitally signed so that any alteration will be instantly detected. And the credential is bound to the person and their device and their digital wallet both by cryptography and biometrics so you can know that it is the rightful owner is presenting their information. The credential can also be programmed to expire or it can be revoked depending on whether its terms of use have been violated.</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials are capable of delivering “government-grade” digital identities that can be bound to biometrics (see 4 below) and verified using simple software anywhere and at any time.</p>
 
  Know Your Customer’s Biometrics (KYCB).&nbsp; 
 
<p>Biometrics are increasingly being incorporated into payments so that you can “pay with your face.” But the rapid rise of generative AI-driven biometric fraud threatens to derail confidence in conventional biometric authentication. Biometric theft represents a much higher existential risk to people than account or password theft. Similarly, the need to store personal biometric data in order to verify it represents a much higher privacy and security risk to all parties involved.</p>
<p>This is where Verifiable Credential technology comes to the rescue. By submitting an authenticated biometric template from a trusted credential provider while performing a liveness check, a relying party has a simple, reliable way to cross check that the person really is the face in front the camera —&nbsp;and without the relying party having to store any biometric data or change their biometric infrastructure.</p>
<p>This “bring your own validated biometrics” approach is driving seamless digital travel, enabling people to seamlessly cross borders. This kind of “government-grade” digital identity is ideal for payments, domestic and international.</p>
 
  Cross-border technical interoperability 
 
<p>Decentralized identity both simplifies the architecture and workflows for sharing data. The first is accomplished by eliminating the need for direct integrations. If you trust the issuer of a credential (Bank A), you can trust the information in the credential, and connect the verifying software to internal systems through an API. This makes data portable and immediately actionable.</p>
<p>Second, it is easy to establish governance rules for how information in a credential is processed. This is because a) there’s a global specification for these governance rules, and b) the rules are encoded in machine-readable files propagated to issuers, holders, and verifiers alike.</p>
<p>In other words, a governance authority can publish a list of trusted credential issuers in a file and send it to every organization with verifying software. A merchant in a village with a mobile verifier on their phone is able to immediately authenticate whether a credential presented has come from a trusted organization. The file can be rapidly updated and, as it is cached, it can be configured to handle offline verification.</p>
<p>While the technical complexities of cross border transactions are not to be underestimated, decentralized identity&nbsp;—&nbsp;and specifically, decentralized ecosystem governance — can radically simplify workflows needed to deliver efficient, cost-effective real-time payments.</p>
 
  Seamless, connected experiences 
 
<p>When you combine Verifiable Credentials with a powerful communications protocol such as DIDComm (Decentralized Identifier Communications), you get even more flexibility. DIDComm enables two powerful features.</p>
<p>First, it is the engine that enables parties to mutually authenticate each other before exchanging any data.</p>
<p>The second is that it allows a mobile device to operate as if it had a very powerful API for data exchange, one that is much more secure than any conventional API. This is groundbreaking, as the inability (for a variety of technical reasons) of mobile phones to use APIs has limited their functionality.</p>
<p>When these two features combine, we have a very powerful way to integrate services in a seamless, secure way. For example, a fintech AI could be permissioned to access and analyze account data in real time.</p>
<p>But the point is that it makes it easy to permission and process any kind of complex workflow between parties; it turns digital wallets and their owners into verifiable data platforms.</p>
 
  Platformless infrastructural transformation 
 
<p>Verifiable Credentials are not a platform. They are not stand-alone systems that replace existing infrastructure; they are, rather, a set of tools you drop into existing systems. Just as a catalytic converter renders harmful emissions less harmful, Verifiable Credentials make the digital data you already have verifiable, portable, private, and secure —&nbsp;and they do so without this data being stored or controlled by the tech developer.</p>
<p>This is critical for data privacy compliance, transparency, and trust. It is the key to why decentralized identity can scale to, and interoperate as, cost-effective global digital infrastructure accessible to all.</p>
<p>The challenge</p>
<p>The travel sector is rapidly transitioning to decentralized identity and “government-grade” digital identities in order to deliver streamlined and more secure customer experiences as global air passenger numbers are set to double in the near future. Airlines and airports get it.</p>
<p>For finance, the challenge is first, to understand how powerful this technology is and how easily it can be deployed to manage the complex tangle of regulatory and technical challenges across multiple stakeholders; second, to then make the policy decisions to allow implementation.</p>
<p>In this, the technology is, in many ways, the easy bit; it’s the talking and coordinating that’s hard.</p>
<p>But there is an incentive for everyone to align around: reducing the cost of cross border remittances are a Sustainable Development Goal (<a href="https://www.un.org/en/observances/remittances-day/SDGs#:~:text=SDG%2010,additional%20US%2420%20billion%20annually.">SDG10</a>) —&nbsp;and the clock is ticking on 2030. The savings are considerable; the impact of these savings, life transforming. The time to implement Verifiable Credentials has never been better.</p>

<p>Understanding what a seed phrase is and its importance is crucial for anyone navigating the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. A seed phrase, also known as a recovery phrase or mnemonic phrase, is the ultimate safeguard for your digital assets. Acting as the master key to your blockchain wallet, it enables access and recovery of cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and more. Whether you’re a seasoned crypto trader or a beginner, knowing how seed phrases work and why they are vital will help you manage your wallet securely and avoid the risk of losing access to your assets.</p>

 What is a Seed Phrase? 



<p>What is seed phrase? A seed phrase, also referred to as a Recovery Phrase or Mnemonic Phrase, is a randomly generated series of 12 or 24 words. It is created following the BIP39 standard (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39) whenever a new blockchain wallet is set up. Essentially, it acts as the master key to your blockchain wallet, enabling users to access and recover their stored data, such as cryptocurrencies (coins and tokens) and digital assets like NFTs.</p>



<p>Think of a seed phrase as the ultimate password in the blockchain world. If your wallet is lost, deleted, or you forget its password, the seed phrase is the only way to recover access to your assets. This is why safeguarding your seed phrase is of paramount importance—losing it means losing your ability to access your digital assets permanently.</p>

 What is the BIP39 Standard (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39)? 



<p>The BIP39 standard (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39) is a fundamental protocol in the blockchain world. It defines how cryptocurrency wallets generate and use a seed phrase (mnemonic phrase) to safeguard digital assets. Introduced in 2013, this standard has become the cornerstone for securing and recovering blockchain wallets.</p>



<p>At its core, BIP39 outlines the process of converting a human-readable mnemonic phrase into a binary seed. This binary seed is then used to create a set of cryptographic keys that encrypt and decrypt blockchain transactions. The combination of simplicity for users and robust cryptographic security makes BIP39 a critical component of modern blockchain infrastructure.</p>



 How Is a Seed Phrase Generated? 



<p>A seed phrase, also known as a recovery phrase or mnemonic phrase, is created through an automated and highly secure process based on the BIP39 standard. When you create a new blockchain wallet, the wallet generates a random sequence of 12 or 24 words. These words are selected from a predefined list of 2,048 English words established by the BIP39 protocol. This process ensures that each seed phrase is unique, random, and easy to use.</p>



 Step-by-Step Process of Generating a Seed Phrase: 



 
 Creating a New Wallet<br>When a user sets up a new blockchain wallet, the system automatically activates an algorithm to generate the seed phrase. 



 Random Word Selection<br>The algorithm randomly selects words from the standardized BIP39 wordlist of 2,048 words. These words are specifically chosen for their simplicity, avoiding confusing pairs such as “man” and “men” to reduce errors during use. 



 Displaying the Seed Phrase<br>The generated seed phrase, typically consisting of 12 or 24 words, is displayed to the user immediately after wallet creation. For example:<br>“bean, wolf, endorse, federal, addict, flame, gasp, hill, insect, lawsuit, meadow, omit.” 



 Exclusive User Knowledge<br>Only the user has access to the seed phrase. Wallet providers intentionally avoid storing or knowing this information to protect user privacy and security. 
 



 How Does a Seed Phrase Differ from a Private Key? 



<p>To better understand the difference, think of a seed phrase as the “master key” to your blockchain wallet, while a private key functions as the “individual key” to a specific account or address within that wallet. While both are crucial for managing and securing your digital assets, they serve different purposes and operate in distinct ways.</p>



<p>Learn more: <a href="https://blog.herond.org/public-key-vs-private-key-key-differences-explained/">Public Key vs Private Key: Key Differences Explained</a></p>



<p>Key Differences Between Seed Phrase and Private Key</p>



 
 Role: A seed phrase (12-24 words) is the “master key” to your wallet, allowing you to recover all accounts and assets. A private key (64 characters) secures only one specific wallet address, authorizing transactions. 



 Scope: Losing the seed phrase locks you out of your entire wallet, while a lost private key can be regenerated using the seed phrase. 



 Purpose: The seed phrase is a recovery tool for your entire wallet, while the private key is used for daily operations, like signing transactions. 



 Format: Seed phrases are easy-to-memorize words (e.g., “bean, wolf, endorse”), while private keys are complex codes not designed for manual use. 



 Security: Anyone with your seed phrase can control all your funds. Protect it securely and avoid sharing it. Private keys offer limited risk as they only grant access to one address. 
 


 
 


 The Importance of a Seed Phrase 



<p>What is seed phrase’s importance? A seed phrase is fundamental in safeguarding and managing digital assets stored in blockchain wallets. It acts as the ultimate key for wallet recovery and ensures ownership and security of your cryptocurrency holdings.</p>



 
 Protection Against Loss and Theft: A securely stored seed phrase enables wallet recovery in cases of device damage, loss, or theft, ensuring uninterrupted access to your assets. 



 User-Friendly Backup Solution: Unlike complex cryptographic keys, seed phrases are 12-24 simple words, making them easy to remember and suitable for both beginners and experienced users. 



 Device Independence: Seed phrases are not tied to specific devices, allowing wallet restoration on any compatible device for greater flexibility and convenience. 



 High Compatibility: Developed under the BIP39 standard, seed phrases work seamlessly across multiple wallets and blockchain platforms, simplifying migrations. 



 Enhanced Security: Utilizing advanced encryption and randomization, seed phrases are highly resistant to brute-force attacks, ensuring robust protection for your digital assets. 
 


 
 


 5 Tips for Safely and Effectively Storing Your Seed Phrase 



<p>Properly storing your seed phrase not only protects your digital assets but also ensures you can recover your blockchain wallet when needed. Here are five practical tips to securely store your seed phrase and minimize the risk of loss or theft:</p>



 
 Avoid Digital Storage<br>Never take photos of or store your seed phrase on email, cloud services, or note-taking apps. Any vulnerability in your device could be exploited by hackers. Instead, rely on traditional handwritten storage for better security. 



 Use Durable Materials<br>Instead of writing on paper, consider engraving your seed phrase onto metal or using specialized tools like CryptoSteel. This ensures protection from physical damage such as fire or water. 



 Do Not Share It with Anyone<br>The golden rule: “Your keys, your coins.” Only you should have access to your seed phrase. Avoid sharing it with anyone, even close family members, and refrain from entering it on unverified websites or apps. 



 Split It into Multiple Parts<br>For enhanced security, divide your seed phrase into two or three sections and store them in separate locations. This way, even if one part is lost or stolen, your assets remain inaccessible to unauthorized individuals. 



 Secure It in a Safe or Deposit Box<br>Add an extra layer of protection by storing your seed phrase in a home safe or a bank safety deposit box. This reduces the risk of theft or loss due to natural disasters. 
 



<p>By following these tips, you can safeguard your seed phrase and ensure the safety of your digital assets in any situation.</p>


 
 


 Conclusion 



<p>A seed phrase is more than just a backup – it’s the lifeline of your blockchain wallet. By ensuring you understand what is seed phrase, how it works, why it’s crucial, and how to store it safely, you can protect your digital assets from unforeseen risks. As the key to accessing your wallet on any device, a seed phrase offers unmatched convenience, flexibility, and security in the ever-evolving world of cryptocurrency. Take the necessary precautions to store your seed phrase securely and always keep it away from prying eyes or digital threats.</p>

<p>Clients noticed too. By demonstrating consistent compliance with FATF Travel Rule requirements, the provider earned trust from regulators and enterprise clients alike—turning regulatory adherence into a competitive advantage.</p>



<p></p>

<p>Jessica, a partner at a global law firm, knew that handling sensitive client information came with serious responsibility. From regulatory filings to high-profile contracts, even a small security lapse could jeopardize client trust—and expose the firm to hefty fines under regulations like GDPR and the U.S. Data Privacy Framework.</p>



<p>Her existing systems were outdated and fragmented, requiring multiple tools for document collection, encryption, and compliance tracking. Jessica needed a comprehensive, secure solution that kept her firm ahead of evolving privacy regulations. That’s when she implemented iComply.</p>



<p></p>



 Seamless Security and Compliance 



<p>Before iComply, onboarding clients meant manually verifying documents and managing sensitive files across email and separate storage systems. This process increased the risk of data breaches and made it harder to prove compliance during audits.</p>



<p>iComply’s platform changed everything. Clients uploaded documents directly through a secure, branded portal. Data was encrypted, authenticated, and verified at the source using edge computing—before it ever left the device. This meant fewer vulnerabilities and full control over data, even for international clients with cross-border privacy requirements.</p>



<p></p>



 Building Trust Through Proactive Protection 



<p>With iComply, Jessica’s team didn’t just meet compliance standards—they exceeded them. Real-time monitoring ensured that all client data remained secure and accessible only to authorized users. The platform automatically tracked every document interaction, creating an immutable audit trail.</p>



<p>Clients noticed the difference too. The streamlined process gave them confidence that their sensitive information was handled with world-class security. This wasn’t just about compliance—it was about strengthening client relationships through trust.</p>



<p></p>



 Future-Ready Privacy and Security 



<p>By adopting iComply, Jessica’s firm was prepared for new regulatory changes without needing costly system overhauls. Regular platform updates kept them compliant with privacy regulations across jurisdictions, while secure API integrations ensured that data flowed safely between internal systems.</p>



<p>If your compliance workflows feel vulnerable or outdated, it’s time to rethink your approach. iComply’s platform provides world-class privacy, security, and encryption—so your firm can focus on what matters most: serving your clients.</p>

<p>Sarah needed a solution that was fast, secure, and customer-friendly—and that’s when she discovered iComply.</p>



<p></p>



 A Seamless KYC Experience 



<p>Before iComply, clients had to email sensitive documents and wait for manual identity checks. Onboarding often stretched into days or weeks as Sarah’s team struggled to verify IDs, cross-check watchlists, and track missing forms.</p>



<p>With iComply, everything changed. Clients uploaded documents through a secure, branded portal, and iComply’s automated KYC system verified identities in real time. Sanctions screening, biometric checks, and document authentication were all completed instantly—no more back-and-forth emails or manual follow-ups.</p>



<p></p>



 Faster Onboarding, Happier Clients 



<p>Onboarding times dropped by over 50%, and customer satisfaction scores improved by 25% within months. Clients appreciated the fast, seamless process, and Sarah’s team had more time to focus on customer relationships instead of manual compliance tasks.</p>



<p>Audits became easier too—every verification step was logged automatically, and reports were generated with a single click, making regulatory reviews stress-free.</p>



<p></p>



 Turning Compliance into a Strength 



<p>By adopting iComply, Sarah’s team turned a cumbersome process into a streamlined customer experience. Clients felt valued, secure, and reassured from day one.</p>

<p>Lisa, head of operations at a U.S. broker dealer, was facing a familiar problem. Her compliance team was overwhelmed—bogged down by manual processes, juggling multiple tools, and struggling to keep up with regulatory changes. Each new client onboarding felt like navigating a maze of forms, document checks, and approvals. Mistakes were inevitable, audits were stressful, and the process was slowing business growth.</p>



<p>She knew they needed a better way—something seamless, secure, and built for scale. That’s when Lisa discovered iComply.</p>



<p></p>



 Simplifying a Complex Process 



<p>Before iComply, compliance felt like a relay race between disconnected systems. KYC data was entered manually. Corporate verification involved sifting through external databases. Sanctions and PEP screenings were handled by separate vendors, and pulling together audit reports took days. Every small change in regulation meant updating multiple workflows across different tools.</p>



<p>By implementing iComply, Lisa’s team consolidated everything into one platform. Individual and corporate verification happened automatically, flagged risks appeared in real time, and clients could upload documents securely through a single portal. Instead of stitching data together from different systems, Lisa’s team had a clear, unified view of every compliance case.</p>



<p></p>



 From Days to Minutes 



<p>The impact was immediate. Onboarding times that used to take days now took minutes. Automated checks reduced the chance of errors, and generating audit reports became as simple as clicking a button. Instead of reacting to regulatory changes, Lisa’s team was prepared—iComply’s regular updates kept them compliant without the need for constant rework.</p>



<p>By the end of the quarter, they had improved their efficiency by 90%. Lisa’s team wasn’t just keeping up—they were ahead of the curve.</p>



<p></p>



 Turning Compliance into a Strength 



<p>With iComply, Lisa transformed compliance from a burden into a competitive advantage. Her team saved time, reduced costs, and focused on what mattered most—building strong client relationships.</p>



<p>If you’re tired of complex compliance workflows slowing you down, iComply can help. Let’s simplify your KYC, KYB, and AML processes and give your team the tools they need to thrive.</p>

				 <p>Meet Eric—a compliance manager at a Nasdaq-listed fintech managing billions of dollars in transactions annually. With growth came complexity, and Eric’s compliance operations were tangled in a web of third-party tools.</p>



<p>For every KYC, KYB, and AML task, there was a separate vendor:</p>



 
 KYC identity verification platform. 



 KYB corporate document collection. 



 Sanctions and PEP screening. 



 Adverse media monitoring. 



 Passport and ID authentication. 



 Biometric identity access management. 



 An audit trail and reporting system. 



 API integrations to stitch it all together. 



 Secure document collection for corporate accounts. 
 



<p>The result? Nine disconnected silos, growing costs, and a frustrated team. Manual case management and their homegrown transaction monitoring system only added to the inefficiencies. Eric knew they needed a change—and fast.</p>



<p></p>



 The Challenge: A Disjointed Compliance Stack 



<p>Every customer onboarding journey felt like running a relay race between platforms. Each handoff slowed down processes, increased the risk of errors, and frustrated internal teams. Regulatory audits became chaotic as reports had to be cobbled together from multiple systems.</p>



<p>Eric’s team spent more time navigating software than assessing actual compliance risks. Meanwhile, costs ballooned as vendor licenses stacked up.</p>



<p></p>



 The Solution: iComply’s End-to-End Platform 



<p>Eric found iComply—a modular, all-in-one platform for KYC, KYB, and AML that integrated seamlessly with their existing systems. With iComply, Eric’s team consolidated nine compliance vendors into just three core systems:</p>



 
 iComply’s Platform for KYC, KYB, AML, and case management. 



 Their in-house transaction monitoring system. 



 A CRM for client relationship management. 
 



<p>Everything else? Eliminated.</p>



<p></p>



 How iComply Transformed Compliance Operations 



 
 Simplified Vendor Management: No more juggling multiple contracts, dashboards, or integration issues. All compliance workflows—from ID verification to adverse media screening—were handled in one place. 



 Cost Savings: Consolidating vendors significantly reduced licensing fees, integration costs, and maintenance overhead. 



 Faster Onboarding: Automated document authentication, PEP and sanctions screening, and real-time biometric checks cut onboarding time from days to minutes. 



 Seamless Reporting: iComply’s robust reporting tools generated audit-ready summaries in seconds, making regulatory reviews stress-free. 



 Future-Proof Compliance: Regular updates ensured Eric’s team stayed ahead of changing regulations without needing to reconfigure or rebuild their workflows. 
 



<p></p>



 The Result: Compliance at Scale 



<p>With iComply, Eric’s fintech could confidently scale compliance alongside its growing business—managing billions in annual transactions without missing a beat. The reduced complexity meant his team could focus on risk management, not system management.</p>



<p>Eric went from putting out fires to driving a proactive compliance strategy, saving his company time and money while improving efficiency and security.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Ready to streamline your compliance stack? iComply helps fintechs consolidate vendors, cut costs, and enhance compliance. Let’s simplify your workflows and build trust together.</p>

<p>Cybercriminals are no longer just lone actors looking for technology weaknesses; they're strategists and technicians who take advantage of every opportunity to profit by stealing customer data, taking over accounts, and infiltrating internal business systems to rob and plunder. Today’s fraudsters can break through tough security measures to commit their crimes and disappear before you even realize they were there.</p>

 Now that 2024 has come to a close, it’s the perfect time to reflect on the digital identity landscape and evaluate how the year’s trends have shaped the market. In our annual tradition, we look back on our predictions at the start of the year and assess how they measure up against reality. This year, instead of rating each prediction individually, we’ll focus on the major industry trends and discuss how our forecasts align with them. 



<p>2024 has been a transformative year for Liminal as well. As a technology company offering market and competitive intelligence through our Link Platform, we’ve empowered businesses with actionable insights to navigate these trends. Let’s explore the major takeaways from 2024 and how our predictions fared.</p>



 


 
2024 Reflections in Digital Identity 


 The Big Picture: 2024 Reflections in Digital Identity 



<p>The cybersecurity and digital identity space continued to experience rapid growth, innovation, and regulatory scrutiny in 2024. Key trends included:</p>



 
 Trust &amp; Safety Become Core to Platform Integrity: Social media platforms prioritized Trust &amp; Safety initiatives, with age assurance and age verification emerging as critical capabilities to address regulatory pressures, user demands, and platform integrity. 



 Convergence of Identity and Cybersecurity: The increasing sophistication of identity-based threats and deepfakes drove the convergence of cybersecurity and identity solutions, with advancements in frameworks, content provenance, and fraud prevention capabilities leading the way. 



 Evolving Regulatory Landscapes: Global regulations targeting AI privacy, age assurance, and data usage placed organizations under greater scrutiny, requiring them to balance compliance, innovation, and ethical practices to maintain market credibility. 



 Market Consolidation and Innovation: Strategic acquisitions and private equity investments reshaped the identity and fraud markets, with adjacent players like Visa, Experian, and Mastercard driving innovation, while identity-first vendors expanded their market influence. 



 The Continued Struggle for Reusable Identity Adoption. Despite the promise of reusable identity networks, slow consumer uptake and market pivots highlight ongoing challenges in achieving scalability and trust for widespread adoption. 
 



<p>These trends underscored the market’s complexity and opportunity, shaping the decisions of buyers, providers, and investors alike.</p>



 



<blockquote>
<p>“2024 marked a pivotal year in the fight for digital trust. Breakthroughs in age assurance, AI-driven deepfake detection, and passkeys laid the foundation for a safer, more authentic online ecosystem. At Liminal, we turned complexity into clarity—empowering businesses to navigate these shifts with confidence and shape the strategies that protect integrity in the digital age.”<br>–<a href="https://liminal.co/team-member/jennie-berry/"> Jennie Berry</a>, Liminal</p>
</blockquote>



 



 Revisiting Our 2024 Predictions 



<p>Our 2024 predictions, which drew on the collective expertise of the Liminal team, anticipated many of these developments. Here’s how they aligned with the year’s major trends:</p>



 
 Age Assurance as a Core Pillar for Trust &amp; Safety 



 Convergence of Identity and Cybersecurity 



 Market Consolidation 



 Regulatory Shifts 



 Continued Struggle for Reusable Identity Adoption 
 



 



 1. Age Assurance as a Core Pillar for Trust &amp; Safety 



<p>Our prediction that major social media platforms would initiate voluntary age verification has proven mostly correct, as platforms like Meta and Snapchat have taken significant steps to enhance age assurance measures, including testing tools such as biometric-based age estimation and document verification to comply with growing regulatory pressures. <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/673341bb0c1051e76221fba8?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-age-assurance-report-access">According to Liminal’s 2024 B2B survey of age assurance practitioners</a>, in regulated sectors, age verification coverage is expected to grow from 60% to 66%, while unregulated industries are moving faster, with adoption rising from 64% to 73% in the next year. This shift reflects the growing recognition of age assurance as essential for Trust &amp; Safety, even outside traditionally regulated areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While we anticipated a blow to state-level regulations in the U.S., the outcome has been mixed. We use<a href="https://link.liminal.co/market-monitor?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-market-monitor-access"> Link’s Market Monitor </a>to anticipate actionable impacts of proposed legislation, and although the Supreme Court has yet to rule on this issue decisively, recent developments—such as <a href="https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2024/3/?Tab=BillText">Florida’s new HB 3 bill </a>mandating parental consent for minors under 14 to access social media —demonstrate states’ continued attempts to impose online protections. Internationally, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/australia-passes-social-media-ban-children-under-16-2024-11-28/">Australia introduced the world-first legislation</a> in its Online Safety Act, which bans children younger than 16 from platforms including X, Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Age Assurance has emerged as a core focus of our coverage and research this year, driven by its critical role in Trust &amp; Safety initiatives across digital platforms. Throughout the year, we’ve closely tracked <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/673341bb0c1051e76221fba8?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-age-assurance-report-access">market sentiment through buyer surveys</a>, which highlight the growing demand for solutions that balance regulatory compliance, user experience, and platform integrity. The gap between understanding and effectively implementing age assurance regulations presents a significant challenge for businesses, with confusion around the scope of specific regulations being a major issue. <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/673341bb0c1051e76221fba8?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-age-assurance-report-access">46% of practitioners</a> incorrectly identify the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) – which primarily applies to schools and libraries – as one of the top regulations impacting businesses. Our <a href="https://link.liminal.co/use-cases?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-use-case-explorer-access">Link Use Case Explorer</a> includes an analysis of product capabilities and technical features, including a detailed view of how solutions are evolving to meet the stringent requirements of this use case, such as biometric age estimation, data enrichment, and parental consent tools. At the same time, we’ve identified key technology gaps—particularly in accuracy and user experience—that remain opportunities for innovation. By mapping the capabilities of emerging technologies to real-world buyer needs, we’ve gained a clear view of how the market is maturing to address the complexities of age assurance, setting the stage for future advancements that ensure safer digital environments for all users.</p>



 



 2. Convergence of Identity and Cybersecurity 



<p>Our predictions regarding the convergence of digital identity and cybersecurity were largely correct, with developments across deepfake mitigation, bot detection, and authentication.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deepfakes are more prevalent today than ever before due to a combination of technological advancements and increased accessibility to AI-powered tools. The proliferation of generative AI models, such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) and large language models, has enabled the creation of hyper-realistic audio, video, and image content with minimal expertise or resources. The rapid spread of misinformation on social platforms and the rise of identity-based attacks, such as impersonation fraud and synthetic identities, have made deepfakes an increasingly potent tool for bad actors targeting individuals, organizations, and even nation-states. Solutions that integrate identity verification tools—such as biometric authentication, liveness detection, and digital watermarking—combined with cybersecurity techniques like content provenance, anomaly detection, and cryptographic hashing are essential to detect and authenticate the origin and integrity of digital media. Based on survey data conducted in <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/67336e5f0402b57725ca0900?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-ians-report-access">Liminal’s 2024 Seminar Research Report: The Market for Identity Authorization Networks</a>, 88% of financial services institutions expect GenAI fraud and deepfakes to grow substantially over the next two years. New frameworks and consortiums have emerged to combat deepfakes, and in the Solution Segment for <a href="https://link.liminal.co/solution-segments/5fc17fe2f82a3e5e2cabd3b2?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-ss-user-generated-content-moderation-access">User-Generated Content Moderation</a> within our <a href="https://link.liminal.co/solution-segments?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-liminal-landscape-access">Liminal Landscape</a>, we are tracking the <a href="https://contentauthenticity.org/">Content Authenticity Initiative</a> and <a href="https://c2pa.org/">Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA)</a>, which have made progress in establishing technical standards for identifying manipulated media.</p>

However, as companies shift toward first-party ad strategies, there remains a heightened requirement to ensure that all website impressions are legitimate. The growing reliance on first-party data amplifies the need for identity-centric approaches to cybersecurity, particularly in bot detection. Automated threats like ad fraud, fake traffic, and click bots can severely undermine the accuracy and value of first-party strategies, impacting advertising ROI and business performance. Organizations are adopting advanced solutions such as behavioral analytics, device fingerprinting, and real-time anomaly detection to differentiate between genuine users and malicious bots to combat this. By ensuring the legitimacy of website impressions, businesses protect their advertising investments and reinforce trust and data integrity in an increasingly privacy-driven digital landscape.</p>



<p>Finally, while passkeys have gained traction, particularly with big tech players like Google and Apple, our prediction remains correct that they remain largely secondary authentication methods rather than primary solutions, as adoption faces challenges in user behavior and enterprise readiness. Passkeys are a form of passwordless authentication that leverages public key cryptography to verify a user’s identity without requiring a traditional password. According to <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/6718c9b9d7f0e77856e7e1b5?utm_campaign=5681049-2024%20Reflections%20Blog%20Post&amp;utm_source=2024-reflections-blog&amp;utm_medium=blog-hyperlink&amp;utm_content=blog-wp-cybersecurity-passkeys">Liminal’s 2024 B2B surveys of authentication practitioners</a>, despite nearly 100% of businesses that have yet to adopt passkeys expressing a willingness to transition to them, only about a third are expecting to do so in the next two years. Our ongoing research on a passwordless future highlights the critical role that CISOs and IT leaders can play in promoting the internal adoption of passkeys within the workforce. We hypothesize that workforce adoption can catalyze widespread customer deployments by proving their effectiveness, ease of use, and security benefits in real-world environments. This workforce-first approach enhances identity-centric cybersecurity by removing the vulnerabilities associated with passwords and helps organizations build trust and familiarity with passkey solutions.</p>

 3. Market Consolidation 



<p>Our predictions around market consolidation were partially correct, with significant activity but slightly different dynamics than anticipated. While at least two publicly traded identity companies did choose to go private—such as <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/61b12a7401c4b637779827d6/overview">Proofpoint</a>’s acquisition by Thoma Bravo and <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/61c12b7dc890a08ec3f64f08/overview">ZeroFox</a>’s buyout by Haveli Investments—the broader trend focused on strategic acquisitions.</p>



<p>Key deals like Visa’s acquisition of <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/61c12b7dc890a08ec3f64f08/overview">Featurespace</a> and Experian’s acquisition of <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/62cc485c7718967730d7cf37">NeuroID</a> and <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/6408eedbe2225e7d5f5cc836">ClearSale</a> highlight how financial giants integrate advanced fraud prevention and behavioral analytics capabilities into their platforms. Mastercard’s acquisition of <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/6408eedbe2225e7d5f5cc836/overview">Recorded Future</a> also points to a growing appetite for cybersecurity and identity intelligence convergence. We also saw <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/5fb4c6f3179dc94908bf4be1/overview">Entrust</a>’s acquisition of <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/5fb4c6f3179dc94908bf4be1/overview">Onfido</a> for up to $600M, despite prior speculation to IPO over $1B.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, our expectation that <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/5fb4c6f7179dc94908bf4c21">Okta</a> and <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/5fb4c6f7179dc94908bf4c26">Ping</a> would aggressively expand into identity verification and fraud prevention—particularly at account opening—was only partially realized. While both expanded capabilities, their focus remained on core IAM/CIAM, leaving traditional identity verification players like <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/5fc1d9b2f26e0d7cd04afeb6">Socure</a>, <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/6101c7f64645a82ed0abf46b">Prove</a>, and others to capture significant market share in fraud prevention and onboarding solutions. The acquisitions and private equity activity seen this year reaffirm that the market is consolidating, but the momentum is being driven by adjacent entrants and strategic investors looking to integrate identity and fraud solutions into larger ecosystems rather than large-scale mergers within the digital identity space.</p>

 4. Regulatory Shifts 



<p>Our predictions regarding regulatory shifts were only somewhat correct, particularly in relation to generative AI and its impact on privacy and data advantage. As generative AI adoption surged, organizations faced increasing privacy concerns and regulatory scrutiny. For instance, the <a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/">EU’s AI Act</a> introduced strict guidelines around data usage, transparency, and accountability in generative AI systems, while jurisdictions like <a href="https://www.bakerdonelson.com/californias-new-generative-ai-law-what-your-organization-needs-to-know">California pushed forward tech regulations</a> to safeguard personal data from misuse in AI training models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Simultaneously, companies struggling to articulate their unique data advantage in the generative AI space encountered notable market criticism. This was particularly evident with firms unable to differentiate their AI solutions from competitors or justify the quality of their proprietary datasets, leading to investor skepticism and concerns about overinflated claims. These developments reaffirm that regulatory shifts are driving organizations to strike a balance between AI-driven innovation, privacy protections, and transparency, with a clear data advantage increasingly serving as a competitive differentiator.</p>



 



 5. Continued Struggle for Reusable Identity Adoption 



<p>Unfortunately, our prediction that reusable identity networks would not gain consumer adoption in 2024 was correct, as significant hurdles around scalability, trust, and consumer behavior persisted. Notably, Mastercard has lost momentum with its ID Network, reflecting the challenges even well-funded, globally recognized players face in driving the adoption of reusable digital identities. <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin</a>, a pioneer in self-sovereign identity, is preparing to <a href="https://us14.campaign-archive.com/?u=b2c2f50b93f0ad7684f55ccde&amp;id=97dcc86838">deprecate its MainNet ledger </a>by April of this year, signaling technological hurdles and a marked reduction in transaction activity. <a href="https://link.liminal.co/companies/5fb4c6f9179dc94908bf4c42">Trinsic</a>, a startup that sought to enable decentralized identity solutions, <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-decentralized-identity-assets-acquired-by-dentity-to-accelerate-digital-id-adoption/">shifted its focus away from its original vision</a>, citing slow market readiness and unclear demand. These developments underscore the difficulty of achieving network effects, interoperability, and end-user trust required for reusable identity solutions to thrive. While reusable identity networks continue to show promise, particularly in niche ecosystems or regulated environments, the broader market remains hesitant, and adoption struggles have reinforced the need for clearer value propositions, regulatory support, and incentives to drive consumer engagement.</p>

<p></p> 
				
				
				
				
				
				
				 
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>In today’s rapidly changing digital landscape, data privacy and security are more crucial than ever for compliance teams. As regulations tighten and cyber threats evolve, businesses must prioritize innovative solutions. Enter edge computing, a game-changer for KYC, KYB, and AML software. This technology is transforming how organizations approach compliance—offering speed, security, and scalability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
 Key Trends Shaping Data Privacy in 2025 
<p></p>
<p>Global Data Regulations Are Expanding<br>With updates to GDPR and new rules like the U.S. Data Privacy Framework, businesses need solutions that ensure compliance across jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Data Sovereignty Is Non-Negotiable<br>Laws requiring local data processing mean businesses must rethink how and where sensitive information is handled.</p>
<p>AI Is Both an Opportunity and a Risk<br>AI-powered compliance tools are advancing rapidly, but they also raise concerns about data misuse and accuracy.</p>
<p>Cyber Threats Are Constantly Evolving<br>From phishing to ransomware, the need for proactive and decentralized security measures is paramount.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Why Edge Computing Is the Future of Compliance<br>Unlike traditional API-driven solutions that rely on centralized cloud systems, edge computing processes data locally—closer to where it’s collected. For compliance functions like KYC, KYB, and AML, this shift delivers three transformative benefits:</p>
 
 
 Stronger Data Privacy: By processing sensitive information locally, businesses reduce the risks associated with transmitting data over public networks. 
 Faster Operations: With real-time processing at the edge, compliance checks, such as identity verification or sanctions screening, are completed in seconds. 
 Regulatory Compliance Made Easy: Edge computing aligns naturally with data localization laws, ensuring sensitive data stays within required jurisdictions. 
 
 
<p>What is Edge Computing?</p>
<p>Imagine a network where data processing happens closer to where the data is generated, instead of relying on a distant central server. That’s edge computing in a nutshell. By bringing computation to the “edge” of the network, you reduce latency, improve security, and enable real-time decision-making.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Streamlining Compliance with Edge Computing<br>Edge computing isn’t just about speed and security—it’s about simplifying complex compliance processes. Here’s how it enhances KYC, KYB, and AML operations:</p>
<p>Enhanced Identity Verification<br>Edge computing enables instant validation of identity documents and biometrics, improving onboarding times and reducing friction, risk, and cybersecurity threats.</p>
<p>Global Compliance Made Simple<br>With multilingual and multi-jurisdictional capabilities, businesses can adapt seamlessly to local regulations while maintaining high standards.</p>
<p>Real-Time Risk Monitoring<br>Continuous AML checks for sanctions, PEPs, and adverse media happen instantly, giving teams immediate insights into potential threats.</p>
<p>Data Minimization by Design<br>By processing only the essential data directly at the source, edge computing reduces storage needs and aligns with privacy principles like GDPR’s minimization requirement.</p>
<p>Customizable and Scalable Solutions<br>Whether you’re a fintech startup or a global bank, edge computing offers modular compliance tools that grow with your business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why Businesses Are Switching to Edge for KYC, KYB, and AML<br>Edge computing addresses compliance challenges that legacy systems and API-reliant platforms can’t. It reduces costs, increases operational efficiency, and ensures compliance teams stay ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
 
 
 A financial services company cut its KYC processing time by 80% using edge-based identity validation. 
 A global bank maintained compliance across 195 countries by leveraging localized edge solutions for KYB due diligence. 
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Edge Advantage for 2025 and Beyond<br>As compliance becomes more complex, businesses need tools that are not only secure but also flexible and future-ready. Edge computing is revolutionizing how organizations approach KYC, KYB, and AML, ensuring faster operations, stronger security, and seamless compliance.</p>
<p>By embracing edge computing, you’re not just meeting today’s demands—you’re setting your business up for long-term success in a trust-driven world. </p>

<p>Deployment: Ensuring sustainable, regulatory-compliant implementation.</p>



<blockquote><p>With ACHILLES, we want to put people at the heart of AI innovation. Our aim is to ensure that every technology not only performs well, but is also transparent and ethical, to inspire trust in the long term.</p>André Carreiro, Project Coordinator and Researcher at Fraunhofer AICOS (Portugal).</blockquote>



 The 6 objectives of the ACHILLES project. 



  Identify ethical and legal frameworks in order to design AI systems that are based on human values.  



  Create frameworks to guarantee high quality, diverse and representative data for AI use.  



  Protect consumer privacy when using data and models in machine learning.  



  Optimize AI model training and deployment processes to reduce energy and IT costs.  



  Enable the development of robust and transparent algorithms.  



  Offer researchers and developers an integrated development environment based on machine learning to facilitate efficient, regulatory-compliant and trustworthy AI.  



 What sectors is ACHILLES focused on? 



<p>The ACHILLES project will focus on creating multiple use cases across various industries, including healthcare by optimizing models to provide faster and more reliable diagnostics, and identity verification by developing more secure, privacy-friendly solutions. By ensuring compliance with regulations, ACHILLES will also offer use cases as far and wide as content creation and pharmaceutical development.</p>



<p>Plus, by aligning with the ethical standards of the European Union, ACHILLES demonstrates that innovation and responsibility can, in fact, coexist to create trusted AI.&nbsp;The ACHILLES project is split into three major milestones.</p>



<p>Year 1 (2024-2025): Define use cases and specifications, start of technical developments.</p>



<p>Year 2 (2025-2026): Continue technical developments, assessment of project use cases.</p>



<p>Years 3 and 4 (2026-2028): Implement and evaluate the efficacy of ACHILLES solutions on project use cases.</p>



 IDnow’s role in the ACHILLES project. 



<p>As a leader in the European identity verification market, IDnow’s chief role in the project is to&nbsp;provide identity verification expertise and work to maximize the efficiency of datasets that comply with privacy standards, including GDPR. This includes:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Creating synthetic data that is representative of real data.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Optimizing data annotation to minimize human resources and guarantee reliable results.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Renewing datasets without affecting model performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>Throughout the project IDnow will be evaluating ACHILLES innovations on real-life use cases linked to identity verification. These tests will enable us to improve the robustness of our algorithms and propose more reliable, secure and privacy-friendly solutions.</p>



<blockquote><p>Thanks to the ACHILLES project, we hope not only to improve the quality and robustness of our algorithms, but also to reduce dependence on real data. This represents a major step toward more sustainable and regulatory-compliant AI.</p>Montaser Awal, Director of Research at IDnow.</blockquote>

 The Metaverse, an interactive virtual space created by augmented reality and virtual reality (AR/VR) tech that seamlessly integrates digital and physical environments, is rapidly expanding 



<p>A Grand View Research report has estimated that the global Metaverse market size had a value of $82.02 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow until 2030. Promoting immersive experiences is one of the critical features of this virtual space. Our previous <a href="https://unionavatars.com/who-can-i-be-in-the-metaverse/">article Who Can I Be in the Metaverse? </a>&nbsp;discusses how users can personalize avatars to interact with others in the Metaverse and highlights opportunities to expand customization options to promote diversity and inclusivity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although tech innovations drive the Metaverse’s growth, many people still lack an awareness of its full potential. In the US, <a href="https://business.yougov.com/content/40805-do-americans-understand-metaverse-and-do-they-care">YouGov research shows only 12% of respondents</a> fully know about the Metaverse, while only two in five partially understand it. Luckily, several resources are available to help introduce the Metaverse to curious minds, including ebooks. Below, we look at why ebooks are helpful and recommend the best titles for understanding the Metaverse.</p>



 Why ebooks? 



<p>Our tech-driven society has enabled the digital world to intertwine with our lives, and ebooks are one example of how tech makes daily tasks like reading more convenient. <a href="https://slejournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40561-021-00176-5">Research published in Springer Open</a> found that the interactive features of ebooks, like highlighting and annotating text, are more efficient in helping readers learn about complex concepts like artificial intelligence compared with other forms of books. If you’re wondering where to access them, <a href="https://www.everand.com/books/Technology-Engineering">Everand hosts a wide range of tech-related ebooks</a> to help you understand the Metaverse, including Mark Van Rijmenam’s Step into the Metaverse and Jaron Lanier’s Dawn of the New Everything. Readers can customize their reading experience by adjusting font sizes and highlighting relevant passages. If you want a range of options, other platforms like Libby might also provide access to titles about the Metaverse through your local library’s ebook catalog.</p>



<p>Here are some titles to check out:</p>



 Ebooks on the Metaverse and virtual worlds 



 The Metaverse Handbook by QuHarrison Terry and Scott Keeney 



<p>There’s nothing like learning from the best. In this ebook, tech and culture experts QuHarrison Terry and Scott Keeney highlight the fundamental concepts of the Metaverse, its history, and how to leverage its opportunities to your advantage. The Metaverse Handbook provides case studies of over 100 Metaverse creators and offers concise and actionable insights into navigating, exploring, and implementing emerging Metaverse tech like blockchain, making it an essential read for beginners.</p>



 Navigating the Metaverse by Cathy Hackl, Dirk Lueth, and Tommaso Di Bartolo 



<p>Research shows that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/05/more-americans-are-scared-of-the-metaverse-than-excited-poll.html">nearly a third of US adults</a> are scared of the Metaverse. To help soothe these fears and foster more understanding, Navigating the Metaverse provides a comprehensive guide and valuable tips on navigating the Metaverse economy and launching an effective Metaverse project. This ebook offers business executives and innovators helpful knowledge on existing frameworks that can capitalize on the Metaverse’s innovative features for their businesses, including spatial computing and Web3 technology.&nbsp;</p>



 Dawn of the New Everything by Jaron Lanier&nbsp; 



<p>Learning about VR as a foundation for developing the Metaverse is essential in understanding how immersive technology can shape the future of the digital space. In Dawn of the New Everything, the father of virtual reality, Jaron Lanier, explores the power and potential of VR and how it impacts not only the Metaverse but also our daily lives. It’s an essential read for those interested in understanding the Metaverse’s key components.</p>



 Step into the Metaverse by Mark Van Rijmenam 



<p>Perfect for readers who want to understand the business side of the digital space, Mark Van Rijmenam’s Step into the Metaverse explores the untapped potential for Metaverse entertainment. Rijmenam examines the Metaverse’s potential to unlock a trillion-dollar social economy and the challenges that come with it. The ebook also provides commentaries on potential risks, including data breaches, avatar imposters, and surveillance, highlighting the need for a Metaverse law.</p>



<p>The idea of the Metaverse might be too confusing or overwhelming for beginners. With these ebooks, you’ll be well on your way to understanding the basics of the Metaverse and its incredible potential.</p>

<p>We’re all accustomed to using SMS (short message service) verification when we sign on to our mobile apps and services. This method is used to prove that you possess the device during an MFA (multi-factor authentication) experience. When you attempt to access an app, it texts you a code and asks you to provide that code to prove that you are who you claim to be. After providing the code, you immediately gain access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SMS verification is extremely popular because most people are accustomed to it and know what to expect. However, this verification method can be vulnerable to SMS fraud, which could result in costly losses for your organization if you do not take the appropriate precautions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although the trade timeline was inaccurate, my fundamental and technical analysis was spot on as SUI traded to a new all time high on December 14, 2024 of 4.85 $USD.  What about SUI was and remains compelling? </p><p>Sui has engineered several industry 1st products including a zero-knowledge oauth2 login aptly called zkLogin and a Rust based smart contract language called Move. As a web 2 and blockchain engineer, I naturally gravitated towards these two products because they solve some of the greater challenges on the road to mass adoption. </p>

 What is zkLogin? 

<p>zkLogin enables users to transact on Sui using the familiar OAuth login flow, eliminating the friction of handling cryptographic keys or remembering mnemonics while using externally owned accounts (EOAs). With a bit of engineering ingenuity, zkLogin could enable instant and private identity authentication to extract billions of $USD locked up in antiquated ​customer onboarding flows all while paving a highway toward the post quantum era. </p>

 zkLogin Design Goals 

  Streamlined onboarding: zkLogin enables you to transact on Sui using the familiar OAuth login flow, eliminating the friction of handling cryptographic keys or remembering mnemonics.  Self-custody: A zkLogin transaction requires user approval via the standard OAuth login process--the OAuth provider cannot transact on the user's behalf.  Security: zkLogin is a two-factor authentication scheme; sending a transaction requires both a credential from a recent OAuth login and a salt not managed by the OAuth provider. An attacker who compromises an OAuth account cannot transact from the user's corresponding Sui address unless they separately compromise the salt.  Privacy: Zero-knowledge proofs prevent third parties from linking a Sui address with its corresponding OAuth identifier.  Optional verified identity: A user can opt in to verify the OAuth identifier that was used to derive a particular Sui address. This serves as the foundation for a verifiable on-chain identity layer.  Accessibility: zkLogin is one of several native Sui signature schemes thanks to Sui's cryptography agility. It integrates with other Sui primitives, like sponsored transactions and multisig.  

 What is Move? 

<p>The most important feature of Move is it's ability to create smart contracts in a blockchain agnostic manner meaning it works seamlessly with all blockchains. Sui made a brilliant design choice in writing Move in Rust, and considering Microsoft plans to migrate its codebase to Rust, the implications and potential of Move are profound. Coupled with zkLogin, developers have unprecedented opportunity to engineer the future of public blockchain technology as the world rapidly accelerates into the post quantum era. </p><p>Move was originally created for the "Diem" blockchain and has evolved into a powerful, hghly expressive language with an execution layer offering unmatched efficiency. </p><p></p>
<p>Move's design enables unparalleled flexibility with it's object data model, composable dynamic fields, and programmable transaction blocks that allow up to 1024 separate homogeneous or heterogenous function calls per transaction. Coupled with zkLogin, Move provides the optimal developer and user onboarding experiences to foster the mass adoption of public blockchain technology.

<p>The blockchain industry entered 2024 amidst transformative shifts driven by regulatory pressures and technological advancements. Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) faced escalating compliance demands, compelling them to navigate a delicate balance between operational efficiency and the preservation of user privacy. Shyft Network emerged as a leader in this evolving landscape, delivering innovative solutions that address the industry’s most pressing challenges without compromising its foundational values.</p> A Turning Point in Crypto Compliance <p>For VASPs worldwide, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Travel Rule remained a pressing challenge. Compliance historically demanded cumbersome manual processes, often at the expense of operational efficiency and user trust. These outdated methods left exchanges and their customers exposed to potential breaches while struggling to meet evolving regulatory expectations.</p><p>Shyft Network addressed these issues head-on. In January, the company introduced its groundbreaking<a href="https://demo.usersigning.shyft.network/"> User Signing</a> feature to the Veriscope Travel Rule solution.

  <p>You have an app with SSO capabilities. What else can you do with Okta to transform it into an enterprise-ready powerhouse?</p>

<p>Today’s enterprises face critical identity management challenges that directly impact their operations; this includes:</p>

 
   Rapid business growth outpacing their current user management capabilities 
   Scattered user accounts creating administrative chaos 
   User management that doesn’t scale with company growth (access free-for-all to resources) 
   Bottlenecks in user provisioning slowing down productivity (i.e., manual provisioning) 
 

<p>and more critically,</p>

 
   Security vulnerabilities from inconsistent user deprovisioning 
 

<p>This is where you come in as a partner. By integrating with Okta through SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management), a standard for managing users, you can offer enterprise customers a solution that addresses these pain points.</p>

 Why System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) is your gateway to enterprise success 

<p>It facilitates:</p>
 
   Real-time user synchronization, which keeps customer organizations agile with instant updates as employees join, leave, or move within the company 
   Automated lifecycle management, which eliminates manual processes with streamlined provisioning, updates, and de-provisioning 
   Enhanced security controls, which give enterprises precise control over user access and permissions 
   Standards-based integration, which leverages open Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocols for reliable, interoperable, and consistent implementation 
   Reduced operational complexity, which helps customers save on their identity management costs and overhead

<p>It’s been a big year for Bluesky! As 2024 draws to a close, I’m excited to take a look back at everything that’s happened in the past year.</p>
<p>Alongside users, creators, and the AT Protocol developer community, Bluesky has grown from an invite-only app with only 3 million people to a public app of over 25.9 million people. In the last month and a half, Bluesky has grown by over 13M people, with organizations reporting a 2-10x increase in the amount of <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/11-29-2024-engagement">engagement</a> they receive.</p>
<p>Here’s a look back at some key milestones of this past year:</p>
 Opening Our Doors 
<p>Bluesky officially launched in just February of this year. When we opened the app to the public, we removed invites, which were a tool to help us grow the app sustainably and safely.</p>
<p>At launch, Bluesky had an early community of 3M people. One week later, over a million new users had signed up.</p>
 Implementing Federation 
<p>Just weeks after our public launch, we achieved a long-standing goal by implementing <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/self-host-federation">federation</a>. This milestone represents our commitment to creating an open, interconnected social network that respects user choice. Users can now run their own personal data servers, and thousands have opted to use their own servers instead of Bluesky’s infrastructure.</p>
 Stackable Moderation 
<p>In March, we launched <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation">labelers</a>, the first piece of our stackable moderation system that empowers users to take control of their experience. Additionally, we open-sourced Ozone, a collaborative moderation tool that enables independent organizations and people to more easily run their own moderation service.</p>
 More Big Features 
<p>In 2024, we also launched:</p>
 
 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3kmjbfqrrbu2t">Hashtags</a>: We added hashtags to make finding content easier. 
 <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/05-22-2024-direct-messages">Direct Messages</a>: In May, we launched DMs, creating new avenues for connection. 
 <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/06-26-2024-starter-packs">Starter packs</a>: In June, we launched starter packs, helping communities onboard to Bluesky more easily. 
 <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/09-11-2024-video">Video Sharing:</a> In September, we launched videos. 
 <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bsky.app/post/3le6bze3nus2c">Trending topics</a>: In December, right around Christmas, we launched trending topics. 
 
 Many Small Features 
<p>We also launched:</p>
 
 Account deactivation (June), 
 Priority notifications (July), 
 Self-moderation tools like detach quotes and hide reply (August), 
 Pinned posts (October), and 
 The thread composer (November). 
 
 Looking forward to 2025 
<p>Building on this year's achievements, we're excited to introduce more features and improvements. Your feedback continues to shape Bluesky’s evolution, and we deeply appreciate the trust you've placed in Bluesky this year.</p>

 What Are AI Translate Tools? 



<p>AI translate tools are software powered by artificial intelligence that can convert text from one language to another with remarkable accuracy and fluency. Unlike traditional translation methods, which often rely on direct word-for-word substitution, AI translation tools leverage vast datasets of multilingual text to understand and process linguistic patterns, grammar, and contextual nuances in a comprehensive manner.</p>

 How Do AI Translate Tools Work? 



<p>AI translate tools go beyond merely translating individual words. Instead, they analyze entire sentences and paragraphs to deliver translations that are both contextually appropriate and semantically accurate. Using advanced algorithms, these tools learn from bilingual and multilingual data to grasp the nuances, syntax, and deeper meanings of the source language. This enables them to produce translations that feel natural rather than robotic, making them ideal for both casual and professional use.</p>



<p>Moreover, with the rise of generative AI technologies such as ChatGPT, AI translation tools have advanced even further. These tools now have the ability to enhance the translated content in the target language by taking into account the context, tone, and overall meaning of the original text. This results in high-quality translations that are not only accurate but also refined, which is particularly beneficial for use cases like marketing, academic research, and corporate communication.</p>

 What is Text-to-Speech Technology? 



<p>Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology is an innovative solution that converts written text into spoken audio. Often referred to as “read-aloud technology,” TTS transforms static text into a dynamic, audible format, making content more accessible and engaging. This groundbreaking technology bridges the gap between written communication and audio, empowering users to consume information in a completely new way.</p>



<p>With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), TTS has evolved significantly in recent years. Gone are the days of robotic, monotone voices. Modern TTS systems now produce highly natural, human-like speech that closely mimics the nuances of real human voices. Some platforms even offer the ability to replicate or “clone” specific voices, preserving the tone, pitch, and emotions of the original speaker. This innovation has brought a sense of realism and relatability to digital content, transforming the way we interact with text.</p>

<p>Career paths have transformed dramatically over the past decade. With remote work becoming standard, <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-is-ai-being-used-in-workplaces">AI technologies entering workplaces</a>, and career trajectories becoming increasingly non-linear, traditional approaches to professional growth and continuous learning are struggling to keep pace.</p><p>This is reflected in research. According to LinkedIn's 2024 Workplace Learning Report, job seekers and employees feel learning and development is more essential to their career opportunities than ever—and they feel artificial intelligence can scale mentorship and career planning to match demand.<a>1</a></p><p>So, how is it changing, and what does personal AI have to do with it? Read on to find out.</p> What is Career Development? <p>Career development is the ongoing process of building professional growth through career planning, continuous learning, and targeted skill development. Essentially, it’s the way people create the careers and salaries they want to have. And it’s changing.</p> Why is Career Development Changing? <p>Traditional career development has long relied on a combination of career counselors, mentors, professional books, and workshops.</p><p>While valuable, these methods have significant limitations in today's fast-paced and economically unequal work environment. According to the International Coach Federation, the average cost of career coaching is around $244 per hour,<a>2</a> which can make them inaccessible to many busy junior professionals.</p><p>Similarly, mentors, while invaluable for their experience, often have limited time and may not be available when needed most—especially when some can be volunteers.</p><p>Books and workshops remove some of the time and cost issues but instead offer static information that can't adapt to individual circumstances or changing market conditions. This one-size-fits-all approach becomes particularly problematic in today's dynamic job market, where roles and required skills evolve rapidly.</p><p>The modern workplace demands a more agile and personalized approach.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb75df393-aef7-49c0-bae0-adc4ba388e51_1792x1024.webp">          </a>DALL-E/Kin Illustration  The Rise of AI Tools <p>So, an opening has appeared for a new kind of career support: AI-powered tools.</p><p>These AI-driven career coaches are available 24/7, process vast amounts of data from interactions, and provide data-driven insights based on an individual's unique situation and career aspirations. Through sophisticated algorithms and machine learning, tools built on AI systems like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft’s Copilot are revolutionizing how people approach upskilling and professional development.</p><p>In short, AI helps in career development by making the guidance it requires cheaper, faster, and more analytical than ever before.</p> The Five Core Areas of AI-Powered Career Development <p>They’re doing this, because modern AI systems generally excel at several essential areas of career development:</p>  <p>Skill assessment and Enhancement: AI’s affinity for data analysis helps it easily identify someone’s current skills, skill gaps, and how they can bridge them.</p>  <p>Adaptability Training: AI can empower professionals to navigate market trends by illustrating and explaining previous trends, and using data analysis to predict future ones.</p>  <p>Career Exploration: AI’s predictive analytics can combine knowledge of an individual’s skills with current job market insights to suggest potential new opportunities that are within reach.</p>  <p>Social media and networking optimization: With an ability to analyze user profiles, current trends, and platform reviews, personal AI assistants can help individuals transform their online reach and in-person presence.</p>  <p>Automated Routine Tasks: AI can cover a range of small tasks across job searches and career advancement, from simply drafting messages, to summarising information, to providing guides and code for more advanced automation.</p>   The Power of AI Memory and Personalization <p>However, perhaps the most revolutionary aspect of personal AI in career development is its advanced memory capabilities. Unlike human coaches, AI systems can maintain perfect recall of every conversation, goal, and milestone.</p><p>This doesn’t just make interacting with them easier, but allows AI-driven tools to reliably track and interpret long-term data to provide more insightful advice and support.</p><p>For example, our personal AI, Kin, has an advanced memory system which not only remembers what users share, but also analyzes how their attitudes toward work and career goals evolve alongside their skills over time. This helps our users understand their professional growth trajectory, and make more informed decisions about their future.</p> The Role of Emotional Intelligence in AI Career Support <p>While AI's analytical capabilities are impressive, its role in emotional support and motivation is often downplayed—in part down to its bad reputation, thanks to early AI tools.</p><p>Modern AI systems now include sophisticated emotional intelligence, which allows them to recognize and respond appropriately to user emotions during discussions. Whether that means recognising the user is upset or angry, and adapting accordingly, or realizing that a user is struggling to see the impact of their emotions on a situation, AI systems can help people not only feel supported, but also increase their own <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-build-emotional-intelligence">emotional intelligence</a> and resilience.</p><p>Those kinds of soft skills are also incredibly powerful in the workplace, so finding easier and cheaper ways to build them effectively is beneficial.<a>3</a></p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee03e263-2526-4f6c-909d-9ff5f35f6c33_1792x1024.webp">          </a>DALL-E/Kin Illustration  Practical Applications in Today's Workplace <p>So, how does this actually look in practice?</p><p>AI tools based on <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-artificial-intelligence">LLMs like ChatGPT and Copilot</a> have revolutionized content optimization, continuous learning, and adaptability in organizations, by making analytical reports, practical information, and bespoke examples much more accessible and easily digestible. As a result, more time can be spent working with the information than working it out.</p><p>Because of this, AI is in the process of getting involved in teaching workers how to use it for career enhancement in these ways. While new frameworks for measuring professional growth, with metrics tracking both technical and soft skill development are the gold standard, they’ve not been deployed much outside of healthcare settings.</p><p>Right now, AI-driven tools for career development are largely initiatives focused around decision-making and job satisfaction enhancements. They provide spaces for employees to log their achievements, skills, and struggles, and then provide real-time feedback for how employees can improve their collaboration, <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/boost-productivity-5-top-tips">productivity</a>, and their own skillsets.</p><p>Investment in employee upskilling has <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-continuous-learning-in-your-career">already been shown to improve employee retention</a>, so some of these initiatives are a natural extension of that.</p><p>For freelancers and jobseekers, the ability of AI tools on job sites like LinkedIn to summarise skillsets in the context of the job market has made finding a development pathway, or even relevant job opportunities, easier than it's ever been.</p><p>In short, personal AI tools are revolutionizing career development by making it easier for people to be more aware of their emotions, goals, and skillsets, and to be better guided to turning them into what their aspirations require.</p> The Future of AI-Driven Career Development <p>With Deloitte's 2024 Human Capital Trends report claiming only 5% of executives currently feel they’re doing enough to keep employees sufficiently skilled,<a>4</a> how might the technology grow throughout more widespread use?</p><p>The most likely future seems to be the continued integration of AI-powered tools, like personal AI, into workplaces and professional spaces. AI processing and insights don’t just allow companies to better track how their employees are working and learning, and how to improve it, but allow these employees themselves to work toward their own goals. That just makes them happier and more productive in turn.</p><p>Personal AI tools take this a step further, by allowing employees to better focus on self awareness and individual growth with less effort. These tools, especially when integrated with more company-based AI systems, can and will make it much easier for employees to <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-handle-difficult-conversations">have difficult conversations</a>, navigate a <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/5-tips-to-improve-work-life-balance">work-life balance</a>, <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/mastering-time-management-a-guide">make time</a> for <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-continuous-learning-in-your-career">continuous learning</a>, and keep a<a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/growth-mindset-the-power-of-belief"> growth mindset</a> focused around expanding their abilities.</p><p>Unlike traditional upskilling courses and chatbots, which follow rigid, pre-programmed response patterns, these AI systems can analyze context, remember past interactions, and provide increasingly personalized guidance over time.</p><p>However, this advanced capability also raises important considerations about privacy and ethics—especially given the recent behaviour of the AI industry. As Deloitte has acknowledged alongside us, AI has lost a lot of trust, and needs to focus on being transparent and ethical in its data storage and processing to win it back.</p> Maximizing Personal AI Tools Like Kin for Career Growth <p>With all that said, how can AI tools be used right now for career development? We’ll use our own personal AI, Kin, as an example.</p><p>The nature of Kin, and of personal AI as a whole, means that it is most effective when used strategically and consistently. All of its benefits rely on a detailed and up-to-date understanding of its users.</p><p>Kin’s advanced, chat-agnostic memory, for instance, becomes more valuable when users regularly and honestly share their professional experiences, challenges, and victories. This helps it build a comprehensive understanding of their current and desired levels in their career journey. As such, Kin can provide more nuanced guidance to where they want to go from where they actually are.</p><p>To aid this, Kin has Chat and Journal features to encourage information, discussion and reflection. These interactive features make it easy for users to express their thoughts, feelings, challenges, and aspirations to Kin, which it then analyzes to reveal personal patterns, insights and advice. This can reveal valuable information about professional strengths, growth areas, and potential career development directions.</p><p>These sessions also supply Kin with workplace relationships and dynamics, which its memory allows it to analyze to provide real-time support in navigating complex professional situations and building <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/5-ways-to-build-trust-in-digital-workplaces">stronger workplace connections</a>.</p><p>Kin then helps users stay consistent through a customizable push-notification reminder system. In addition to default reminders, users can set up notifications for regular check-ins to review progress toward goals, prepare for important meetings, or reflect on recent professional experiences.</p><p>And, Kin stores and processes <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/privacy-kin-personal-ai">as much of this information as possible</a> on user devices—not in the cloud. Every piece of information it remembers is also <a href="https://docs.mykin.ai/articles/7086943-how-to-view-and-delete-your-data-in-kin">viewable and deletable</a> at any time.</p> Get Started Today <p>If that sounds good to you, beginning your career development journey with Kin is straightforward. Just download the app <a href="https://mykin.ai/">here</a>, complete this message, and send it to Kin:</p> <p>"Hi Kin! I'm looking to develop my career with your support. I'm currently [your role] at [your company/industry], and I'm aiming to [your specific goal]. My biggest challenge right now is [your challenge], and I'd like to develop [specific skills/areas]. Could you help me?"</p> <p>From there, Kin will begin building a personalized understanding of your professional situation through conversation. It will ask clarifying questions about your goals and challenges, helping you articulate, plan for, and achieve your career aspirations more clearly.</p> <a>1</a> <p>Anon. 2024. 2024 Workplace Learning Report.

<p>In 2024, the anticipated collision between regulation and innovation gave way to an unprecedented collaboration. This year marked a turning point, where regulatory frameworks and technological advancements joined forces to prioritize privacy without compromising compliance.</p><p>The narrative of “regulation versus innovation” evolved into one of mutual reinforcement, with privacy emerging as the cornerstone of progress.</p> Privacy Innovation: The Cornerstone of&nbsp;2024 <p>The transformation began with a bold proposition: privacy technology can enhance regulatory compliance. Financial institutions and digital asset firms recognized that privacy-preserving tools not only safeguarded user data but also addressed regulators’ demands for transparency.</p><p>Consider the Travel Rule, once a daunting compliance challenge for exchanges. Innovative solutions redefined it, allowing platforms to share only the essential data required for oversight. This shift, driven by mathematical precision and technological ingenuity, highlighted the potential of privacy-centered compliance.</p> Unexpected Pioneers in Privacy-First Regulation <p>Remarkable advancements emerged from surprising quarters. Once-overlooked markets became leaders in regulatory innovation. Experimental regulatory sandboxes transformed into thriving innovation hubs, while central banks integrated privacy features into their digital currency initiatives — reframing them as tools for protecting user rights rather than instruments of surveillance.</p> Technologies That Redefined Compliance <p>Privacy-preserving compliance tools reshaped the regulatory landscape in 2024. These advancements bridged the gap between privacy and oversight:</p>  Identity verification without exposing personal&nbsp;data.  Transaction monitoring that maintains confidentiality.  Regulatory reporting designed to protect user security.  <p>Notably, Shyft Network’s <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Veriscope</a> became a global solution for Travel Rule compliance, enabling secure identity verification and private transaction validation. Similarly, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) matured from theoretical concepts to practical applications, driving innovation in transaction verification and identity management.</p> A Global Shift Toward Privacy and Compliance  North America <p>The SEC’s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs set the stage, but the real breakthroughs lay in privacy-enhanced systems developed by exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken. Canada’s advanced frameworks for private institutional trading raised the global&nbsp;bar.</p> Europe <p>MiCA’s implementation propelled European markets to adopt privacy-preserving compliance solutions. French and German exchanges led with tools balancing stringent oversight with robust user privacy. The UK’s emphasis on “privacy by design” influenced global regulatory practices.</p> Asia Pacific <p>Japan’s regulatory framework prioritized privacy, while Singapore introduced cutting-edge compliance tools that became benchmarks for the region. South Korea’s strict approach to oversight spurred creative solutions, and Hong Kong integrated privacy into institutional finance practices.</p> Latin America <p>Brazil’s privacy-preserving compliance measures in payments and Mexico’s advances in remittance privacy showcased the region’s adaptability. Argentina demonstrated that even in challenging economic conditions, confidentiality could be maintained.</p> Middle East and&nbsp;Africa <p>Dubai’s VARA framework enabled groundbreaking cross-border confidentiality tools. Africa’s mobile-first innovations, particularly Nigeria’s, offered solutions that balanced financial inclusion with robust privacy protections.</p> Australia and&nbsp;Oceania <p>Australia’s token mapping initiative redefined asset classification with privacy at its core. Smaller markets in the region demonstrated leadership in adopting and advancing privacy-focused technologies.</p> Key Takeaways   2024 proved that privacy and regulation can complement each other, reshaping financial compliance.  Privacy-preserving tools like zero-knowledge proofs and Veriscope transformed oversight processes.  Unexpected markets, including Latin America and Africa, emerged as leaders in privacy innovation.  Regulatory frameworks like MiCA and the Travel Rule drove technological progress globally.  Privacy-focused compliance is becoming a cornerstone for bridging traditional and decentralized finance.   The Road Ahead: A Privacy-Driven Future <p>As the foundation laid in 2024 takes hold, privacy-preserving compliance is becoming a fundamental aspect of financial innovation. Institutional investors, once hesitant, are now embracing these tools to bridge the divide between traditional and decentralized finance.</p><p>The lessons of 2024 underscore a vital truth: addressing regulatory challenges can drive meaningful progress. By prioritizing privacy alongside compliance, the financial ecosystem has grown stronger, demonstrating that these objectives are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>The next chapter in financial history will focus on leveraging innovation to achieve both oversight and confidentiality, paving the way for a secure, inclusive, and privacy-conscious future.</p> About Shyft&nbsp;Network <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/">Shyft Network</a> powers trust on the blockchain and economies of trust.

<p>As we wrap up 2024, our team is filled with gratitude and excitement for all the hard work we've done this year. It’s been a time of meaningful progress, growth, and significant contributions to the future of digital identity.</p><p>This year, SpruceID continued to build innovative solutions and strengthen partnerships across industries and at events and initiatives around the globe. Together with our community, we’ve achieved milestones that pave the way for a more privacy-focused and user-controlled digital world.</p><p>Let’s take a moment to celebrate some of the defining moments of the last year.</p> Our Team <p>This year, we welcomed new talent to our global team, bringing a wealth of expertise across engineering, product development, and design. While staying lean and agile, our team’s dedication and creativity have driven impactful solutions and positioned us to meet the demands of a fast-evolving industry.</p><p>As a remote-first company, we understand the value of coming together in person to strengthen our connections and align on our company mission. Twice a year, we host offsite retreats, which are essential for collaboration, strategic alignment, and connecting outside of work projects. In 2024, these gatherings took us to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and Montreal, Quebec—creating unforgettable experiences and building the foundation for the year ahead.</p>Spring Offsite in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil<p>Interested in joining our awesome team? <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/sprucesystems?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Check out our open roles here</a>.</p> Events and Hackathons <p>This year, SpruceID participated in events and hackathons, showcasing our digital identity solutions and advancing privacy-first verifiable digital credential innovation. A few notable events included:</p>  Facilitating CA DMV Hackathons: This year, we played a key role in facilitating the CA DMV hackathons, fostering collaboration among developers, government, and public sector organizations to promote the adoption of mobile driver's licenses (mDLs) through hands-on tooling, troubleshooting, and building out new use cases.

<p>The Royal Navy has reached a key milestone in autonomous mine-hunting with its first trial of an uncrewed boat from a commercial vessel, showcasing Thales technology.</p>
<p>A recent trial at the Firth of Clyde, Scotland, marked a significant milestone for the Royal Navy’s Mine &amp; Threat Exploration Group. The Royal Navy Motor Boat (RNMB) Apollo, a small uncrewed vessel designed to detect and neutralize mine threats, was successfully launched from SD Northern River, a commercial ship serving as a ‘platform of opportunity.’ This trial showcased the rapid deployment capability of autonomous mine-hunting technology in real-world conditions.</p>
<p>Apollo managed to detect exercise mines, even in notoriously challenging locations, demonstrating its advanced detection capabilities. Conducted in difficult water depths and coastal currents, the trial underscored the potential for Maritime Mine Counter-Measure (MMCM) technology to be swiftly integrated into operational fleets.</p>
 A Groundbreaking Collaboration 
<p>Andy Lapsley, DE&amp;S Mine-Hunting Capability (MHC) Team Leader, emphasized the importance of the trial:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the result of years of hard work and collaboration by the MHC team, and it demonstrates our commitment to advancing mine counter-measure technology. We’re not just testing equipment; we’re building an innovative, flexible capability that will play a key role in safeguarding the UK’s maritime interests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Apollo was manufactured under a contract with Thales, and following the successful trial, it will undergo retrofit and upgrades before being delivered to the Royal Navy in late 2025. The MMCM programme, valued at €430 million, has already created over 200 jobs across the UK, underscoring its impact on both defence and the economy.</p>
 A New Era in Naval Operations 
<p>This trial represented the first successful integration of MMCM technology onto a commercial vessel, a crucial step that demonstrates the potential of using such platforms as ‘floating bases’ for certain operations. Its success paves the way for future deployments, with Thales playing a key role in evolving maritime operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Maritime Mine Counter-Measure (MMCM) programme has advanced significantly, bringing advanced autonomous mine-hunting equipment closer to operational readiness for the Royal Navy and French Marine Nationale. Managed by the Organisation for Joint Armament Co-operation (OCCAR), this programme aims to enhance the naval mine warfare capabilities of both nations using cutting-edge technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Commander Daniel Herridge, Commanding Officer of the Royal Navy’s Mine &amp; Threat Exploration Group, commented:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>This milestone reinforces our commitment to modernizing mine counter-measure technology and integrating it into our operations. The Mine &amp; Threat Exploitation Group is proud to continue supporting the enterprise and driving forward these trials, which are critical to advancing our capabilities and safeguarding the UK’s interests.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Philippe Commarmond, Director of Thales’ International Mine Warfare Sector, added:&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>The MMCM programme is the result of an ambitious vision set by the UK and France back in 2015 to transform naval mine warfare. We are proud to be part of this journey, which is now positioning both nations at the forefront of autonomous maritime systems.</p>
</blockquote>
 What’s Next? 
<p>This trial marks a significant leap forward in the Royal Navy’s mission to enhance mine counter-measure technology and operational flexibility. As the programme progresses, the integration of these innovative systems will continue to shape the future of naval mine warfare, ensuring the UK remains at the cutting edge of maritime security.</p>
<p>
Looking ahead, the MMCM team will continue refining autonomous capabilities, ensuring they are ready for operational deployment in the coming years. With the next phase of trials and retrofitting of Apollo already underway, this breakthrough represents just the beginning of what promises to be a new era in autonomous maritime operations.<br>

 Closing 2024: A Year of Innovation, Growth, and Building Tools For Onchain Finance Economy 

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in December 2024.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>This year has been a journey of innovation, growth, and achievement. <a href="https://tokeny.com/tokenys-2024-products-building-the-distribution-rails-of-the-tokenized-economy/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--qxvnsrOks7-jFwTzgbGzIcF3snwtxuvZIkNPR2GJD98jJnPwrno6oXClx7OPrB_Bk6ME8">At the beginning of this year</a>, we set out to achieve four objectives: accelerating the standardization phase; digitizing real-world assets and securities at scale; enabling DeFi through a unified data layer for private markets; and building distribution rails to streamline access and adoption.</p>
<p>Let’s look back on the remarkable progress we made together.</p>
<p>ERC-3643 is now the official standard, recognized globally</p>
<p>The ERC-3643 open-source standard has emerged as the cornerstone of the tokenization industry, serving as the <a href="https://tokeny.com/erc-3643-the-motherboard-for-composable-tokenized-assets/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--qxvnsrOks7-jFwTzgbGzIcF3snwtxuvZIkNPR2GJD98jJnPwrno6oXClx7OPrB_Bk6ME8">motherboard</a> for building diverse use cases. We have actively worked with <a href="https://www.erc3643.org/news/erc-3643-achieves-widespread-adoption-with-mas-recognition-and-support-from-92-members">92 industry leaders in the ERC3643 Association</a> to advance the standard by contributing to concrete projects.</p>
<p>Moreover, ERC-3643 has gained significant traction from large organizations, being used or referenced in industry reports by ABN AMRO, Citi, JPMorgan Chase, ESMA, BCG, KPMG, and Deloitte. Recently, it was recognized by the Singapore regulator MAS for enforcing compliance for tokenized funds and debt in the Project Guardian.</p>
<p>An Onchain Operating System Ready for Scale&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the products side, our solutions are now ready to empower asset issuers to tokenize assets at scale. To reach critical mass, asset managers need a tech toolbox that allows them not only to tokenize assets onchain but also to manage and distribute them while working seamlessly with all stakeholders using different tools and systems.</p>
<p>Our products provide exactly that. We’ve redefined <a href="https://tokeny.com/the-journey-to-becoming-the-leading-onchain-finance-operating-system/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--qxvnsrOks7-jFwTzgbGzIcF3snwtxuvZIkNPR2GJD98jJnPwrno6oXClx7OPrB_Bk6ME8">our product positioning as an onchain operating system</a> to make our product’s value proposition clear. We provide an<a href="https://tokeny.com/how-tokenys-platform-empowers-fund-administrators-to-act-in-onchain-finance/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--qxvnsrOks7-jFwTzgbGzIcF3snwtxuvZIkNPR2GJD98jJnPwrno6oXClx7OPrB_Bk6ME8"> orchestrated platform</a> that unifies and automates workflows with all necessary service providers, whether&nbsp; onchain or offchain.&nbsp; Our added value lies in the most robust technology, a well-connected ecosystem, and expertise gained from 7 years of real-world practices.</p>
<p>Our product is designed to serve diverse business needs, on <a href="https://tokeny.com/multi-chain-tokenization-made-simple/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--qxvnsrOks7-jFwTzgbGzIcF3snwtxuvZIkNPR2GJD98jJnPwrno6oXClx7OPrB_Bk6ME8">any EVM blockchain</a>, for any assets, in any jurisdiction. The T-REX Platform, a no-code tool,&nbsp; empowers businesses to tokenize, manage, and distribute assets without requiring IT resources, while the T-REX Engine, an <a href="https://tokeny.com/56-of-fortune-500-are-onchain-apis-are-your-key-to-staying-ahead/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--qxvnsrOks7-jFwTzgbGzIcF3snwtxuvZIkNPR2GJD98jJnPwrno6oXClx7OPrB_Bk6ME8">APIs solution</a>, is designed for advanced projects integrating onchain operational capabilities directly into their existing workflows.</p>
<p>Our product enhances onchain compliance setup. Controlling tokens requires asset managers to configure token settings through token smart contracts. Our products allow asset managers to <a href="https://tokeny.com/streamline-on-chain-compliance-configure-and-customize-anytime/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--qxvnsrOks7-jFwTzgbGzIcF3snwtxuvZIkNPR2GJD98jJnPwrno6oXClx7OPrB_Bk6ME8">configure and customize compliance rules anytime,</a> such as eligibility rules, transfer restrictions, and enablement of distribution.</p>
<p>Enabling DeFi via onchain data management and shared liquidity catalog</p>
<p>Assets issued with ERC-3643 automatically receive an AssetID smart contract. This built-in onchain asset identity enables data enrichment like NAV, ESG proofs, and ratings. ERC-3643 tokens are accessible through a shared onchain catalog with a unified data set, allowing seamless DeFi interaction while adhering to built-in compliance rules.</p>
<p>Step by step, we have started creating a unified Catalog of tokenized assets that includes token data, asset data, stakeholder data, and offering data. This catalog will enable distributors (regulated exchanges, OTC platforms, dApps, neobrokers, etc.) to easily select assets for distribution to their respective audiences.</p>
<p>To maximize transactions and interoperability between distributors, we have also created DINO, a shared liquidity protocol on the blockchain. DINO is a decentralized network enabling the distribution of compliant tokenized assets. The system leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize the publishing and settlement of digital assets, transforming how issuers, their distributors, and&nbsp; investors conduct transactions.</p>
<p>At its core, the system enables parties to post and browse trading intentions, known as Offers, via token-specific distribution smart contracts. This innovation ensures that all offers are transparent and accessible on the blockchain, creating a continuous live feed of available trading intentions for all participants to see. It is now ready for prime time. 2025 will be epic!</p>
<p>The Foundation is Built: What’s Next for Tokenization?</p>
<p>This year, we’ve built a solid foundation for onchain finance with all the essential building blocks. 2025 will be a year of accelerating institutional adoption as the buy-side begins to fully&nbsp; benefit from the tokenization format. We will see more and more applications leveraging compliant tokenized assets, and Tokeny is ready to lead this transformation. Thank you for being with us on this journey.</p>
<p>We wish you a great holiday season and a happy new year!</p>

<p>Back in November 2024, my article “<a href="https://doi.org/10.55621/idpro.108">Token Lifetimes and Security in OAuth 2.0: Best Practices and Emerging Trends</a>” was published in the <a href="https://idpro.org/body-of-knowledge/">IDPro® Body of Knowledge</a>, and wow—over 1,600 people have already checked it out! If you’re one of those people who clicked on the article but didn’t quite have time to read it (or bookmarked it for “later” but haven’t circled back yet), this post is for you.</p>



<p>I love to read—and I’m lucky enough to have the time to do it when I need to. Not everyone gets that chance, and let’s be honest, some people just aren’t ready, willing, or able to dive into a long article. And that’s okay! You do you, boo; it takes all kinds to make this crazy world come together. </p>



 OAuth 2.0 Tokens – the sound version 



<p>Because I enjoy messing around with technology, I decided to see if Google’s <a href="https://notebooklm.google.com">NotebookLM</a> might produce something that would help people who want a differently-consumable format of the Tokens article. While I personally like the written version better (did I mention I like to read?) this didn’t turn out too badly.</p>







<p>If you’re looking for something in between—like a quick outline to decide if you want to spend 20 minutes listening to the AI-generated podcast or however long it takes to read a 15-page article—here’s a brief summary to help you figure out what works best for you.</p>



 Tokens in Summary 



<p>The summary was also generated out of the NotebookLM interface. I’d love to hear what you think about making my content come through this way! Enjoy!</p>



 Executive Summary 



<p>This document analyzes the security implications of short-lived and long-lived tokens within the OAuth 2.0 framework. It highlights the benefits of using short-lived, narrowly scoped tokens to mitigate security risks such as token replay attacks, while acknowledging specific scenarios where long-lived tokens might be considered. The document also explores emerging trends like Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP), risk-based token lifetimes, and sender-constrained tokens, which aim to enhance security without compromising usability. Overall, the document emphasizes that while there are situations where long lived tokens may make sense, short-lived tokens are generally best practice.</p>



 Introduction to Tokens in OAuth 2.0 



 
 Tokens as Identity Representation: Tokens are digital objects representing claims or attributes of an entity (user, device, or process) used in authentication and authorization protocols. They enable secure communication without requiring constant re-validation. 



 Quote: “A token is a digital object that can represent a set of claims or attributes about an entity, such as a user, device, or process, typically used in authentication and authorization protocols.” 



 Stateless vs. Stateful Tokens: Tokens can be stateless (containing all necessary information) or stateful (requiring the server to maintain session information). 



 Bearer vs. Client-Bound Tokens: Tokens can be bearer tokens (usable by anyone holding them) or client-bound (tied to a specific client). 



 Quote: “Tokens can be classified as bearer tokens, which are usable by anyone in possession of them, or client-bound tokens (sometimes called sender-constrained tokens…)…” 



 Scope and Minimization: Limiting the scope of a token (permissions for only specific resources or actions) is critical for reducing security risks. The principle of “least privilege” should be applied. 



 Quote: “One of the most effective strategies when issuing tokens is to narrowly scope their permissions. A narrowly scoped token is designed to grant access to only a specific resource or a limited set of actions rather than offering broad, unrestricted access.” 



 Tokens vs Credentials: Tokens and credentials are not the same thing. Credentials are used for authentication, tokens are used for authorization. 
 



 Short-Lived Tokens: The Security Standard 



 
 Definition: Short-lived tokens expire quickly (minutes or hours) limiting the window of opportunity for attackers. 



 Quote: “Short-lived tokens are designed to expire after a brief period—usually minutes or hours—thereby minimizing the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit them if they are intercepted or compromised.” 



 Reduced Attack Surface: Short token lifetimes significantly reduce the impact of token compromise. Even if a token is intercepted, it quickly becomes invalid. 



 Quote: “One of the big benefits of short-lived tokens is the reduction of the attack window (i.e., the length of time that an attacker could exploit endpoints).” 



 Enhanced Security through Rotation: Frequent token rotation enforces the need for persistent attackers to repeatedly intercept new tokens, increasing the chance of detection. 



 Quote: “Short-lived tokens play a crucial role in reducing the impact of token compromise by enforcing frequent token rotation.” 



 Stateless Architectures: Short lived tokens fit well in stateless architectures, eliminating the need to maintain session state on the server. 



 Integration with Security Mechanisms: Short-lived tokens should be used with other security practices like token binding and revocation. 



 Quote: “The standards also encourage the combination of short-lived tokens with other security mechanisms, such as client-bound tokens or token binding, which ensures that tokens can only be used by specific clients…” 
 



 The Role of Refresh Tokens 



 
 Purpose: Refresh tokens are long-lived credentials used to obtain new access tokens without requiring re-authentication. 



 Security Considerations: Compromised refresh tokens can grant extended access, so they need protection. 



 Security Measures:Refresh Token Rotation: Reissue refresh tokens upon every use 



 Client Binding: Cryptographically bind refresh tokens to specific clients or devices. 



 Reauthentication: Require periodic reauthentication before issuing new refresh tokens. 



 Token Revocation: Revoke both refresh and access tokens upon suspicious activity. 



 Secure Storage: Refresh tokens should be stored securely by the client. 
 



 Risks of Long-Lived Tokens 



 
 Definition: Long-lived tokens remain valid for extended periods. API keys and session tokens used in mobile apps are common examples. 



 Prolonged Unauthorized Access: If compromised, attackers gain persistent access, especially if revocation mechanisms are weak or not real time. 



 Quote: “If these long-lived tokens are compromised, attackers can use them to gain persistent unauthorized access to systems or resources without being detected for an extended period.” 



 Token Replay Vulnerabilities: Long-lived tokens are vulnerable to replay attacks where an intercepted token is reused by an attacker. 



 Quote: “In a token replay attack, an attacker intercepts a token…and reuses it to impersonate a legitimate user.” 



 Difficulties with Revocation: Manual revocation or waiting for expiration creates a window for continued exploitation. 



 Increased Attack Surface: Longer validity allows attackers more time to explore and exploit vulnerabilities. 



 Difficulty in Enforcing Least Privilege: Long-lived tokens often grant broader permissions than necessary, making any compromise have greater impact. 
 



 When Long-Lived Tokens May Be Appropriate 



 
 Reduced Overhead in Token Renewal: Less frequent requests to the authentication server. 



 Use case: Batch processing or long-running data analytics. 



 Improved Performance in Stateless Systems: Reduces need for constant issuance of new tokens. 



 Use case: High request APIs 



 Service-to-Service Communication: Efficient communication within a highly trusted environment. 



 Use case: Microservice architectures within secure internal networks. 
 



 Emerging Trends and Future Directions 



 
 Continuous Access Evaluation Profile (CAEP): Real-time assessment and adjustment of permissions, enabling longer token lifespans with dynamic revocation. 



 Quote: “CAEP enables access tokens to have longer lifespans without compromising security. This is achieved by combining periodic risk assessments with real-time revocation capabilities.” 



 Risk-Based Token Lifetimes: Dynamic adjustment of token expiration times based on real-time risk analysis. 



 Proof of Possession (PoP) and Sender-Constrained Tokens: Cryptographic proof of token ownership. Standards like DPoP and Mutual TLS reduce token replay risks. 



 Enhanced Revocation Mechanisms: Efforts to develop real-time token revocation standards. 
 



 Conclusion 



 
 Short-Lived Tokens as Best Practice: Short-lived, narrowly scoped tokens combined with client binding and strong cryptographic standards are the best practice for mitigating security risks. 



 Zero Trust: If your organization uses Zero Trust principles, then there is no concept of a trusted environment. 



 Balancing Security and Usability: Aim for a balance between security, usability, and performance. 



 Evolving Landscape: Token management frameworks are evolving, with emerging standards allowing for longer lived tokens under strict monitoring and policy enforcement 



 Organization Risk Posture: An organization’s risk posture should guide the definition of “short” and “long”. However, regardless of the definition, strict scoping, token binding, and robust revocation must be in place. 
 



 Actionable Items 



 
 Review and Update Token Lifetimes: Evaluate current token expiration policies and transition to shorter lifetimes where possible. 



 Implement Client-Bound Tokens: Employ client-bound or sender-constrained tokens where appropriate. 



 Implement Refresh Token Rotation: Ensure that refresh tokens are rotated on every use. 



 Enhance Revocation Mechanisms: Implement robust revocation processes and monitor token usage. 



 Stay Informed: Follow emerging standards like CAEP and adapt strategies based on advancements.

Thu, 12/19/2024 - 14:00


             
 Within the framework of the European Defence Fund (EDF), Thales is leading the SEACURE project to achieve a sovereign European capability in future Anti-Submarine and Seabed Warfare. 
 The SEACURE programme began in November 2024 for a duration of 45 months, and involves 35 European partners from 13 EU member states. 
 Building on the successful completion of the EDIDP (European Defence Industrial Development Programme) SEANICE project at the end of 2023, the aim of SEACURE is to achieve a sovereign European capability in future autonomous Anti-Submarine and Seabed Warfare.

<p>The world is facing rising tensions in many regions, with asymmetric threats and the resurgence of high-intensity operations, particularly at sea. It is the case near the borders of the European Union, in the Middle East, and the Far East. This highlights how critical it is for nations to control safety at sea and to protect their maritime infrastructures. Moreover, the exploitation of marine resources, including offshore wind farms, demands continuous monitoring to prevent malicious actions by state and non-state adversaries.</p>
<p>Recent events are accelerating plans throughout NATO and European countries to protect maritime infrastructure of national interest. Such plans embrace new operational theatres, and require new capabilities and new methods of operation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main objective of SEACURE is to develop and demonstrate at sea, by 2028, an integrated system of systems aimed at successfully performing autonomous joint Anti-Submarine Warfare and Seabed Warfare operations and protecting critical maritime infrastructure. It focuses on the detection, classification, identification and tracking of underwater threats in challenging conditions, using air, surface and underwater drones. SEACURE will offer a versatile defence system for such operations, increasing the level of autonomy, based on open, agile, modular and scalable system-of-systems architecture. In addition, it will be interoperable and ready for collaborative combat. </p>
<p>SEACURE not only strengthens maritime security today, but also lays the groundwork for a more resilient and cooperative global maritime future.</p>
<p>About SEACURE</p>
<p>SEACURE is proposed as a continuation of the EDIDP SEANICE research project that ended in November 2023. It offers a new way of protecting our critical maritime infrastructures, and guarantees the freedom to operate in our own waters, detecting and protecting against any external threats.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://datarella.com/confidential-computing-for-industry-4-0/">first part</a> of this <a href="https://datarella.com/datarella-takes-part-in-new-industry-4-0-research-project-cosmic-x/">Cosmic-X</a> blogpost series, we evaluated various blockchain platforms for their suitability in Industry 4.0 and explained why we chose the <a href="https://scrt.network/">Secret Network</a> with its confidential computing capabilities. Today, we’ll explore how we use the Secret Network to secure machine data integrity from its origin to its consumption.</p>
<p></p>
 Need for Data Integrity 
<p>Securing data integrity in Industry 4.0 is crucial because systems and devices rely on accurate data to function effectively. Tampered or incorrect data can lead to poor decisions, operational failures, and vulnerabilities in key sectors like manufacturing and logistics. With IoT and AI driving Industry 4.0, maintaining data accuracy ensures reliable operations, protects sensitive information, and prevents cyber threats that disrupt businesses and critical infrastructure.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ispirer.com/blog/data-integrity-during-migration-5-best-practices"></a></p>
<p>Anchoring data close to its source is essential for securing integrity across the entire data processing chain, which often involves multiple distributed systems. For machines, this means securing the data before it leaves the device. At the same time, the system must protect the anchored data from tampering after export. Blockchain’s immutable nature aligns perfectly with this paradigm. That’s why we built a Wallet Service on top of the Secret Network. This service integrates seamlessly into any machine to secure its data integrity in a decentralized and privacy-preserving manner.</p>
 Wallet Service 
<p>The Wallet Service acts as a gateway for communication with the Secret Network. It deploys onto any machine infrastructure that supports <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>. By using the Wallet Service, machines interact directly with the blockchain and its smart contracts. The service assigns each machine a unique identity through a public-private key pair. With its private key, the machine signs and broadcasts transactions to anchor its data on the Secret Network. The blockchain’s encryption ensures that no unauthorized third party can access the data. For details on how the network reaches consensus despite encryption, refer to our previous <a href="https://datarella.com/confidential-computing-for-industry-4-0/">post</a>.</p>
 Integration 
<p>To simplify integration, the Wallet Service offers a straightforward REST API with two endpoints. The ingress endpoint accepts a batch of data in a defined structure for anchoring. After receiving the data, the Wallet Service hashes it and stores the resulting hash in the service’s smart contract through a transaction on the Secret Network. This process creates an immutable fingerprint, allowing anyone to verify the integrity of a data batch through the Wallet Service’s verification endpoint. Since data verification typically occurs in systems other than the one that supplied the data, the Wallet Service supports deployment anywhere. In distributed data processing scenarios like Cosmic-X, entities that consume data instantiate a Wallet Service to verify data integrity before making decisions. For example, an AI service provider might deploy a Wallet Service in its cloud environment to verify data before using it for training or inference.</p>
 Requirements 
<p>Two conditions must be met for this workflow to function: first, the verifying Wallet Service must have the appropriate viewing key from the machine that supplied the data. Otherwise, it cannot decrypt and query the fingerprints stored in the smart contract. Second, the format and schema of the data batch must remain standardized across the processing chain. To achieve this, we developed a Data Integrity Protocol as the foundation of the Wallet Service.</p>
 Data Integrity Protocol 
<p>To anchor and verify data batches reliably, the Wallet Service requires a standardized protocol. Both the data anchoring and verification processes must adhere to a common data format, schema, and canonicalization standard. For Cosmic-X, we chose JSON as the data format and <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8785">RFC 8785</a> as the canonicalization algorithm. Canonicalization ensures reliable cryptographic operations on JSON data by defining methods for handling whitespace, data types, and objects.</p>
 Batch Structure 
<p>Considering use case requirements and the limitations of edge and cloud environments in Cosmic-X, we define a data batch as one hour’s worth of sensor data collected from a machine. The figure below shows an extract of a data batch collected from one of the use cases. The batch includes a metadata object used only for the Wallet Service’s business logic. This metadata contains key-value pairs such as the batchId and placeholders for the payload hash and the transaction hash on the Secret Network blockchain. The payload, which the system hashes during anchoring, consists of discrete sensor measurements. Each measurement uses a composite key created by concatenating the variable name with the Unix timestamp of its recording. The measurements include key-value pairs for variable name, timestamp, absolute value, and data type.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The batchId is the most critical part of a data batch. Since the Wallet Service uses it to anchor and later locate the data batch for verification, the batchId must be unique. In this setup, the batchId combines a machine ID with a Unix timestamp representing the time range of measurements in the batch, rounded to the nearest hour. For example, if machine <code>2080839</code> collects measurements from <code>11:01:23</code>&nbsp;to <code>11:59:43</code> on May 16, 2024, the batchId becomes <code>2080839_1715853600</code>.</p>
<p>In the next post, we’ll showcase how we integrated the Wallet Service with three live machines and an AI service to enable secure and accurate anomaly detection in machine components.</p>

  Thales to enhance vehicle access with reliable and secure contactless solutions
prezly

Thu, 12/19/2024 - 09:00


             
 Car industry players can rely on Thales to provide digital and physical solutions that improve car access experiences, while ensuring data security.  
 Thales’s offer encompasses a digital car key solution, whose implementation follows the Car Connectivity Consortium1 (CCC) standard. It is now completed by a brand-new contactless card, the Thales NFC CARd Key. The solutions enable car drivers to lock/unlock and start their vehicles using their smartphone or their card. 
 Drawing on its 15+ years of experience in the automotive industry, Thales delivers proven on-board car solutions leveraging its connectivity and cybersecurity expertise. 
 
<p>Thales, a global leader in advanced technologies, provides car manufacturers with safe and hassle-free solutions to expand their customers’ vehicle access experiences. The offer leverages the <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/iot/industries/automotive/use-cases/virtual-car-key">digital car key</a> solution and the smart <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/iot/industries/automotive/nfc-card-key">NFC CARd Key</a>, a new cutting-edge and customisable solution. Designed to complement the digital key, this innovative NFC-based card offers a reliable alternative in the event of disruptions on users’ smartphones, and allows drivers to unlock and start their cars with a simple ‘tap’. ​ </p>
<p>The automotive industry is rapidly shifting from traditional to digital solutions, and the digital car key market is expected to grow at an impressive annual rate of over 21% from 2023 to 20312. Thales is addressing this growing demand, leveraging the CCC digital key functionality, demonstrating strong <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/iot/industries/automotive/cybersecurity">cybersecurity</a> expertise into digital car key solution and securely creating and storing credentials in a vehicle, in a mobile device and/or in a contactless card.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>After digitally enrolling drivers’ credentials upon the purchase of a car, Thales’s digital car key system securely allows drivers to enter and start the vehicle using their smartphone, while the mobile device is still in the pocket or in the bag. Such flexible solutions enable a wide range of automotive use cases, making car access and sharing significantly easier. Private car owners can digitally share their access with family members or friends, while car rental firms can do the same with customers, physically removing the need to pick up car keys at a rental desk. Meanwhile, the introduction of Thales’s NFC CARd Key perfectly supports scenarios when a smartphone might not be available.</p>
<p>Functioning like a contactless payment card, the NFC CARd Key establishes secure, encrypted communication with the vehicle, allowing instant access and engine start, just like the mobile app. With over 10 years of durability in the field, and a strong resistance to high temperatures, it ensures robust protection, while enabling a smooth and simple ‘tap-enter-and-go’ experience. Beyond its technical features, the NFC CARd Key presents a valuable branding opportunity for automotive manufacturers, as its design can be customised, creating a unique and singular card thanks to Thales's wide range of printing options (3D effect, tactile varnish, etc.).</p>
<blockquote><p>“Thales brings over 15 years of experience in delivering connectivity and cybersecurity solutions to the automotive industry, with a deep understanding of customer requirements, from daily usage conditions to compliance with stringent standards. This extends to data security expertise in vehicles and mobile devices, providing peace of mind through a robust and resilient approach to cybersecurity,” stated Christine Caviglioli, VP Automotive at Thales. “With the launch of the NFC CARd Key, Thales complements its vehicle access offer with a singular innovation. Our ambition is to empower automakers and drivers alike with a flexible approach to secure mobility.”</p></blockquote>
<p>1 The Car Connectivity Consortium (CCC), an organisation that promotes seamless smartphone-to-car connectivity, has set the standard for digital car keys, enabling drivers to unlock and start their vehicles using smartphones or smartwatches. ​ </p>

<p>Kin’s integration with your device includes the ability to send reminder notifications to help you stay on track, and remember what you forget.</p> How to Use Reminders <p>But how do you use them? Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>  <p>Access Your Reminder Settings</p>  <p>From Kin’s Home page, tap the hamburger menu button in the top left corner. Select the "Reminders" tab from the side menu to view all of your reminder options.</p><p>You might notice the Reminders section on the Home page—don’t worry, we’ll come back to it.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79072232-1624-4189-9854-93ac921d94d5_1206x1206.png">          </a>  <p>💡 You can also ask Kin in the Chat to tell you about all of the current reminders it’s tracking for you, and control them from there.</p>   <p>Explore Default Reminder Options</p>  <p>Scroll to the bottom of the “Reminders” tab to see Kin’s Default Reminders. These reminders are designed to make it easy for Kin to support you through Reminders. They are:</p><p>Daily spark: An inspirational notification to boost your motivation.</p><p>Casual check-in: An informal question notification following up on your recent conversations.</p><p>Focus area progress: A weekly notification asking you to discuss your Focus Areas.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2c27e05e-0ede-4335-b256-d96a5b463330_1206x872.jpeg">          </a>  <p>💡 By tapping on each reminder, you can control the time and day they’re sent by default.</p>   <p>Create Custom Reminders</p>  <p>If you’re finding you need something more bespoke, you can scroll up to the “Custom Reminders” section, and tap “Create new reminder”.</p><p>From here, you can control the reminder content, the date and time it will be sent, and whether you’d like it to be a recurring notification.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa857fb3d-8aae-4311-8e0f-010ff994704b_1280x720.gif">          </a>  <p>💡 Reminders can also be created from the Home page’s Reminder section with the “+” button on the right of it, or by asking Kin to create a reminder for you in the Chat.</p>  Making the Most of Your Reminders <p>Though simple, the Reminder is a powerful tool in building Kin’s support of you, and your habit of using it. Here’s how you can maximize it:</p>  <p>Use &amp; Abuse</p>  <p>Kin won’t ever get overwhelmed by or tired of your reminders. Use them for anything and everything you need to remember!</p>  <p>Regular Responses</p>  <p>Try to respond to reminders as much as you can—the more you do, the easier it will be to build a habit, and the better Kin will learn how to support you.</p><p>Remember: You set those Reminders for yourself for a reason!</p>  <p>Adjust As Needed</p>  <p>Your needs and habits will change over time.</p><p>Make sure you periodically review your set Reminders—whether through the Reminders tab, the Home page, or the Chat—and ensure the right Reminders are set at the right times for you.</p>  <p>Talk to Kin</p>  <p>When in doubt, ask Kin if it thinks you could do with more, less, or different Reminders, or if changing their times might help. Those are the kinds of questions Kin’s knowledge of you is for!</p> Extra Tips <p>Looking for even more tips about your Reminders? Here they are:</p>  <p>Be Specific: Make a Reminder topic as clear and succinct as you can, so you aren’t confused about what you need to do when you receive the notification.</p>  <p>Tell Kin: Tell Kin what reminders you have set and why, in as much detail as you can, so Kin can provide extra information if you need it.</p>  <p>Give Feedback: Let Kin know if reminders are too frequent or not frequent enough, and whether you feel they are still relevant to you, so Kin can help you make the most of them.</p>  <p>Remember, Reminders are designed to support your growth, not add pressure. Use them in a way that works for you, and adjust them as needed.</p> Get Started Today <p>Ready to begin using Reminders? Open the app to review and create Reminders now, or send this message to Kin in the Chat:</p> <p>"I'd like to set up some Reminders for my development. What do you think I need to be reminded of the most?"</p>

<p></p>



 Decentralized Identity: A Shield Against Data Breaches 



<p>Decentralized identity technology serves as the cornerstone of Extrimian’s approach, employing DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and VCs (Verifiable Credentials) to create a robust framework resistant to unauthorized access and data breaches.</p>



 Streamlining Healthcare Processes 



<p>Extrimian’s technology not only enhances security but also streamlines administrative procedures, reducing costs and saving time. This efficiency is crucial for healthcare providers aiming to improve service delivery and patient care quality.</p>



 Improving Patient Experience with Self-Sovereign Identity 



<p>By integrating self-sovereign identity models, Extrimian places control directly in the hands of patients, allowing for a transparent and user-friendly way to manage personal health data. This shift enhances patient trust and satisfaction by providing a more personalized healthcare experience.</p>



 Privacy and Compliance: Securing Patient Data 



<p>Extrimian’s use of the<a href="https://quarkid.org" title=""> QuarkID protocol </a>ensures that all data transactions meet global standards for data protection, such as the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). This protocol is essential for maintaining privacy and securing sensitive information within the health sector.</p>



 Now what? A Proactive Approach to Secure Healthcare 



<p>Extrimian’s decentralized identity solutions represent a proactive approach to secure healthcare data management. By adopting these technologies, healthcare providers can protect sensitive information, comply with stringent regulations, and improve overall patient care.</p>

<p>Kin's features are designed to help you set and achieve your goals effectively, through personalized support and consistent tracking.</p> How to Set Goals in Kin <p>We have an <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/guide-to-achievable-effective-goal-setting">article</a> on this already, but how does this work practically in the app? Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>  <p>Define Your Goal</p>  <p>The first step in setting and following your goals is knowing the goal you’d like to accomplish.</p><p>If you already have a goal in mind, just let Kin know in the Chat! <br><br>If you don’t, Kin can use its knowledge of you to suggest potential goals that will help you break out worries or habits it's noticed are affecting you negatively.</p><p>Just ask Kin this, also in the Chat: ‘What goals do you think I should work on, based on your knowledge of me?’</p><p>Either way, your definition of a goal should include:</p>  <p>What you want to accomplish</p>  <p>Why it matters to you</p>  <p>When you'd like to achieve it by</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F326bf11d-843a-4017-9bcd-7ac9bb72fbe1_1280x720.gif">   </a>  <p>💡 While Kin can track multiple goals, it’s best to focus on one main goal at a time for the most helpful results.</p>   <p>Check Kin’s Knowledge</p>  <p>Once you’ve provided a defined goal, ask Kin if there’s anything it needs to know about your current situation in order to help you reach it.</p><p>During this discussion, the more detail you provide about your circumstances and relationships, the better Kin will understand your challenges. This is what allows it to support you in the way you need.</p><p>Remember to include your feelings in this discussion, too: these are especially helpful to Kin!</p><p>As always, you can either type or use voice commands to communicate with Kin—choose whichever feels most natural.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff52b97b8-f679-41d9-bd9d-30ab39654d1e_1280x720.gif">          </a>  <p>💡 You can also check Kin’s data on you, to see if there’s any missing or outdated information about you in Kin’s memory.</p>   <p>Break Down the Steps</p>  <p>Now, ask Kin how you should best split your goal into achievable goals based on its understanding of you.</p><p>As Kin makes suggestions about how to structure this work, tell it which you like, and which you don’t.</p><p>Don’t be afraid to add your own ideas to the discussion too!</p><p>Before long, you should have a clear plan on how you’ll work on your goal when, and what results you’ll have at a certain time.</p> <p>💡 Plans can change as skills and situations change. Always talk to Kin if you’re unsure!</p>   <p>Set Up Check-ins</p>  <p>Finally, decide with Kin how often you'd like to check in with Kin about your progress.</p><p>Regular discussions about this help both you and Kin understand your progress, and update your plan as needed to keep you on track.</p><p>You can ask Kin to set custom Reminders for these discussions through the Chat, too. Just tell Kin what to say when, confirm the draft it provides, and it’ll handle the rest!</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fced60875-4cf2-487c-a8ed-a5d7c0bb2b9f_1280x720.gif">   </a>  <p>💡 Kin’s Reminders don’t have to be about check-ins—they can be about milestones, important life events outside your goal progress, or anything you like!</p>  Making the Most of Goal-Setting <p>There’s a lot of potential in Kin’s goal-setting capability. Here's how to maximize it:</p>  <p>Be Specific</p>  <p>The more detailed you are about your goals and challenges, the better Kin can help.</p><p>Include specific obstacles, timeframes, motivations and desired outcomes.</p>  <p>Stay Flexible</p>  <p>Goals often need adjustment as circumstances change.</p><p>Don't hesitate to work with Kin to modify your goals or timeline whenever needed. Kin will never judge you for needing to move deadlines.</p>  <p>Regular Updates</p>  <p>Keep Kin informed about your progress. Regular check-ins help Kin understand what's working and what isn't, so it can adjust your plan accordingly with you.</p>  <p>Trust the Process</p>  <p>Working toward any goal takes time, and sometimes it can feel like you’re going nowhere. As hard as it is, sometimes you just have to trust that your work will lead somewhere better.</p><p>If in doubt, you can always explain your doubts to Kin for support and potential solutions.</p> Extra Tips <p>Still looking for tips? Here are some more ways to enhance your goal-setting:</p>  <p>Start Simple: Begin with a straightforward, short-term goal to familiarize yourself with the process. Kin can always help you expand it later.</p>    <p>Track Progress: Regularly view your data to see how you're advancing toward your goals visually, and ask Kin how you could improve as you check in.</p>    <p>Be Honest: Share both successes and setbacks with Kin—both are equally important not just to Kin’s understanding of you, but to the learning process in general.</p>    <p>Celebrate Wins: Take time to acknowledge progress, even small steps forward. Every task completed is something gained, and that’s important!</p>   Get Started Today <p>Feeling ready to begin setting and achieving your goals? Start with this finish off this message, and send it to Kin:</p> <p>"Hi Kin, I'd like to work on setting and achieving a goal. Let me tell you about my current situation and what I'd like to accomplish..."</p>

  DBS Taiwan Partners Thales to bring bio-sourced payment cards to Asia

Wed, 12/18/2024 - 10:39


             
 Thales will reissue over two million cards to DBS Taiwan to support the bank’s largest credit card renewal operation following its merger with Citibank.&nbsp; 
 Out of these, more than one million sustainable credit and debit cards are made from Polylactic Acid (PLA), a bio-sourced, more eco-friendly alternative to traditional plastic, making DBS Taiwan the largest issuer of PLA cards in Asia. 
 
<p>In 2020, supported by Thales, DBS Taiwan issued Asia’s first bio-sourced credit card in their aim to promote customer awareness and use of environmentally friendly payment products. Fast forward to 2024, and Thales is now helping DBS Taiwan become the largest issuer of sustainable payment cards in Asia.</p>
<p></p> 
 
  
   
 
<p>Through this project, Thales is helping DBS Taiwan revamp its Eco Card as well as supporting the re-issuance of over 2 million cards following DBS Taiwan’s acquisition of Citi’s consumer banking business in Taiwan. &nbsp;Working within a tight timeline set by Taiwan’s financial authorities, Thales is helping produce up to 30 card body artworks to support DBS Taiwan’s ambition to become the largest and most environmentally friendly international commercial bank in Taiwan. More than a million of these cards are crafted from bio-sourced Polylactic Acid (PLA), aligning with DBS' ambitions to prioritise more eco-friendly products. The remaining selection showcases DBS commitment to innovation with Thales' range of premium metal cards and LED Artlight cards.</p>
<p>Derived from renewable resources such as non-edible corn, the Thales Bio-sourced PLA card is one of the most <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/banking-payment/cards/eco-friendly-credit-card">eco-friendly products</a> in the market. The card is the world’s first UL Environmental Claim Validation (ECV)* certified eco-friendly payment card, and its bio-based component has been lab tested and accredited by worldwide science safety leader UL. Thales is a worldwide leader in modern and responsible payment solutions; the PLA cards are part of a comprehensive eco-friendly product portfolio, with over 50 million PLA cards already delivered globally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, there is a forecast of 235 tons of carbon offset from the cooperation with Thales Carbon-Neutral Program. DBS Taiwan has also embedded the concept of green consumption into card value proposition such as rebate in low-carbon transportation, and cooperated with DBS Foundation to encourage cardholders to enjoy a more sustainable life with the goods and services through championing social entrepreneurship.</p>
 &nbsp;“Thales is honoured to collaborate with DBS Taiwan in their initiatives to offer environmentally and socially impactful solutions to its customers and to be Asia’s sustainable payment solutions leader. As a global pioneer in advanced technology, Thales is also at the forefront of modern card issuance, with an extensive range of solutions that includes cards produced from bio-sourced PLA, ocean-recycled plastic, recycled PVC, and even sustainable wood. We look forward to deepening our partnership with DBS as we build towards a safer, greener and more inclusive future for all.”

  <p>In the post-COVID era, higher education institutions face unprecedented challenges in managing student matriculation and access governance. With IT departments stretched thin and an influx of in-person students, the risk of over-provisioning and compliance violations has skyrocketed. Balancing efficiency with data security and privacy concerns with FERPA, HIPAA, and other regulations has become a critical issue for HigherEd CIOs and IT professionals.</p>
<p>Modern technology offers a solution through automation of student enrollment processes and access reviews. By implementing "touchless" matriculation systems and streamlined user access controls, institutions can significantly reduce the burden on IT resources while enhancing security and compliance. This approach allows for efficient management of student identities across multiple systems, from initial enrollment to graduation or departure.</p>
<p>Martin Kuppinger, Principal Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will discuss why student identity management presents an "IAM on steroids" challenge. He will explore how the high turnover of student identities surpasses typical workforce IAM issues, and explain why integrating IAM, GRC, and Line of Business systems is crucial for addressing these unique challenges in higher education.</p>
<p>Greg Wendt, Executive Director Security Solutions at Pathlock, will present practical strategies for achieving automated student matriculation and streamlined access reviews. He will demonstrate how Pathlock's solutions can help higher education institutions reduce security and compliance risks, alleviate IT burdens, and optimize operations in the face of evolving educational landscapes.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/automating-the-academic-journey"></a>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Anne Bailey</a></p> Non-Human Identity Management: Tailoring IAM for AI Agents 
<p>The rise of AI agents as active participants in organizational workflows introduces unique identity and access management (IAM) challenges.&nbsp;Unlike human identities, AI agents often operate autonomously and may refer to sensitive data or interact with secure systems in order to achieve their assigned goals. Managing their access effectively requires a paradigm shift, as human-oriented IAM methods can leave AI agents over-provisioned and create security risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The paradigm shift we’re talking about is AIdentity: the crossover of IAM with AI. AI needs identities and built-to-purpose identity management. IAM also can massively benefit from AI for automation, predictive analysis, and decision-making for governance and risk assessment. To learn more about KuppingerCole’s take on AIdentity, listen to <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/aidentity-crucial-link-between-ai-identity">this podcast</a>. This post’s focus is on IAM for AI agents, and the complex identity relationships that emerge when using AI bots.&nbsp;</p>
 What is an AI Agent?&nbsp; 
<p>AI agents are software entities designed to autonomously carry out tasks in pursuit of specific goals set by humans. Backed by large language models (LLMs) and connected to tools via APIs, these agents break down high-level objectives into actionable tasks. For example, an AI agent deployed in customer support might independently analyze user queries, craft responses, and escalate complex cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the AI agents market projected to grow from $5.1 billion in 2024 to $47.1 billion by 2030 with a compound annual growth rate of 44.8%, their adoption is set to redefine operational workflows. <a href="https://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/6007585/ai-agents-market-agent-role-productivity-and">Research and Markets</a> forecasts this rapid expansion, driven by tailored AI solutions addressing specialized industry needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While AI agents bring transformative potential, their autonomous nature demands robust security frameworks to safeguard actions and ensure accountability.&nbsp;</p>
 Challenges in IAM for AI Agents&nbsp; 
<p>AI agents have complex identity relationships by default. Imagine the scenario where an AI agent replaces an executive assistant, which among other tasks works on behalf of an employee to make travel bookings or arrange meetings. The decisions and actions taken by that AI agent must be transparently documented as completed by the agent, not the employee. The agent must have access to the necessary data to make useful decisions (such as access to the employee’s calendar), but only for the strict time that the agent is performing its task. To have the appropriate level auditability and explainability the AI agent must have a distinct identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is one of many scenarios, and a basic one at that. An AI agent that directly fills a human role that is typically well defined is easier to understand and anticipate than the cross-cutting, interdepartmental roles that AI agents can fill. Treating AI agents like human users in IAM systems leads to significant risks. Traditional identity frameworks may provision roles and permissions based on static attributes and far over-provision the agents causing risk of lateral movement in the case of a security breach. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As a place to start, consider these four concepts about AIdentity of AI agents:&nbsp;</p>
 
 AI Agents Handle Dynamic Contexts&nbsp; 
 
<p>Tasks often span across departments. For example, an AI agent may access classified files for one task and send sensitive emails for another. Individually, these actions are permissible, but together, they could violate organizational policies.&nbsp;</p>
 
 AI Agents Must Have Just Enough Access, not Persistent Access&nbsp; 
 
<p>More so than humans, AI agents must not have persistent access to resources because it creates vulnerabilities and increases the attack surface. However, human IAM solutions appropriated for AI Agents may use hardcoded credentials, service accounts, or API keys, which can provide continuous access to underlying resources and unnecessarily increase risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather, AI Agents should have just-in-time (JIT) and just-enough-access (JEA) provisioning. Each access request should be dynamically evaluated against policy frameworks, with ephemeral tokens replacing static credentials.&nbsp;</p>
 
 AI Agents Must Have a Different Take on Authentication&nbsp; 
 
<p>Multifactor authentication (MFA) may give AI agents more access than they need, since MFA can include non-static credentials. For AI agents, authentication and authorization should be non-persistent and contextual. Authentication for AI agents ideally uses ephemeral credentials to secure communications between agents, APIs, and tools. &nbsp;</p>
 
 AI Agents Require Governance and Auditability:&nbsp; 
 
<p>Beyond access control, organizations must establish clear policies for AI agent actions, ensuring they align with business rules, legal requirements, and ethical guidelines. Audit trails must document every decision for accountability and compliance.&nbsp;</p>
 Identity Fabric for AI Agents&nbsp; 
<p>The KuppingerCole Identity Fabric provides a flexible and modular approach to identity management, making it well-suited to address non-human IAM needs. By integrating capabilities like dynamic access management, policy-based authorization, and governance, Identity Fabrics enable organizations to build secure, scalable, and adaptable IAM systems for AI agents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learn more about how the Identity Fabric enables robust IAM for both human and non-human entities in the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81426/identity-fabrics">Identity Fabrics Leadership Compass</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 Building a Secure Future&nbsp; 
<p>Managing AI agent identities effectively is a cornerstone of ensuring trust, accountability, and security in a rapidly digitizing world. Non-human IAM must prioritize dynamic, policy-driven approaches tailored to the unique needs of AI agents. By integrating solutions such as non-human authentication, authorization, and audit capabilities, organizations can securely harness the potential of AI agents while minimizing risks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This provocation is part of an ongoing conversation between Martin Lorenz and Emily Harris, centred on the role of design (and specifically Designers) in the context of an extractive economic system. A system that we are all complicit in yet which is systematically incompatible with life. These topics are not easy. In fact they are deeply uncomfortable. Why then do we, or might you, wish to engage with them? Perhaps because continuing to bury these inconvenient thoughts with busyness and self-justification is starting to feel slippery and insubstantial. A sickness we can’t quite identify but yearn to recover&nbsp;from.</p><p>Just because something is trending, it isn’t&nbsp;better</p><p>If you are a designer in your 20's or 30's you probably grew up with the term Branding. Growing up with something makes it hard to question it. It seems to be the normality you have to accept and adjust to. But the term Branding, as inoffensive as it seems, deserves a hard second&nbsp;look.</p><p>I (Martin Lorenz) am not in my 20’s or 30’s, I am in my late 40’s. When I studied design, Branding was called Corporate Design or Visual Identity Design or Corporate Visual Identity Design. Then came digital design (and the internet) and with a little delay, a wave of new terms popped up to respond to this new reality. Design studios known for being innovative invented a myriad of new terms to describe the new kind of Visual Identity Design: Liquid Identities, Fluid Identities, Evolving Identities, Generative Identities, Living Identities and Dynamic Identities.</p><p>When the new comes with force, and you are young, it is exciting. You feel born into a movement that will change the world. There are comprehensible arguments why the old must go and the new has to be fought for. I am no exception. Focusing on a more flexible and systemic approach to design corresponded to a feeling of that time. I knew very little about the new design terms, but as they came from my design heroes and sounded intriguing I did not question them. Authority and the promise of the new was sufficient to make me a devoted follower, until it was&nbsp;not.</p><p>I went back to University and started researching the flexible, systemic approach to design. Surprise, systems were always a part of design. Yes, it became more flexible through digital design, the internet and the devices we use, but what has been hyped as a completely new kind of design, has been, in its essence, around for centuries.</p><p>Selling something old by making it apparently new, is an old marketing trick. Invent a new term, and you are the only expert in this new market. Make it plausible, and you will find young followers to help you in your fight for your unique selling position (USP). Using an old term, that makes more sense, but makes you look outdated is bad for business.</p><p>While this reasoning is completely plausible in the economic environment that design currently serves, it does not mean it is a healthy way to think, act and relate to others. It shifts design’s focus away from a profession in service of society and towards an economic tool that firmly places profits before people, ego before ecosystem. As designers we have a choice: do we want design to be a culture or an industry?¹</p>Inspired by Mason, Walter George, Slave-Branding, 1853, Engraving<p>Why Branding is not just a&nbsp;term</p><p>You could argue that we are just talking about words and words are just words. They do no harm. In contrast, our work at Dark Matter Labs frequently highlights that words both constitute and express worldviews and that worldviews define how we see (or not see) and act (or not act). Words are not neutral; they can and often DO&nbsp;harm.</p><p>The Branding worldview comes from a gruesome etymology. The term has its origins in the branding of livestock or slaves. A logo was branded on the skin of animals² and humans³ to claim their ownership. The intrinsic value of these living beings was reduced to the singular value that could be extracted for private&nbsp;gain.</p><p>I (Emily Harris) would argue that the ability to collapse diverse values into singular measures of utility is the beating heart of our extractive economy. If we take a moment to think about this, it was an extraordinary shift in human philosophy and behaviour. Something only made possible by an emotional dissociation from all forms of life (including other humans). This separation, sometimes described as Othering⁴ is paradoxically the foundational rock of our modern&nbsp;economy.</p><blockquote>‘Enclosure and colonisation were necessary preconditions for the rise of European capitalism…..Something else was needed — something far subtler but nonetheless equally violent. Early capitalists not only had to find ways to compel people to work for them, they also had to change people’s beliefs. They had to change how people regarded the living world. Ultimately, capitalism required a new story about nature’. — Jason&nbsp;Hickel⁵</blockquote><p>Capitalism still needs that story for its own survival — my question to designers is whether this is a story that they are proud to&nbsp;uplift?</p><p>In accounting for economic activity we actively exclude aspects of the living world from our measures of success. There is even a term for it: externalities⁶, which basically means ‘something out there that we don’t need to deal with’. Following this logic, we do not have to deal with the value of life beyond its immediate (financial) value to us. An animal is food or clothing. A tree is lumbar. A human is useful labour. Nature is fodder for the foaming crucible of shareholder returns. Even culture and tradition delicately woven over centuries ends up being extracted. Property owners benefit from the culture of a neighbourhood, even though they did not contribute in any&nbsp;way.</p>Inspired by the book “What is post-branding? How to Counter Fundamentalist Marketplace Semiotics” by Oliver Vodeb, Jason Grant ​​<a href="https://www.setmargins.press/books/what-is-post-branding/">https://www.setmargins.press/books/what-is-post-branding/</a><p>Branding has consequences</p><p>Branding is superficial, but has deep consequences. Designers tend to focus on this thin layer between company and consumer, declaring it our entire world. A beautiful little world which revolves around aesthetics and craft. We (including I — Martin Lorenz) do not want to see the first or second order effects of our doing and the doing of the ones we support with our talent. Maybe it is time to measure the success of our work differently? Maybe we should focus on outcome and not output? Maybe the judges shouldn’t be our fellow designers, but all stakeholders involved in the before and after? Perhaps we should proactively ask those who currently have no&nbsp;voice?</p><p>Branding has colonized all aspects of life. We are supposed to love brands and define ourselves through them. It has become easier for us to remember and distinguish brands than animals or plants. We live in a colonized world of consumption. In the book Post-Branding Jason Grant and Oliver Vodeb draw a link between today’s Branding and the Branding of Nazi Germany: ‘This Nazi history is particularly interesting because although these are antecedents, and what we now call branding is very much a contemporary neoliberal phenomenon, the parallels are striking. For example, counter to what we might think, Nazis actually wanted to abolish the state — for them it was just a means to an end. Does this sound familiar in today’s neoliberal context?’⁷⁸ Comparing today’s brands to the abhorrence of the Nazi regime might seem extreme, but given the fracturing geopolitical context can we afford to squirm away from this kind of friction? We would firmly argue that the answer is&nbsp;no.</p><p>Unlearning Branding</p><p>Where and how can we question what design does for whom and how?⁹ If design schools are becoming companies, students become customers and design degrees get branded like products, we will remain ‘prisoners’ in an unlocked global cell, passively compliant in a violent economic system. If we stay in our little design world, discussing output instead of outcome, how can we participate in this huge conversation called culture?¹⁰ If we want to change how design is used, which ultimately also changes how design is made, we need to ask the big questions together with all stakeholders of&nbsp;life:</p>  What does living well&nbsp;mean?  How do we design into this&nbsp;future?  How do we do this together?  <p>The answers will most likely play out as an infinite conversation. A dance born out of reciprocity, alive with curiosity and bound by aesthetic wisdom. In 2025 we invite you to join us as we continue to explore the culture and praxis of&nbsp;design.</p>LEE, LED and CD Dynamics, Emily Harris and Martin Lorenz, <a href="https://lee.darkmatterlabs.org/">https://lee.darkmatterlabs.org/</a> <a href="https://cds.darkmatterlabs.org/">https://cds.darkmatterlabs.org/</a><blockquote>Endnote about Conversational Design</blockquote><blockquote>An essential aspect of Conversational Design, as we understand it, is transparency. Design lives on an intangible layer and can be persuasive, which undermines the freedom of the reader. By disclosing our intention we want to enable the reader to question our decisions. In this text there were two main points we want to highlight:</blockquote><blockquote>1. Initially this text was written by one person. But is a text really ever written by one person? Isn’t everything we think and write based on the thoughts of others? Giving a voice to the hidden voices, by adding sources and footnotes, letting them speak, avoids a linear narrative, pretending to be the only truth. Multiple voices allow for a more nuanced and even better, contradictory conversation. We need opposition to spark the conversation in us. As the great atomic physicist Niels Bohr said — ‘it is the hallmark of any deep truth that its negation is also a deep truth’.¹¹</blockquote><blockquote>2. We were discussing if we should show the original image material or design custom illustrations for this text. In our opinion the text deserves the love of a custom illustration, but it might also contradict our intentions. We reject the idea of branding because it creates a surface that does not let us see beneath the persuasion. On the other hand we also see writing and drawing as part of culture. Not communicating with visual language would reduce the bandwidth of our conversations. Where would you draw the&nbsp;line?</blockquote><p>This article was written by Martin Lorenz (martin@darkmatterlabs.org) and Emily Harris (emily@darkmatterlabs.org) as a collaboration between Dark Matter’s Next Economics LAB and Conversational Design Studio. The images were custom drawn by Martin Lorenz to add his visual voice to the conversation.</p><p>In 2025 we will be experimenting at the intersection of Life-Ennobling Economics and Conversational Design. Drawing on the multidisciplinary expertise of Dm’s Next Economics Lab and Conversational Design Studio we will explore the anchoring role that we believe designers can play in reconfiguring our economic systems. Perhaps you are a designer interested in how you might use your craft in service of life. A professional who feels stuck in a system that no longer aligns to your personal values. Or perhaps you already work in the broad field of systems but yearn for a more grounded practice. All voices and disciplines are warmly welcomed to the conversation: we look forward to exploring who, collectively, we are capable of interbecoming.</p><p>References:</p>  <a href="https://cityofsound.medium.com/read-culture-is-not-an-industry-by-justin-o-connor-86f7eb56601d">https://cityofsound.medium.com/read-culture-is-not-an-industry-by-justin-o-connor-86f7eb56601d</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock_branding">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock_branding</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_branding">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_branding</a>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_(philosophy)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_(philosophy)</a>  Hickel, J.

He suggested that national flags should no longer dominate the sports venues and the opening ceremony. Instead, neutral flag groups in the Olympic colors would denationalize the games. However, the participating countries protested against this suggestion, not wanting to miss the opportunity to present their own national colors. Therefore, the flags of the individual nations continued to be displayed along the Olympic Stadium. In the Munich city area, however, Aicher’s colorful flag groups prevailed.  We did some research where we looked at the shift in how design studios have promoted themselves and self-identified. In Australia, for example, there were virtually no graphic design practices that called themselves “branding agencies” or offered “branding” as their key service prior to the year 2000. Only two decades later, in 2022, around 85% were doing it. Also consider branding guru Wally Olins’ bibliography. All his books prior to 2000 have “identity” or “corporate identity” in the title, but from 2003 (with On Brand) they all feature “Brand” instead. Universities design programs used to teach “visual identity design”; now they teach “branding.” This isn’t just the adoption of new terminology, it’s the emergence of a new industry.” <a href="https://www.printmag.com/daily-heller/the-daily-heller-is-post-branding-a-thing/">https://www.printmag.com/daily-heller/the-daily-heller-is-post-branding-a-thing/</a>  “You know, I think that the problem, as I said earlier, about the GNP argument is that, okay it’s nice to know that we’ve all contributed £28 billion, I think it was last year, to the Gross National Product. But it isn’t the most important thing. The most important thing is that we have been altogether — that doesn’t mean just ‘the artists’, so called, it means everyone, it means all the people actually in the community, everybody — has been generating this huge, fantastic conversation which we call culture. And which somehow keeps us coherent, keeps us together. If you will accept that that might be correct, then you might also think well, it sounds pretty important, that job.” Brian Eno <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p033smwp">https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p033smwp</a>  Niels Bohr was a Danish physicist and Nobel Prize winner.

<p>Using Your Digital Me Across Multiple Services with ShareRing, Hedera and FCSO</p>



<p>Imagine you want to apply for a loan (like a personal loan for a car or house) and you need to prove your identity, your financial standing, and your credit score. But here’s the challenge, you don’t want to hand over all your personal details to every service (like banks, loan agencies, or even insurance companies). You just want to prove who you are, show you’re trustworthy, and verify your financial reliability without disclosing everything.</p>



<p>Here’s how FSCO, ShareRing, and Hedera work together to solve this:</p>



<p>Step 1: Creating a Digital Identity (Digital Me) with ShareRing</p>



<p>First, you create your self-sovereign digital identity with ShareRing. This ‘Digital Me’ contains your basic credentials (like your name, age, credit score), but keeps your sensitive information private. With ShareRing, you maintain full control over your identity, deciding what data to share and when to share it.</p>



<p>ShareRing creates a verifiable credential for you, which is a secure, cryptographic proof that validates your identity without revealing everything about you. This is like a digital identity card that can be used for verification across different platforms.</p>



<p>Step 2: Connecting and Verifying with Hedera</p>



<p>Let’s say you now want to apply for a loan at a bank, but the bank uses a different platform (Hedera’s blockchain) to manage its operations. Instead of filling out lengthy forms or submitting piles of documents, the bank can instantly verify your identity and credentials through Hedera’s blockchain, using the data stored in ShareRing.</p>



<p>Hedera is a high-performance public ledger, meaning identity verification happens fast and securely, without delays. The bank can instantly check your digital identity, your credit score, and other necessary credentials, without accessing your private information. It’s a much quicker and safer way to confirm your financial standing.</p>



<p>Step 3: FSCO Ensures Everything Syncs Securely</p>



<p>This is where FSCO plays a critical role. FSCO acts as the “connector,” ensuring that your digital identity flows seamlessly and securely between ShareRing and Hedera. Think of FSCO as the bridge that links ShareRing’s Digital Me to Hedera’s verification system.</p>



<p>With FSCO’s infrastructure:</p>



<p>• Banks can access up-to-date, verified data instantly.</p>



<p>• The process remains private and trustworthy for users.</p>



<p>• The data synchronization happens securely and reliably, no matter the platform.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Step 4: Applying for the Loan</p>



<p>With all these pieces in place, applying for a loan becomes simple and stress-free:</p>



<p>• The bank verifies your identity and credit score through your Digital Me.</p>



<p>• You don’t share unnecessary details like your full address or history—just proof of eligibility.</p>



<p>The result? A faster, safer, and more private loan approval process for both individuals and financial institutions.</p>



<p></p>



<p>The Real-World Benefit:</p>



<p>In this scenario:</p>



<p>This collaboration represents a breakthrough for the Hedera ecosystem by introducing self-sovereign digital identities for real-world use cases:</p>



<p>• ShareRing provides the secure, user-controlled Digital Me.</p>



<p>• Hedera offers a fast and trusted blockchain verification layer.</p>



<p>• FSCO enables these systems to work together seamlessly, unlocking innovative solutions for identity verification.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Why is this important?</p>



<p>• Privacy-Preserving Verification: Users share only what’s necessary—no oversharing of personal data.</p>



<p>• Speed and Efficiency: Services like loan approvals happen almost instantly.</p>



<p>• Scalable and Secure: This solution lays the foundation for broader applications, including Web3 wallets, cross-border finance, and decentralized services.</p>



<p>By pioneering this solution on Hedera, FSCO and ShareRing are setting a new standard for trust, privacy, and efficiency in industries like finance, healthcare, and digital services.</p>

<p>Productivity isn’t as simple as it used to be. With the rise of remote work, digital distractions, and increasingly blurred work-life boundaries, keeping focus in one place is only getting harder—especially for neurodivergent people.</p><p>As such, understanding and implementing effective productivity strategies has never been more crucial for career success and personal well-being.<br><br> That’s exactly why this article will cover some of the most common and most effective, and how Kin can make following them easier.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6343d929-7a37-4f90-8a81-a20c43de36ca_1792x1024.webp">          </a>DALL-E/Kin Illustration  What is Productivity? <p>Before diving into techniques, it's important to understand what productivity actually means. It’s not just simply multitasking, or completing tasks quickly.</p><p>Productivity is formally defined as “the rate at which a company or country makes goods, usually judged” alongside how much time and effort those goods require, and their quality.<a>1</a></p><p>Essentially, it’s a measure of how much is made with a certain measure of time and resources.</p><p>But good productivity isn’t just about making good things fast and cheap. It’s about doing that sustainably.</p><p>This is why, according to Harvard Business Review, today's most productive employees don't necessarily work longer hours – instead, they work smarter by managing their energy and attention effectively.<a>2</a> Regular breaks, deep focus on important tasks, and maintaining <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/5-tips-to-improve-work-life-balance">clear boundaries</a> between work and personal time often have more impact on long-term productivity than just working more.</p><p>Productivity also means different things to different people. Someone with ADHD might measure productivity differently than a neurotypical person, while remote workers often need different productivity metrics than office-based employees—all for reasons we’ll discuss.</p><p>Still, understanding your personal definition of productivity is crucial for setting <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/guide-to-achievable-effective-goal-setting">clear goals</a> and choosing appropriate strategies.</p> Why do People Struggle With Productivity? <p>Distractions, motivation, and burnout. Though keeping workplace productivity high is a complex task, those are the biggest reasons for its downfall.</p><p>The reasons for these three factors vary massively, and some of the most common are discussed below.</p> Digital Distractions <p>Email notifications, social media updates, and constant phone calls fragment the workday, making it harder to streamline workflow and focus on one priority task at a time. In fact, the average person now checks their phone as much as 150 times in a single workday.</p><p>These conditions can make it tempting to turn to multitasking to manage different tasks, types of work, and notifications effectively, but research shows this can reduce productivity by as much as 40%.<a>3</a></p><p>It’s not as simple as building self-discipline, though—even if that would help. Remote work and digital communication have eroded traditional office structures, leaving team members to set boundaries and practice effective <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/mastering-time-management-a-guide">time management</a> themselves. That extra stress can drive people to procrastinate on the internet, or with home distractions like pets and hobbies.</p> The Procrastination Factor <p>As implied, Procrastination often stems from emotional rather than time management issues. Research shows that procrastination is frequently linked to anxiety about task performance or external stressing factors like tiredness or financial issues, rather than laziness.<a>4</a></p><p>Thus, overcoming procrastination requires finding the underlying cause, and tackling it effectively. But, as everyone is different, that’s not always easy.</p> Individual Differences in Productivity <p>People's natural work productivity levels vary based on numerous factors. Two that are only now being seriously explored are chronotypes and neurodiversity.</p><p>Someone’s chronotype dictates when they properly sleep and awake, which directly impacts when and how they need to sleep for peak productivity.<a>5</a> Forcing someone to work against their natural chronotype can reduce their productivity, and make them feel more physically and mentally exhausted, which can impact their mental health as well as their productivity.<a>6</a></p><p>Neurodiversity refers to the different ways different people’s brains function, and the impacts of that. For example, conditions like ADHD affect how people process information and maintain focus, and can mean they require different routines and even medication to work effectively.</p><p>The challenge isn't necessarily about being less productive, but rather about finding methods that work with rather than against these differences.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdcdb4277-ef86-4c64-9ce6-49a422e494cf_1792x1024.webp">          </a>DALL-E/Kin Illustration  How To Boost Productivity <p>With all that in mind, it's essential to develop strategies addressing the above factors to overcome procrastination and boost productivity,</p><p>The remaining sections of this article explore how to do this, using achievable tasks, productivity apps to track progress, and productivity hacks, among other things—like Kin.</p><p>To begin, here are five research-backed techniques that can significantly improve productivity in the modern workplace:</p> 1. Deep Work Implementation <p>Perhaps the most powerful productivity technique for many is the implementation of deep work, a concept popularized by Cal Newport. This approach involves dedicating specific time to focused, uninterrupted work on important tasks. No phone, no pets, no email notifications taking 28% of workdays each week.<a>7</a> Just someone and their work.</p><p>For remote workers, deep work can be particularly effective when combined with time blocking (which our <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/mastering-time-management-a-guide">time management guide</a> has covered), given their increased lack of traditional routines and work-life boundaries.</p><p>This technique is especially valuable for those with ADHD, as it provides clear structure and reduces decision fatigue.</p> 2. Energy Management Over Time Management <p>As mentioned, the key to consistent productivity is energy management, not time management.</p><p>It’s essential to recognize that human beings naturally operate in cycles of peak performance and regular breaks and to plan for that. We’ve already linked to the Harvard Business Review’s demonstration that energy management in this way is the key to high performance and productivity.<a>8</a></p><p>Predictably, it’s then important for someone to identify their personal peak performance times, and then schedule priority tasks and short breaks accordingly. They might do this through their chronotype, or tracking their work habits with something like Kin.</p><p>The most important thing in this tip is to ensure proper personal and rest time is scheduled between work times so that a high level of rest can be maintained to minimize barriers to a high level of healthy productivity.</p> 3. Strategic Task Batching <p>Task batching addresses the costly impact of context switching we mentioned. The method works by grouping similar types of work together and completing them in dedicated time blocks throughout the day.</p><p>For example, rather than checking email throughout the day, setting a specific time for email management reduces the cognitive load of constantly switching between emails and different tasks. This streamlines workflows and makes it easier to enter deep work to maintain work productivity, without the impacts of multitasking.</p><p>Task batching is particularly effective for remote workers who need to manage multiple projects and communication channels. It's also helpful for those who struggle with task initiation, as it reduces the number of times someone needs to start new types of work.</p> 4. Progressive Overload in Productivity <p>Perhaps counterintuitively, applying the concept of progressive overload—traditionally used in physical health training—to productivity can help.</p><p>Progressive Overload involves gradually increasing workload and complexity over time, which can manageably teach people to work faster. The idea is that the slow increase isn’t noticed, much like how musicians learn to perform fast pieces of music by practicing slowly, or weightlifters slowly build to heavy weights.</p><p>This might mean starting with the Pomodoro Technique's 25-minute focused work sessions and gradually extending them, or beginning with simpler tasks before tackling more complex ones.</p><p>The technique relies on consistent, incremental progress, and building the ability to reliably complete a workload before increasing it.</p><p>Eventually, the technique allows for the speed attainable in short-term, unsustainable productivity sprints to be maintained long-term.</p> 5. Environmental Design for Focus <p>Finally is something every other technique relies on: intentionally designing a workspace to support productivity.</p><p>This extends beyond just having a clean desk—it encompasses everything from lighting and temperature to <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/7-organizational-skills-for-2025">digital environment organization</a>.<a>9</a> Even where your desk is can make a difference.</p><p>Building an optimal work environment might involve:</p>  <p>Setting up a dedicated workspace that is separate from other spaces, and minimizes identified personal distractions</p>  <p>Creating systems that support effective work-related teamwork, like regular meetings of a team group chat</p>  <p>Using project management tools to organize digital files</p>  <p>Implementing productivity apps that help track and streamline tasks</p>   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5b8cf9be-bbfc-462e-a878-3ecc0a616920_1792x1024.webp">          </a>DALL-E/Kin Illustration  Personalized Productivity Strategies  Finding Your Ideal Time Management Strategy <p>As the article shows, everyone's workflow differs. Some professionals thrive with rigid time blocking, while others need more flexibility, or a different kind of structure completely.</p><p>It’s generally a good idea to experiment with the various productivity strategies mentioned above, as well as using something like Kin to suggest new ones tailored to you.</p><p>For example, another popular technique is the <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/mastering-time-management-a-guide">Eisenhower Matrix</a>, which helps with prioritizing tasks by urgency and importance. That makes it easier to schedule and delegate tasks, which streamlines to-do lists.</p><p>This article is a start—there are many more out there!</p> ADHD-Specific Productivity Strategies <p>For individuals with ADHD, traditional productivity tips often need adaptation or even replacement. Popular ADHD-specific strategies include:</p>  <p>Body-doubling: Working alongside other team members (even virtually) to maintain focus</p>  <p>Parallel tasks: Combining physical movement with mental tasks</p>  <p>Micro-deadlines: Breaking already-broken down deadlines down further than a neurotypical person might, so that tasks are clearer and completed more often</p>  <p>Progress Tracking: Using visual systems to see how long it’s taken to reach a certain point in a task can make it easier to stay motivated</p>  <p>Regular breaks: It’s important to maintain physical health and mental focus</p>   Comprehensive Procrastination Solutions <p>On top of the above tips, there are specific tactics that can help procrastination:</p> Emotional Management   <p>Acknowledge and investigate anxieties around tasks</p>  <p>Set boundaries around perfectionist tendencies—done is better than perfect!</p>  <p>Use achievable milestones to build confidence in abilities</p>   Environmental Control   <p>Use website blockers during specific time blocks</p>  <p>Avoid distracting spaces during work breaks</p>  <p>Keep a clock easily visible to keep track of time</p>   Strategic Approaches   <p>Break large projects into smaller, less intimidating tasks</p>  <p>Use body-doubling (working alongside others) for accountability</p>  <p>Implement ‘if-then’ planning for common procrastination triggers, i.e. “If there are 20 minutes before the next meeting, then work on _____.”</p>   Overcoming Task Resistance <p>Sometimes, trying to complete tasks that feel too difficult or too boring can benefit from specific approaches different to procrastination:</p>  <p>Temptation bundling: Pair unpleasant tasks with enjoyable activities (like listening to a productivity podcast)</p>  <p>Task delegation: Identify which priority tasks can be delegated to team members with complementary strengths</p>  <p>Energy matching: Schedule challenging work during peak energy periods, and easier work for when motivation and energy are lower</p>   Responding to Work Environment <p>Two of the most impactful work environments on productivity are so-called ‘toxic’ workplaces, which are mismanaged workplaces that harm employee well-being, and remote working.</p><p>Here’s how to mitigate their effects:</p> Addressing Toxic Workplaces <p>Toxic work environments significantly impact both mental health and workplace productivity. To recognize one, look for things like:</p>  <p>Unclear expectations</p>  <p>Constant <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-handle-difficult-conversations">difficult conversations</a></p>  <p>Poor teamwork</p>  <p>Limited <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-a-career-coaching">growth opportunities</a></p>  <p>Inconsistent leadership</p>  <p>These factors can lead to burnout, reduced physical health, and decreased productivity. Solutions are largely out of this article’s scope, but might include:</p>  <p>Setting clear boundaries</p>  <p>Building support networks</p>  <p>Documenting interactions</p>  <p>Seeking mentorship</p>  <p>Planning career transitions</p>   Remote Work Optimization <p>As a summary of what’s been discussed, plus some new things, here are ways remote workers can tackle productivity issues:</p>  <p>Creating a dedicated workspace away from bedrooms and communal areas</p>  <p>Establishing routine check-ins with team members</p>  <p>Using electronic project management tools effectively</p>  <p>Setting a clear work-life balance</p>  <p>Streamlining digital communications</p>   Modern Productivity Tools  Top Productivity Apps <p>We featured a comprehensive list of productivity apps and programs for building skills in our <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/7-organizational-skills-for-2025">guide to Organization Skills</a>.

For instance, if it's distraction by constant notifications, begin by blocking in time for deep work where they’re all blocked.</p><p>Start with just 25 minutes of focused time, gradually increasing as this becomes more comfortable. Just remember to block time in for answering them too!</p><p>Then, monitor progress and adjust approaches based on what’s working, and what isn’t. Boosting productivity is highly individual, so don’t worry if what ends up working doesn’t look like what other people are doing.</p><p>The goal is to find a sustainable system that increases productivity while maintaining well-being in the long term.</p><p>Most importantly, view productivity enhancement as a long-term journey rather than a quick fix. Each obstacle should be dealt with one at a time in order to build up to the ideal situation slowly and sustainably.</p> <a>1</a> <p>Anon. 2024. “PRODUCTIVITY meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary.” dictionary.cambridge.org.

 <a href="https://www.farmerconnect.com/news/automated-eudr-solution" title="">  </a> 
  
  
 <p>With years of hands-on experience in the commodity industry, we know the intricate, multi-layered nature of supply chains across various sectors such as cocoa, coffee, rubber, and beyond. We have developed a highly automated solution to help facilitate EUDR compliance.</p> 
  Building a Universal EUDR Solution&nbsp;  
 <p>We've worked with stakeholders at various levels—from cooperatives to traders to global brands— and we’ve seen firsthand the complexities involved in managing data from across the supply chain. Even more so, we know how complicated it can get when compiling all this data together, from multiple sources. This story has a tendency of getting even more complex when we add regulatory compliance to the mix.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>That’s why for farmer connect, whether you’re importing/exporting cocoa, coffee, rubber, or any other EUDR impacted commodity, our goal remains the same: facilitate your EUDR compliance journey with an automated and fully streamlined solution that integrates effortlessly into your existing operations, ensuring you get your valuable time back to focus on what really matters.&nbsp;</p> 
  Streamlined Compliance  
 <p>Our solution mirrors our clients' framework, providing a lean and flexible EUDR compliance journey and seamlessly integrating all necessary ESG data from internal and external systems and stakeholders. Adapting to your preferred data sources and documentation, our platform streamlines every step of the due diligence process</p> 
 <p>We give you your freedom: Bring your own partners or leverage our standard EUDR setup. We’re saying no lock-ins, just an uninterrupted compliance experience. We’ll automate where it makes most sense, andleave manual control where it’s needed.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>With a focus on empowering you, our platform ensures that you remain in control while navigating the complexities of regulatory requirements.&nbsp;</p> 
   
    
   <p>How Do We Do This?</p> 
   <p>Following industry-standard data protocols and ensuring full interoperability across various platforms, our solution streamlines the entire compliance process from start to finish. Through standard APIs available for integration, our platform compiles, into one place, all the relevant EUDR data from your systems, enabling automated compliance checks and reporting. By leveraging existing IT and ERP data and automating processes, we reduce the need for manual data entry and ensure greater oversight and control over compliance activities. Thus, giving you time back to focus on what matters, maintaining your business as usual.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p><br><br><br></p> 
    
   
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
  ConnectHub: Our EUDR Compliance Solution  
 <p>ConnectHub is where EUDR data, such as geolocation information, date of production, legality info, business references, previous DDS numbers, gets consolidated. By leveraging APIs from ERP/IT systems or Supplier Portals, the platform ensures streamlined workflows.</p> 
 <p>Integrate with our third-party satellite analysis provider or bring in your own partners, and we’ll make sure the processes get linked to a seamless workflow that connects between systems.</p> 
  1.&nbsp;Regulatory Compliance  
 <p>To meet EUDR requirements, businesses must collect information on their commodities origins, conduct a risk assessment and submit a due diligence statement to the EU Information System. This data will need to be retained for 5 years and requires timely interactions with Competent Authorities whenever subject to audit.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>Our solution aggregates relevant data from available sources, such as Supplier Portals or ERP systems, and enables automation where it brings most benefits. For added flexibility, data can also be uploaded manually, in bulk or in an intuitive drag and drop fashion. All data is structured into the GS1 format, ensuring compatibility with EU Information System requirements, for example GeoJSON file formats.</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>2. Automated Due Diligence Statement Generation and Submission to EU Traces&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>When generating the due diligence statement, our solution automatically populates required fields with the necessary EUDR data. Directly within our platform, our clients can edit the DDSs right up until they get submitted to the EU Information System, EU Traces. This happens once all required data fields have been completed and validated. Once the submission is complete, DDS# can be obtained for cascading down the supply chain.&nbsp;</p> 
  &nbsp;  
  3. Automated Deforestation Assessments  
 <p>As an optional add-on, our solution, through our partnership with <a href="https://tradeinspace.com/">Trade in Space (TiS),</a> offers real-time deforestation assessments using uploaded geolocation data. TiS integrates multiple high-frequency, high-resolution data sources, giving regular updates on whether deforestation is occurring in the areas where commodities are sourced. This data is automatically integrated into our platform, providing a streamlined reporting mechanism that keeps you informed and compliant.&nbsp;</p> 
 <p>However, our flexible approach allows integration with alternative deforestation assessment systems, making sure our solution aligns with your specific needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
  Supply Chains are Complex Enough, Why Not Facilitate Where We Can ?  
   
    
   <p>We recognize the complexities of the EU Deforestation Regulation and have developed a scalable, fully interoperable solution designed to meet the compliance needs of businesses. Our approach is centred on three core principles: simplicity, automation, and compliance.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>For more information on how we can support your EUDR compliance journey, visit <a href="https://www.farmerconnect.com/">Farmer Connect</a>.</p>

							  Quibering With FUD   <p>Google just announced Willow, a quantum computing chip that, according to their recently published studies, has overcome a small hurdle on its journey to becoming a commercially available technology.</p>  <p>That’s lowkey a scary thought. There are significant implications of quantum computing on existing technology infrastructure that is secured by encryption algorithms like SHA-256. These are supposed to take the average computer millions and millions of years to break into. But they could be accessed by quantum computers in a matter of minutes.</p>  <p>In other words, your seedphrase, your private key, let alone your passwords? No longer safe in a quantum computing environment.<br><br>The&nbsp;slight&nbsp;silver lining is that, in order to do so, someone with access to one of these computers would have to target you specifically. But in this context, “commercially available” is an ominous turn of phrase, for sure.</p>  <p>Is that responsible for this weeks’ sell off? The discovery of El Dorado in El Salvador? Is it the failure of our Chad and Savior Michael Saylor to convert Microsoft shareholders? Are the paper bitcoin ETFs and Coinbase meddling with things? Who knows.</p>  <p>But as for the FUD narrative around quant tech, on the bright side, I don’t see it coming to fruition for another 5 to 25 years. Google is boasting about this now due to, in my opinion, a relatively mundane academic breakthrough. They were basically able to overcome a theoretical challenge posed by academics and show they could get quality outcomes as they increased the size and capacity of the chips, which theory argues isn’t possible. But said breakthrough is also only “in theory”.</p>  <p>Aside from critiques about questionable evaluation methodology, the chip currently holds 46 physical qubits (quantum bits, more in a sec) of which it needs millions in order to make a functional quantum computer capable of breaking into a wallet. A taller task like, say, rewriting the Bitcoin blockchain would require exponentially more quibits and more energy. These computers suck fuel.</p>  <p>As with all things in nature, balance will be achieved. Defense will catch up to offense. And the strongest quantum decryption resistant algorithms will emerge to protect the systems. Hell, Algorand or Quant would already argue that this is what’s intrinsically valuable about their design compared to other blockchains.</p>  <p>The Bitcoin Foundation and its network of participants are more likely to fork than successfully upgrade the protocol to ensure quantum resistance. (Although, as the OG, it’s still got more staying power than Ethereum.) As for Solana, transactions per second (TPS) reigns supreme. Consumer capture will always be the name of the game when it comes to true technology adoption.</p>  <p>Which brings us back to Qubits. Quantum bits are an upgrade to the existing computer bits, because they introduce a third position to the traditional binary-based statistical processing of a computer. In other words, these computers don’t think in black and white, but shades of gray. This allows for the computer to draw conclusions faster, because it derives a more holistic nature of the rules and relationships between variables in its predictions.<br><br>The data scientists at Google clearly have a spiritual tinge because they think it’s evidence of parallel universe theory… but you’ll have to Search for that yourself.</p>  <p>A data scientist’s favorite thread on the implications of Google’s quantum announcement.</p>  <p>—El Prof</p> 						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			
						
		 
				 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
				 
				 
																										 
				 
				 
				 
							         Trade Spot Trade   <p>Spot trading — simply, when you buy and sell digital assets at current market prices — may seem straightforward. But it’s an art that requires both instinct and precision.</p>  <p>Profits in spot trading come from buying assets at a lower price and selling them at a higher price. But it’s not as simple as picking any low price and waiting for it to go up. The crypto market is notorious for its volatility, and prices can swing wildly in hours, minutes, or sometimes seconds. That’s why timing is everything.</p>  <p>To succeed, you must constantly monitor the market, identify key price movements, and act fast when the right opportunity presents itself.</p>  <p>One of the first lessons I learned was the importance of&nbsp;taking profit&nbsp;orders over&nbsp;stop-loss&nbsp;orders. While many traders set a stop loss to minimize potential losses, I’ve found that this approach can be counterproductive. Imagine the price of a coin drops while you’re away from the screen — your stop loss triggers, selling your crypto at a loss. But what if the market quickly rebounds? You’re out of the trade, missing out on the gains.</p>  <p>On the other hand, with a take-profit order, you set your target price and let the trade run its course. Once the price hits your target, you lock in a profit. It’s a safer, more reliable way to ensure you’re capitalizing on the market’s upward movement without getting caught in emotional reactions.</p>  <p>Understanding the market is about more than just watching price fluctuations. It’s about knowing the subtle signals the market sends through patterns and trends. Although many successful DeFi transactions rely on unusual sources of alpha — such as Twitter threads, Telegram channels, or meme cycles —&nbsp;technical analysis remains an essential tool in crypto spot trading too.</p>  <p>It’s still crucial to be able to interpret charts and recognize key patterns, like the&nbsp;head and shoulders formation. This pattern is a classic indicator of a reversal from bullish to bearish, and understanding it can help you time your entry and exit points. A&nbsp;head and shoulders&nbsp;pattern consists of three peaks — two shoulders on either side of a taller “head” in the center. The key to trading this pattern is identifying when the price breaks through the neckline, signaling a trend reversal. The accompanying volume also gives clues: the highest volume typically occurs during the left shoulder, and the lowest during the right shoulder. If you know how to “spot” this, you can make highly profitable spot trades by entering positions at the right time.</p>  <p>On the flip side, patterns like&nbsp;rising&nbsp;and&nbsp;falling wedges&nbsp;provide different kinds of insights. A&nbsp;falling wedge, for instance, is a bullish pattern that signals price consolidation before an upward breakout. Conversely, a&nbsp;rising wedge&nbsp;typically signals a bearish reversal when the price starts to break downwards. Both patterns are invaluable tools for predicting market direction.<br><br>Beyond these TradFi tools, it is important to pay especially close attention to external factors like news events. Cryptocurrency is highly reactive to news, whether it’s a regulatory update or a tweet from a prominent figure. At the same time, these events tend to generate runaway hype on social media channels, so it’s important to react to them with logic and discipline, not emotion.</p>  <p>Ultimately, the key to being successful in spot trading is understanding not just the technical aspects, but the psychology of the market. Spot trading requires an ability to read the market’s mood, react swiftly to changes, and avoid the pitfall of emotional decision-making.</p>  <p>See spot? Great. Now trade, spot trade!</p>  <p>—Muhammed</p>

<p></p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Hi, everybody. My name is Mike Engle, co-founder and head of strategy here at 1Kosmos. I’m joined today by Jens Hinrichsen. Say hello, Jens.</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Hello, everybody.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Jens is our head of sales here at 1Kosmos, spends a lot of time in the trenches. And today we’re here to talk about remote caller verification. We have an acronym for that, RCV. But Jens, would you mind giving your quick pitch on what RCV is for the folks out there?</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Yeah, I would love to. And I think certainly also, Mike, with all the conversations that we’re both fortunate to have with a variety of organizations globally, please chime in with some of your own perspective as well. But I think remote caller verification, whether it is IT service desk for employees, contractors, other third parties that are interacting with an organization and have access to the inner sanctum, if you will, of an organization versus, say, contact center or call center. Where for years the industry has been working on solutions to mitigate fraud from a customer or outside facing standpoint, this is really about these emerging threat actor groups. Not even so much emerging, but Scattered Spider certainly has taken the cake recently in terms of being in the press most from MGM, Caesers, a host of other organizations where they have as a group socially engineered their way through the IT service desk of an organization.</p>
<p>So in the case of 1Kosmos, hi, I’m Mike Engle, I’m a co-founder. Service desk agent’s like, “Oh, my gosh, I got a co-founder on the call.” And if it’s not Mike and it’s a threat actor group, very charming, you name it, they can socially engineer their way in, get the credential reset, and then have Mike’s access to the company. So it is a big area of threat. It’s a big area of inefficiency also that organizations are trying to get better shored up. Mike, any other thoughts you have on that?</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah, so a lot of friends in the industry, I talk to them about this and they don’t have the right tools typically. So they’re using old, tired methods or no methods. They just turn it off because they can’t trust it. And an example would be secrets. What’s your employee ID? What was your date of hire? What was the amount of your last payroll deposits? Which I wouldn’t know that. So sometimes those are too hard and don’t work or they’re too easy to guess and anybody can use them. So social engineering has been around forever, but they’ve gotten really good at finding the information, the legacy ways that people have been using over time. What are some of the ways that they’re using now to get into help desks?</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Well, it’s interesting, too. I think back to the point we made earlier from a fraud standpoint, I mean, there’s been social engineering going on for ages. Whatever that chain looks like, phishing, malware, getting information, and then pretending to be a customer of an organization, malicious actors are looking for economic gain and other impact for a variety of reasons. But where you can have big impact is when you’re able to infiltrate an organization. It’s one thing to steal $50,000 from a customer of an organization. It’s a big deal. You want to mitigate that, but as far as being able to get into the inner bowels of an organization’s IT stack moving laterally, whatever the case is, that is a huge area of focus these days.</p>
<p>So a lot of the, call it, the social engineering talent, the charms, I mean, Mike, you and I have even through different circles heard some of these calls and they’re … Wow, if I’m the service desk agent, yeah, I’m believing this person. You don’t have an ID for what reason or you don’t know this for whatever reason? Sure, of course. So I think it’s really been the same playbook focused on this avenue now. And again, it is really, really easy for these sophisticated threat actors to sound very believable, have core information that’s needed that would get a service desk agent to say, “Mr. Engle, co-founder of 1Kosmos, that’s fine that you don’t have this and this, but I’m going to issue a new credential to you right away. I want to make sure you’re happy.”</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Right, and they may create a sense of urgency. I’m a doctor, I got a patient here at a table and I can’t unlock my stethoscope, whatever it is. So yeah, that’s a common tactic as well that we’ve seen them use. And then once they get that initial credential, they’re typically 50% of the way of getting into the core network and things go downhill from there. And so yeah, the traditional KBA, which you would think stands for knowledge based authentication.</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Knowledge based authentication. Right.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
We actually refer to it as known by anybody, KBA. So it really is close to useless. And whenever I opened a new financial services account and they pop up those five questions, what was the type of car you had when you were five years old or whatever, I run for the hills if I can. So what can we do about it? How does 1Kosmos, for example, mitigate this threat?</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Yeah. And even, Mike, before we go there, and I think one of the examples, what’s one of the KBA examples you’ve used before? It’s like your grandmother’s shoe size when she was nine or something. Well, whatever the iteration is, before we even get into solution, I think some of the really interesting parts that we’ve gotten more intimate with is even the other ways that organizations are trying to address this. So KBA, sure, that’s one. Known by anybody, as you said. OTP. Hey, I’m going to push you an OTP. Well, we still don’t know it’s Mike. And then we’re also seeing a lot of organizations, not even necessarily just at the highest level of privilege, but even more broadly where it’s an escalation to the manager. And you do the math on that in terms of just sheer productivity loss and in some cases you might not still be actually verifying it’s that genuine user.</p>
<p>So there’s these kind of clunky ways and tools that we as an industry have been trying to address this. And so to your question, Mike, it’s like, well, gosh, what is a way that an organization can do this where it’s effectively automated? So somebody is still calling into the service desk, but you’re removing the onus of verification from the service desk agent because the reality is service desk agents are being asked to do so many things already and they’re always do it in this amount of time, get it faster, faster. So you don’t want to forsake quality, but how do you have a very easy process for both agent and user, whether genuine or a malicious actor, to undertake that then gives the credence that, yes, this is actually Mr. Engle calling in? And so there are a few ways to do it. One that really gives, I’ll say, the minimum viable baseline would be a one-time identity verification or identity proofing event where I call into the service desk and I’m pretending to be you.</p>
<p>And the service desk agent says, “Okay, Mr. Engle, I’m going to send you a link either to your phone, to your email address.” There are a variety of things that you have to take into consideration obviously in terms of companies that might not have employees be able to have phones or are they company owned, et cetera. Those are all things that you see and we navigate accordingly, but the very simple process of opening up a link, scanning the front and back of a driver’s license, a passport, some other government issued document, and then doing a matching selfie against the image that’s on that document. And what we can do with very high assurance is give a thumbs up or thumbs down. And all we would do is simply say the agent, “Yep, this is Mr. Engle,” or in my case, pretending to be you, “No, this is not.” And so that’s a really simple initial way to do it. The really exciting part, and this is what permeates the next generation, which is actually here now and gaining steam, is the user control.</p>
<p>That reusable identity of, hey, once I have verified myself, once I essentially have an identity wallet that I can then present wherever it’s needed that proves that I am like Engle and I don’t have to go back through the whole process of scanning something, selfie, et cetera. So the elegance is there. You get high assurance, quick and easy, reduces call center times. And then again, you’re removing that, again, onus on the service desk agent of having to be the one. And there are other companies, too, Mike, where it’s, “Hey, can you hold your ID up to the camera?” It’s hard enough to tell that they’re real when you’re holding them, much less over a camera.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah. And when I hold my license up to a camera, now what’s the other person doing with that information? First of all, they can’t verify it. It’s too hard. You can’t see the little security features and then now I’ve just showed you my driver’s license number. That’s something you don’t want floating out there on a video call. So yeah, the privacy preserving aspects are really key. If you can assure the help desk and your remote callers, your remote employees, or customers that it’s safe, then they’ll trust it and feel good about using it as well. That’s a great point. Yeah, so I think we’ve about done it. I guess one last thing is how hard is it to implement a tool like identity-based biometric verification for a service desk?</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Yeah. What’s the usual answer? Well, we could have had it in yesterday, so you got a couple of flavors. And I think the great thing for us as an industry is you can literally start as fast as you can start with, call it, a touchless integration where you’re simply calling out to an API. That link that we talked about earlier that gets sent to the user, that’s essentially a service. It’s a hosted service and you’re not having to replumb or do anything on day one within your organization. You can address the threat, make it a simpler process literally within a couple of weeks. And then the subsequent steps that I know we’ve observed with our customers is there are things that you can do to tighten some of the workflows, whether it’s ServiceNow or whatever the service desk system or backend might be.</p>
<p>But then that next step, and it can come pretty quickly, is the organization’s adoption and use of that reusable identity. And it’s a pretty powerful thing when we think about especially at the point of, say, onboarding. Whether it’s say HR onboarding, contract, or third-party onboarding, you’re doing that verification once. The user now owns it. You made a great point about privacy preservation. I mean, that’s what we’re all in the space for, right? It’s one thing to have a point in time, but you have to make sure it’s privacy preserving. But then also, let’s make it efficient for everybody. Do the verification once and then all you’re doing is you’re essentially authenticating into systems or doing high-risk transactions or whatever the case is after that.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Right, right. And you can’t implement something like this without uttering the words ROI, right?</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Yeah.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
You have the obvious security benefits, stop bad guys, but the user experience is actually better. And then an organization can have 100,000 calls into a help desk a year. It’s an average of 30% to 50% are password reset or identity related, so why not remove that and save those calls from even coming in? You can automate this, you can do it in a self-service password reset manner as well, SSPR. So yeah, a lot of reasons to do it.</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Yeah. Well, no, and you’re right. And it’s fun to build these business cases alongside organizations because it’s not just a security risk mitigation. There are very direct, like you said, Mike, very direct savings, overall operating efficiencies. Even to the point where as an organization lifts its security posture, they’re getting better policy. Their cyber insurance policies are coming down or at least not going up as quickly as they might go, depending on what most of us are feeling in the industry. So that’s a great point, that this is a really a multi-pronged business case. And I think we’ve observed 10, 20, 30X return on an investment in even just the first year.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Yeah. Yeah, it’s a no brainer. So hopefully we’ll get the phone calls before the bad guys get in and not after, but either way …</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Mike’s personal number is…</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
That’s right. Well, cool. Thanks so much for joining. It’s been fun chatting with you about this. Hopefully somebody out there will see it and will spark some ideas to make a difference in the world of cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Jens Hinrichsen:<br>
Brilliant. Great chat, Mike.</p>
<p>Mike Engle:<br>
Thank you.</p>

<p>2024 goes down in history as the year with the largest and most destructive <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breaches</a>.</p>



<p>The non-profit <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/latest-alerts/">Identity Theft Resource Centre</a> says in the first half of 2024, the number of data breach victims surpassed 1 billion—a 490 per cent increase from the same time last year.</p>



<p>In 2024, masses of personal information from tens of millions of people—and sensitive medical data from roughly one-third of all Americans—was stolen and posted online. Other countries had similar large-scale breaches, such as the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2024/05/cybersecurity-news-lockbit-scattered-spider/">UK military data breach</a> and Australia’s <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/medisecure-hit-by-cyber-security-breach-607992">MediSecure data breach</a> which affected <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/medisecure-hit-by-cyber-security-breach-607992">around 12.9 million people</a> or roughly half of the country’s population.</p>



<p>Here’s a recap of the largest data breaches in the U.S. in 2024:</p>



 “Mother of all data breaches” 



<p>The year kicked off early as a record-breaking year for data breaches, with the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2024/01/23/massive-26-billion-record-leak-dropbox-linkedin-twitterx-all-named/">“mother of all data breaches”</a>—a 12-terabyte database containing 26 billion leaked data records—discovered in January.</p>



<p>The data came from users of Chinese messaging giant Tencent; social media platform Weibo; platforms and services such as Twitter, Dropbox, LinkedIn, Adobe, Canva and Telegram; and various U.S. and other government organizations. In the hands of threat actors, the data could be used for a vast variety of attacks, including identity theft, sophisticated phishing schemes, targeted cyberattacks, and unauthorized access to personal and sensitive accounts.</p>



<p>Authorities say some of the data isn’t new and is probably more likely compiled records from thousands of previous breaches and data leaks, but combinations of passwords and usernames in the data still present significant risk for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing#:~:text=Credential%20stuffing%20is%20a%20type,user%20accounts%20on%20other%20systems">credential stuffing</a> attacks.</p>



 National Public Data data breach 



<p>More shocking because it is newly breached data is the National Public Data data breach in August 2024, which exposed <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/topic/national-public-data-breach-what-you-need-to-know-843686f7-06e2-4e91-8a3f-ae30b7213535">2.9 billion records</a> (full names, social security numbers, mailing addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers) of up to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/topic/national-public-data-breach-what-you-need-to-know-843686f7-06e2-4e91-8a3f-ae30b7213535">170 million people in the U.S., Canada and the UK</a>.</p>



<p>The breach occurred because the NPD, an online background check and fraud prevention service (data broker), website had inadvertently published a zip file with the back-end passwords for the database. The stolen data included American social security numbers, and <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/08/national-public-data-published-its-own-passwords/">experts</a> say it’s pretty likely that all social security numbers have been compromised.</p>



<p>If you haven’t already done so, follow the <a href="https://hr.berkeley.edu/news/national-public-data-breach-what-you-can-do">advice</a> to freeze your credit file at each of the major consumer reporting bureaus, and closely monitor your accounts for suspicious activity. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In October, National Public Data <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/national-public-data-the-hacked-data-broker-that-lost-millions-of-social-security-numbers-and-more-files-for-bankruptcy/">filed for bankruptcy</a>.</p>



 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larsdaniel/2024/10/28/100-million-americans-medical-records-exposed-in-massive-data-breach/">Change Healthcare</a> 



<p>Considered <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larsdaniel/2024/10/28/100-million-americans-medical-records-exposed-in-massive-data-breach/">“the largest healthcare data exposure in U.S. history”</a>, the Change Healthcare data breach exposed the personal, medical and billing information of 100 million customers, or roughly one-third of all Americans¾a number that is likely to rise.</p>



<p>In February 2024 the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware group breached UnitedHealth’s Change Healthcare platform, a widely used payment processing system in the healthcare industry, stealing the data, disrupting billing and payment processing, and delaying patient care. And since the payment processing system is integral to healthcare infrastructure in the US, the impact went well beyond UnitedHealth to also impact <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larsdaniel/2024/10/28/100-million-americans-medical-records-exposed-in-massive-data-breach/">innumerable</a> hospitals, clinics, and medical practices.</p>

<p>In July the telecomms giant announcedcybercriminals had stolen&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/att-phone-records-stolen-data-breach/">the phone numbers and call records of “nearly all” of its customers, or around 110 million people</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/2024-in-data-breaches-1-billion-stolen-records-and-rising/">TechCrunch</a> says while the records don’t contain contents of texts and phone calls, the “metadata” still reveals who called who and when, and in some cases the data can be used to infer approximate locations.</p>



<p>This breach followed a data breach of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/14/2024-in-data-breaches-1-billion-stolen-records-and-rising/">73 million</a> AT&amp;T customer records in March.</p>

 Last thoughts 



<p>Data breaches aren’t going away. They’re getting more sophisticated and the increase in ransomware attacks means even criminals with little computer skill can pull them off. If you consider that the number of data breaches in the U.S. was <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/273550/data-breaches-recorded-in-the-united-states-by-number-of-breaches-and-records-exposed/">447 in 2012</a> and more than <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/273550/data-breaches-recorded-in-the-united-states-by-number-of-breaches-and-records-exposed/">3,200 in 2023</a>, and that the cost of cybercrime is increasing <a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016/">15 per cent</a> year over year, the future for data privacy will likely be bleaker not better—unless you take steps to protect yourself.<br><br>Download <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo</a>.<br>Download <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/reclaim/">RECLAIM</a>.<br>Discover other <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals">MySudo apps</a>.</p>

							 <p>November went by so fast we aren’t sure how this happens every year. Blink and this’ll be in your inbox again and the year is 2025. jk… we’ve still got more festivities ahead.</p>  <p>Product development is on track. As mentioned in last month’s product demo video, we expect to release our software for business owners in January of 2025. Two additional data sources, account tenancy for multiple brands to be managed, and the start of some asset management tools were added since we last spoke.</p>  <p>Our focus has been on fundraising since getting terms from MTC. We’ve spoken with 7 funds in the last month, and had follow on conversations with three that are promising, and one more on the schedule for follow ons early next week. We’re aiming to close this deal in early February, ideally with just 2-3 partners so we are looking for check sizes between $50-150k. Introductions and referrals would be very appreciated.</p>

							 <p>Timing is everything. We hear that all the time. It’s not just business, sports, or deciding to start a family, time affects every aspect of our lives. Time quite literally is wealth, the ability to control your own that is. The so-called American Dream. Well the time for decentralization is now. This is the cycle.</p>  <p>Solana is primed to be the blockchain that can deliver a real decentralized data infrastructure to power a new version of the internet, which is precisely why we are building our technology on that platform. And while quantum computing may be threatening the existing security infrastructure, conversations around legacy blockchains are moot if they don’t start thinking about what it means to play defense in that environment.</p>  <p>But that’s likely years off, and transactions per second [<a href="https://chainspect.app/compare/solana-vs-ethereum?utm_source=beehiiv&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=community-update">TPS</a>], that’s the metric that bar none, another scaled decentralized information protocol has yet to address in the way that Solana has. Right now the protocol can deliver transaction times nearly on par with the speed of the largest cloud providers without having to layer out the benefits of decentralization with side chains. L2’s should be the end apps/sites &amp; browsers/wallets, because everything else is middle-man-spyware.</p>

							 <p>Gaming or SexFi, as per early generations of the internet are the most likely places to see consumer breakthrough adoption, but the demand from gamers to date hasn’t been there. And leading IP house have seemingly little interest in adopting the tech, Sony &amp; Sonium being a very centralized exception. Some are trying their hands at versions of SocialFi trying to replicate the growth of web2 staples like Facebook to little success. But even there our conversation around TPS is reinforced, as there nothing more that either of those groups hate more than a LAG in their transaction speed.</p>  <p>The reality is it’s hard to tear consumers away from the social lists they’ve built, the picture &amp; message logs they’ve accrued, the trophies earned or skins purchased, and a well curated doom scroll, they have rooted. The underlying data is likely the key &amp; dePIN as a whole the catalyst for web3 adoption, something we at playhaus know a lot about.</p>  <p>Why data? If the future is AI, than it’s raw input is probably going to grow in value especially verified data, straight from the source. Some people call this digital twin data, because it’s a virtual representation of something physical, like a person or a power plant. We try to drive this home in our pitch, but who knows?</p>  <p>Anyways you, and your data are valuable, but only after it’s been refined for the AI to have the right context and preparation to devour it for it’s learning purposes. Smart contracts and data wallets give us a really unique opportunity to make those markets more efficient and redirect the flow of value to the producers of the highest quality data.</p>  <p>Queue cut to our web3 data management portal that helps business owners and operators do precisely that with the full brand value of their organization.</p> 						 
				 
				 
				 
					 
			 		 
				 
				 
				 
				 
							 <p>I’ve been learning how to code, very very slowly, over the last 10 years. That is if you count using tools like Wix &amp; WordPress to get started. My first real success came at my first job out of college, the startup AdAdapted, where my dabbling in spreadsheets to accelerate our email outreach systems lead to me being allowed to work in operations and start querying our systems with SQL ad hoc. But it’s been learning and working in the advertising and crypto industries that’s really allowed me contextualize what I can do with these tools and what’s coming for consumers. I’m excited that AI has allowed me to pick up front-end and full-stack development to round out the data science skills I built in my masters degree, that’s what’s finally allowing me to ship this product I’ve been talking about for too long.</p>  <p>And yet the timing couldn’t be more perfect. As the aforementioned Solana diatribe alluded to, I think the moment for dePIN has come in 2025, a use case that that protocol is uniquely positioned to cannibalize because it’s the only system to date that could actually handle millions of users, and of growing importance — automated requests or bots. And playhaus will be building one of the first business SaaS platforms in the space, geared at non-web3 enthusiasts, and actually incentivize them to participate in the network mechanics that make the system valuable. But it’s more than that because it’ll be pioneering the frameworks for licensing data directly from users to AI systems via smart contracts, or you know Solana’s equivalent to them.</p>

			 What is a VPN (Virtual Private Network) and what is it for? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>In recent years, increasing focus on online privacy and security has led many people to discover tools such as VPNs. With the increase in cyber threats and risks associated with surfing online, protecting one’s personal data has become a priority for many users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the most effective solutions to guarantee security and privacy when accessing the Internet is to use a VPN, a service that protects data transmission on public networks and preserves one’s identity by detecting and rejecting malware, phishing and fraud attempts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This tool allows you to surf the Internet anonymously, protecting your information from eavesdropping and malicious attacks. But what is a VPN and what makes it so useful?</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 What is a VPN and why is it important? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							   <p>VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. It is a technology that creates a private connection between your own device and the Internet. In practice, a VPN connection allows you to surf online more securely by masking your IP address and encrypting your data in transit. This means that your information is more difficult to intercept by third parties, such as hackers or individuals trying to monitor your online activity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Using this type of connection is essential to ensure security and privacy, especially in situations where the risk of personal data exposure is high. For instance, when you connect to public Wi-Fi networks, such as those in bars, restaurants or airports, your data can easily be intercepted by malicious attackers who could connect to your device. By encrypting your connection, a Virtual Private Network prevents information from being stolen or monitored even on these public networks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, many organisations, including marketing agencies, try to monitor your behaviour as you browse in order to collect personal information, such as history and sensitive data. To protect your privacy and prevent your data from being used without your consent, it is essential to use a private network. In fact, using a VPN makes it almost impossible for anyone to monitor your online activities, ensuring that your information remains protected and out of reach of prying eyes.</p>   						 
				 
				 
				 
			 Are VPNs legal? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>One of the most frequently asked questions concerns the legality of this tool: are VPNs legal? The answer depends on the country you are in. In general, the use of a VPN is legal in most countries, including the UK and Italy, but there are some exceptions. The key lies in the way the technology is used.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>While using this type of connection to protect privacy and surf safely is perfectly legal, in some countries the use of a private network to circumvent certain government controls or to access prohibited content may be restricted.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 What is a VPN for? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							As mentioned above, a Virtual Private Network is an indispensable tool for protecting data and privacy online. By using it, you can surf more safely and defend yourself against potential threats.

&nbsp;

Here are the main functions of a VPN connection:

&nbsp;
 
 	 Personal Data protection. A private network encrypts your Internet connection, making data, such as passwords and banking information, invisible to anyone trying to intercept them, especially on public or unsecured Wi-Fi networks. 
 	 Online anonymity. By hiding your IP address, it allows you to surf without being tracked. This means that websites cannot collect information on your location or surfing habits, guaranteeing completely private surfing. 
 	 Increased security. A VPN service protects online traffic from external attacks, such as hackers, and reduces the risk of unauthorised access. In addition, some private networks offer advanced features to protect against web threats, such as blocking suspicious applications in case of abnormal activity, malware and intrusive advertisements. 
 						 
				 
				 
				 
			 How does a VPN work? 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>A virtual private network protects your Internet connection by creating a channel through which data travels encrypted, preventing anyone from intercepting or monitoring it.</p><p>Here is how a VPN works in greater detail:</p>  User and server authentication. When you connect to a Virtual Private Network, your device is first authenticated by the server. This ensures that only authorised users can access the private network.  Data encryption. Once authenticated, the server applies an encryption protocol to the data you send and receive. Encryption makes your data unintelligible to anyone attempting to intercept it, protecting your personal information during transmission. This creates a secure data exchange ‘tunnel’ that makes it impossible for third parties, hackers and even your service provider (ISP), to view the content passing over your connection.  Encapsulation of data packets. Data is wrapped in an external packet, which is also encrypted. This encapsulation process makes it even more difficult for anyone to access the data, keeping it safe during transfer.  Data decryption. Once data arrives at the destination server, the external packet is removed via a decryption process, allowing the data to be read securely.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, a VPN works by creating a private and confidential connection between your device and the destination server, ensuring that your data can be transmitted encrypted and protected. Using an encrypted tunnel prevents data from being intercepted or used without your consent.</p>

 A potential breakthrough on personal data&nbsp;… and productivity <p>As far as Government announcements go, this one hardly seems the most exciting: there’s not many people who will see this title — “Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework Gamma (0.4) Pre-release” — and think “Oh wow! I must stop everything and read&nbsp;that!”</p><p>Yet, amidst a welter of other announcements and initiatives coming from the new Government, this could be the most important thing it does in its entire term of office. We’ll come to why in a minute. But first, what’s it all&nbsp;about?</p> Why identity&nbsp;matters <p>In a digital world, identity verification matters. If you are transacting online you need to be confident that the person at the other end of that transaction is who they say they are. If they’re not, all sorts of horrible things could happen, including damaging errors and fraud. Without some way of building this confidence, online commerce and service provision either grinds to a halt or entails all sorts of potential risks and associated costs.</p><p>Not surprisingly the potential benefits of cracking this identity problem could be huge. <a href="https://medium.com/@mckinsey_mgi/five-key-takeaways-on-the-value-of-digital-id-71f6026932e9">According to McKinsey</a> for example, getting digital identity right “could unlock economic value equivalent to 3 to 13 percent of GDP in 2030”. One example: it could reduce organisations’ costs of onboarding new staff and customers by up to&nbsp;90%.</p><p>But that’s just organisations. McKinsey also estimated that “just over half of the potential economic value of digital ID could accrue to individuals, making it a powerful key to inclusive growth”.</p><p>“Beyond quantifiable economic benefits,” their research continued, “digital ID can offer noneconomic value to individuals through social and political inclusion, rights protection, and transparency. For example, robust identity programs could help guard against child marriage, slavery, and human trafficking.”</p><p>So, as we said, it&nbsp;matters.</p><p>Yet finding a way to verify these identities has proved to be a very difficult task. We know because we’ve been involved in trying to find a workable solution for many years. For example, we were one of just five companies chosen by the UK Government to pioneer its first big attempt to crack this problem way back in 2011 with its Gov.UK <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOV.UK_Verify">Verify programme</a>.</p> Three hard won&nbsp;lessons <p>Verify didn’t work and the lessons from its failure are extremely important.</p><p>When the UK Government first tackled the identity problem with its Verify programme, its underlying assumption was that ‘digital identity’ would become a new ‘market’ like another, where specialist producers called ‘identity service providers’ would produce a specialist product called ‘an identity’ which they would sell to buyers in a competitive marketplace.</p><p>There were three things wrong with this assumption and the lessons learned about them are key to where we are&nbsp;today.</p><p>First, there is (and never can be) one, single ‘thing’ called an ‘identity’. People often think of ‘identities’ in terms of a single document like a passport or driving licence. But while these documents are very useful in many cases, they don’t always work. What happens if a person doesn’t have a driving licence or passport, for example? For an identity system to work, it needs to work for everybody, all the time, and ‘identity’ is too fluid and complex a concept to be nailed down by a single identity ‘product’.</p><p>Second, identity verification is first and foremost a process, not a product. Driving licences and passports are not official identity documents, for example. They are documents that provide people with certain entitlements. But the information they contain is widely trusted because of the stringent processes that went into creating&nbsp;them.</p><p>Crucially, these so-called identity documents are examples of ‘composite’ data points: one piece of data — entitlement to a driving licence — made up of a series of other, separate data points — such as name, date of birth, address and so on — each of which have been separately checked. Each one of these data points being a separate attribute.</p><p>That’s what really goes into verifying someone’s identity — the ability to verify different details about them, with these details varying according to the situation. For example, if a person does not have a driving licence or passport, or happens to be homeless, then other ‘verified attributes’ will be needed to verify them. Ultimately, it’s the attributes and the processes for verifying these attributes that&nbsp;matter.</p><p>Recognising this is a crucial step forward. For a system of identity assurance and verification to work it needs to be based on the ability to share and access a wide range of ‘verified attributes’ which may vary from one person and situation to another. Identity verification is a by-product of the ability to assemble enough such verified attributes for a person to be confident enough in their reliability for them to act on the information provided. This is why it was hugely important that the Government’s programme was renamed to say ‘Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework’.</p><p>The third key lesson has been to realise that ‘digital identity’ isn’t a single-purpose product. It covers many different purposes each of which may require different bits of information — different verified attributes. For example, being able to prove you are over 18 so that you can buy an alcoholic drink is very different to being able to prove you are a qualified pilot and really able to fly an aeroplane or that you are not a sex offender seeking to work with children (which is one of the functions of the Disclosure and Barring Service).</p><p>For an identity and attributes verification system to really work well, in other words, it needs to be flexible enough to share and assemble a very wide range of different verified attributes for a wide range of different use-cases.</p><p>This is what that exciting sounding document called “Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework Gamma (0.4) Pre-release” represents: the fact that these lessons have been learned and that, for the first time, after decades of trying, the UK Government has actually worked its way through to creating an approach that can actually work, efficiently and effectively, at&nbsp;scale.</p> Lifting the productivity logjam <p>“Yes,” you might say, “That’s great. But does that really make this the most important announcement that a Government could make in its entire time in&nbsp;office?”</p><p>Well, here’s why it could&nbsp;be.</p><p>Our entire economy — and society — is in the midst of a gut-wrenching, disconcerting and often bewildering economic shift. For hundreds of years it was organised around one, single basic model of wealth creation: deploying energy derived from fossil fuels to drive machines that turbocharged the transformation and movement of physical things. That is what ‘industry’ was about: the production of ever more physical items at ever lower&nbsp;cost.</p><p>It was an incredible driver of wealth creation, but now that model is reaching its sell-by date and our entire economy is in transition. It is beginning to pivot around the deployment of an entirely different type of resource — data — that enables us to do a different set of things that provide new value along different dimensions: make new discoveries; make better, more informed decisions; organise and coordinate the detailed actions needed to implement these decisions.</p><p>In other words, we are moving from a ‘thing’ driven economy to become a data driven economy and with that, we are opening up opportunities for improved productivity (and quality, and innovation) that the industrial age couldn’t&nbsp;reach.</p><p>Here is the point most people miss: Data in the form of verified attributes lies at the epicentre of every step of every service that deals with an identified individual. As well as identity assurance, these activities include onboarding and recognising service users when they return, deciding on eligibilities, configuring service details according to the specific needs and requirements of the individual and the circumstances in which the service is being provided, planning coordinating and executing the many necessary details of service delivery, and undertaking associated record keeping and customer services. Data is how services are provided.</p><p>If at any point, the data needed to drive these activities is wrong or unreliable the whole process either grinds to a halt or starts producing the wrong outcomes. In this sense, verified attributes are the new oil of an efficient, productive economy - not the ‘new oil’ that people talk about, as in Big Money and Big Power struggles, but the easily overlooked but ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL oil that lubricates the machinery of the entire economy. This is true of every citizen-facing service you may think of, from central and local government services, through health and care to education, financial services, retailing, travel and so on — across every sector (public, private and&nbsp;third).</p><p>It is precisely because we do not have reliable operational processes for the sharing of verified attributes that productivity in this country is flatlining. By opening the door to these reliable, trustworthy processes the new Digital Identity AND ATTRIBUTES Trust Framework is opening the door to a new, economy wide productivity revolution.</p><p>As part of this, the new Framework has identified the core functions that lie at the heart of this new data-driven economy. They&nbsp;are:</p>  ‘Attribute Providers’ that collect, create, check or share pieces of information that describe something about a&nbsp;person,  ‘Relying Parties’ that use this information to undertake a service,&nbsp;and  ‘Holder Services’ which provide individuals with the ability to securely “collect, store, view, manage or share identity and/or attribute information”, and which enable these individuals to “control what information their holder service stores, when it can be shared, and who it is shared with”. (A personal data store is one form of Holder Service.)  <p>The Trust Framework identifies other categories and functions too. They include identity service providers which “verify a user’s identity for one-off use at a single point in time”; orchestration service providers that “make sure data can be securely shared between participants through the provision of their technology infrastructure” but are not user-facing; and component service providers who provide specialist information (such as biometric data) that can be used in an identity verification process.</p><p>But it is the first three that really count in terms of understanding how the emerging data-driven economy will work. It will be driven by organisations which produce information (particularly verified attributes), organisations that use this information to provide specific services, and Holder Services that connect the two, including and embedding individuals as active parties in the collection and sharing of their own information.</p><p>This is the logical structure and architecture of a data sharing economy that has grown up inside an industrial age. Modern service providers don’t only produce services. They also produce and use data (e.g. verified attributes). Holder Services provide the glue that brings them together safely and efficiently — as the hub and clearing house for data&nbsp;sharing.</p><p>This is what makes the Trust Framework so important. The concepts and processes it is laying out have the potential to last long into the future, becoming embedded into how our economy works in 20 years time and beyond, with transformational impact on how this economy works. Remember McKinsey talking about 90% reductions in the costs of onboarding new staff and customers? With the approach identified by DIATF, similar productivity breakthroughs become possible with every step of every service that needs verified information about people in order to serve&nbsp;them.</p> Ensuring trust <p>But the Trust Framework does a lot more than just identify the shape of things to come. It is also helping to ensure that these things happen on the ground, and that they happen safely. It doesn’t allow any old chancer to come along and say “I am an attribute provider” or ‘Holder Service”. It creates processes for their independent certification, so that people can trust their operations.</p><p>It also creates room for supplementary schemes that apply the Framework’s core principles and processes to specific situations where more detail is required. It is creating what it says — a framework — by which this system can actually&nbsp;work.</p><p>One key question remains. Will the public ‘buy’&nbsp;it?</p><p>Here, research undertaken as part of the development of the new Framework is crucial. Below we include some quotes from this research. We quote them in detail because they speak so strongly to the work we at Mydex CIC have been doing all these years on this&nbsp;front.</p><p>Please note: in what follows we are quoting from <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/public-dialogue-on-trust-in-digital-identity-services/public-dialogue-on-trust-in-digital-identity-services-a-findings-report">the research report</a>. These are not our own&nbsp;words.</p><p>A human rights&nbsp;issue</p><p>“Participants’ attitudes towards identification and digital identity services shifted during the course of the dialogue. Many participants began the dialogue believing that having identity documents is purely practical. As participants’ discussions developed, many began to think of identity documentation as a basic human&nbsp;right.</p><p>“Participants perceive it to be an articulation of being human and a demonstration that they have a recognised role in society. Participants believe the importance of identity data is not simply practical but also instrumental in people having control over their lives and life&nbsp;chances.</p><p>“This has ethical implications. It means participants want to know that service providers will look after them and their data and protect and support the vulnerable and disadvantaged in society. This is important so that everyone can accrue benefits from digital identity services.</p><p>Human centred</p><p>“This human-centred approach is requested throughout the&nbsp;system…</p><p>“This points to a broader, more philosophical point that is a thread throughout the dialogue. Participants are concerned that digital identity service providers will be more focused on the technical aspects of the service than they are with developing a service that will take care of users and provide them with the support they need to use the service, and to ensure their data is safe and secure. Participants believe their confidence and trust in services will develop and increase if they see evidence, through the trust framework and in the actions of service providers, that they support people and put user needs and experiences at the centre of service design and delivery.</p><p>A public service &amp; trustworthiness</p><p>“Participants want to know that digital identity service providers are motivated by more than generating income. They call for the trust framework to make it clear that public benefit is a core value for those being certified to deliver digital identity services, and the government and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-for-digital-identities-and-attributes">OfDIA</a> [Office for Digital Identity and Attributes] as overseers of the programme.</p><p>“Participants articulated a ‘trust tension’: whilst they do not trust the government, they feel that a public sector organisation, a non-profit organisation or a research consortium might be more trustworthy than private sector organisations. This is seen as more trustworthy as it would operate without vested interests or the need to satisfy company shareholders&nbsp;… whilst trust in government is low, trust in government sponsored bodies is higher and perceived as more trustworthy than private sector organisations.</p><p>Benefits to&nbsp;society</p><p>“This leads to the second key factor. Participants want to know that digital identity service providers are motivated by more than generating income. They call for the trust framework to make it clear that public benefit is a core value for those being certified to deliver digital identity services, and the government and OfDIA as overseers of the programme. In this context, convenience on its own is not seen as a strong enough benefit. Delivering services which provide a trusted resource which can be used interchangeably across services and in a range of contexts is more powerful.</p><p>Inclusion</p>  “Participants do not see convenience on its own as a compelling enough reason for increased use of digital identities. They want to know how digital identity services are going to benefit society by making proving identity more inclusive.  “Participants want to know that these services are accessible to those that want and need to use them. Having options that work for everyone is seen as part of an inclusive system, one which enables people to verify their identity or attributes in the way which works for them, whatever their background, level of skills and experience.  “They want to know that service providers will look after them and their data; protect and support the vulnerable and disadvantaged in society so that they too can accrue benefits from digital identity services.  <p>Control</p><p>“Participants believe the trust framework should provide a clear statement on how users ‘own’ and ‘control’ their&nbsp;data.</p><p>“Having control over their data is important to participants. They want assurances within the digital identity services trust framework that they have choice about who they share data with and&nbsp;why.</p><p>“Participants believe the trust framework should provide a clear statement on how users ‘own’ and ‘control’ their data, including being able to update it and protect personal data they do not wish to&nbsp;share.</p><p>Personal utility and&nbsp;agency</p><p>“Participants see identification for consequential transactions such as renting or buying a property; proving you have the right to work in the UK or to get or renew a passport or driving license as more complex. It moves identification beyond the practical to instrumental in achieving life shifts such as demonstrating something significant and personal to them, including gender transition.</p><p>“The more participants thought about identification, the more they considered it a route to demonstrating that they are part of and contribute to society. Many participants feel that not being able to demonstrate something about themselves could have a significant impact on their lives, including having a meaningful role in&nbsp;society.</p> Conclusion <p>In trying to find an answer to the pressing question of digital identity, the UK Government has been on a long and steep learning curve. It might have taken nearly a decade and a half, but it has now arrived at a way forward that works — a way forward that could prove transformational for our economy and society as a&nbsp;whole.</p><p>A key part of this is recognising the role of individuals and their Holder Services: the right and need for individuals to participate in an identity and attribute data sharing ecosystem with all the qualities identified by the programme’s public engagement research: human rights, human centredness, public service and trustworthiness, benefits to society, inclusion, control, personal utility and agency. That is what we are about as a Community Interest&nbsp;Company.</p><p>DIATF encapsulates a formula for the treatment of personal data in a data-driven age. It transcends the limitations of the organisation-centric database by enabling data sharing via Holder Services. By embedding human rights into how it works operationally, it also transcends the trade-offs between data protection and innovative uses of data. This trade-off has bedevilled the growth of this economy in its early years. In doing these things, it enables the data sharing that is needed to unleash personal data’s full social and economic potential.</p><p>Of course there is many a slip between cup and lip. Everything depends on how this Framework is interpreted and implemented. But for now it represents a strategically crucial beginning.</p><p>At Mydex, we have been involved in this journey from its beginnings with the Verify programme of 2011. We look forward to contributing further as it&nbsp;unfolds.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/a-potential-breakthrough-on-personal-data-and-productivity-96ab1e16eecc">A potential breakthrough on personal data&nbsp;… and productivity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>We recently proposed the <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/how-personal-data-licenses-can-keep-digital-identity-private-part-1/">Personal Data License</a> (PDL): a system that leverages Verifiable Digital Credentials to give individuals control over the sharing of their sensitive data, including the ability to enforceably limit, revoke, or receive disclosures about that access. As part of this system, the person sharing data will issue a PDL using their digital wallet, establishing a clear record of the terms for data sharing. The PDL will then be countersigned by the recipient, signifying their acceptance of the user's conditions and creating a mutual agreement that protects both parties.</p><p>Combined with legislative enforcement, a Personal Data License system would allow individuals to share data for a limited time, requiring recipients to delete it after the agreed period or report its continued existence as required. This enhanced level of control greatly increases the power that individuals have over their data. The ability to revoke data, ensure its removal, or receive notifications about its existence would have a profound impact in a landscape where personal data is increasingly used for commercial purposes and massive repositories of outdated data remain vulnerable to a growing number of security breaches.</p><p>Personal Data Licensing (PDL) would also have a third important benefit: increasing user trust in the digital systems handling their data. The public is increasingly <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/10/18/how-americans-view-data-privacy/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">confused and worried</a> about how their data are used, by both private companies and governments. That anxiety could be a serious obstacle to the adoption of digital identity systems like the <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruceid-partners-with-ca-dmv-on-mdl/">mobile driver’s licenses (mDL)</a>, which offer <a href="https://learn.spruceid.com/the-considerations/increased-privacy-in-identity-checks?ref=blog.spruceid.com">significant improvements</a> to the current privacy and security status quo.</p><p>But how exactly would Personal Data Licensing work? Let’s dive in.</p> Forget Me Now <p>Enforceable data control is important, both practically and for public perception because the public has come to associate digital tools with sacrificing their privacy. There’s the ambient experience of surveillance-driven advertising, but also much more scary examples, such as when <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before-her-father-did/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Target’s algorithm detected and exposed a customer’s pregnancy</a> or the current uncertainty about what 23andMe will do with <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/g-s1-25795/23andme-data-genetic-dna-privacy?ref=blog.spruceid.com">all the individual genetic information it owns</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The 23andMe situation illustrates how trackable data licensing would improve on the current status quo. In retrospect, 23andMe’s customers would probably have preferred to let the company handle their genetic data temporarily, not store it in perpetuity. Personal data licensing makes data more like a digital book out for a temporary loan. Notably, the goal is not to create a more nuanced commercial license to let users monetize data, a concept many experts believe would be <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-data-ownership-is-the-wrong-approach-to-protecting-privacy/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">exploitative and bad for privacy</a>. Instead, PDL is intended as a privacy tool for particularly sensitive data, such as medical records, allowing users to automatically and auditably request the deletion of their data from their smartphones. If a user revoked their PDL and then published this action to a public blockchain, there would be solid evidence that they requested their data deletion at a certain point in history, accessible to anyone with shared data records and an internet connection.</p><p>Personal Data Licensing would use the same mix of digital wallets and secure signatures that verify digital IDs like California’s mobile driver’s license. When data are shared from a document or record in a digital wallet, a PDL system could require the recipient to digitally countersign a data license indicating acceptance of terms. This is aligned with building blocks like <a href="https://kantarainitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Kantara-Consent-Receipt-Presentation.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Katara’s verifiable “receipt”</a> for the data, which is based on standards outlined by groups, <a href="https://www.iso27001security.com/html/27560.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">including ISO</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>These licenses would be readable by both humans and machines, outline the purpose of the sharing, and have clear expiration dates. They might also define any rights for third-party sharing or provisions for the sharer’s right to revoke data access. They may also encapsulate reporting requirements, such as how to notify the user if further data sharing is needed. Data wallets would automatically retain copies of these licenses, with verifiable signatures from the data recipients. With legislation backing, such as an updated version of Europe’s GDPR, this paper trail would make data deletion auditable and enforceable.</p><p>These capabilities and interactions are not currently part of dominant digital ID standards, such as the ISO’s Mobile Driver’s License (mDL) or the W3C’s Verifiable Credentials standard. We believe the system can be designed externally to such standards in the “white space” left open—though ideally, data licensing would eventually be integrated with base standards.</p> Data Control and a Fairer Digital Economy <p>A system of digitally signed receipts for data sharing would create a verifiable record of what data we share, with which counterparties, and under which conditions. However, legislation would be needed to ensure compliance by imposing penalties on data recipients who didn’t comply with the conditions of a license. Analogs to such legislation already exist, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA), and the&nbsp; <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/right-to-be-forgotten/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">European GDPR’s “Right to Be Forgotten.”</a> Governments worldwide have been implementing policies to give people more control over their data.</p><p>Notably, Utah enacted the <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2024/bills/static/HB0491.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Government Data Privacy Act (GDPA) in May 2024</a>, which gives Utahns discretion over how their own government should manage their personal data. At SpruceID, we are generally aligned with actions that increase individual autonomy while avoiding the centralization of power.</p><p>However, the current enforcement state for these laws tends to favor large-scale data collectors, such as Google and Facebook, who can afford the staff and other overhead to comply. Compliance costs have even led <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/online-privacy/closing-shop-or-closing-off-companies-respond-to-gdpr?ref=blog.spruceid.com#:~:text=Blocking%20out%20Europe&amp;text=The%20GDPR%20was%20a%20contributing,on%20business%20in%20other%20regions.">some smaller digital businesses to leave the EU</a> or even shut down entirely.</p><p>A standardized and open system of Personal Data Licensing, including verifiable “receipts,” would make both enforcement and compliance simpler, reducing the unfair burden that data policies have tended to have on smaller digital businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>Public policy would need to support PDL systems with enforcement. Imagine, for instance, that months after releasing your blood test data to a medical provider, you start receiving health marketing messages that seem guided by that data. This evidence of data misuse could be directly correlated with a digitally signed receipt showing exactly who received the data, and when, and submitted to a data enforcement body.&nbsp;</p> From “Papers, Please” to “Why—and for How Long?” <p>Making the Personal Data License a reality will take work and time, but we believe it’s a compelling path forward. One very practical upside of personal data licensing is that it will make privacy frameworks such as GDPR and CCPA much more implementable. A record-keeping standard simplifying policy enforcement gives individuals more control over their data while also reducing the compliance burden on firms that collect data for valid purposes.</p><p>More fundamentally, Personal Data Licensing would be a major step forward in digital identity’s overarching mission to improve privacy, security, and user control of data. Personal Data Licenses, paired with monitoring and enforcement, can reverse the power dynamic in data sharing. Instead of a presumption that users must hand over data on request, government agencies and data-hungry enterprises will be required to convincingly justify their data collection and how long it will be stored.</p><p>The data hoards built up by unrestricted data collection have become huge risks to global privacy, security, and democracy. They have been used for surveillance and mass manipulation. It’s time for a change in control.</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

				  With a focused, achievable goal, you can quickly deploy your Verifiable Credential ecosystem and gain an edge over your competitors  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Helen Garneau</p>
<p>If you’re looking to transform costly, inefficient, or user-unfriendly authentication and data sharing systems, our motto at Indicio is: “Start today, start small, scale smart.” This means beginning with a focused, manageable use case to build understanding of the technology, achieve results, and let these results create momentum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve helped customers implement Verifiable Credentials to solve a myriad of business issues: interoperability between partners and governments when privacy is a concern or when direct integration is too complicated and expensive; inefficient, error-prone, and repetitive processes based on manual, paper-based form-filling verification, and simplifying, securing, and speeding up access to systems and software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, rather than aiming to solve every challenge at once, we encourage customers to start with a small deployment that fixes one problem. This approach builds understanding and trust, drives stakeholder buy-in, and sets the foundation for long-term success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Verifiable Credentials are a new digital authentication method that uses cryptographic proofs to verify identity or attributes without exposing unnecessary personal information or requiring the verifier to check in with the original source of the information or a third-party identity provider.</p>
<p>Here’s how they work:</p>
 
 Issuer: A trusted entity (e.g., a bank, government agency, or employer) issues a credential to a user (e.g., proof of identity, business license). 
 Holder: The user stores this credential securely in a digital wallet on their mobile device. 
 Verifier: When logging in or accessing a service, the user presents a cryptographically verifiable proof of the credential and, depending on the use case, information in the credential to the verifier. Importantly, only the necessary data is shared, and the verifier can confirm its authenticity without contacting the issuer. 
 
<p>This decentralized model for data ecosystems means that users hold their own data and that the data issued in a credential is completely under the user’s control. This decentralization eliminates the need to store personal data in a centralized database in order to cross check and verify it. It also removes the privacy concerns over how third-parties can use personal data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s look at the simplest decentralized identity ecosystem we can create, one where the issuer and verifier is the same entity —&nbsp;for example, an employer issuing an employee credential for seamless login to company systems and applications. This structure, often referred to as a closed ecosystem, provides a simple, controlled environment for implementing, testing, and understanding the solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once a team experiences how easy it is to implement such a system, the path is much easier to adding outside verifiers (say a company’s benefits partners) or other issuers (say, government-issued credentials) to create new ecosystems for sharing verifiable data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting in this way allows for iterative development and continuous improvement, ensuring smoother rollouts and minimizing risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our CTO, Ken Ebert calls this stage of development, a three-legged stool. While decentralized identity often seems like a purely technological solution, success relies on making important choices to balance the needs of three critical elements:&nbsp;</p>
<p> Business: What problem are you trying to solve with decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials? Who are the users, and how will they benefit? What funding model supports the initiative? We’ve seen the customers who are quick to answer these questions get the budget and speed to deployment the fastest.</p>
<p> Governance: Governance defines how users obtain the credentials, who uses them, who the other parties in the ecosystem are, as well as how the deployment adheres to emerging global data regulations. Ensuring compliance and clarity builds trust among stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Technology: This involves the foundational tools: the software for issuing credentials, holding credentials (in a digital wallet) and verifying credentials; the ability to write to and retrieve cryptographic material; and decisions over protocols and standards.</p>
<p>Our team at Indicio is active and lead many different communities where technologies and standards are being developed. From OpenID to DIDComm, W3C and IETF, chances are if you are interested in a specific protocol, credential type, or specification– we’ve got you covered.</p>
<p>An example of how these three elements work together: A company call center could issue credentials to customers, enabling quicker authentication. If this reduces verification time from 30 seconds to 5, with data to prove efficiency and customer satisfaction, the team can now ask for further funding for adoption. Here, the technology solves a business problem, and the governance is rooted in the trusted relationship between the company and its customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As new applications and improvements emerge during an initial rollout, the temptation to scale quickly can be strong. However, the key to sustainable growth is incremental expansion. Using the call center example, this might mean gradually adding new verifiers, issuers, or credential holders to improve routine transactions while maintaining a stable and secure system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Decentralized identity is transformative. A key factor in the success of any decentralized identity project is effective communication of this — both internally and externally. Teams must articulate the value proposition to users, addressing the pain points that decentralized identity alleviates. This requires a combination of education, documentation, and messaging that engages stakeholders at every level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Indicio, we help organizations take their first steps with decentralized identity and support their success as they grow into larger deployments. By providing enterprise-grade tools built on open-source technologies, a variety of hosting options, and customizable training programs, we provide businesses the flexibility to create a variety of scalable solutions to fit their needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether you’re just starting out in testing or ready to deploy, our expertise helps you confidently navigate the path to a successful decentralized identity ecosystem.</p>

<p>The latest <a href="https://quarkid.org" title="">QuarkID</a> update, implemented using the <a href="https://extrimian.io/products" title="">SSI API and ID Connect </a>by Extrimian, introduces a critical feature for decentralized information management: VC Attachments. This functionality allows the inclusion of files, such as PDFs, images, and other formats, in verifiable credentials, providing additional context or evidence to support the information contained within the credentials.</p>



<p></p>



 



 What Are VC Attachments? 



<p>VC Attachments enhance the handling, storage, and linking of attachments to verifiable credentials. Issued under the Verifiable Credentials (VC) standard, these are cryptographically signed digital documents containing verifiable data.</p>



<p>The inclusion of attachments ensures that any relevant supplementary information is securely available and managed, preserving the integrity and reliability of shared or stored documents.</p>

  <p>In an era where cyber threats are constant, organizations must prepare not for if a breach will happen but when. The urgency to identify, address, and bounce back from security incidents has never been greater. Privileged Access Management (PAM) plays a vital role in bolstering defenses and streamlining responses to these incidents. However, many organizations still struggle to unlock its full benefits, leaving critical vulnerabilities exposed.</p>
<p>Modern PAM solutions offer a range of capabilities that extend far beyond traditional access control. By integrating PAM into incident response strategies, organizations can significantly improve their ability to identify threats, contain breaches, and streamline recovery processes. Join us as we explore how PAM can be leveraged to transform human risk into human assets, providing full visibility and control over internal risks.</p>
<p>Paul Fisher, Senior Analyst at KuppingerCole Analysts, will look at the state of PAM and compare common versus emerging capability areas. He will discuss to which extent these capabilities can support not only protective requirements but support in the analysis of incidents and thus streamline incident reporting.</p>
<p>Aleksandr Dymov, Product Manager at Syteca, will showcase the Syteca platform, a comprehensive cybersecurity solution designed to meet the diverse needs of modern organizations. He will present a case study and provide a live demo, illustrating how Syteca's customizable security toolkit enables granular PAM and advanced user activity monitoring to secure organizations against insider threats.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/pam-your-secret-weapon"></a>

				  Our success in developing OpenID for Verifiable Credentials is paving the way for new use cases and quicker adoption.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Helen Gareau</p>
<p>Our mission at Indicio is to make decentralized identity accessible and practical for real-world adoption. A key to this is our active involvement in developing and supporting OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OID4VC) and OpenID for Verifiable Presentations (OID4VP). Part of the emerging <a href="https://www.european-digital-identity-regulation.com/">European eIDAS 2.0 identity standards</a>, these protocols specify how Verifiable Credentials can be used, building on OpenID Connect (OIDC), a widely used framework for authenticating user access to applications and websites.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OID4VC</a>: Streamlines the issuance of Verifiable Credentials using familiar web technologies.</p>
<p><a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html">OID4VP</a>: Facilitates the presentation of these credentials, ensuring interoperability with existing OpenID-based systems.</p>
<p>These protocols make the transition to decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials easy for many organizations, as they are familiar with the underlying authentication technology and don’t have to replace their identity and access management systems. This means companies and organizations can quickly implement seamless operations and services that deliver immediate value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Gartner Research notes in its <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/5560195">2024 Market Guide to Decentralized Identity</a>, the technology “represents magnitudes of improvement in terms of efficiency, cost and assurance” for authentication, account security, fraud, privacy, and security.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An example of Indicio’s work with these protocols is the<a href="https://indicio.tech/a-landmark-in-digital-travel-aruba-indicio-and-sita-combine-a-dtc-and-iata-oneid-for-international-flights/"> IATA One ID Proof of Concept (POC)</a>. This was developed with our strategic partner SITA, along with Delta Airlines and the Government of Aruba, and showcased at the joint<a href="https://www.iata.org/en/events/all/wfs--wps/"> IATA World Financial Symposium (WFS) and IATA World Passenger Symposium (WPS) </a>in October 2024.</p>
<p>The POC showed how two different Verifiable Credentials, a <a href="https://www.icao.int/Meetings/TRIP-Symposium-2021/PublishingImages/Pages/Presentations/Digital%20Travel%20Credential%20%28DTC%29%20Policy%20and%20Guiding%20Principles.pdf">Digital Travel Credential</a> using the DIDComm protocol and a <a href="https://www.iata.org/en/programs/passenger/one-id/">One ID</a> credential using OID4VC, can work seamlessly together to facilitate seamless check in, baggage management, lounge access, and international border crossing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The POC showed just how easy it is for a person to enroll in both at the same time with a passport and mobile phone, and then use them for instant, seamless authentication through each step of the passenger journey from home to destination. This was the first ever One ID implementation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see <a href="https://youtu.be/StRH7uOqxQA?feature=shared">a demonstration</a> from a recent <a href="https://indicio.tech/how-decentralized-digital-identity-is-creating-simpler-more-streamlined-air-travel/">meeting of the Indicio Identity Community Meetup</a>.</p>
<p>At Indicio, we see the future as a multi-credential, protocol, and standard world, and our goal is to provide the best implementation of each to meet our customer needs and to ensure that all work together so that our customers can seize every opportunity.</p>
<p>Our success in implementing&nbsp; OID4VC and in combining and bridging different credentials and protocols has made Indicio a trusted partner for global organizations looking to implement cutting-edge identity solutions.</p>
<p>If you’re ready to explore how OID4VC can revolutionize your identity ecosystem, or to explore our solutions in education, finance, health, agriculture, the public sector, and travel and tourism, we’re here to help you every step of the way. <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">Reach out to Indicio today!</a></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p> A&nbsp;Game-Changer in Data Backup and&nbsp;Cyber Resilience&nbsp; 
<p>On December 10th, 2024,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cohesity.com/press/cohesity-becomes-worlds-largest-data-protection-provider-after-completing-combination-with-veritas-enterprise-data-protection-business/">Cohesity and Veritas&nbsp;announced</a>&nbsp;that they have finalized their union. This is a major development as it will create the largest player in the rapidly growing market for cyber resilience and data protection. Data is not only fundamental to all organizations’ business processes but now also defines the very infrastructure upon which these processes depend.&nbsp; Cyber-attacks and ransomware are an existential threat to this data and data protection solutions are essential for cyber resilience.&nbsp; This union represents a pivotal moment in the worldwide marketplace for these solutions.&nbsp;</p>
 Why This Merger is Important&nbsp; 
<p>Digitalization of business processes has increased the potential impact of cyber threats.&nbsp; This, taken together with increased regulation on cyber resilience, makes the market for these solutions strong. Based on our current research the Cloud Backup market size was last estimated at over $5.75B with an annual growth rate of 18.7%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The merger of Cohesity and Veritas underscores the importance of dependable, scalable, and innovative data protection solutions for cyber resilience. Both these vendors are recognized as leaders in our recent Leadership Compass report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc80868/cloud-backup-for-ai-enabled-cyber-resilience">Cloud Backup for AI Enabled Cyber Resilience</a>&nbsp;with each bringing their own complementary strengths.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Complementary Strengths&nbsp; 
<p>Cohesity brings its modern, cloud-native approach to data management and Veritas brings its long-standing expertise in enterprise-grade data protection. By combining their strengths, the new entity is well placed to address the full spectrum of data protection and cyber resilience needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cohesity offers the Cohesity Data Cloud (CDC), built on SpanFS, an immutable filesystem ensuring data integrity and security plus instant file serving of backed-up NAS data, and using SnapTree chain-free metadata such that essentially each point-in-time backup can be accessed as rapidly and efficiently as if it had been originally made via a full backup.  Veritas products include Veritas Alta™ Data Protection, NetBackup – an enterprise backup and recovery solution, and Backup Exec - designed for backup and recovery for small to mid-sized businesses. Together these combine modern architecture with a wide range of capabilities and coverage.&nbsp;</p>
 The Importance of&nbsp;ML and&nbsp;GenAI&nbsp; 
<p>An important market trend is the evolution of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) in particular generative AI (GenAI).&nbsp; ML and GenAI provide capabilities that can be helpful to enhance cyber resilience, and we expect cyber resilience solutions to exploit these technologies where appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both vendors have recognized the importance of ML and GenAI both in terms of the opportunities they provide as well as the data protection needs, they introduce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Veritas uses GenAI/ML with the AI-powered Operational Assistant, Veritas Alta™ Copilot. Alta Copilot brings the power of GenAI to Alta View, making it more intuitive and accessible for all users to detect suspicious activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cohesity’s AI framework, including the patent-pending Cohesity Gaia, leverages GenAI throughout the platform to offer operational insights, anomaly detection, information insights, and predictive analytics. Gaia enables users to search based on meaning rather than search based on characters, and converse with their data using natural language. The platform also includes AI-driven data classification and threat detection, utilizing machine learning to enhance security and compliance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our view, in future an organization should be able to give a GenAI based backup and disaster recovery solution a set of resilience objectives, compliance requirements and cost constraints for the system to build, evaluate, and implement the technology elements and support the manual processes needed to meet these.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Impact on Customers&nbsp; 
<p>Not all marriages last and customers may be anxious about what this union may mean for them.&nbsp; Both companies recognized that it is easier to lose customers than to gain them. In February 2024, when they&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cohesity.com/press/cohesity-and-veritas-data-protection-business-to-combine-forming-a-new-leader-in-ai-powered-data-security-and-management/">announced</a> their intention to combine, the announcement included a “no customer left behind” <a href="https://www.cohesity.com/product-roadmap-strategy/">product roadmap</a> in which “...all products will be supported for many years. Customers can migrate when and if they want, on their own schedule.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what we expect the new entity to provide:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transitional Arrangements&nbsp;– to ensure that all capabilities from the existing products remain available with the opportunity to mix and match between the two product ranges.&nbsp; No enforced customer migration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enhanced Capabilities:&nbsp;a unified portfolio that combines the best of both companies' technologies. These will likely be based around the Cohesity Data Cloud (CDC), to provide a unified interface and exploit the wide range of data connectors from Veritas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Global Reach and Support:&nbsp;With their combined resources, the new entity will be better positioned to provide support and expertise across regions and industries. This is particularly important for enterprises operating in highly regulated sectors such as healthcare, finance, and government.&nbsp;</p>
 Technology Advances to Watch For&nbsp; 
<p>The Cohesity-Veritas merger is not just a consolidation of market share but a bold move to accelerate technological advancements in data backup and recovery. Key innovations we anticipate include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI and Machine Learning for Data Resilience:&nbsp;Leveraging Cohesity’s AI-driven analytics and Veritas’s deep integration capabilities, the new entity is likely to push the boundaries of predictive and autonomous data recovery. This could minimize downtime and enhance ransomware recovery strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seamless Multi-Cloud Integration:&nbsp;As businesses increasingly adopt hybrid and multi-cloud environments, the combined expertise of Cohesity and Veritas will result in more robust and seamless cloud-native solutions, protecting data and data defined infrastructure in a common way across diverse environments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comprehensive Data Governance and Compliance:&nbsp;With increasing regulations on data protection and cyber resilience worldwide, the union offers an opportunity to deliver solutions to help organizations to meet and exceed their regulatory obligations.&nbsp;</p>
 Our Opinion&nbsp; 
<p>The union of Cohesity and Veritas is a transformative moment for the data protection and cyber resilience market. As the largest player in the market, the combined company has the power to set new standards, influence industry trends, and drive the next wave of innovation. For customers, this means access to unparalleled technology and expertise, though the path forward may ultimately require customers to adapt and align with new offerings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As dust settles on this announcement, one thing is clear: the data protection and cyber resilience market has forever changed, and we are just beginning to understand the full impact of this historic combination.&nbsp; Stay tuned and book now for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2025">EIC</a>&nbsp;in May 2025 to hear the latest news.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In today’s digital age, business verification has become crucial for ensuring trust and compliance in various industries. Verifying the legitimacy of business entities helps mitigate risks associated with fraud, money laundering, and other illicit activities. Effective business verification processes not only safeguard organizations but also build trust with customers and regulatory bodies.</p>



 The Importance of Business Verification 



<p>Business verification involves confirming the authenticity and legitimacy of business entities.

             December 2024   
	 
		 
			 Bitcoin Hits $100K: The Tokenization Tipping Point? 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>Last week, Bitcoin hits $100k!</p>
<p>This milestone, fueled by institutional adoption and a promising regulatory shift under new SEC Chair Paul Atkins, sets the stage for a transformative 2025 in onchain finance and tokenization. It is clear that institutional capital is going onchain, it is crucial to start bringing assets onchain now. The tokenization trend is inevitable.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			<p>But to reach that tipping point, we must overcome a few critical challenges.</p>
 Challenge 1: Lack of Actionable Data 
<p><br>
The Problem:<br>
Private assets often lack actionable data that allow all ecosystems to easily read the data of the tokens, such as Net Asset Value (NAV). Without this, other applications like data aggregators, distributors, and other service providers, can not provide accurate data to their audience.</p>
<p>The Solution:<br>
ERC-3643 is designed to solve this. With its built-in AssetID smart contracts, tokenized assets gain a unique onchain identity. Asset data (Asset type, NAV, ISIN, LEI, ESG ratings…) can be verified and directly linked to AssetID. This allows the ecosystem service providers to access verified asset information.</p>
 Challenge 2: Limited Accessibility 
<p><br>
The Problem:<br>
Despite the promise of tokenized RWAs, they remain out of reach for most investors. Take BlackRock’s tokenized money market fund, BUIDL, as an example. Its $454 million market cap in Ethereum is held by just 23 investors, with 40% owned by a single Web3 company. High minimum investments exclude smaller investors from participating. Many institutions are still hesitating to open their onchain products to retail investors. They are afraid of losing control and fail to enforce compliance.</p>
<p>The Solution:<br>
The ERC-3643 token standard enables issuers to tokenize more accessible financial products while maintaining full control and automated compliance. ERC-3643 tokens are permissioned tokens. They ensure issuers decide who can participate, and under what conditions, and even allow for token freezing or recovery. Issuers can scale by using this token standard and open onchain assets to smaller investors. The protocol has already been used many times to tokenize securities available to retail investors, such as open-ended public funds, or even with prospectus exemptions in Europe.</p>
 Challenge 3: Fragmented Liquidity 
<p><br>
The Problem:<br>
Secondary markets for RWAs remain siloed. Distributors can only offer assets within their isolated order books, leaving unmatched trades, inactive markets, and frustrated investors.</p>
<p>The Solution:<br>
Shared liquidity. Imagine all distributors leveraging a shared order book while retaining full control of their platforms and investor relationships. In the new era of tokenized assets, trading offers are universal. Investors publish a trading offer on one platform, and it is instantly visible across all others. Smart contracts ensure compliance by design: Onchain identity checks confirm the buyer’s eligibility, enforce transfer restrictions, and verify wallet balances. Unauthorized transactions are denied instantly. The best part is delivery vs payment enabling instant settlements. Trades are completed in seconds without counterparty risk or intermediaries, creating a seamless and risk-free experience.</p>
<p>This vision is no longer theoretical. ERC-3643 tokens, combined with the open liquidity protocol DINO, make it a reality. By sharing an onchain catalog of offers, blockchain has been turned into a giant marketplace.</p>
<p>But unlocking this potential requires collective action.</p>
 
 For asset issuers: Adopting the open source ERC-3643 standard ensures compliance and future interoperability. 
 For asset administrators: Defining their operating models to support seamless onchain operations. 
 For distributors: Connecting to the ERC-3643 catalog of tokens and starting managing onchain transactions. 
 
<p>At Tokeny, our mission is to provide the best in class tokenized assets orchestration platform and expertise for all stakeholders to thrive in this financial revolution, empowering institutions to upgrade finance, onchain.</p>
<p>Change is no longer optional, it’s an opportunity, let’s make 2025 a bull market for RWAs!</p>

  The Identity Fabric paradigm has established as the guiding principle for building modern Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) infrastructures. Since the introduction by KuppingerCole Analysts more than five years ago, many organizations have adopted this concept to streamline their IAM architecture, portfolio, and investments. With the newest release of the Identity Fabric, KuppingerCole Analysts provides an updated framework that not only reflects the evolution of IAM with respect to supported identity types and technologies, but also provides additional perspectives and layers to help organizations shape their own Identity Fabric for human and non-human identities. The Reference Architecture as second major framework of KuppingerCole Analysts adds more detail to the Identity fabric by going more into detail on IAM.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Matthias Reinwarth</a></p><p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) has long been the backbone of enterprise security. As digital transformation accelerates and compliance requirements grow more stringent, the need for a flexible, scalable, and future-proof IAM framework has never been more critical. This is where the [new KuppingerCole Identity Fabric](https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80978/the-2025-identity-fabric-and-iam-reference-architecture) comes into play - a holistic framework expertly designed to tackle these challenges head-on.</p>
<p>But why is a comprehensive IAM blueprint so important? According to recent data, only 40% of companies currently have a complete IAM blueprint in place, while 26.8% are in the process of developing one, and a concerning 33.1% have no blueprint at all. This gap highlights a significant vulnerability for many organizations, leaving them exposed to risks that could be mitigated with a well-defined IAM strategy. The Identity Fabric addresses this very issue by providing a structured, adaptable approach to IAM, ensuring that organizations not only close this gap but also stay ahead of future challenges.</p>
<p>Building on its successful design and widespread adoption, KuppingerCole analysts and advisors have recently finalized the [updated revision of the Identity Fabric for 2025](https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/an80978/the-2025-identity-fabric-and-iam-reference-architecture). This new version is not just a routine update; it is a carefully crafted evolution that leverages valuable feedback from the industry, incorporates insights and experiences from end-user organizations, and integrates the latest market and technology trends.</p>
<p>**Understanding the basics: What is the Identity Fabric?**</p>
<p>At its core, the Identity Fabric is a comprehensive framework for architecting, evolving, and modernizing IAM systems. It is essential for organizations looking to keep pace with the demands of their future challenges, ensure compliance with pertinent regulations and corporate security policies, and address changing business requirements. Identities are the cornerstone of cybersecurity frameworks, and the Identity Fabric offers a structured approach to managing them effectively.</p>
<p>The benefits of the Identity Fabric are multifaceted. It not only provides a robust high-level model for IAM but also ensures that systems are adaptable to future challenges. This adaptability is imperative as the digital landscape itself continues to evolve, bringing with it new threats and opportunities. The business value of the Identity Fabric lies in its ability to streamline IAM processes, reduce operational costs, and enhance the overall user experience.</p>
<p>**Applying the Identity Fabric: Why is it so useful?**</p>
<p>The Identity Fabric is not just a theoretical framework; it is a practical tool that can be applied across various IAM scenarios. Whether you are designing a new IAM platform or evolving an existing one, the Identity Fabric provides the entry point for a clear roadmap. Areas of application include:</p>
<p>1. **Strategy Definition for New IAM Platforms**: Implementing new IAM platforms requires more than just technical know-how, it demands a strategic vision. The Identity Fabric helps define long-term goals and ensures that the platform is built with future scalability in mind.<br>2. **Strategy Definition for Evolving IAM Platforms**: Just as new platforms need a strategic direction, so do existing systems undergoing transformation. The Identity Fabric guides the modernization process, ensuring that legacy platforms meet both current and future business requirements.<br>3. **Architecture Design for New IAM Platforms**: When building new IAM platforms, the Identity Fabric framework ensures a robust, scalable, and flexible architecture. This architecture can adapt to changing business needs and technological advancements, making it future proof.<br>4. **Architecture Design for Evolving IAM Platforms**: For organizations with legacy IAM systems, the Identity Fabric offers a pathway to modernization. By aligning older systems with the framework, businesses can enhance functionality and improve scalability without the need for a complete overhaul.<br>5. **Review and Analysis of Existing IAM Service Platforms**: To fully leverage the Identity Fabric, organizations must first understand their current state. Thorough reviews and analyses help identify gaps, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement, allowing the Identity Fabric to guide the necessary changes.<br>6. **Portfolio Management**: Effective IAM is not just about managing individual systems - it’s about managing a portfolio of services and solutions. The Identity Fabric ensures that all elements are aligned with business objectives and that resources are allocated efficiently.</p>
<p>**Evolving the Identity Fabric for 2025: A Sneak Peek**</p>
<p>The upcoming 2025 update to the Identity Fabric brings several exciting enhancements, each aimed at ensuring that the framework remains relevant in the face of both technological and business changes.</p>
<p>- **A Revision of the Conceptual Design**: The new Identity Fabric features a slightly updated conceptual design that encapsulates all relevant themes. The structure of the Fabric is more refined, looking at all types of identities, with all relevant IAM capabilities consolidated into IAM services and mapped to tools and market segments.<br>- **Integration with the IAM Reference Architecture**: One of the key enhancements in the 2025 update is the integration of the Identity Fabric with the existing IAM Reference Architecture. This ensures that the Reference Architecture is aligned within the Fabric context.<br>- **Development of Detailed Blueprints**: The 2025 update enables new applications of the Identity Fabric through deriving detailed, bespoke, and individualized detail identity fabrics. It is a two-tiered model, which aims to provide a structured framework for managing identity and access within different organizational contexts.</p>
<p>The Identity Fabric can be adjusted two levels of abstraction:</p>
<p>1. **Level 1: Master Identity Fabric (IF)** - This is the core framework designed to manage functions and services across various identity and access management (IAM) requirements. It acts as the central IAM blueprint applicable to a broad range of organizations.<br>2. **Level 2: Tailored Identity Fabrics per Business Model and/or Maturity Level** - At this level, the Master Identity Fabric is refined into more specific models to serve different organizational needs and maturity levels. These refined models serve as role models for other organizations and are designed to meet the distinct challenges and requirements of various industries.</p>
<p>This hierarchical approach allows for greater flexibility, ensuring that the Identity Fabric can be adapted to fit specific organizational contexts while maintaining a standard core framework.</p>
<p>**Looking Ahead: The Future of IAM**</p>
<p>The KuppingerCole Identity Fabric 2025 is more than just an update - it’s a significant development that prepares organizations for the future of IAM. By adopting this enhanced framework, businesses can ensure that their IAM systems are not only capable of meeting today’s challenges but are also ready for those of tomorrow. As identities continue to be at the core of cybersecurity, the Identity Fabric offers a clear path to resilience, adaptability, and long-term success.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for further information on the KuppingerCole Identity Fabric 2025, where these enhancements and more will be fully detailed, providing a cutting-edge framework for the next generation of IAM. For reference, see the [previous edition of our Leadership Compass on Identity Fabrics](https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/lc81426/identity-fabrics).</p>

 Discover the best free avatar generator that sets you a step ahead of others! Use your customisable 3D avatars to take advantage of tomorrow’s creator economy. 



 Why is Avatar Essential for Creators? 



<p>As technology evolves, we are getting closer to a world where a blend of virtual reality, augmented reality, sensorial tech and spatial computing can be experienced from the comfort of our couches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this new visual economy, avatars are essential to bridge virtual and physical worlds. They have not only taken up responsibilities of traditional human influencers but also performed better by eliminating risks associated with a real person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>No human influencer can be anywhere at any time, but avatars can. They have no scandals, no accidents, and tend to be more positively perceived by audiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many successful avatar influencers have popped up in the past five years. For example:</p>



 Hyper Realistic Instagram influencers&nbsp; 



<p>Do you know <a href="https://www.instagram.com/imma.gram/?hl=en">Imma</a>, the virtual influencer from Japan?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Known for her signature pink bob, she has over 389,000 followers on Instagram and has collaborated with global brands like Nike and Coach. Each year, Imma’s campaigns generate an estimated €600,000 revenue, crowning her as one of the most successful hyper realistic avatar influencers in the world.</p>



 Cartoon-style Vtubers 



<p><a href="https://unionavatars.com/vtuber-maker-avatar">Vtubers</a> usually do not imitate humans. Their characters are built around fantasies, adventures, and mythologies, helping audiences develop much more unique emotional attachments.</p>



<p>Take <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoSrY_IQQVpmIRZ9Xf-y93g">Gawr Gura</a> as an example, this shark-themed VTuber from <a href="https://hololivepro.com/en/">Hololive</a> has over 4.5 million YouTube subscribers. Her monthly earnings are estimated at $75,000, combining ad revenue, super chats, and merchandise sales.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vtuber is one of the fastest-growing virtual economy, with an annual growth rate estimated at 35.6% from 2024 to 2034.&nbsp;</p>







 How to Benefit from This Trend? 



<p>While the successes of virtual influencers are tempting, most of us do not have enough technology to build one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For independent creators, an easier way to get started is using a<a href="https://unionavatars.com"> free avatar generator</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After creating your avatar, it is important to identify the right market for your content. Make sure to target either the under-explored or rapidly expanding area of the market, so you are well-positioned to stand out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is an example:</p>



 The Rise of Gaming Avatars 



<p>The gaming industry is not new, but it has been growing exponentially since the pandemic. On average, gaming influencers can earn $4k – 5k per month. Some from the top tier can unlock over $100k for just one post they create.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2023,<a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/gen-z-teens-gaming.html"> over 80% of Gen Z have reported watching gaming content every once in a while</a>. The global game streaming market size was estimated at USD 9.8 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at an annual rate of 11.8% from 2024 to 2030.</p>



<p>Currently, gaming influencers are also exploring customisable characters to reinforce their brands. However, many free avatar generators do not provide a file format that makes your avatar compatible with multiple platforms, and many gaming platforms lack plug-ins for customisable avatars.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is why Union Avatars becomes the best free choice for any content creator eager to explore the budding game streaming market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The Best Free Avatar Generator 



<p>Union Avatars seamlessly integrates with major gaming platforms like Nifty Island and game engines like UE5. It is truly a go-to choice for gamers, developers, and content creators alike.&nbsp;</p>

 After three years, IDnow’s research project, Soteria has come to an end. Here, we share the findings and what it could mean for the future of personal data management. 



<p>Soteria, named after the goddess of safety and harm prevention, was a joint research project funded by the Horizon 2020 research and innovation program. Carried out in collaboration with 12 other European partners, the main aim of the project was to explore digital security and user privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Where does our personal data go?&nbsp; 



<p>Nowadays, many carry out the majority of&nbsp;their daily tasks online; managing bank accounts,&nbsp;accessing insurance details and even attending medical consultations to name but a few. Accessing these services requires the authentication of the user, which is facilitated by the transfer of personal data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As personal data invariably needs to be entered to access personal online services, this can be a frustrating experience for the user. How this personal data is collected, stored and used is often not clear to the user, nor the organization that requests the data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://fra.europa.eu/en/project/2015/fundamental-rights-survey">Fundamental Rights Survey</a>, which asked people about their views on sharing personal data, 55% said they feared that criminals or fraudsters could access their personal data, while 30% said they worried that advertisers, businesses and governments could access their information without them knowing.&nbsp;Unfortunately, there are currently no solutions on the market to enable users to take control and manage their data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These personal data have to be repeatedly completed to access to each service, which can be time-consuming for the citizens. In addition, the use of the personal data collected is most of the time not transparent for the citizen, as well as the organisations which have access to them.</p>



<p>For these reasons, more than 70% of the EU citizens have concerns about the online use of their personal data. Currently, there is no solution to allow users to take control and manage their data as they see fit.</p>



 Enter SOTERIA: a secure, privacy-friendly digital wallet. 



<p>In an attempt to address this issue, the SOTERIA project proposed the creation of a digital wallet that combined a digital identity, secured by high-level remote identity verification, with a data storage platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the course of three years, IDnow and its partners carried out the following:</p>



  Extensive consultation: 3,600 members of the public were surveyed to understand their expectations of data protection and digital wallets.&nbsp;  



  Development of a digital wallet prototype: The SOTERIA wallet includes advanced identity verification at account creation, limiting potential fraud and enabling users to authenticate themselves to access various online services and store certified information in the form of ‘verifiable credentials.’ Users can easily share this information with online service providers while retaining full control over the shared data, with the option of revoking access at any time.&nbsp;  



  Experimental security solutions: Several new tools to guarantee data security and protect users’ privacy were explored.&nbsp;  



  Integration with online voting and examination platforms: The wallet was integrated with online voting and examination platforms, demonstrating its effectiveness in connecting to services and storing documents like examination certificates, online voting receipts and health documents.&nbsp;  



  Large-scale pilots: We conducted tests with 1,200 members of the public in Austria, Romania and Spain, using the wallet for online exams and e-health services.&nbsp;  



  Feedback analysis: Feedback from users has shown that using the digital wallet enhances their sense of security and privacy when transacting online.&nbsp;  



<p>The SOTERIA wallet is user-centric, accessible to all, and requires no specific IT skills. It protects the privacy of European citizens and gives them full control over their data, ensuring that only the data needed to access a service is shared with the service provider.</p>



<blockquote><p>The results of this project will enable IDnow to adapt its solutions to offer an eIDAS 2.0 compliant digital wallet.</p>Noémi Thomazo, Research Project Manager at IDnow.</blockquote>
