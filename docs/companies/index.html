<p>This week’s roundup of the top FindBiometrics stories touches on a wide range of topics, covering everything from health passes to the future of the access control market. We also have details about an upcoming webinar, and the latest talking points in the ongoing debate surrounding facial recognition.</p>



  



<p>To kick things off, Thales argued that airports and airlines should be using digital health passes to facilitate safe travel in the wake of COVID-19. The company specifically advocated for the use of biometric self-service kiosks and mobile apps, the latter of which can be used to store health and vaccination credentials:</p>

<p>On the access control front, Fact.MR has released a new report that predicts that the demand for electronic access control systems will climb to $21.2 billion by 2031. The firm suggested that the market will be particularly interested in contactless biometric solutions in the years ahead:</p>



<p><a href="https://findbiometrics.com/electronic-access-control-market-solid-growth-next-decade-report-707021/">Electronic Access Control Market to See Solid Growth Over Next Decade: Report</a></p>



<p>In more controversial news, the Government Accountability Office has confirmed that six federal agencies used facial recognition to identify protesters after the police murder of George Floyd. The agencies acknowledged that the scans could inform criminal investigations, which once again raised civil rights concerns about state surveillance and potential racial bias in the public use of biometric identification systems:</p>

<p>Finally, IDEMIA and FindBiometrics have released an on-demand webinar that addresses best practices and potential applications of Mobile ID technology. The panel is hosted by FindBiometrics Editor in Chief Peter Counter, and features a trio of experts from the IDEMIA identity team:</p>

<p>Security and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/brazil-tests-idemias-biometric-passenger-processing-tech-domestic-air-shuttle-service-061701/">identity solutions company IDEMIA</a>&nbsp;is celebrating a new milestone with the announcement of the 11 millionth enrollment for the PreCheck expedited screening program.</p>



  



<p>The Transportation Security Administration’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/five-more-airlines-join-tsas-precheck-program-081401/">TSA PreCheck program</a> allows eligible passengers to use IDEMIA’s technology to register their personal and biometric information prior to going to the airport in order to facilitate a faster check-in process. </p>



<p>In doing so, PreCheck participants are able to move through various airport security checkpoints faster than non-program members, with the TSA claiming that 94 percent of PreCheck participants are able to pass through their designated lanes — which currently number at more than 450 lanes in over 200 airports around the US — in under five minutes.</p>



<p>PreCheck members are also not required to remove their shoes, belts, 3-1-1 liquids, food or light jackets, while children under the age of 12 years old are able to join a parent or guardian in a dedicated lane.</p>



<p>IDEMIA’s more than 440 enrollments centers, along with various pop-up enrollment events located throughout the United States, have helped support the growth of the TSA PreCheck program and boost its total enrollment numbers to help it get to 11 million.</p>



<p>“The 11 million enrollment milestone exemplifies IDEMIA’s continued success and commitment in passenger facilitation solutions,” said Donnie Scott, CEO of IDEMIA I&amp;S North America. “In the midst of the ongoing trend of increased air travel, IDEMIA aims to increase enrollments and help travelers prepare for their next airport experience at one of our enrollment facilities or at our pop-up enrollment events.”</p>

<p><a href="https://worldline.com/content/worldline/en/home.html">Worldine</a> has integrated <a href="https://www.a3bc.org/">A3BC</a>’s (Anything Anywhere Anytime Biometric Connection) authentication tech into its own Worldline Authentication platform. A3BC is a French FinTech that offers fingerprint and finger vein recognition, and stores its biometric data on a private server in a manner that is compliant with the latest GDPR data protection regulations.</p>



  



<p>Worldline Authentication, meanwhile, supports fingerprint and PIN-based verification. It can also use those biometric and knowledge-based authenticators to link a device to its proper owner, thereby delivering an additional, device-based authentication factor. As a result, the joint Worldline and A3BC solution will be able to authenticate users through possession and inherence, relying on smartphone ownership and finger biometrics, respectively.</p>



<p>The new solution seems to be designed primarily for the financial sector, insofar as it can be used to verify someone’s identity when completing a transaction. A3BC participated in Worldline’s third e-Payments Challenge in September, which tasked competitors to come up with innovative solutions to problems facing existing Worldline clients. OneVisage was the winner of an earlier Challenge, and its solution would eventually be integrated into a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-worldline-debut-pay-by-face-system-new-york-010601/">Worldline naked payments system</a> that relies on facial recognition.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://mobileidworld.com/fraud-rates-up-60-during-covid-19-pandemic-says-jumio-401051/">Fraud is on the rise</a> due to the pandemic,” said Worldline Global Product Manager of Authentication Services Claire Deprez-Pipon. “We are now able to add a new layer of security with no friction into Worldline Trusted Authentication and other solutions. It opens new doors to facilitate an even better customer experience and authentication from any device.”</p>



<p>In other news, Worldline recently acquired 80 percent of Axepta Italy, and has now entered into a commercial partnership with the country’s BNL banking group as part of the deal. In that regard, BNL will help Worldline distribute its various payment products to potential customers. Wordline has previously <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/gemalto-worldline-card-onboarding-104084/">partnered with Gemalto</a> to improve the utility of mobile wallets.</p>

<p>In a move that shows the confidence the automotive industry has in the further integration of biometric technology into vehicles, iconic American brand Jeep has revealed that it is exploring a variety of features for future vehicles, including biometric facial recognition.</p>



  



<p>As a part of parent company Stellantis’ EV Day 2021, Jeep made the announcement that its popular 4xe brand — which includes its flagship Wrangler series of SUVs — will continue to move toward going electric, with the Grand Cherokee 4xe next in the line of Jeeps to do so as it will be a gas/electric hybrid release.</p>



<p>According to a recent report from <a href="https://www.slashgear.com/jeep-4xe-roadmap-includes-ev-suvs-drones-and-autonomous-off-roading-08681687/">SlashGear</a>, the Wrangler 4xe (which has been on sale in Europe and US since late 2020), has been a success with all orders for the remainder of 2021 having already been filled.</p>



<p>With its eyes to the future, Jeep also stated that it expects 70 percent of all of its vehicle sales to be of the electric variety, while also teasing autonomous drones and biometric features for future releases.</p>



<p>The company highlighted the use of biometric facial recognition as a means of both accessing and powering future vehicles, with the increasingly popular tech potentially being integrated into the activation system for the drivetrain.</p>



<p>The market for biometric systems in the automotive industry has been seeing rapid growth in recent years. A September 2020 Market Analyst Report&nbsp;on Automotive Biometrics from Goode Intelligence predicted that the revenue for biometrics in the industry <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/goode-intelligence-forecasts-booming-automotive-biometrics-market-092407/">will rise to $560 million</a> by the year 2026.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time Jeep has shown confidence in biometric authentication for its vehicles. In 2015, Jeep’s release of that year’s Jeep Wrangler was the <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/archive/new-jeep-to-pioneer-iris-scanning-driver-authentication-3251/">first commercially available</a> automobile to incorporate the EyeLock ID iris scanning authentication system.</p>

 From Zero History to Storied Value: Securing and Unlocking the Art and Antiquities Markets With the Mattereum Protocol <p>The global fine art and antiquities trade is struggling with combating fraud and creating a more sustainable business model. To showcase the utility of the Mattereum Protocol in this space, we have vaulted, passported, and tokenized three distinct artifacts, securing their provenance and trade so their storied value is never&nbsp;lost.</p><p>A story goes that the eccentric master painter Salvador Dalí would — in lieu of paying his restaurant bill with cash — draw a quick sketch on a napkin or one-dollar bill to hand to the staff instead. While this can be seen as certainly odd (true to form) or perhaps even rude (doesn’t help pay the waiter’s bills), one thing is certain: Dalí’s personal brand was and still is capable of a strange alchemy of turning a mundane material into an object of historical and cultural&nbsp;value.</p><p>Which begs the question: If the story of a thing is essential to its value, how do we chronicle this story? How do we ensure that a Dalí piece doesn’t become separated from its history, and consequently, it’s value? Not only for fine art, but for all manner of cultural artifacts?</p><p>The caretakers and curators of works of art, who are often wary of incorporating new technologies into their practice, are struggling with combating fraud and creating a more sustainable business model around their stock. To work, the solution must be designed with the realities and particularities of their profession in&nbsp;mind.</p><p>Enter Mattereum</p><p>To showcase the utility of the Mattereum Protocol in the global art and antiquities trade, Mattereum Head of Ontology and former museum curator Dr. James Hester acquired three different cultural artifacts to be vaulted, passported, and tokenized:</p>  A 350,000 year-old stone hand axe excavated from&nbsp;France  A 19th-20th century bronze statue of Buddhist protector deity&nbsp;Acala  A signed and numbered etching by Dalí&nbsp;himself  <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/2">https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/2</a><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/1">https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/1</a><a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/0">https://opensea.io/assets/0x1c347c8af4ad73411cec7d05c2ea1a17b4597e76/0</a><p>The Mattereum Protocol leverages an integrated legal and software system consisting of three main components: Mattereum Asset Passports, Trust Communities, and Real-World Asset&nbsp;Tokens.</p><p>(For a more detailed guide of the protocol, we highly recommend referring to the <a href="https://mattereum.com/2021/04/01/mattereum-product-walkthrough/">Mattereum Product Walkthrough</a>.)</p><p>Let’s walk through how these three objects were onboarded onto this system. By doing so, we will also unpack the value propositions for the $60 billion fine art and antiquities market.</p> Asset Passports: Securing Identity and Provenance <p>In short, an Asset Passport is a bundle of legal warranties tied to an object. While these warranties can vary with the object in question, the initial warranty is often some form of identification (with core data points provided by the owner, such as vaulting&nbsp;status).</p><p>Other warranties that may accompany an asset may include a reference to the particular tagging system used for in-person authentication of the item (such as scannable NFC chips affixed to the object) or the token smart contract if the object has been tokenized and “uploaded” to an NFT marketplace.</p><p>For example, the warranties tied to the passported and tokenized etching of Dali’s “Le fuite de Satan” (The Flight of Satan) can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/mtrm.ph.dali.fuitesatan.1974.129773.3.20/#02_NFT">here</a>:</p><p>Using the Ricardian framework designed by Mattereum Chief Scientist Ian Grigg, all of the legal and digital agreements around these objects are bundled together, signed on the blockchain and stored on IPFS, establishing a secure record of provenance.</p><p>In practice, the Asset Passport aggregates warranties and object data using established best practices. Designed by a former museum curator, experts in the field will appreciate the attention to detail that goes into generating these passports. The dispute resolution and insurance baked in also provides peace of mind for professionals outside&nbsp;crypto.</p><p>It is important to note that the Asset Passport is not a singular or static thing, but an integrated structure composed of software and legal elements which will evolve over time along the object’s journey: a living document.</p><p>An incredible utility of an asset passport is in its composability, the capability of programming value flows and social interactions around the object. Let’s take a look at what we can build on this foundation.</p> Trust Communities: Crowdsourcing Expert Certification <p>In 2018, the Terrus museum in Southern France discovered that over half of its collection — around $190,000 worth — were in fact forgeries.</p><p><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/fake-art-france-culture-spd">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/fake-art-france-culture-spd</a></p><p>Unfortunately, stories like this are common in the arts and antiquities world. The sophistication of forgery has only improved over time, and institutions are having to adapt their practice accordingly with methods such as chemical analysis. But despite best efforts, if there is even the slightest chink in the armor, the system will remain vulnerable.</p><p>The prevailing method for certifying fine art and antiquities is a disconnected, patchwork process of consulting specialist firms with data logged in separate silos around the world. This lack of a shared inventory database presents a fundamental flaw at the infrastructure level. There is no single source of truth or a collective means of aggregating this data over time. Until&nbsp;now.</p><p>Once an Asset Passport has been generated, it can give rise to some interesting applications: such as Trust Communities, a peer-produced, decentralized alternative to centralized expert certification that elegantly brings assets from zero history to storied value with built-in legal warranties, insurance, and dispute resolution.</p>Trust Communities<p>By bringing together multiple third-party sources of information on objects, it is possible for an object’s Asset Passport to contain several independent assessments of its authenticity, provenance, and condition. This would enable buyers to get a broader perspective not limited to centralized firms. Experts can also hold each other to account to safeguard against erroneous claims. Through this distributed framework of crowdsourcing expertise, trust becomes a feature powered by community, not simply a risk to be mitigated.</p><p>To further secure this peer-produced, multiplayer approach, all expert certification is backed by a legal warranty as well as financial stake, adding weight to an expert’s assessment. Even if they are not employed by one of the main firms (and wouldn’t this be great for former curators to leverage their experience?), the fact that these experts are willing to put skin in the game and put their own money behind their assessments will not be overlooked by serious curators and collectors.</p><p>The Trust Communities model can aggregate individual expertise with institutional expertise over time, allowing an unprecedented level of trust in the trade of these objects and an ongoing revenue stream for curators, caretakers, and other professionals in the&nbsp;field.</p> NFTs: Bringing Liquidity to Static Inventories <p>In many cases, most of a gallery’s assets are not on display for the public but rather secured in vaults on location or somewhere else entirely. In this state, these objects cannot generate any value. They remain illiquid, static&nbsp;stock.</p><p>Enter Physical Asset&nbsp;NFTs.</p><p>A Physical Asset NFT is a unique digital token that denotes the right to take physical delivery of an object. While sharing features with the NFTs now gaining popularity in the cultural mainstream in the creative industries, these tokens are different in that they are backed by an actual object, complete with warranties, insurance, and legal enforceability.</p><p>Turning the NFT into an actual warranty claim within the Asset Passport allows it to denote true ownership of an underlying good in a systemic way rather than what would amount to a mere promise by a stranger on the Internet. The token contract becomes a fundamental part of the deal, with execution of the agreement now deferred to the smart contract. Also, in the case of systemic fallout (software exploits on the protocol or application level) the legal agreement within the passport provides a source of truth for all parties and arbitrators to refer&nbsp;to.</p><p>NFTs connected to an Asset Passport allow any vaulted object to become a liquid, globally-tradable asset. Like the aforementioned <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/mattereum-fine-art-and-antiquities-collection-warr">artifact collection</a> now live on&nbsp;OpenSea:</p>Live on the OpenSea Marketplace<p>The ease through which these NFTs can be traded allows for truly liquid ownership of otherwise static stock, opening access to cultural capital and providing museums and galleries with a compelling new business&nbsp;model.</p> From Zero History to Storied&nbsp;Value <p>It is our hope that by taking these objects through the full Mattereum Protocol — from assigning an Asset Passport, to vaulting in a secure art storage facility, to generating an NFT to be sold online — dealers and galleries will see how this new technology can benefit their own work and adopt it is an industry standard for the global inventory management of cultural artifacts</p><p>With blockchain-based cryptographic authentication and tokenization of physical assets with built-in legal guarantees, the Mattereum Protocol can resolve the fear, uncertainty, and doubt that has plagued the fine art and antiquities markets for generations.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/from-zero-history-to-storied-value-securing-and-unlocking-the-art-and-antiquities-markets-with-355e1c3c318">From Zero History to Storied Value: Securing and Unlocking the Art and Antiquities Markets With…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Building Civic Tech: A new frontier of our&nbsp;work <p>This is the fourth in a series of DM notes that we write about the insights from our work on the ground, which follows internal learning sessions called the DM Downloads that are organized every two weeks or so. The aim is to make our practice more legible, for us as well as for&nbsp;you.</p><p>DM Note #4 is a reflection on a new frontier of our work: civic technology development, or how to make things in a complex&nbsp;world.</p> DM’s trajectory: becoming practical strategists and experimental developers <p>When Dark Matter Labs started in 2016, <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/">our provocation page</a> presenting various visions around the future of civic infrastructures was the core of what we did, which made many people believe we were essentially a think tank. We are not not that, but we are a lot more too, especially as we grew and started crafting these civic infrastructures that we had first only imagined with various partners around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Today, Dark Matter Labs is building a sort of ship, whose form and parts are being imagined, designed and assembled around the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>Sometimes, we start by making the systems we work with visible in order to analyse the pain points, underlying drivers and strategic risks of each domain. We build portfolios of experiments to show all the various interconnected ways we could intervene in that system. Out of all of them, we identify the experimental probes to which we can best contribute and work from these starting points to develop and iterate the best initiatives for the targeted domain as well as learn from the system we intervene in.</p><p>Most of our work fall into shared civic infrastructure missions (nature based solutions, spatial justice, mental wealth, etc.) around which we organize internally, in order to maximize our shared value internationally. And beyond each initiative and mission are the shared deep code innovations that we are designing across finance, contracting, data, policy, governance and&nbsp;more.</p><p>This is the dark matter our name refers to; the invisible structures responsible for producing the majority of the environment around&nbsp;us.</p><p>At that point of the process, our focus shifts from system overview to minimal viable products (MVP), which requires a totally different mindset, posture and process, to rediscover how systems work by now acting within them. This last part is a new frontier for us. It raises questions internally such&nbsp;as:</p>  How do we go from from system change mapping to&nbsp;MVP?  How does this fit within and change our current practices?  What is our added value in this sphere globally?  What are the challenges with the rest of our work (different business model, ways of working,&nbsp;etc.)?   Civic technology development at&nbsp;DML <p>During our DM download on civic technology development, we discussed the need to build the right thing, as well as building the thing right. That is to say: making sure we are setting up partnerships, projects and explorations as places to answer key, difficult questions (as opposed to making a thing our research and modelling tell us we need to make). We talked about how this currently requires an organisational transition as opposed to purely looking at how to set up teams to build digital products. It is a mindset shift that we‘ll have to&nbsp;embrace.</p><p>The complex future states, theories and potential answers that we have been communicating to you in blogs and reports are just a starting point for us. We use these starting points to explore, test and iteratively build products/systems, based on the insights we gather as we go. And we’re not precious about whether our original theory was right as long as we achieve the outcome we desire. We look for commonalities that make our products/systems scalable and transferrable.</p><p>You’ve been reading about our theories and provocations in blogs. More and more, you’ll be able to see how we experiment with them and reshape them until they become actual things that you can see in the world around&nbsp;you.</p> What we are learning from some of the civic technologies in the&nbsp;making <p>Proof of concept or proof of possibility, prototype, experimental probe, pilot, MVP — what’s in a name? We are still exploring which methods of testing and developing are best suited for the kind of work we want to accomplish, and so these terms are being used here loosely for the moment. While we clarify our own glossary of terms. Y<a href="https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/proof-of-concept-prototype-pilot-mvp-whats-in-a-name/">ou can find how Nesta defines them&nbsp;here</a>.</p> Futurefit — Proof of&nbsp;concept <p>This body of work looks at how we can encourage more collective forms of retrofit and energy efficiency measures, as a vehicle for Covid recovery and a more just, democratic climate transition</p><p>One of the key challenges of retrofit is a distinct lack of open and available building data — both in terms of basic information and in its energy performance. Here our ambition was to make an early proof of concept for an open retrofit data map, combining and cleaning existing public datasets, to show potential places for focus in a retrofit&nbsp;scheme.</p><p>Rather than viewing this as a top-down analytical tool, the aim was to give citizens more information about their buildings, and create a first step in encouraging the self-selection of groups of residents to upgrade their homes. Alongside this process we outlined a new collective service model for a multi-family apartment block to be able to retrofit their homes, reimagining the role of the administration de condominio could play in facilitating this&nbsp;process.</p><p>We’re currently working on the potential next steps of this tool with the Comune di&nbsp;Milano.</p> Nouveaux voisins — Prototype +&nbsp;Pilot <p>Building a platform to facilitate socio-ecological transitions and community-based climate action in private&nbsp;yards</p><p>We worked with <a href="https://www.nouveauxvoisins.org/">Nouveaux voisins / New Neighbors</a> to develop the prototype of a platform bringing together different functions (pedagogical, actionable, evaluational, financial, regulatory, etc.) to support and accelerate this socio-ecological transition through the aggregation of residential and commercial yards. Many of the functions were inspired by their pilot projects on the&nbsp;ground.</p><p>What we are learning by doing so&nbsp;far:</p>  Doing completely analog pilot projects, no matter how small, can help inform the sort of civic infrastructure required to support a broader movement and scaling model for the initiative (see example below from Nouveaux&nbsp;voisins)  No matter how detailed your complex paper prototype is, moving it toward a minimum viable product requires to take a step back and test many assumptions in order to move from what felt like a complex integrated platform to what seems like a very basic one. And that’s&nbsp;ok.   Amsterdam CE — Experimental probe + pilot (in progress) <p>Understanding and unfolding existing legal structure of Dutch law and visualizing the articles and different connections to make them more transparent and easier to understand. With goal to make it easier for lawmakers to make the needed change and transition towards a just circular economy in effective time.</p><p>One of the aims of this initiative is to make laws and their articles to be machine readable and indexable, so it can be easier for lawmakers to see connections and people associated with each law. We are also exploring the needed culture and way of working to use and maintain the tool and its&nbsp;data.</p><p>Learning about the system by trying to change it through an experimental probe of what could be is the stage we are at&nbsp;here.</p><p>What we are learning by doing so&nbsp;far:</p>  Laws are tend to be complex and nuanced, it is difficult to label and index to a particular category. We have a created a decision tree to add the needed structure and using degrees and threshold measures to encode the minute&nbsp;details  A regulatory dashboard is only one tool towards a broader cultural shift in how the administration functions, it cannot stand&nbsp;alone  This is not the kind of project that can be done all at once; it requires a team to develop it iteratively to maintain&nbsp;it   TreesAI — MVP (in progress) <p><a href="https://treesasinfrastructure.com/">Trees as Infrastructure</a> establishes nature as a critical part of urban infrastructure, alongside bridges, roads and rail, enabling investment, profitability and sustainability.</p><p>Currently trees and urban nature are just seen as maintenance costs in city budget sheets. We are trying to establish urban nature’s true value in terms of all the benefits they bring and their associated financial value so they can be maintained systematically.</p><p>What we are learning by doing so&nbsp;far:</p>  We better understand which data parameters are needed to give accurate calculations of tree benefits, and cities have completely different data landscape.  There is big need for data informed decision making when it comes to nature based solutions  Cities lack the budget and capacity to create and maintain the needed digital civic infrastructure required  There is an abundance of existing open source tools, however the challenge is how to integrate them best to our needs and for the long term without reinventing the&nbsp;wheel  Open source project does not mean that you just plug and play with it for your needs; it requires significant work and skill capacity in order to adapt it to the intended&nbsp;use   Moving Forward — Key Questions <p>As DM moves into the development of key civic technologies such as the ones presented above, it will require not only that we organize differently internally, but that we also work collaboratively internationally around some of the key following questions:</p>  Because they will need to exist outside the specific domain of market and state, how do you preserve the public good independently of where the capital comes from? How do we subordinate capital to the governance for public&nbsp;good?  Public investments for this work are typically focused on what exactly is needed to do be accomplished. However, many of the challenges we face are too complex to know how to address them at the outset. How do we invent investment mechanisms for the discovery of the public good as we&nbsp;go?  We need very clear do no harm principles of how these civic technologies are developed, used, what frameworks they create and what the implications are. How do we do&nbsp;that?  It has been shown how many AI technologies replicate the biases from the data it was based out of. If we want more power in the hands of communities, how do we create UX and transparency to avoid creating unconscious biases in the behavioural economics it&nbsp;creates?  Maintenance of civic tech when it doesn’t have the security of the state of large private investment is a big challenge. How do we create open and transparent maintenance friendly tech without increasing rent seeking infrastructures for private&nbsp;capital?  How do we insure the sustainability and longevity of these services outside traditional institutional models of&nbsp;support?  How can we be open and declarative assumptions &amp; references so as to create the hypothesis that the decision making can be interrogated and challenged and create accountability for stakeholders?  How do we construct new frameworks of accountability to all stakeholders, both future and&nbsp;present.  How do we build civic tech with open unitary modular blocks of value, adopting a modular design principle in which we subdivide a future system into smaller parts, which can and should be independently created, modified, replaced, or exchanged with other modules or between different systems.

<p>Kenya’s national insurance agency is preparing to phase out insurance cards in favor of fingerprint biometrics. Moving forward, members of the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) will no longer be able to present an NHIF or national identity card, and will instead be expected to verify their identities with a fingerprint recognition scan.</p>



  



<p>The new system will go into effect on July 11, at which point members will need to have registered their biometric information in order to file claims and receive insurance coverage. Those interested can register their fingerprints at NHIF service centers, or at participating hospitals throughout Kenya.</p>



<p>According to the NHIF, the new biometric identification requirement will help cut down on insurance fraud, which was a problem under the old card-based system. The fingerprints are being introduced in conjunction with a new electronic claims system that will eliminate the need for manual claims processing as part of a broader digital transformation.</p>



<p>The NHIF itself currently has 8.9 million members, as well as an unspecified number of dependents. The organization is hoping that the new system will be more efficient than the old one, and reduce the amount of time needed to handle each individual claim.</p>



<p>GenKey previously <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/archive/genkey-kenya-biometric-health-card-28311/">supplied the NHIF with a biometric health card</a> back in 2015. However, the latest announcement did not have any information about the NHIF’s technology provider for the new fingerprint authentication system. The government of Kenya has been trying to launch a national biometric identification program, though the country’s courts <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-kenyas-national-biometric-id-program-delayed-high-court-020301/">suspended the project in early 2020</a> to give lawmakers time to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-new-biometric-hiv-identification-system-ready-111901/">pass anti-discrimination legislation</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.trulioo.com/">Trulioo</a> has added four new companies to its client roster in Europe. The news will advance the identity provider’s ongoing expansion efforts on the continent.</p>



  



<p>The four new customers are PayDo, Pollen Technologies, Sokin, and XanderPay, all four of which are payment providers in some capacity. <a href="https://www.paydo.com/">PayDo</a> offers e-wallet services for businesses and individual customers, while <a href="https://www.pollentechnologies.com/">Pollen</a> is a white label banking platform and <a href="https://sokin.net/">Sokin</a> allows customers to make payments internationally. Finally, <a href="https://www.xanderpay.com/">XanderPay</a> is a specialist that provides payment services tailored to hotels.</p>



<p>Trulioo, meanwhile, is trying to ramp up its operations after bringing in a whopping $394 million in a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/trulioo-becomes-tech-unicorn-after-394m-series-d-706072/">recent round of Series D funding</a>. That money pushed Trulioo to unicorn status, and the company is now hoping to capitalize on that to drum up more business overseas. The company will also use the money to increase the size of its staff, and plans to raise the headcount by 300 percent at its offices in Dublin, Ireland.</p>



<p>“Payments providers grapple with facilitating cross-border transactions while meeting ever changing regulatory requirements,” said Trulioo CEO Steve Munford. “Turning to our expertise in global identity verification helps deliver frictionless customer onboarding for real-time payments, fueling the digital economy.”</p>



<p>Trulioo will provide its new customers with identity verification services, which will help them comply with international Know Your Customer requirements. The company is best known for its GlobalGateway solution, which can verify someone’s identity with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/trulioo-philippines-507251/">selfie biometrics</a>. The solution will also check phone records, credit bureaus, and other data sources to analyze risk and provide customers with a higher level of identity assurance.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Trulioo has been making inroads in other parts of the world beyond Europe. GlobalGateway <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/trulioo-brings-globalgateway-pakistan-091103/">debuted in Pakistan</a> last September, before <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/trulioo-brings-globalgateway-services-kenya-062305/">making its way to Kenya</a> in June. Trulioo has argued that biometric security can help financial institutions deal with the <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/trulioo-advises-financial-apps-boost-security-fight-covid-19-fraud-072303/">higher rates of fraud in the wake of COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://directory.findbiometrics.com/listings/integrated-biometrics/">Integrated Biometrics</a> (IB) has entered into a strategic partnership with <a href="https://www.sciometrics.com/">Sciometrics</a>. Moving forward, the two companies will be working together to advance the development of contactless fingerprint biometrics on mobile devices.</p>



  



<p>The goal is to make contactless fingerprint authentication interoperable with more traditional touch-based databases. In plain terms, that means that Sciometrics and IB would be able to match a fingerprint captured with a high-resolution smartphone camera to a print that was captured with a legacy touch scanner.</p>



<p>The joint solution will draw on Sciometrics’ Slapshot API in addition to IB’s expertise with fingerprint scanners. The Slapshot API allows people to take a photo of their finger with a smartphone camera to capture a print. IB’s physical scanners, meanwhile, are FBI-certified, and have been deployed for <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/kojak-biometric-scanner-finds-fujitive-laredo-border-080406/">border control</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/french-police-use-integrated-biometrics-scanners-identify-disaster-victims-092304/">relief efforts</a>, amongst <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/nigeria-uses-integrated-biometrics-scanners-power-bank-identification-system-020907/">other applications</a>.</p>



<p>IB will be marketing Slapshot through the new arrangement, and indicated that the development partnership will eventually lead to the release of new contactless solutions. The two companies are also hoping that their work will inform the creation of new NIST and FBI standards for contactless scanners that need to work with legacy systems.</p>



<p>“IB sees contactless fingerprint identity as an emerging and exciting modality,” said&nbsp;IB CEO Steve Thies. “We believe our collaboration will provide our customers globally the ability to expand their identity capabilities using their fleets of smartphones.”</p>



<p>“This strategic development agreement speaks to IB’s commitment to add the best contactless identity to their portfolio, and to supporting their customers with legacy contact databases as the technology advances,” added Sciometrics President&nbsp;Mark Walch.</p>



<p>Sciometrics has been <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/sciometrics-nist-contactless-fingerprint-306094/">working with the NIST</a> to develop contactless matching standards since 2016. For its part, IB argued that a contactless smartphone solution would make it easier for customers to identify people while in the field, since they would no longer need to carry a dedicated capture device. Until then, IB has tried to make its scanners safer through the use of an <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/integrated-biometrics-coats-fingerprint-scanners-with-nbd-nanos-antimicrobial-solution-060107/">antimicrobial coating from NBD Nanotechnologies</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow</a> will help guide the development of digital identity standards in Europe as the latest member of the IDunion network. As an organization, the <a href="https://idunion.org/?lang=en">IDunion</a> is an advocate for decentralized identity management, and works to create an open ecosystem that will allow European citizens to take advantage of digital identities in their day-to-day lives.</p>



  



<p>As a member of the network, IDnow will be particularly focused on digital wallets. The company is currently working on a solution that would allow people to store a digital identity in a secure wallet on their smartphone. That wallet could then be unlocked through the use of device biometrics (either face or fingerprint recognition) should the holder ever need to prove their identity to a third party. The wallet gives individuals more control over their personal information, in a manner that is <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idnow-achieves-eidas-substantial-level-assurance-latest-autoident-biometric-authentication-solution-112305/">compliant with the latest eIDAS regulations</a>.</p>



<p>IDnow will be modifying its solution to ensure that it is also compatible with the IDunion’s standards moving forward. According to those standards, a good digital identity solution needs to be convenient and cost-effective in addition to being secure, with a strong emphasis on privacy and consumer rights.</p>



<p>“We are excited to play a key role in shaping the future of digital identities in&nbsp;Europe, and looking forward to working together on secure and economical solutions,” said IDnow Co-founder and Technology Managing Director&nbsp;Armin Bauer. “The introduction of a digital identity solution is an important and necessary step for&nbsp;Europe. We now need to think about a unified infrastructure.”</p>



<p>The news is in keeping with IDnow’s prior <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/idnow-becomes-latest-member-fido-alliance-091904/">standards work with organizations like the FIDO Alliance</a>, and with various <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/regulatory-change-opens-door-selfie-id-germany-idnow-74202104/">European regulatory agencies</a>. The company has noted that the demand for digital identity solutions has <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idnow-sees-1000-increase-in-selfie-authentications-during-2020-906242/">increased during the COVID-19 pandemic</a>, and has been working to build its portfolio through the <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/wirecard-acquisition-support-idnows-selfie-biometrics-services-090104/">acquisitions of Wirecard</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idnow-to-acquire-fellow-biometric-onboarding-specialist-ariadnext-706301/">ARIADNEXT</a>.</p>

<p>Lack of great user experiences is often raised as one of decentralized identity’s (and public blockchain’s) missing ingredients for ubiquitous adoption. However to arrive at usable experiences across the industry, we first need to reach consensus around basic user personas and mental models, then design and build interoperable system accordingly.</p><p>In “<a href="https://medium.com/universal-identity/the-internets-missing-identity-layer-3934b23b6c22">the internet’s missing identity layer</a>” we took a stab at an acceptable set of personas and solution criteria for this self described identity&nbsp;system.</p><p>In “<a href="https://medium.com/universal-identity/the-economics-of-identity-systems-98ac08a60a18">Economics of identity systems</a>” we also observed how users already interact with identity concepts in their day-to-day economic activities, and the artifacts they use as tools to accomplish them.</p><p>This article explores the different aspects of how a typical user understands concepts related to identity through the use of economic, cognitive, and design lenses, as well as through historical observation and application of first principles.</p> Summary <p>No typical human explicitly understand abstract terms like “identity”. They may intuitively understand some well-defined concepts without ability to articulate what they are, while other terms they will understand explicitly. We start by defining a few abstract terms such as digital identity, identity systems, social contexts, etc and move on to more explicitly understood terms.</p><p>As a result of exploring a typical user’s mental models of identity-related concepts, and historical patterns of human economic activities, we identify more innate concepts such as self-identities, perceived identities, accounts, conversations, messages, etc.</p><p>We then explore how multiple identities play a part of a user’s cognitive understanding of their place within multiple social contexts as well as task-based contexts with anonymous and pseudonymous identities.</p><p>Then we explore how identity-related tools and artifacts have historically been used and understood by people, including how they use artifacts that function as IDs, credentials, and/or keys, as well as how for managing large numbers of artifacts we use complementary organization and storage&nbsp;tools.</p><p>Building systems and applications that operate based on concepts parallel to a typical user’s mental models, will inherently result in better user experiences, as well as more intuitive understanding of underlying processes.</p> Definitions <p>As explained in “<a href="https://medium.com/universal-identity/what-identity-means-e998291668f9">What identity means</a>” the word “identity” is overloaded on many levels. Few regular users understand abstract words like identity, authentication, credentials, or authorization. So here, let’s reiterate the key terms and concepts that will be reused throughout this article to discuss users’ consciously or subconsciously understanding.</p><p>Identity systems — The identity industry is built upon the building, maintaining and usage of identity systems, that ultimately help us be more efficient and secure our daily transactions against undesired outcomes.</p><p>Identity instances — Any virtual representation of persons or organizations in any system be they digital, paper-based, or&nbsp;mental.</p><p>Cognitive realm — The sometimes oversimplified approach of looking at our cognition as systems and processes, can result in valuable insights. As such the cognitive realm considers the representation and interaction of real world things as reflected onto our mental information space.</p><p>Digital realm — As a subject of interest and source of great societal impact, digital systems are of growing importance in our lives, highlighted by the prominence of internet, web and so called “cyberspace”. The digital realm considers the representation and interaction of real world things as reflected onto digital systems in the form of&nbsp;data.</p><p>Digital identities — a sub-type of identity instance — within the context of digital identity systems these are specific instances of an an entity’s representation, a digital twin so to speak. In other words, digital identities, are records of a person or organization within digital systems that are uniquely secured for common operations such as lookup, authentication, recovery, sharing,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Social context —aka Social circle — Is both a mental and sociological context that is defined within a well-known social circle. For example, close friends and professional social circles are two completely different contexts with different rules. Accordingly, we mentally identify as separate (yet related) beings depending on this&nbsp;context.</p><p>Self-identity —aka Self — Is a type of mental identity instance that identifies the “self” within a given social context. For example the “self” of personal relationships is different than that of professional social&nbsp;circles.</p><p>Perceived-identity —aka Identity — Is a type of mental identity instance that identifies other people or organizations, again within the context of a given social&nbsp;context.</p><p>Identity information (fragment) — Additional information associated with an identity that further describes a person, organization or thing, and possibly helps identify it through language, visual or other sensory&nbsp;input.</p>Identity in the cognitive domain<p>Our goals in designing intuitive identity systems for consumers, will often require us to align the concepts and taxonomy used to that of our natural mental&nbsp;models.</p> Economic activities and mental&nbsp;models <p>As subjects of life evolution, we are inherently economic individuals and societies. As such our mental models have evolved with significant influence from the economic activities that most help sustain us and our societies. With this view we can look at human mental model of specific types of activities, artifacts, tools and mental contexts that are closely related to our use of identity&nbsp;systems.</p><p>You can argue that our minds come equipped with a cognitive identity system, one that intuitively interoperates with the real world, and is sometimes aided by external identity systems such as digital or paper-based ones, ultimately forming a hybrid&nbsp;system.</p><p>In “<a href="https://medium.com/universal-identity/the-economics-of-identity-systems-98ac08a60a18">Economics of identity systems</a>” we touched on the frequent and high-value activities that help us support transactions.</p>Transaction support activities<p>These activities point to five distinct mental contexts involved in said supporting activities, namely:</p>  Information (or data) — Is the generalized form of information about the real world, and how we organize and make sense of&nbsp;it.  Identities (self and perceived) — Are the representation instances of self and others within various and specific social contexts, enhanced by trust information.  Money (or valuables) — Is the mental monetary understanding of valuables natural to our evaluation of property, transactions and&nbsp;surplus.  Connections (or contacts and relationships) — Is the mental social understanding around the state and protocols of belonging to specific groups or relationships, and the mutual expectations that go with building relationships.  Messages (or conversations) — Is the mental orientation having to do with communication and the mechanics of conversations in terms of single or fragmented messages and their&nbsp;replies.  Transaction support activities and mental&nbsp;contexts<p>The above root level concepts are generally well understood by typical users. In addition, the following extended list of core concepts are expected to be explicitly understood by typical users, as they seem to represent innate cognitive constructs:</p>  Information (fragment) — Given the composability of information, humans intuitively understand and handle fragments of information for the purposes of mental storing, organizing and retrieving. A typical user however may be unable to articulate what an information fragment They can however intuitively navigate information systems such as libraries, books, newspapers, etc. Information systems such as the world wide web provide functionality of digitally publishing, addressing, organizing and consuming public information.  Social circle (or context) —As detailed in our definitions, as humans we intuitively and explicitly aware of social circles or contexts we are a part of. These contexts vary across different groups, common goals and interests, as well as particular relationships with individuals.  Self-identity —Depending on a given social context, we take on dynamic roles which manifests in separate but related self-identities. Simple examples are our roles and identities as parents, siblings, citizens, team members,&nbsp;etc.  Self-identity information (fragment)—For each given social context and self-identity there may be unique fragments of information that we associate with ourselves and potentially present to others. For example we may take on a special nickname for designated social contexts such amongst close friends, or amongst our extended&nbsp;family.  (Perceived) Identity — High level information about another person (or organization’s) is mentally stored for the purposes of identifying that person in future interactions. This is different than that person’s self- identity which belongs to them, however it is deeply affected by how that person presents themselves, and asks to be remembered. Humans may not explicitly know they are dealing with a perceived identity but they can intuitively navigate it, even with help of external tools such as directories and address books&nbsp;etc.  (Perceived) Identity information (fragment) —Each given perceived identity is mentally associated with possibly unique fragments of information. For example we may remember a friend’s phone number, as well as a secret handshake between&nbsp;us.  Connection (or contacts and relationships) —Perceived identities can be mentally stored even without an actual connection or relationship existing. Connections suggest the existence of some state of trust or long term understanding between two parties or an individual and a group. As such connections often require varying levels of maintenance.  Account (or perceived connection) —When dealing with businesses who keep track of customers, we often perform the equivalent of opening up an account with them. This is essentially the other party’s record or mental store of their connection with us. The goal is often for that business and us to help maintain the state of that account in good standing.  Conversation —As part of connections with others we may perform long-term and short term conversations with them. We may mentally store and recall the state of these conversations, or use external tools such as letters or digital messages to keep track of&nbsp;them.  Message —Messages are the atomic sub-component of conversations, that can be mentally tracked individually. As humans we can intuitively recall specific messages and their contexts, as well as navigate external tools such as IM or email that enhance&nbsp;them.  <p>As a result of the users’ explicit understanding of these concepts, they are expected to be intuitive to deal with as digitally represented artifacts.</p> Multi-identity <p>As mentioned in the previous sections, a person’s self-identity is not one static thing, it morphs depending on the context of the social circle or context it is embedded in. Each of these multiple identities take on a well-defined role within their target social context, and may be associated with separate identity information fragments.</p>Cognitive multi-identity<p>A list of some well known social contexts include but are not limited&nbsp;to:</p><p>Core — this is what a person means to themselves. It represent ones relationship to themselves and the core of one’s identity.</p>  Public (social) — This is the most public aspect of our self identities there for all to see. This context has not commonly existed before the advent of internet and social networks. An example of the digital representation of our identity in this context is our facebook public&nbsp;profile.  Social (within a given circle) — A context meant mainly for general socializing and forming medium strength social connections within a social group bound by factors such as class, geography, beliefs, or other&nbsp;factors.  Professional (in a given field) — The context represented by professionals working within a given group with the same company, organization, career path, specialization, etc. LinkedIn is a typical professional social&nbsp;network.  Intellectual (general and/or in a given intellectual field)— A social arena where people pursue thought leadership or patronage in order to share or add to their intellectual prowess. Specific fields of academia fit this context. Also twitter can be typically identified as an intellectual-based social&nbsp;network.  Sports (general and/or a specific sport)— A social community where people may share and consume sports news, reactions and trivia as well as participate in actual sport competitions. The team a person plays sports on, or the office’s sport tournament bracket are examples of such contexts.  Romance (and/or sexuality)— Social networks or mutual relationships based on romance or possibility of finding it. Dating networks or events, as well as people’s romantic relationships are examples of such contexts.  Family (core and/or extended)— Social groups based on family relations be they small and intimate or larger and more extended. A person’s immediate family including partner and children, or extended family such as grandparents and cousins are examples of such contexts.  Friends (core and/or extended) — A group of mutual friends, a pair of best friends, or the larger circle of past friends can make up the friends social&nbsp;context.  Acquaintances — The larger circle of temporary or relatively weak social relationship that we maintain in case they become advantageous at a later time. Networking activities and events are one of the way people gain new acquaintances.  Retail (or other consumption)— The relationships we have with brands and companies we transact with to purchase goods, products and services. These relationship contexts are often isolated and transactional, although they may be persistent across sessions of interaction.  Citizenship (local, state and/or national)— The social context of belonging and feeling allegiance to a given locality, state or nation. This often comes with a sense of community and loyalty to the larger&nbsp;entity.  Common interest (or hobby)— A social group brought together by common interests such as a hobby, technology, activity or topic. Such social contexts often benefit from a sense of community due to the fringe nature of the participants’ interests.  <p>There are certain task-based relationships where one’s self identity is not consequential. Often such tasks can be completed using a completely or partially anonymous identity, at other times they can be accomplished using a synonymous identity that is correlated across sessions yet unidentified and uncorrelated to other identities.</p>  Anonymous — A completely unidentified and un-correlate-able one-time-use identity. This type of identity offers maximum privacy benefits.  Incognito —aka partially anonymous — Mostly anonymous with some correlate-able or identifiable information out of necessity. It is essentially a partially anonymous identity for when complete anonymity cannot be achieved due to technical or environmental limitations.  Pseudonymous — An unidentified persona that is correlate-able across sessions. It is used when anonymity is desired but some state across sessions is required for things to go smoothly.  <p>For example buying a pack of cigarettes from a convenience store using cash can be done mostly anonymously, however creating content and building reputation in social media can be done pseudonymously. Browsing the internet can be performed in incognito mode which is mostly anonymous but leaks information such as your IP&nbsp;address.</p> Identity as a&nbsp;tool <p>Often the way identity concept manifest themselves in the external physical or virtual worlds has to do with how we use “identity” as a tool for accomplishing everyday&nbsp;tasks.</p><p>In “<a href="https://medium.com/universal-identity/the-economics-of-identity-systems-98ac08a60a18">The economics of identity systems</a>” we take an in depth look at how we historically use identity-related artifacts and tools, and reveal the insight that despite going various waves of technologies, we have been using them to accomplish the same set of activity&nbsp;verbs.</p><p>Artifacts we tend to use by the name ID, identification card, or identity, across different technology waves have historically performed a combination of one, some or all of the following functions:</p>  Identification artifact —aka ID (or identification document)— Act as a medium for the user to communicate identifying information such as name, address, etc to another party in order to facilitate a mutually beneficial transaction.  Credential — Is used to present a claim and/or to promote the user’s perceived level of trustworthiness to a transaction participant, by demonstrating verification by a trusted third&nbsp;party.  Key — Is used to securely interact with a system and access its functions, as the system prevents unauthorized parties from access. This is typically done by authenticating the key artifact used and trusting that the holder was originally granted that key, or is authorized by the&nbsp;grantee.  ID functions mapped to tools and&nbsp;verbs<p>When dealing with a large number of these artifacts and tools, we often resort to using additional organization and access of tools. These tools in turn seem to naturally function in parallel to how we mentally organize and access the related concepts.</p><p>For example for physical tools like hammers and wrenches, we use complementary tools such as tool-belts and toolboxes to either temporarily store and immediately access them, or store them for longer term storage and&nbsp;access.</p><p>For artifacts such as ID (identification document) cards, keys, payment cards, or contact cards we utilize similar storage and organization tools such as wallets, keychains, and rolodexes.</p>Tool, tool-belt, toolbox analogy for identity system artifacts Conclusion <p>Our ultimate goal of understanding the mental models of typical users is building intuitive identity systems and applications. They need to operate based on parallel concepts to said mental models in order to achieve better user experiences and intuitive processes.</p><p>This article takes a good stab at identifying concepts that are likely to be innate to human cognitive constructs, and how multiple identities innately make up people’s understanding of themselves. It also touches on the common patterns of artifact and tool usage, as well as complementary storage and organization tools.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/universal-identity/how-humans-understand-identity-367200ae9591">How humans understand identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/universal-identity">Universal Identity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   The traditional model of enforcing security at the network perimeter is no longer effective. The nature of the corporate network is changing with mobile and cloud computing. A Zero Trust model offers an alternative that secures data while ensuring it is accessible to employees, regardless of where they are working. But deciding how best to adopt Zero Trust can be challenging.

<p><a href="https://www.bio-key.com/">BIO-key</a> will be showcasing its PortalGuard Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) solution at this month’s <a href="https://www.naco.org/">National Association of Counties</a> (NACo) Conference in Maryland. As an organization, NACo speaks to the interests of county-level governments in the United States, covering topics that range from housing to agriculture to cybersecurity.</p>



  



<p>BIO-key, of course, has particular expertise in the latter category. The company’s PortalGuard solution provides organizations with streamlined <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-extends-portalguard-coverage-with-new-sso-concierge-062306/">single sign-on capabilities</a>, and offers support for multiple forms of authentication, including <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-upgrades-portalguard-with-new-palm-authentication-feature-051003/">biometric</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-adds-new-passwordless-authentication-features-portalguard-idaas-platform-020301/">passwordless authentication</a>.</p>



<p>As a sponsor and an exhibitor, BIO-key plans to emphasize the utility and the affordability of the PortalGuard product. NACo has encouraged its members to prioritize multi-factor authentication (MFA), and while BIO-key praised that stance, it noted that many solutions can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, which may be prohibitively expensive.</p>



<p>PortalGuard, on the other hand, is available as a cloud service, which means that it can be deployed without any significant hardware investments. That makes it much more cost-effective than many of the other solutions currently on the market, and should make it more appealing to counties that need to deal with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/digital-transformation-in-the-enterprise-month-covid-19s-impact-909109/">increasing cyberattacks and remote work traffic</a>.</p>



<p>“For over ten years, BIO-key has been focused on helping counties secure access for their employees, citizens, and contractors,” said BIO-key CRO Fred Corsentino. “Now, more than ever, we’re excited to attend and sponsor this event at such a critical time when counties require solutions to protect against breaches, eliminate passwords, lower costs, and improve productivity for their IT teams.”</p>



<p>The <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-partners-prominic-deliver-portalguard-us-department-defense-112302/">Department of Defense</a>, the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/doj-agency-opts-for-portalguard-iam-security-701063/">Department of Justice</a>, and the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/n-c-municipality-is-now-bio-keys-latest-portalguard-customer-907307/">municipality of Durham, North Carolina</a> are some of BIO-key’s recent PortalGuard customers in the public sector. The <a href="https://www.naco.org/events/2021-naco-annual-conference">NACo Annual Conference</a> runs from July 8-12 at the National Harbor in Maryland’s Prince George’s County. BIO-key will be giving demonstrations at booth 302, while Product VP Kimberly Johnson will be a featured panelist during the event’s CIO Forum and Technology Summit.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/">Allied Market Research</a> (AMR) is predicting that the <a href="https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/11462">global passive authentication market</a> will quadruple in the next few years, growing from $796 million in 2019 to $4.09 billion&nbsp;by 2027. Those figures represent a CAGR of 22.7 percent in the 2020 to 2027 window.</p>



  



<p>The firm attributed much of that growth to the rising demand for solutions that can remove friction from the authentication process and deliver a better overall user experience. The passive authentication market covers a range of technologies that can authenticate without direct user input, including <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/innovatrics-brings-passive-liveness-detection-live-video-feeds-052703/">face</a>, <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/demand-authentication-services-expected-drive-3-9-billion-voice-biometrics-market-040603/">voice</a>, and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/grand-view-forecasts-4-62-billion-behavioral-biometrics-market-101503/">behavioral biometrics</a>.</p>



<p>AMR noted that the demand for such solutions has been particularly high in the past year. More people started working from home due to COVID-19, and that has created more security vulnerabilities and led to an <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/experian-warns-about-synthetic-identities-covid-scams-future-fraud-predictions-011103/">increase in phishing</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/transunion-reports-higher-fraud-rate-during-covid-10-pandemic-032306/">other cyberattacks</a>. That, in turn, has created a need for security solutions that can close some of those potential gaps.</p>



<p>The solution segment of the market accounted for nearly 60 percent of the global market in 2019, though the service segment will grow more quickly with a CAGR of 23.2 percent. The financial industry has displayed the most enthusiasm for passive authentication (roughly 40 percent of the market), largely because the technology can help detect and prevent fraud. However, the healthcare segment will have a higher CAGR of 27.8 percent for the duration of the forecast period. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, North America&nbsp;was the biggest driver of revenue, though the Asia-Pacific market will exhibit the most growth with a 24.8 percent CAGR moving forward. In each case, the segment that was the largest in 2019 will hold its position in 2027 despite more rapid growth elsewhere.</p>



<p>AMR identified NEC, Gemalto, RSA Security, Experian, Nuance, and BioCatch as some of the most noteworthy players in the passive authentication space. Adroit, meanwhile, believes that the market for <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/adroit-forecasts-12-8-billion-risk-based-authentication-market-053102/">risk-based authentication technology</a> will reach $12.8 billion by 2028.</p>

					<p>In 2019, Trinsic launched the first verifiable credentials platform, enabling developers to easily implement digital trust into any application for the first time. Since then, our APIs have been used by more than 2,000 developers and supports some of the largest verifiable credentials implementations in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Through this period of growth and by working closely with our customers, we’ve learned what is needed to take our platform to the next level, and we’re thrilled to announce the largest upgrade to our platform since its launch. The next version of the Trinsic platform is 10x as accessible, 100x more performant, and 1,000x more scalable. And it is available now. Keep reading to see how you can start using it.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 Introducing Trinsic Core 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
					<p>Before diving into the specifics of the platform upgrade, we need to introduce a new term. Up to this point, we have referred to Trinsic’s APIs for verifiable credential exchange as simply the Trinsic platform. Moving forward, we will refer to these APIs as Trinsic Core. We decided to name our API platform Core because it underpins all of our current and future products. Trinsic Core is infrastructure for digital trust in the same way that Stripe is infrastructure for payments or Twilio is infrastructure for communications.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Our original tech stack, Trinsic Core v1, is what our customers use today and as mentioned above, supports some of the largest verifiable credentials implementations in the world. Core v1 uses JSON credentials, CL signatures native to the Hyperledger Indy SDK, Hyperledger Aries exchange protocols, and DIDComm v1.¹</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But, as the size and complexity of our customers’ use cases grew, there were scaling and performance requirements that the original open source codebases for verifiable credential exchange listed above were not able to meet. And that is why we have built Trinsic Core v2—the largest upgrade to our digital trust infrastructure to date.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To be clear, we will continue to support Trinsic Core v1 which is generally available now by signing up for a free <a href="https://studio.trinsic.id/">Trinsic Studio</a> account. With that said, we invite all current and new customers to try out Trinsic Core v2 and experience the future of digital trust infrastructure.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
			 What's new with Trinsic Core v2 		 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
					<p>Trinsic Core v2 meets the scaling, interoperability, and performance enhancements our customers, and the world at large, need to deploy verifiable credentials in production. It uses the latest standards that are emerging as the de facto, next-generation standards for verifiable credential exchange. These include JSON-LD credentials, BBS+ signatures, and decentralized identifiers. To learn a little more about each of these specifications, click on the drop-down below.</p>					 
						 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
					 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>JSON-LD credentials</a>
					 
					 <p>We follow the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#json-ld">Verifiable Credential Data Model</a>, so there’s no vendor lock-in when using the Trinsic. We use an encoding format called JSON Linked Data so that the data within a credential can be described using self-contained URIs.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>BBS+ signatures</a>
					 
					 <p>The BBS+ Signature Suite provides the capability to perform zero-knowledge proof disclosures on datasets. When used in tandem with a verifiable credential, these signatures empower individuals to prove things about themselves with minimal data disclosure.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Decentralized identifiers</a>
					 
					 <p>Taken from the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#dfn-decentralized-identifiers">Verifiable Credential Data Model</a>, a decentralized identifier is “a portable URL-based identifier, also known as a DID, associated with an entity. These identifiers are most often used in a verifiable credential and are associated with subjects such that a verifiable credential itself can be easily ported from one repository to another without the need to reissue the credential. An example of a DID is did:example:123456abcdef”.</p> 
				 
								 
				 
				 
						 
					 
		 
								 
					 
		 
				 
						 
							 
					 
			 
							 
						 
				 
								 
									
																					The chart above lists out the open source specifications that make up Trinsic Core. The specifications that are included in Trinsic Core v1 is in the "Current, in production" column. You can use Trinsic Core v1 today by signing up for a free Trinsic Studio account at studio.trinsic.id. Trinsic Core v2 is in the highlighted yellow area. Our beta release of Trinsic Core v2 (the second column) is available for customers to start using now.

					<p>For verifiable credentials to achieve adoption at scale, they need to be easy to implement for developers and easy to adopt for end users. As we move forward with Trinsic Core v2, we are getting closer to making the user experience of sharing verifiable credentials as seamless as using Apple Pay. Trinsic Core v2 has the following advantages that will help make this a reality:<br><br></p>  Scalability: Trinsic Core v2 can support tens of millions of people using their credentials several times per day.  Performance: Trinsic Core v2 enables near-instant verifications (&lt;200 milliseconds).  Accessibility: Trinsic Core v2 makes it so that digital wallets are available across devices, browsers, and platforms. People will be able to access their credentials from any device, and developers no longer have to write an entirely new framework from scratch to integrate digital wallet capabilities using their preferred language.  Built for Ecosystems: Trinsic Core v2 was developed from the beginning to integrate with <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-ecosystems/">Trinsic Ecosystems</a>, the only product developed specifically for providers of digital trust ecosystems.  Unopinionated technology: While our initial beta release supports the latest standards such as JSON-LD verifiable credential data model, BBS+ signatures, and DIDComm v2 messaging formats, Trinsic Core v2 is architected from the beginning to be agnostic to ledger, transport, payload, signature scheme, etc. That means over time, Trinsic Core will easily allow developers to tailor their preferred technical standards to their ecosystems.

         Tokeny Has Solved the Problem of Gas Fees  8 July 2021             
	 
		 
			<p>For a long time, gas fees have been a huge issue for public blockchain users; especially within the Ethereum mainnet in the past 12 months. While crypto users complain about the high and unstable gas fees preventing them access to DeFi, financial institutions are struggling to quantify their future costs and how they will add crypto tokens to their balance sheet if they enter the public blockchain space.</p>
 What are gas fees? 
<p>First, let’s walk you through some basic knowledge of gas fees. Gas fees are the cost of transactions on the blockchain. More precisely, they are the fees you pay as a blockchain user to reward the individuals and companies securing the network.</p>
<p>Currently, Ethereum uses a consensus protocol called Proof-of-Work (PoW). It is an algorithm that sets mathematical computations for miners to solve. Once those puzzles are solved by miners, new transactions will be encoded into a block and added to the blockchain. When a miner finds the correct answer, they can produce a block and receive gas fees as a reward. Miners are the individuals and companies that participate in this process with powerful computers. Furthermore, their computers often conduct the ‘trial and error’ method to find the solutions. It requires strong computation power that runs day and night, all around the world.</p>
 Gas fees are unpredictable and complex 
<p>As each block space is finite, miners will obviously pick the highest gas fee bid transactions to prioritize. Therefore, you will need to overbid on gas fees to get the transactions validated quickly. Your transaction is therefore in competition with others, and also depends on the value of the crypto token you must use to pay (e.g. ETH on Ethereum). Paying for the infrastructure only when you use it is great, but not being able to predict how much you will have to pay is obviously an issue. It is difficult to define operational costs and how to recharge them to clients. Basically, it requires a whole process for institutions to buy crypto at a reasonable price, store them in secure wallets, and, at the same time, make them available for their employees when they perform actions on security tokens. On the other hand, some institutions are not even allowed to buy and keep crypto due to regulation or their own risk policies, or accounting difficulties.</p>
 Tokeny made gas fees disappear 
<p>For a long time, we’ve been looking for solutions to solve the gas fee issues. Because we believe that public blockchains are valuable as ecosystems, we didn’t want to start issuing security tokens on private or nascent blockchains. Obviously, our customers were not alone in facing these gas fees issues, millions of users and developers needed to fix this as well. That’s mostly why amazing new solutions came up recently in the market, such as sidechains, layer 2 solutions and other technical improvements, leveraging the decentralization of Ethereum but validating transactions differently, mostly with Proof-of-Stake mechanisms.</p>
<p>After long research, tests and discussions with people involved in the industry, we decided to make our EVM compatible platform evolved in order to issue, manage and transfer security tokens on the Polygon network. In April, we <a href="https://tokeny.com/tokeny-solutions-and-polygon-enter-a-partnership-to-improve-accessibility-of-security-tokens/">partnered with Polygon</a>, a layer 2 protocol building and connecting Ethereum-​compatible blockchain networks. With Polygon, the gas fee has been reduced by over 10,000 times. It now costs less than $0.01 per transaction.</p>
<p>While the cost of transactions is no longer the issue as the gas fees become so low, the complexity of the process remains. Users still need to go to cryptocurrency exchanges to buy MATIC – the crypto token used to pay the gas fees on Polygon. The problem with this process becomes more complicated for financial institutions, as some don’t even know how or where their balance sheets will include these crypto-costs going forward.</p>
<p>It was therefore clear to us that the key to getting traditional players and investors to embrace tokenized securities is to provide them with a better user experience by making the gas fee process disappear. To achieve this goal, we have developed a solution called the “Polygon Gas Tank”. Basically, the system monitors the balance of MATIC tokens in issuer’, agents’ and investors’ wallets. When it falls below the balance threshold, the Polygon Gas Tank will top up the wallet with more MATIC tokens automatically, and for free. As a result, our users always have enough MATIC tokens to cover their gas fees. In other words, we’ve got this covered, users don’t need to pay any blockchain transaction fees anymore.</p>

		 
	 
          
	 
		 
			<p>With the Polygon Gas Tank, performing operations and transferring security tokens becomes easier, faster, and free. By making the complexity of blockchain disappear for all stakeholders, true financial inclusion and mainstream adoption of tokenization is on the horizon.</p>

<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Patrick some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p><br></p>
<p>Why do you think that complexity has reached a tipping point in IT?</p>
<p>
From our experience, large customers typically have 3,000 to 5,000 different applications that the IT staff have to manage, provision, control access. And end-users in these organizations interact with hundreds of these applications. So really the IT staff being able to be properly trained and understand the security models and how to grant and manage security in these thousands of applications has become overwhelming. Most of these organizations have outsourced this role to staff in other countries, that have a high turnover rate. So it's always a new employee and the new employees coming in and they're managing access requests for hundreds of systems, for which they're not trained. For each of these systems, they have to have native permissions, which is a huge risk as they are going into these systems as a superuser.&nbsp; They're not very well-trained. They may not be in this job for very long, and they have to make sense of these access requests to try to grant the user permission in these systems. It has really become an impossible task. The turnaround time has become extremely slow. The frustration for end-users and often at errors on the side of just over permissioning and giving the users too much access to try to just close the ticket.</p>
<p>It also makes it extremely difficult for managers, because managers are business users. They know what the users should be able to do as part of their job, but translating that into the technical entitlements that they are prevented from these systems and enabling them to make a decision is often just a guessing game. The technical entitlements have no real relation or meaning as to how they, what they grant the user, the ability to do on a day-to-day basis and what would be the risk of that, and whether it's appropriate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the same thing goes for auditors. They are investigating to see our people within our risk policies. Do they just have the access they need? What have they been doing? Again, looking at low-level technical audit logs of transactions, looking at these technical entitlements – there is too much data for it to be humanly possible for them to accurately assess risk compliance and to keep this all in check. It is just becoming overwhelming and it's only growing more complex as we move to the cloud. As digital transformation causes an outsourcing of best of breed for each area of the enterprise to different applications, this is an ever-expanding universe of complexity.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>What are the risks of complexity in our IT Infrastructure?</p>
<p>
One of the major risks of the over ever-growing complexity within our IT organizations is over permissioning. This has become dramatically worse as we've moved to the cloud. Cloud platforms have extremely elaborate and idiosyncratic security models, which are specific to each of the platforms. Google GCP has a different model than AWS than Azure and the various systems like SAP. Each one has an ever-expanding set of services they offer. So the typical cloud administrator for these platforms only actually utilizes less than 1% of the permissions, which they hold at all times. This creates a very large population of super users, which are always on, always armed, and open to attack. So this large amount of standing privileges is a huge security risk for organizations who are hackers have access to these publicly available systems, where if they compromise any of these accounts, they have God-like permissions and could do very destructive actions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, another major risk is just end-user frustration, what might lead to something called the great IT slowdown where end-users and managers are overwhelmed by the complexity of dealing with IT systems. They really want to do the business work in their job, but the percentage of their time that they spend interacting with IT, making requests, dealing with permissions, recertifying access is only increasing. So the end-user frustration will lead to rubber stamping, which will avoid and bypass all of our organization's compliance and security policies. And at some point, the complexity will just reach a limit to where it's really impossible for certain roles to understand as many systems as they're being required to manage, which will lead to breakdowns, human error and vulnerability.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>How would you solve the challenges imposed by an IT infrastructure that has become too complex?</p>
<p>
I think the one thing we can assume is that the IT infrastructure is only going to increasingly grow complex and to continue its velocity or its path. So the solution to that is really the solution that's been used in many other industries over time. Developers no longer deal with machine-level code. They have abstracted it out so that they're dealing with higher-level objects, functions, the low code movement, allowing users who are less technical to automate processes without actually writing code. If we borrow a term used in business intelligence and data analytics - what we really need is a semantic layer. In business intelligence, a semantic layer is the mapping for your complex data in different heterogeneous systems into a single set of easily understandable business concepts for users. So it really transforms data into meaning and insight. The same thing could be applied here for IT and identity and access management specifically. The complex permissions and actions and activities that users perform in all these various systems, whether they're cloud or on-premise, we really need a mapping layer, a semantic layer so that the business users, the help desk users, the operational staff, and the auditors can deal with a single set of recognizable terminologies so that you can see what a user wants to do and who has access on understandable terms.</p>
<p>As an example, creating a purchase order in various systems, Microsoft Dynamics, SAP, and others, &nbsp;would be delivered by technical entitlements, granting complex and cryptic low-level transactions. If we are dealing at that level, the auditors and the users will have to understand the low-level complexity. But if we're dealing with a semantic layer, then you'll be able to see, I want to create a purchase order, and that's all you interact with. Or if I'm at help desk, I can see in grant the ability to create a purchase order. And then the IAM system is what translates that last-mile delivery of the technical entitlement. So we're dealing with business terms that are readily understandable, that we can categorize the risk that we can recertify. Everything makes sense. And the actual technical mapping of these semantics of these terminology down to the system-specific is hidden from us because we shouldn't have to learn that because it is not really a value add for our job.</p>
<p>Now, this is also a good from a zero-trust perspective because you're pulling users out of having direct interaction with those systems and native permissions and granting them access to a single interface, which hides that complexity. So it reduces the training time. It drastically reduces the amount of information and knowledge that a user has to have to perform their day-to-day duties, which reduces the cost to an organization. It helps on turnover and re-education, and it lowers risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The semantic layer you describe – Is that the Place where AI will come into play?</p>
<p>
Yes. So, so that's another point I had on here. So in AI, there is something called intention analysis and intention mappings, where for a user to be able to talk to AI, it has to be able to say human recognizable terms like “I would like this”. Or if the AI is analyzing activities, it can prevent the low-level information it has to bubble up into something that means something to the user. So it's the same type of mapping that happens on the AI to produce intelligible results and for AI assistance, to understand that human recognizable terms and translate that into the action that it needs to perform.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>You propose a semantic layer to simplify IT.&nbsp; Would this model support multi-cloud or hybrid environments?</p>
<p>
Yes, actually, since it is a layer that's outside of anyone's system, it's really what is even more needed for multi-cloud. So if you have a multi-cloud environment, you have Google GCP, which has a very different security model, &nbsp;very complex, that takes someone a long time to learn, which is very different than AWS that has a Jason policy-based model, which is even very different from Azure's role-based and scope based model that the users that are on the front line requesting access, delivering access, fulfilling access, auditing access. They shouldn't have to be an expert in every system. So this layer for a multi-cloud is really even more important to bubble it up into intelligible, understandable results, and also to hide the complexity so that users are doing these tasks in the native interfaces, where they would require extensive training and have native direct unproxied permissions. You're giving them a zero-trust interface where they can perform their activities without having native access and with having a monitoring layer in the middle, which makes it easier for them. But it also adds security for the organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Have you already been working on such a layer?</p>
<p>Yes. We've been working on it for about a year and a half now, so we have the mapping layer. One of the key trends is that organizations are trying to get down to activity-based access. So monitoring activities, understanding who's actually using privileges, what are the activities they perform? What are the activities they could perform, where they have access to, but actually never do. That way You can have more of an autonomous access system, which is decreasing the risk profile by trimming out automatically activities that you actually don't do. It can also propose new rules based upon activities of similar cohorts. And if the activities map to technical entitlements that can propose new roles or reshaping of the access policies. So we have the layer in place to be able to have the finest fine-grain permissions, the SAPT codes, authorization object, field values, the Azure, rights and role assignments, everything at the fine grain, to be able to map that up into this semantic layer so that you can immediately look at a person and see that this user can create a Kubernetes cluster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that if I look at that, I could also see if they could create it in Google or AWS, instead of these being distinct technical entitlements that have no relationship, now I can see an activity, create Kubernetes cluster and see exactly who has it across our enterprise landscape, how they're getting it and also activity usage tracking. So if they're executing transactions using those fine-grain permissions, it has meaning now that they are creating it, that meant they created a Kubernetes cluster, and here's the risk associated with that. So, yes, we have that mapping layer built into the product right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Right now it looks like platforms like Salesforce and ServiceNow are taking over more and more Identity &amp; Access related processes. If this trend prevails – how would it&nbsp; influence your approach?</p>
<p>
So the rise of the platforms, as far as ServiceNow extending into identity and access management functions, Salesforce and others, these platforms are great general-purpose platforms. They're great for workflow processes, for human-to-human automation and approvals and tracking, for compliance change requests, et cetera, but where they typically fall short, what isn't within their scope, is fulfillment. So we have customers right now, like one example that is fully ServiceNow. They have access requests processes for SAP and other systems, but just to fulfill the access request for SAP, and they have 800 staff in India, which is an extremely huge expense, because ServiceNow can automate the approvals. It can go through different levels, but these systems typically don't handle fulfillment of the technical access. So once it goes to the system owners or these outsource staff, then they have to deal with the complexity of what did the user really mean?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because users don't know the entitlements. They don't really know what they need. They don't understand the technical aspect and they shouldn't. So this person is responsible for somehow fulfilling this request. And most of that is manual where they have super privileged access. And so the platform vendors aren't extending down to where they really automate fulfillment. Typically that's something they leave out. So you still have the risk, you still have the human factor. And I see these platform products being probably the biggest consumer of the semantic layer, because you need a system that's specialized that can understand and get the fine-grained permission. So it knows who can do which of these human activities. It can track this, but then in the platform system, that semantic layer would ease the process for them. So when users are remaking access requests in a semantic layer integrated approach, they would be able to request the things they want to do and not just service catalog items.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They'd be able to tell the system what they want to do. Tell the virtual assistant or the AI, what they're trying to do. If the AI ask them, who shows them users who have the same job function, it could show them not technical entitlements, but the activities these users perform. And they can say, that's what they're trying to get access to do. And then the mapping layer would translate that after the access request was fulfilled into that last mile fulfillment, which the platform products typically do not provide and which increases complexity and costs. So I see a synergy here where they will be major consumers of this new technology.</p>

<p>By Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of&nbsp;BOTLabs</p><p>KILT Protocol is designed to be a fully decentralised permissionless blockchain network. That means we are building KILT to evolve into a blockchain that is run by the community, with decisions being made transparently on chain by KILT token&nbsp;holders.</p><p>As is often the case with cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, things can change even before they manifest! <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/consensus-through-collators-kilt-as-a-nominated-proof-of-stake-network-e58c8c4cf8a2">Previously I wrote about</a> how I envisioned the KILT Protocol as a Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) network. Since then, we have decided to adopt a different mechanism that better supports KILT in the long&nbsp;term.</p><p>There are three major factors we considered:</p>  Since we plan to run in the Polkadot ecosystem (initially as a parachain on Kusama), security is provided by the Relay Chain on the&nbsp;network  We want to recognise the importance of the work of the collators on the KILT blockchain  We want to keep inflation low.  <p>Taking all these factors into consideration, we decided to launch KILT’s parachain on the Kusama network using Limited Delegated Proof of Stake&nbsp;(LDPoS).</p> Limited Delegated Proof of Stake&nbsp;(LDPoS) <p>Limited Delegated Proof of Stake (LDPoS) is a Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism that limits the number of delegators and the number of collators to whom they can delegate their&nbsp;stake.</p><p>In LDPoS, the network will have collators (similar to validators in the Polkadot ecosystem), as outlined in my previous blog. The network will also have delegators. Similar to nominators in the NPoS system, delegators use their KILT tokens to back collators that they trust in the&nbsp;system.</p><p>In this way, collators can be supported by token holders in the community while they build up their own&nbsp;stake.</p> Collators <p>Collator nodes hold the data of the blockchain, collecting transactions and building blocks. The blocks of data they verify are passed via the validators to the Relay Chain of the wider network (Kusama or Polkadot) to be finalised and become the state of&nbsp;truth.</p><p>Running as a collator requires some technical skill, hardware and commitment to the project. Collators will be rewarded for every block they verify. The first group of collators for KILT has been selected, and we will have around 16 active collators at launch. This number will increase in the months after mainnet launch, as the network matures. Stay tuned for more news about the members of this Initial KILT Collator Programme.</p> Delegators <p>Delegators would be KILT token holders who choose to back collators with their tokens. In the current model, a delegator will be able to choose one collator to back per account; this may be increased in the future. We’ll be announcing more details about the role of delegators in upcoming&nbsp;weeks.</p> KILT in the&nbsp;Future <p>This plan to implement LDPoS is another step in our goal to optimise the design of KILT as a decentralised blockchain, with the facility to evolve and be self-sustainable over the long term. We will present a detailed outline of the economics of this mechanism in our forthcoming document on the token economy. KILT is implementing LDPoS with the aim of maximising long-term viability, ensuring that KILT’s services will continue to contribute to privacy on the internet for decades to&nbsp;come.</p>

<p>IDnow joins IDunion, the network initiative for digital identities funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Munich, July 8th 2021, IDnow, a leading European Platform-as-a-Service provider for identity verification, announces its participation in the IDunion network, which aims to build an open ecosystem for decentralised identity management.</p>
<p>For the IDunion network, central aspects of implementation are security, cost-effectiveness, user-friendliness and privacy compliant use of identity data. IDnow has joined forces with other industry experts through IDunion to drive a shared vision of digital identities that is aligned with European values and regulations.</p>
<p>“We are excited to play a key role in shaping the future of digital identities in Europe with our partners at IDunion and looking forward to working together on secure and economical solutions,” says Armin Bauer, Managing Director Technology and Co-Founder of IDnow. “The introduction of a digital identity solution is an important and necessary step for Europe. After the publication of the EU decision on the EU Digital Identity Wallet, we now need to think about a unified infrastructure,” adds Armin Bauer.</p>
<p>Since its foundation, IDnow has been working closely with various regulatory authorities across Europe and supporting standardisation working groups such as the FIDO Alliance or ETSI’s Special Task Force 588 to develop new standards with its expertise.</p>
<p>As one of the European market leaders in the field of digital identification, IDnow is working on a technology to implement digital wallets. With this technology, users’ data is stored securely on the user’s smartphone in compliance with data protection laws. By means of fingerprint or facial recognition (touch or face ID), the data is released for identification. The user retains control over his or her own data at all times. As a certified identification service (“Registration Authority”) according to §24 1 d) eIDAS and as one of the largest providers of eIDs, the online ID function, IDnow is ideally positioned to provide all citizens and companies with an identity within the framework of a digital identity wallet in the future. Within IDunion, IDnow’s goal is to make the wallet technology compatible with the standards of the IDunion network.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, IDnow has expanded its role far beyond offering individual ident procedures and has become the overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year. In 2021, IDnow acquired the French market leader in identity technology, ARIADNEXT as well as German identity Trust Management AG. This enables IDnow to expand into new industries and offer its services to a broader customer base in Europe.</p>

   Introduction 

<p>Jenkins is a free and open-source application that makes it easy to create CI/CD pipelines in almost any language or environment. Jenkins features a vast number of plugs to help create a CI/CD environment that is tailored to your technologies.</p>

<p>In this application, you will create a .NET5 MVC web application and check it into a git repository. You will secure this application with Okta. Finally, you will set up a Jenkins project to fetch the code from your git repository, publish the project, apply configuration values, and run the application. Combining these three technologies you’ll see how quick and easy it is to set up a modern CI/CD environment for a web application that is properly secured with a great single sign-on provider.</p>

 What you’ll need 

 
   Your favorite IDE. I will be using Visual Studio but Visual Studio Code is another great option 
   A git repository 
   .NET 5 
   Jenkins 
   A Web Browser to Access Jenkins 
   An Okta Developer Account 
   The Okta CLI tool 
 

 Create your Okta Application 

<p>The first thing you want to do is create your Okta application. To do this you can use the new <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI tool</a>. Download the Okta CLI tool if you haven’t already and run <code>okta login</code> to log into your account. Next run <code>okta apps create</code> and follow the prompts you receive. First, select <code>web</code> as your application type. Next, for your Redirect URI type in your web application’s development location and append <code>/okta/callback</code> to it. For Post Logout RedirectURI use your same base domain and append <code>/signout/callback</code> as this is the route Okta will use by default. If you have multiple authorization services the CLI tool will prompt you to select one. For this project you can select default however in a production environment you should create a custom server. After a moment the CLI tool will return your ClientId. Be sure to note this as you will need it in your application.</p>

<p>Next, navigate to your Okta admin portal. The first thing you want to do is note your Client Secret. Next, press Edit under the General Settings tab and scroll down to the Login subsection. Add a value under Sign-in redirect URIs with the same path as before but use <code>https://locahost:5001</code> instead of your development domain. This URI will be used when you publish and run your application with Jenkins. Similarly, under Sign-out redirect URIs add a value with the same route as your development route but using <code>https://localhost:5001</code>.</p>

<p></p>

 Create your .NET Application 

<p>Open Visual Studio and select Create a New Project. Use the template for ASP.NET Core Web App(Model-View-Controller). Give your application a meaningful name click Create. Visual Studio will scaffold your application. Once it is complete you can begin making the necessary changes.</p>

<p>First, install the Okta.AspNetCore package from nuget using the command:</p>

<p><code>Install-Package Okta.AspNetCore -Version 3.5.0</code></p>

<p>Next, modify your <code>Startup.cs</code> file with the code below.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.HttpsPolicy;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Okta.AspNetCore;

namespace Okta_Jenkins
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public Startup(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            Configuration = configuration;
        }

        public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
        public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
        {
            services.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;
            {
                options.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
                options.DefaultSignInScheme = CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
                options.DefaultChallengeScheme = OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme;
            })
            .AddCookie()
            .AddOktaMvc(new OktaMvcOptions
            {
                // Replace these values with your Okta configuration
                OktaDomain = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:Domain"),
                ClientId = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientId"),
                ClientSecret = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:ClientSecret"),
                CallbackPath = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("Okta:CallbackPath") 
            });

            services.AddControllersWithViews();
        }

        // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
        {
            if (env.IsDevelopment())
            {
                app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
            }
            else
            {
                app.UseExceptionHandler("/Home/Error");
                // The default HSTS value is 30 days. You may want to change this 
                // for production scenarios, see https://aka.ms/aspnetcore-hsts.
                app.UseHsts();
            }
            app.UseHttpsRedirection();
            app.UseStaticFiles();

            app.UseRouting();

            app.UseAuthentication();
            app.UseAuthorization();

            app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;
            {
                endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
                    name: "default",
                    pattern: "{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}");
            });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>In your new <code>Startup.cs</code> file you are configuring the application to use authentication. In addition, you are also configuring your application to use the <code>Okta.AspNetCore</code> library you added a moment ago.</p>

<p>Next, add a new controller called <code>AccountController.cs</code>. This will handle your login and logout methods.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies;
using Okta.AspNetCore;

namespace Okta_Jenkins.Controllers
{
    public class AccountController : Controller
    {
        public IActionResult Login()
        {
            if (!HttpContext.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
            {
                return Challenge(OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme);
            }

            return RedirectToAction("Index", "Home");
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public IActionResult Logout()
        {
            return new SignOutResult(new[]
            {
                OktaDefaults.MvcAuthenticationScheme,
                CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme
            });
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, replace the code in your <code>HomeController</code> with the following.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Okta_Jenkins.Models;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Diagnostics;
using System.Linq;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Okta_Jenkins.Controllers
{
    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        private readonly ILogger&lt;HomeController&gt; _logger;

        public HomeController(ILogger&lt;HomeController&gt; logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            if(User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
            {
                return RedirectToAction("Index", "Profile");
            }

            return View();
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Your new <code>HomeController</code> will now check for authenticated users before dropping them on the home page. If the user is authenticated, you will redirect them to their profile page. To do that you will need to add <code>ProfileController.cs</code> to your controllers.</p>

   <code>using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authorization;

namespace Okta_Jenkins.Controllers
{
    public class ProfileController : Controller
    {
        private readonly ILogger&lt;ProfileController&gt; _logger;

        public ProfileController(ILogger&lt;ProfileController&gt; logger)
        {
            _logger = logger;
        }

        [Authorize]
        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            return View();
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>Index</code> method here has the <code>Authorize</code> attribute. This will prevent unauthenticated users from accessing the page. They will be redirected back to the home page where they will need to log in.</p>

<p>Next, you will want to work on your views. Open <code>_Layout.cshtml</code> and replace the code with the code below.</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;@ViewData["Title"] - Okta with Jenkins&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="~/lib/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" /&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/site.css" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;
        &lt;nav class="navbar navbar-expand-sm navbar-toggleable-sm navbar-light bg-white border-bottom box-shadow mb-3"&gt;
            &lt;div class="container"&gt;
                &lt;a class="navbar-brand" asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Index"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
                &lt;button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".navbar-collapse" aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent"
                        aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation"&gt;
                    &lt;span class="navbar-toggler-icon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;div class="navbar-collapse collapse d-sm-inline-flex justify-content-between"&gt;
                    &lt;ul class="navbar-nav justify-content-end flex-grow-1"&gt;
                        &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;
                            @if (User.Identity.IsAuthenticated)
                            {
                                &lt;form asp-action="Logout" asp-controller="Account" asp-method="POST"&gt;

                                    &lt;input type="submit" value="Logout" class="btn btn-secondary" /&gt;
                                &lt;/form&gt;
                            }
                            else
                            {

                                &lt;a class="btn btn-primary" asp-action="Login" asp-controller="Account"&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt;
                            }

                        &lt;/li&gt;
                    &lt;/ul&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/nav&gt;
    &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;div class="container"&gt;
        &lt;main role="main" class="pb-3"&gt;
            @RenderBody()
        &lt;/main&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;footer class="border-top footer text-muted"&gt;
        &lt;div class="container"&gt;
            &amp;copy; 2021 - Okta_Jenkins - &lt;a asp-area="" asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Privacy"&gt;Privacy&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/footer&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/lib/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/lib/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;script src="~/js/site.js" asp-append-version="true"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    @await RenderSectionAsync("Scripts", required: false)
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>The only difference here is that you have added a Login button for unauthenticated users and a logout button for authenticated ones.</p>

<p>Next, open <code>Home/Index.cshtml</code> and replace the razor code with this.</p>

   <code>@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home Page";
}

&lt;div class="text-center"&gt;
    &lt;h1 class="display-4"&gt;Welcome&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a brief tutorial on using &lt;a href="https://www.jenkins.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jenkins CI/CD&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;.Net 5&lt;/a&gt;, Secured with &lt;a href="https://www.okta.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Okta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Written by &lt;a href="https://profile.fishbowlllc.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nik Fisher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>Finally, create a new view for <code>Profile/Index.cshtml</code> and add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>&lt;div class="jumbotron"&gt;
    Welcome to your Profile
&lt;/div&gt;
</code>   

<p>The last thing you will need to do is add your application settings. By default you should have a file called <code>appsettings.json</code> and one called <code>appsettings.Development.json</code>. If you don’t, create one and add the following code to <code>appsettings.Development.json</code>.</p>

 <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "Domain": "{yourOktaDomain}",
    "ClientId": "{yourClientId}",
    "ClientSecret": "{yourClientSecret}",
    "CallbackPath": "/okta/callback"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>This file should be listed in your <code>.gitignore</code> file because it contains sensitive information. You should never check client secrets or any other sensitive data into your git repository. Next, add the following configuration to <code>appsettings.json</code>.</p>

 <code>{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Warning",
      "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information"
    }
  },
  "Okta": {
    "Domain": "",
    "ClientId": "",
    "ClientSecret": "",
    "CallbackPath": "/okta/callback"
  }
}
</code> 

<p>You will notice that this is the same structure as <code>appsettings.development.json</code> but without the sensitive values. When you create your Jenkins project, you will pull this file and publish it then you will override the settings in this file with environment variables.</p>

 Create your Jenkins Project 

<p>The first thing you’ll need to do is installing Jenkins. You can <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/download/">do that here on their site</a>; Just make sure you get the appropriate version for your operating system.</p>

<p>Once Jenkins is installed on your machine you will be present with a screen for the first time login. Follow the instructions to get your admin password and log in. Jenkins will then offer to install recommended plugins. If this is your first time you can use that option. More advanced users may want to install the plugins they want manually. Note, you will need at least the <code>Git</code> plugin.</p>

<p>After that is complete you can begin to set up your project. However, if you are working on a windows machine you will want to change your Git to <code>JGit</code>. First, click on <code>Manage Jenkins</code> then click on <code>Global Configuration Tool</code>. Delete the default Git that was added there and click on Add Git. Select JGit then hit Save at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Navigate back to Dashboard and click on Create a Job. Select Freestyle Project and give your project a meaningful name. I called mine <code>Okta_Jenkins</code>. Click Ok and you will be brought to your project page. Navigate to Source Code Management and select Git. Enter the path for your project from your git repository. Add your credentials using the Jenkins Credentials Provider. Specify which branch your want to build.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Finally, under the Build section add a new task with the Execute Windows batch command option. Add the following lines of code.</p>

   <code>dotnet publish
cd Okta_Jenkins\bin\Debug\net5.0\publish
set Okta:Domain={yourOktaDomain}
set Okta:ClientId={yourClientId}
set Okta:ClientSecret={yourClientSecret}
set Okta:CallbackPath=/okta/callback
dotnet Okta_Jenkins.dll
</code>   

<p></p>

<p>The first line of code here will publish your application. Next, you want to switch your working directory to the publish directory. Next, you need to set your environment variables. There are a few different ways you can do this but the idea is that your <code>appsettings.json</code> in your git repository will not be populated with your sensitive values. Therefore you will need to set them on your server. The environment variables will override any values in the <code>appsettings</code> file.</p>

<p>Finally, you want to run your application by calling <code>dotnet</code> with the dll.</p>

<p>Navigate back to your project dashboard and click Build Now. After a moment you should be able to click on the build on the left pane. In there click Console Output and you should see a message telling you that the application is now running on <code>http://localhost:5000</code> and <code>https://localhost:5001</code>. Open your browser and navigate to either URL and you should see your application running.</p>

 Conclusions 

<p>By combining .NET5 and Okta you can quickly and easily build a secure web application on the latest framework from Microsoft. By adding Jenkins you have now created a modern and powerful CI/CD pipeline that can set up multiple environments in a flash, run automated testing, and publish your project.</p>

<p>You can find all the code from this tutorial on GitHub, in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-jenkins-ci-app-secrets-dotnet">okta-jenkins-ci-app-secrets-dotnet</a> repository.</p>

<p>Introduction: Blockchain Technology Exacerbate Climate&nbsp;Change?</p>Aergo Intends On Being A Net-Zero Carbon Blockchain By 2030, With A Mandate That Block Producers Must Be Net-Carbon Zero.<p>It is evident that the utilization of energy has become a focal, social and political issue that has become a topic of discussion for the last half-century and has expanded well into the 21st century. Recently, there has been massive argument surrounding the efficiency of blockchain and how/if Proof-Of-Work exacerbates an already fragile climate. Blockchain has unfortunately utilized the same amount of energy as 159 individual nations; from a global perspective, that is roughly 75% of all nations that exist on the Earth: a staggering statistic indeed.</p><p>AERGO is looking to solve this issue through its Delegated-Proof-Of-Stake consensus model. AERGO’s blockchain operability isn’t accompanied by centralized mining farms that contribute to energy inefficiencies and non-friendly environmental tactics to create blocks. AERGO utilizes a Delegated-Proof-Of-Stake model that mandates block-producers become net-carbon zero and will consistently give preference the corporate entities that perpetuate this&nbsp;vision.</p><p>The method of centralized mining farms to mine Bitcoin has become a prominent topic of discussion, as mining is the consequence of this blossoming technology. As the evolution of blockchain has expanded tremendously in the last five years, energy consumption conceived by competing miners and mining farms has also increased as Bitcoin reaches inconceivable prices, which has drawn entities to garner an insatiable desire to mine Bitcoin in large quantities for massive profits. Miners are unfortunately at the heart of this issue that must be resolved to combat climate&nbsp;change.</p><p>Miners: The Life's-Blood Of Blockchain Inefficient Energy&nbsp;Output</p>Is Bitcoin To Blame; Or The Method Of&nbsp;Mining?<p>During the first few years of Bitcoin’s life, its value against the dollar was inherently worthless. Over the last eight years, Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies valuation as a whole, has skyrocketed tremendously, thus leading larger groups of centralized entities to build mining farms that utilize immense amounts of energy that has lead to this topic of discussion. Imagine, for a second, how much energy output it must take for tens of thousands of miners to solve complex mathematical equations to garner Bitcoin. The underlying technology, blockchain, unfortunately perpetuates this notion because the cost of running a blockchain is passed on through transaction fees. Fortunately, environmentally friendly blockchain entities are emerging such as the Crypto Climate Accord, which AERGO has joined and how plans to become a net-zero carbon blockchain through the transition of net-zero carbon mining through its DPOS consensus paradigm.</p><p>Green Energy Blockchain Mining: Proof-Of-Work vs. Proof Of&nbsp;Stake</p>Green Blockchain Energy Paradigms Are Now Emerging Through DPOS: But How Do POW And POS&nbsp;Differ?<p>There are many methods on how blockchain mining can become environmentally friendly and practically efficient. Solar panels and allowing for mining via the cloud (such as what company Genesis Mining does) are efficient fixes to solve the crypto climate dilemma. Energy efficient blockchain systems have now come to the forefront by eliminating the competition of Proof-Of-Work consensus models by implementing Proof-Of-Stake/Delegated Proof-Of-Stake models like&nbsp;AERGO.</p><p>In Proof-Of-Work consensus algorithms such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, miners compete with each-other to problem-solve at a faster rate than the other to mine blocks. A plethora of machines operating consistently, competing with one another, with lead to a plethora of problems, and energy consumption highlights such a notion. In Proof-Of-Stake, “validators” not “miners” validate the network based on the algorithm of the amount of cryptocurrency that is “staked” or provided by the validator to the network. It is important to note that Ethereum is slowly transitioning to a proof-of-stake paradigm.</p><p>AERGO’S Environmental Idealism Into Vision Through DPOS: A Clean Energy Representative Democracy.</p>AERGO’S Delegated Proof Of Stake (DPOS), A Green Energy Model And Representative Democracy<p>Energy efficiency is a major talking-point within the blockchain community, and Proof-Of-Stake models are at the forefront of this growing discussion. Delegated Proof-Of-Stake, however, embodies not only the notions of efficiency and an environmentally conscious consensus model, but perpetuates the concept of representative democracy as well. AERGO envisioned a concept for their blockchain that successfully amalgamated Proof-Of-Work with with the Byzantine Agreement consensus model. In essence, a Byzantine Agreement model guarantees instant block finality while requiring a set of parties to agree on a value even if one of the parties are corrupted. AERGO envisioned a representative democracy that is clean energy and representative to the populace of the network; a community that thrives allows a project to&nbsp;survive.</p><p>AERGO emphasizes the right of generating blocks to set block producers, while allowing a reorganization of these block producers through a finite range. By following a Proof-Of-Stake model with only a limited amount of block producers, AERGO addresses multiple performance issues. AERGO prevents an excessive amount of energy consumption from occurring from an ever-growing amount of block producers like what occurs in a Proof-Of-Work system such as Bitcoin. Simultaneously, AERGO gives a voice to its token holders, an important value proposition in any Proof-Of-Stake network; it gives token holders a voice in their investment and prevents them from staying on the outskirts as voiceless entities who just bought the token. Block producers must produces blocks in the allotted time given and AERGO stakers can freely vote for numerous different block producers (though they can choose one per-day to avoid an excessively dynamic and unpredictable environment for block producers).

These paradigm of virtues must accompany the vision’s of blockchain companies if we’re to hope for any type of mass adoption. Companies like AERGO, who have recently joined the Crypto Climate Accord (which is inspired by the Paris Climate Accord), will be on the forefront of this idealism through further collaboration with the Accord, providing preference to net-zero carbon companies, and a Delegated-Proof-Of-Stake paradigm that eliminates the competition of Proof-Of-Work.

 GiD Report#167 — Is Facebook a monopoly? <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-166-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-big-tech-antitrust-bills-83ac623cf3c1">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>ICYMI — The most popular XRP wallet, XUMM, has <a href="https://twitter.com/myglobal_id/status/1410302762823434252">integrated GlobaliD</a>!</p><p>This week:</p>  Judge throws out Facebook antitrust case  What people are&nbsp;saying  This week in Facebook and antitrust  “Social networks face an identity&nbsp;crisis”  Tweet of the&nbsp;week  Stuff happens   1. The antitrust lawsuit against Facebook gets dismissed Photo: Anthony&nbsp;Quintano<p>We’ve been talking quite a bit about Lina Khan, Big Tech, and antitrust. The big news last week was that a federal judge <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-ftc-ruling-brakes-tech-antitrust-c5079818-97a6-446a-ba0f-aa9e5d92d631.html">dismissed parallel lawsuits</a> filed against Facebook by the FTC and a coalition of state attorney generals.</p><p>The takeaway? Legally pinning Facebook as a monopoly is a tough task despite “conventional wisdom.” (And maybe the FTC and state AGs were a bit unprepared for this first go&nbsp;around.)</p><p>As Judge James Boasberg&nbsp;noted:</p><blockquote>“It is almost as if the agency expects the court to simply nod to the conventional wisdom that Facebook is a monopolist.”</blockquote><p>Part of the issue is the definition of monopoly power — the ability to jack up prices beyond the market rate. But Facebook is essentially free. And Mark Zuckerberg would argue that they have plenty of competitors in the form of TikTok, YouTube, Discord,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-06-29/facebook-victory-against-the-ftc-is-an-antitrust-lesson-in-monopoly-power-kqi8jeku">Matt Levine with a counterpoint</a>:</p><blockquote>That said, the government’s position is not crazy, it’s just not fleshed out, so the judge dismissed the complaint but suggested that the FTC should try again with a bit more specificity.[2] Perhaps the FTC will re-file a complaint making clearer arguments that Facebook has market power, and then it can move on to debate whether Facebook abused that power by, for instance, excluding competitors.[3] Here at Bloomberg Opinion, <a href="https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/24305256.68914/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjEtMDYtMjgvZmFjZWJvb2stcy1jbGltYi10by0xLXRyaWxsaW9uLW5lZWRzLWFuLWFzdGVyaXNr/57d8173a3f92a424d68db1c2B0286af7b">Tae Kim writes</a> that “it shouldn’t be difficult for the agency to come up with the required backup,” and that “it’s also likely any renewed legal action will be formidable.”</blockquote><p>Also, Facebook just became a trillion dollar&nbsp;company.</p> 2. And here’s what everyone else is&nbsp;saying <p><a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-ftc-ruling-brakes-tech-antitrust-c5079818-97a6-446a-ba0f-aa9e5d92d631.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Why it matters: The rulings show just how tough it will be for regulators at the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department to make their charges of tech malfeasance stick.</blockquote><blockquote>Yes, but: It could also strengthen the hand of lawmakers who argue that today’s outdated antitrust laws lack the teeth to restrain the power wielded by Google, Facebook, Amazon and&nbsp;Apple.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Between the lines: Antitrust prosecutions remain dauntingly complex and forbiddingly difficult to&nbsp;clinch.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/technology/facebook-ftc-lawsuit.html">NYTimes</a>:</p><blockquote>Courts have narrowed interpretations of antitrust laws over the years, making government cases difficult to win. Last week, the House Judiciary Committee advanced six bills that would overhaul antitrust laws, with the goal of loosening the influence that the big companies have over wide swaths of the&nbsp;economy.</blockquote><blockquote>“Today’s development in the F.T.C.’s case against Facebook shows that antitrust reform is urgently needed,” said Representative Ken Buck, a Republican from Colorado and a co-sponsor of the antitrust bills. “Congress needs to provide additional tools and resources to our antitrust enforcers to go after Big Tech companies engaging in anticompetitive conduct.”</blockquote><blockquote>Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri and a critic of Big Tech, said on Twitter that the court had acknowledged Facebook’s “massive market power but essentially shrugged its shoulders.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-judge-dismisses-government-antitrust-lawsuits-against-facebook-11624907747?mod=hp_lead_pos4">WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>The rulings dealt a direct, early blow to bipartisan government efforts to pursue Big Tech giants on allegations they have unlawfully monopolized the marketplace. They also served as a reminder that antitrust cases — particularly against dynamic tech-sector firms that offer free, nontraditional products — can be difficult to win before federal courts that have narrowed the reach of antitrust laws over several&nbsp;decades.</blockquote><blockquote>“This really stings for the agencies,” said George Washington University law professor William Kovacic, a former FTC chairman. “The FTC and the states I’m sure used the best talent they had to bring these cases, and they have been knocked out at the earliest&nbsp;stage.”</blockquote><blockquote>Even if the FTC is able to successfully amend its lawsuit, he added, “this adds complexity and delay to a case that was already going to be difficult.”</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/29/business/dealbook/facebook-antitrust-ftc.html">Dealbook</a>:</p><blockquote>The ruling is a blow to the antitrust movement that is gaining momentum in Washington. The biggest takeaway from the case is this: The monopoly case against one of Big Tech’s key players is out of step with the law as currently written. What needs to be established is whether what Facebook is doing, as defined by the law and rulings in other cases, is illegal. The answer seems to be&nbsp;no.</blockquote><blockquote>The judge’s ruling also added evidence for those who say the law is not up to the task of keeping Big Tech in check. Legislative efforts took a step forward last week when the House Judiciary Committee advanced six bills that would overhaul antitrust laws, with the goal of reining in tech giants. But this also puts Lina Khan, the Big Tech critic who now chairs the F.T.C., in a tricky spot. If the F.T.C. amends and refiles its case against Facebook, Khan would need to balance arguments that Facebook is violating law as it currently stands with support for efforts, as she has backed in the past, for Congress to introduce new legal&nbsp;tools.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/judge-s-facebook-ruling-embarrasses-ftc-states">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>The milder rebuke of the FTC suggests the ruling may prove a mere speed bump in the government’s case, rather than a brick wall bringing the entire case to a halt. But the rulings are a reminder that, despite the deluge of coverage by the news media about the antitrust battle against big tech, nothing is guaranteed. And that has particular significance for the FTC’s new chair, Lina Khan, who is seen as a critic of big tech. She has previously argued that current approaches to antitrust law don’t address the scope of Amazon’s power. For Khan, and other tech critics, the rulings make it even more important that Congress pass the antitrust bills targeting big&nbsp;tech.</blockquote> 3.

<p>Privacy changes from big tech are coming thick and fast right now. Some are solid privacy commitments, like Apple’s&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/apples-new-att-and-why-facebook-is-hitting-back-hard/">ATT</a>&nbsp;and Google’s abolition of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/google-makes-genuine-privacy-move-by-scrapping-ad-ids-for-users-who-opt-out-of-targeted-ads/">Ad IDs</a>&nbsp;for users who opt out of tracking. But others are underwhelming from a privacy perspective, like Google’s&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/google-pushes-privacy-but-can-a-leopard-really-change-its-spots/">planned abolition of third party cookies</a>&nbsp;and its new Google Play&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/googles-safety-section-doesnt-really-keep-pace-with-apple/">safety section&nbsp;</a>which doesn’t raise the bar anywhere near as far as&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/12/apple-forces-data-privacy-further-into-the-spotlight/">Apple privacy labels</a>.</p>



<p>The latest big privacy announcement comes from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8/">Apple</a>, with its raft of privacy and security measures to launch in updates&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/">iOS</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey-preview/">macOS</a>&nbsp;this fall. The new features are designed to help users better control and manage apps’ access to their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>. Apple promises users “deeper insights and more granular control than ever before.” And individual control is what is at the core of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;after all, right?</p>



<p>And, we have to say, with these changes Apple has got a lot of things right for consumer privacy. While some of the biggest moves are security measures, we like most of what we see from the privacy ones.</p>



<p>That’s not to say Apple is offering a complete fix for protecting consumer data privacy. Users absolutely still need the privacy capabilities baked into&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;and available through&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, which is why we’re going to look at what Apple is offering against what we already offer:&nbsp;</p>



 iCloud Private Relay 



<p></p>



<p>Apple says:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Private Relay is a new internet privacy service that’s built right into iCloud, allowing users to connect to and browse the web in a more secure and private way. When browsing with Safari, Private Relay ensures all traffic leaving a user’s device is encrypted, so no one between the user and the website they are visiting can access and read it, not even Apple or the user’s network provider. All the user’s requests are then sent through two separate internet relays. The first assigns the user an anonymous IP address that maps to their region but not their actual location. The second decrypts the web address they want to visit and forwards them to their destination. This separation of information protects the user’s privacy because no single entity can identify both who a user is and which sites they visit.”</p>



<p>We say:</p>



<p>Private Relay is like a VPN or Tor in that it masks data by running it through relays. With a VPN from a quality provider, the user is trusting a single vendor with their data. If they choose vendor wisely, VPN is also a safe and private option.&nbsp;If iCloud Private Relay is thought of as a simplified version of Tor, then wider ownership and control of the relay servers would be desirable.</p>



<p>Apple is asking for trust to deliver this service, which is fine, but it’s not offering&nbsp;choice. The user can only access it from a Safari browser. If all the user does is in the Apple ecosystem and they use a Safari browser, this is a fine solution. But if users want choice and alternatives, they’d look to MySudo’s&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/09/the-3-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-browser-in-mysudo/">private browser</a>, and Safe Browser, Safe Browser Extension and the VPN in&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Safe Browser is a full-featured web browser that isolates user data from the default web browser that comes with their device. Their browsing history, bookmarks and settings are encrypted and never leave the device.</p>



<p>Safe Browser allows the user to open multiple tabs, view full screen video in landscape and portrait, and bookmark favourite sites.</p>



<p>For added safety and privacy, Safe Browser comes with a built-in ad and tracker blocker and a site reputation shield. The site reputation shield checks for known malicious sites on the device and warns the user before they visit them. The user can also enable biometric or PIN access for an extra layer of security.</p>



<p>Sudo Platform VPN is a completely secure VPN that supports streaming and geographical relocation.&nbsp;</p>



 Hide My Email 



<p></p>



<p>Apple says:</p>



<p>“Expanding on the capabilities of Sign in with Apple, Hide My Email lets users share unique, random email addresses that forward to their personal inbox anytime they wish to keep their personal email address private. Built directly into Safari, iCloud settings, and Mail, Hide My Email also enables users to create and delete as many addresses as needed at any time, helping give users control of who is able to contact them.”</p>



<p>We say:</p>



<p>Hide My Email validates MySudo’s&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/dr-paul-ashley-presents-on-how-to-solve-the-privacy-problem/">multi Sudo approach</a>. Disposable or one-off email like Apple is offering is great, but sometimes users want to link their private email to other privacy capabilities like a&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-6-big-benefits-of-using-the-phone-numbers-in-mysudo/">phone number</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-7-big-benefits-of-using-virtual-cards-in-mysudo/">virtual card</a>, as they can in&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/mysudo-private-secure/">MySudo</a>. If a user is a committed Apple customer and happy to use only Safari and Apple Mail, then this feature is great. But if that’s not the case, then users still need a private email solution with greater functionality. Identity is more than email and that what’s we at Anonyome Labs have known for years. Proof:&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-5-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-email-in-mysudo/">MySudo email</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/secure-communications/encrypted-email/">Sudo Platform encrypted email</a>.</p>



 Mail Privacy Protection&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Apple says:</p>



<p>“In the Mail app, Mail Privacy Protection stops senders from using invisible pixels to collect information about the user. The new feature helps users prevent senders from knowing when they open an email, and masks their IP address so it can’t be linked to other online activity or used to determine their location.”</p>



<p>We say:</p>



<p>This is good.&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;offers similar. A lot of marketeers&nbsp;embed&nbsp;invisible pixels in the emails they send to force email servers to make network requests (e.g. to show that an email was opened and from where). We can’t criticize this Apple move, but it is certainly a case of them doing something second but being very good at convincing users it’s novel. And, again, it’s a nice easy solution for committed Apple customers.&nbsp;</p>



 Improved Intelligent Tracking Prevention&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>Apple says:&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For a number of years, Intelligent Tracking Prevention has helped protect Safari users from unwanted tracking by using on-device machine learning to stop trackers while allowing websites to function normally. This year, Intelligent Tracking Prevention is getting even stronger by also hiding the user’s IP address from trackers. This means they can’t utilize the user’s IP address as a unique identifier to connect their activity across websites and build a profile about them.”</p>



<p>We say:</p>



<p>This is a good feature.&nbsp;This type of anti-tracking capability is great, and the embedded browser in MySudo&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/09/the-3-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-browser-in-mysudo/">private browser</a>&nbsp;has this capability too. But&nbsp;where we offer a significant but complementary difference is in&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalization</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you know, compartmentalization means&nbsp;categorizing and separating the user’s personal data to reduce the impact when it is compromised. It’s the world’s&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalizing-your-private-data-is-simple-with-mysudo/">most powerful data privacy strategy</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;was created on the exact same principle.&nbsp;MySudo is based around&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>, a&nbsp;customizable digital identity that intentionally differentiates from the user’s personal identity and mitigates the risk to their highly sensitive&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/10/14-real-life-examples-of-personal-data-you-definitely-want-to-keep-private-plus-how-to-do-it/">personal data</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In MySudo, our exemplar consumer privacy app, a user can create up to nine different Sudos and use them in any context (e.g. for banking, selling on classifieds, catching up with friends, and booking travel).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each Sudo has its own set of attributes and associated capabilities:&nbsp;</p>



  name  phone number  address  email address  <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/04/mysudo-virtual-cards-are-here-making-the-safest-way-to-live-online-now-even-safer/">virtual cards</a>&nbsp;for secure shopping  browser profile (all your bookmarks and any cookies that sites set are compartmentalized to the browsing Sudo)  notification settings for phone, email and message  contacts and more.  



<p>The user gives each of their Sudos one or more identity attributes that are different from their personal identity. They can make their Sudo identity a little different (e.g. by having a different phone number) or very different (e.g. by having a different name, email address, phone number,&nbsp;virtual cards, contacts, etc.). They label each Sudo and can even assign a different notification sound to each.</p>



<p>Users structure their Sudos to achieve the degrees of privacy, safety, organization and convenience they need. For example, they might regard their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cybersecurity-hospitals-idUSKCN0HJ21I20140924">medical information</a>&nbsp;as more sensitive than their financial information, and their financial information as more sensitive than who they know. They decide what suits them. (Listen to how two of the world’s leading privacy experts Michael Bazzell and Justin Carroll structure their Sudos in this episode of The Privacy, Security, &amp; OSINT Show:&nbsp;<a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-98066669/034-our-sudo-strategies">Our Sudo Strategies</a>.)</p>



<p>Sometimes the user might want to let one of their Sudos retain some of the benefits of ‘privacy invasive’ searching and tracking online. Health information is a great example. When researching a health condition, the user may want some level of tracking in order to preserve their search history, mark favorites, set bookmarks, be offered search results relevant to their previous searching, receive discount coupons for remedies, be offered new research material, or even be referred to doctors or hospitals specializing in their condition. By using a Sudo, the user can still have all these benefits, but they’re not correlated to the user’s personal data.</p>



<p>The bottom line is MySudo private browser is more nuanced than Apple’s offering and gives the user more of that granular control Apple is talking about, which is essential to privacy.</p>



<p>Overall, Apple’s latest privacy enhancements are good, and even more great validation that we’re working on the right stuff. Check it out here:&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a></p>

<p>We’re pleased to announce that the Dock mainnet has successfully transitioned to Proof of Stake (PoS) network today. This is a major milestone for the Dock community which can now play an active role in securing and running the Dock network.</p><p>The transition to PoS further decentralizes the network by expanding the validator pool to 50 concurrent validators (there may be several hundred vying for top 50 spots) who are selected based on the amount of Dock tokens they have staked. This also marks a transition to more open governance with token holders being able to elect council members and vote on proposals.<br></p><p>To ensure that the new mainnet is safe to use, we have worked with the security experts at <a href="https://solidified.io/">Solidified</a> in partnership with <a href="https://cryptonics.consulting/security-and-diligence/">Cryptonics Consulting</a> to perform an audit of the network. The final report from the auditors shows that all issues identified have been resolved or acknowledged by the Dock team and is publicly available on our <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/dock-substrate/blob/master/audit-reports/Dock%20PoS%20-%20Audit%20Report%20%5B20210706%5D.pdf">Github</a>.<br></p><p>Please follow the following links on how to participate in the network as a <a href="https://blog.dock.io/nominating-validators-on-docks-proof-of-stake-network/">nominator</a> or a <a href="https://blog.dock.io/how-validation-works-in-docks-proof-of-stake/">validator</a> and we will follow up soon with an additional article on how governance works in the new mainnet. You can also learn more by reading our <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn">docs</a>, and please feel free to reach out to us via <a href="https://twitter.com/docknetwork">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/feW8KGf7r3">Discord</a> with any questions.<br><br>We hope you enjoy the new mainnet as much as we enjoyed creating it!</p>

I’ve used GPG for years, but it didn’t really "click" for me until I sat down and wrote this post.

 Why Use a YubiKey? 
 
 
<p>A YubiKey is a hardware-based authentication device that can securely store secret keys. Once a private key is written to your YubiKey, it cannot be recovered. Keeping secrets off your computer is more secure than storing them on your computer’s hard drive—another application could read your SSH keys from the <code>~/.ssh</code> folder.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Each type of YubiKey supports a variety of different "interfaces," each with different use cases.  Many people associate a YubiKey with generating long one-time passwords (OTP) that look like this:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cccjgjgkhcbbirdrfdnlnghhfgrtnnlgedjlftrbdeut</code> 
 
 
 
<p>However, generating one-time passwords is just a small slice of what you can do with a YubiKey. In this post, I’ll be talking about the OpenPGP interface and how you can use it for authentication.</p>
 
 






If you don’t own a YubiKey, you can still follow along and skip the YubiKey parts.



 
 
 
 
 What Is OpenPGP? 
 
 
<p>OpenPGP is a specification (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4880">RFC-4880</a>), which describes a protocol for using public-key cryptography for encryption, signing, and key exchange, based on the original <a href="https://www.philzimmermann.com/">Phil Zimmermann</a> work of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP).</p>
 
 
<p>There is often confusion between PGP and Gnu Privacy Guard (GnuPG or GPG), probably because of the inverted acronym. Sometimes these terms are used interchangeably, but GPG is an implementation of the OpenPGP specification (and arguably the most popular one).</p>
 
 
<p>You may have seen "Verified" badges on GitHub commits that use OpenPGP to confirm an author’s identity.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 Set Up and Configure a GPG Key 
 
 
<p>First, you need to generate a GPG key. You could do this directly on a YubiKey. However, you can NOT back up the keys once they are on the device. So instead, I’ll generate a GPG key on my computer, and once I have everything working, I’ll permanently move it to my YubiKey.</p>
 
 
<p>Start by generating a new key using <code>gpg</code>. If you already have a key, you can skip this first step:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>gpg --full-generate-key</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
   (9) ECC (sign and encrypt) *default*
  (10) ECC (sign only)
  (14) Existing key from card
Your selection? 1 (1)
RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (3072) 4096 (2)
Requested keysize is 4096 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      &lt;n&gt;  = key expires in n days
      &lt;n&gt;w = key expires in n weeks
      &lt;n&gt;m = key expires in n months
      &lt;n&gt;y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 2y (3)
Key expires at Sat Jun  3 15:08:09 2023 EDT
Is this correct? (y/N) y (4)

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Brian Demers (5)
Email address: Brian.Demers@okta.com (6)
Comment: bdemers test key (7)
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Brian Demers (bdemers test key) &lt;Brian.Demers@okta.com&gt;"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o (8)</code> 
 
 
 


1
Create an RSA key.


2
Set the key size to 4096.


3
Expire in 2 years, you can extend the expiration later.


4
Enter your name.


5
Enter your email address.


6
Enter an optional comment.


7
You will be prompted for a secret passphrase.


8
Press `o' to save and exit.


 
 
 
 
<p>Now you have a key! You can view your secret keys at any time by running:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>gpg --list-secret-keys</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>---------------------------------

1
make a note of the Key ID; you will need this for a few different steps below.


 
 
 
 
<p>Add an authentication sub-key for use with SSH for authentication—more on that below.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gpg --quick-add-key {your-key-id} rsa4096 auth 2y</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you list the secret keys again, you can see the new key and capability:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>gpg --list-secret-keys</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>---------------------------------

1
The primary key, has the capabilities of signing <code>[S]</code> and certification <code>[C]</code>.


2
The encryption <code>[E]</code> subkey.


3
The new authentication <code>[A]</code> subkey.


 
 
 
 
<p>Now that you have your newly minted key, back them up!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Back Up Your GPG Keys 
 
 
<p>Backups of your GPG keys should be stored offline. You are going through the process of securely storing your keys on a YubiKey, don’t leave your backup hanging around on disk.</p>
 
 






Pick a backup strategy that works for you, anything from storing the keys on a USB stick in a lock box, to a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Paperkey">printed paper key</a>, or you could <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/dnssec/root-signing-ceremony/">go all out</a>.



 
 
<p>Run the following commands to export the keys and trust store.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>gpg --armor --export &gt; public-keys.asc (1)
gpg --armor --export-secret-keys &gt; private-keys.asc (2)
gpg --export-ownertrust &gt; ownertrust.asc (3)

# Create a revocation certificate, in case you need lose your key
gpg --armor --gen-revoke {your-key-id} &gt; revocation.asc (4)
# Select 1 for "Key has been compromised"</code> 
 
 
 


1
Export all public keys.


2
Export all private keys.


3
Export the trust store.


4
Create a revocation certificate as well. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/faq/gnupg-faq.html#define_rev_cert">GnuPG docs</a> to learn more about key revocation.


 
 
 
 






The <code>--armor</code> argument outputs the key in a PEM format.



 
 
<p>If you ever need to restore your keys from this backup, you can run:</p>
 
 
 
 <code># restore public keys
gpg --import public-keys.asc
# restore private keys
gpg --import private-keys.asc
# restore trust store
gpg --import-ownertrust ownertrust.asc</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Enable Your GPG Key for SSH 
 
 
<p>There are a few moving parts needed to expose your new GPG key in a way that your SSH client will use them. Initially, this part confused me the most and left me jumping between blog posts and various Stack Overflow questions (many of which were out of date).</p>
 
 
<p>Working backward from the SSH client:
- The SSH client reads the <code>SSH_AUTH_SOCK</code> environment variable; it contains the location of a Unix socket managed by an agent.
- A <code>gpg-agent</code> running in the background controls this socket and allows your GPG key to be used for authentication.</p>
 
 






<code>gpg-agent</code> can replace the need for <code>ssh-agent</code>.



 
 
<p>Enable SSH support using standard sockets by updating the <code>~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf</code> file:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>echo "enable-ssh-support" &gt;&gt; ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
echo "use-standard-socket" &gt;&gt; ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Next, you will need to find the "keygrip" for the authentication key; this is different from the key id, run:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>gpg --list-secret-keys --with-keygrip</code>

1
Don’t confuse the Key ID with the "keygrip"


2
The "keygrip" for the authentication <code>[A]</code> key.


 
 
 
 
<p>Update <code>~/.gnupg/sshcontrol</code> with the authentication "keygrip"; this allows the gpg-agent to use this key with SSH.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>echo {keygrip} &gt;&gt; ~/.gnupg/sshcontrol</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Configure your shell environment to use <code>gpg-agent</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code># configure SSH to use GPG
echo 'export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)' &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc

# start gpg-agent, if it isn't started already
echo 'gpgconf --launch gpg-agent' &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
echo 'gpg-connect-agent /bye' &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
# the docs say to use: gpg-connect-agent /bye

# Set an environment variable to tell GPG the current terminal.
echo 'export GPG_TTY=$(tty)' &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc</code> 
 
 
 






The <code>gpg-agent</code> is started automatically the first time it is used. However, to make sure it is running and available for SSH, it needs to be run when your shell starts.



 
 
<p>Open a new terminal session and run <code>ssh-add -L</code>; if everything is working correctly, your public key in SSH format will be output to your console:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQC66/kO8H70GENVLxdD6ZBaRKzj5iDmhUpjFw1WzQmFe+O/dW8FpIXtuZX7QxtV+fqCaK6zbMPfKcUTfogRPdUtzzy/1Ik5WOAfJRF/woL6rMpId0klLalAJ4etOq2X3izBY8RhdiBGPOBPWl9bVTMcvrxIJqcO61FUC0vfwcXX/0GnQ+CnnA2c3CoeZAJbVFWSjo3imii26DdcfL3S0++6yN1y8EFr6BXh7S50Wog/c3CjgyM9t8Hiew/6XpB4deHWEPKkjn/TquRrg1xoFlCkz8w4NJ+jjkhhn8zZ0pcL9fk6VlkzkGiA1ADaEYj+ji0yKvenjrMiiM2FxHEcnTyXsAJkw/3iSxkQ2CpnWjg+BMZnV0inCH9KGvgQcZ3NF6hLuCi1wWP9TA1pVIcLVsDXJrwAnKYyrngWF1O2eI60x2I6ySQUJd1bExYWt2M50V5SynqKWUiYcRecLrO3/wPKzdUsYSNgCcwRSE4pXabAzTsre/WOp7MPQZ9tqWp1tPjyg+wn5UeQ21j0Fm3pZ4EWhBDQmPjm6y9tLv0kzoR8gmqa1KfSqwWyCl3FrNkT1wixxjQL1DVhVy3Kqoy5HA/z30hhkd5BSaqqouykirS/fmFE+k5pwZ/TVwf7BlC1AFNH0AzlCqoWt8s7wFsMUKsVkhZmYaHU52EIvn5rwPcUQQ== (none)</code> 
 
 
 






If you don’t see any output, try restarting the agent with the following command: <code>gpg-connect-agent reloadagent /bye</code>



 
 
 
 
 Test Your GPG Keys with GitHub 
 
 
<p>Now that I have GPG configured on my computer, the next thing is to make sure everything is working correctly.</p>
 
 
<p>Log in to GitHub and go the Settings → <a href="https://github.com/settings/keys">SSH and GPG</a> page. Copy the output from <code>ssh-add -L</code> and add a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account">new SSH key</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>On the same page <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-new-gpg-key-to-your-github-account">add your GPG key</a>, copy the value from <code>gpg --armor --export {your-key-id}</code>.</p>
 
 






On macOS, you can pipe the output directly to your clipboard using <code>pbcopy</code>, for example, <code>ssh-add -L | pbcopy</code>.



 
 
<p>Once you have your key configured, you can open an SSH connection to GitHub:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>ssh git@github.com</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The session will close immediately but will print a message:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>Hi bdemers! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
Connection to github.com closed.</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Woot! Everything is working!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Use a Graphical Pin Entry Program 
 
 
<p>If you would rather use a graphical application to enter your passphrase, you can install an alternative "pinentry" program.  For example, on macOS:</p>
 
 
 
 <code># install a GUI pin entry program
brew install pinentry-mac

# configure gpg-agent to use this pinentry application
echo "pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac" &gt;&gt; ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf

# Restart gpg-agent
gpg-connect-agent reloadagent /bye</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sign Git Commits 
 
 
<p>Signing your commits is the only way to prove you are the author. Without a signature, someone could easily impersonate you by setting the name and email on a commit to match your information.</p>
 
 
<p>Configure Git to sign commits and tags automatically takes a few global properties; you want that "Verified" label on GitHub, don’t you 😉:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git config --global commit.gpgsign true
git config --global tag.gpgSign true
git config --global user.signingkey {your-key-id}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Your next commit will be signed, and you can double-check this by running <code>git log --show-signature</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>commit 85e0174d961f44666d8ffc7000e81df22eea13c6

 Setting Up a YubiKey 
 
 
<p>You didn’t need a YubiKey to complete any of the above GPG setup. Without one, though, I don’t think I’d go through setting up GPG + SSH authentication. Using standard SSH keys will offer the same level of security with less complexity. As I mentioned above, the goal was to move keys off my computer, and into the secure storage of the YubiKey.</p>
 
 
<p>One of the first things I do when I get a new YubiKey is to disable the keyboard functions. Unfortunately, I found myself accidentally touching the device, only to have it spew out a long set of characters; this is an excellent feature if you use it, but if you don’t, it can easily be disabled.</p>
 
 
<p>Open up the YubiKey Manager Application, select the Interfaces tab, and disable "OTP," "PIV," and "OATH" interfaces, and press the Save Interfaces button; the result will look something like this:</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Open up a terminal and run <code>gpg --card-status</code>, to display information about your device.</p>
 
 






GPG refers to devices as "smartcards", so any time you see the term "card" it refers to your YubiKey.

Move the primary key to the smartcard.


2
Switch to key 1, the encryption key.


3
The selected key is marked with a <code>*</code>. If you do not see a selected key that means the primary <code>key 0</code> has been selected.


4
Run <code>keytocard</code> again.


5
Deselect <code>key 1</code>.


6
Repeat the process for <code>key 2</code> the authentication key.


7
You know the drill <code>keytocard</code>


8
All done! Exit and save changes.


 
 
 
 






After moving your keys to smartcard like a YubiKey, running the <code>gpg --list-secret-keys</code> command will show a greater-than symbol <code>&gt;</code> next to the <code>sec</code> and <code>ssb</code> listings:



 
 
 
 <code>---------------------------------

<p>The smart card does NOT store your public key, run the <code>fetch</code> sub command to make sure GPG can fetch your key from the GitHub URL specified above:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gpg --edit-card</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>gpg/card&gt; fetch
gpg: requesting key from 'https://github.com/bdemers.gpg'
gpg: key B2EAA49E11DE8CBD: duplicated subkeys detected - merged
gpg: key B2EAA49E11DE8CBD: public key "Brian Demers (bdemers test key) &lt;Brian.Demers@okta.com&gt;" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Use Your GPG Key on Multiple Computers 
 
 
<p>One of the great things about storing your GPG keys on a YubiKey is that you can easily bring the keys to a different device. Since the keys are stored on the smartcard, you simply need to "link" the device’s keys:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gpg --card-edit</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>gpg/card&gt; fetch
gpg: requesting key from 'https://github.com/bdemers.gpg'
gpg: key B2EAA49E11DE8CBD: duplicated subkeys detected - merged
gpg: key B2EAA49E11DE8CBD: public key "Brian Demers (bdemers test key) &lt;Brian.Demers@okta.com&gt;" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1

gpg/card&gt; quit</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Finally, you can confirm the keys have been linked by running <code>gpg --list-secret-keys</code> and look to see if the <code>sec</code> entry is marked with a <code>&gt;</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>---------------------------------

 <code>gpg --edit-key</code> 
 
 
 
 
 <code>...

 The key is not just about the needs, but it is also about trust! 



<p>Rapid developments in digital transformation put pressure on businesses to constantly update and adapt to new technology. While shifting towards online platforms is already a huge effort, further steps must be taken as service providers are facing immense disruptions, driven by their customers, in every aspect of their business.</p>



 Personalizing customers’ need should be more efficient 



<p>A variety of advertising tools are available to help businesses reach their potential customers, and for users to experience quick and easy access in purchasing what they need. As good as it seems on paper, in practice things do not go so well. Although the filters and algorithms of these tools provide some assistance in personalizing marketing, they could only filter basic information such as demographics, but could not classify more advanced categories. Thus, it brings inconvenience to both parties.</p>



<p>On the one hand, customers are being disturbed with absurd ads popping up on their screen when swiping their feed, or excessive deals being offered as they are trying to participate in a transaction. They are being exposed to too many options, while not all of those options can meet their needs, interests, or capability precisely. This abundance backfires in two possible ways: ignorance or the paradox of choice. Customers might pursue the tendency to disregard all kinds of ads and recommendations so that they could avoid any disturbance on online platforms. The other potential outcome is “The paradox of choice”, a well-known psychological theory by Barry Schawrtz (2007), that indicates the unpleasant experience in decision making when having too many options to choose from.[1] Both ways of behavior lead to disincentives for customers to onboard any services suggested on the site.</p>



<p>While businesses can reach a larger pool of audiences by switching to online transactions, they are still facing the problem of personalizing needs efficiently. Applying technology to precise target the customer segment could escalate their rate of conversions and enhance their customer experience.</p>



 Time is also a crucial key 



<p>Does this customer have this demand and capability to participate in such a transaction at this particular point in time?</p>



<p>While most businesses are mainly focusing on the former challenge, approaching customers on time is also a vital complementary in enhancing customer experience. While online offers are created to increase customer experience, bombarding advertising that appears at any time defeats this main purpose. Customers may receive ads that relate to their interests and yet, it is not what they want at the moment. By repetitively seeing information that they do not need right away,&nbsp; customers tend to neglect these disturbances, which is why using ad-blockers is one common example of how they negatively react towards advertising.&nbsp;</p>







<p>To support businesses in tackling such issues, the concept of embedded finance arises from robust digital transformation. Since embedded finance is a branch of fintech that financial services are integrated into other online platforms, appropriate offers with content tailored to match with customer’s demand and capability as well as appear only when customer need. This optimizes the personalization of customer experience and supports businesses to efficiently convert new clients while working remotely.</p>



<p>Furthermore, integrated services provide customers opportunities to participate in cross-sectoral transactions without going through different intermediates to make their purchases like the traditional ways.[2] Hence, this experience not only serves customers at the right time but also shortens the customer journey.</p>



 A step towards the future of data security and data privacy 



<p>Although Vietnam is still new to the ideas of “data privacy” and “data security,” both of these terms are predicted to become more widespread in the next couple of years as the pace of digitalization is getting faster than ever. Hence, businesses should be aware and get ready before the rising trend as a part of improving customer experiences.</p>



<p>The benefits of digitizing our daily activities are undeniable. Nonetheless, potential threats underneath these benefits could make customers become victims in many fraudulent transactions. Such risks arise from the great possibility of private information leakage while users participate in online activities. While some people might think the results of data leakage would only appear in rare serious cases, the consequences are experienced by the majority in many different forms, namely, telemarketing calls from a company or services that one might have never heard before. An increase of data leaking incidents in the past few years does also raise doubts amongst users when trying new products and services. Therefore, ensuring data security could also help improve customer experience by gaining their trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The need of users in governing and using their own data is interconnected with data security. Customers would want to ensure that their data is used for a precise purpose and benefits them the most. If businesses could provide customers with a more active engagement and a sense of ownership, customer experience can be significantly improved. In order to both meet the rising demand for both data privacy and data security as well as earn the trust from customers, businesses will need to keep up by advancing their technology.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Even though many companies have taken a major step in transitioning their services to online platforms, the robust digital world requires them to make more efforts to stay ahead of the game. While personalizing experiences might be a great gateway for businesses to reach customers remotely, both customer’s needs and the right timing should be acquired in order to optimize its efficiency. Furthermore, businesses may also want to be aware of the rising trends of technology, in which data privacy is one of the distinguished movements.</p>

   The knowledge and skills gap in the cybersecurity industry is a problem that has been identified and discussed for the past 20 years. However, with the rapid acceleration of technology development, the skills gap seems to worsen as time goes by and may soon become a systemic deficiency. In this presentation, I will talk about the first-ever, technical, vendor-neutral credential for cloud auditing.

 Recap: Ontology’s Consensus 2021 Live&nbsp;Session  Transcript of Ontology’s Consensus 2021 live session, featuring Humpty Calderon, Head of Community at Ontology, and Raindy Lu, Ontology’s Head of Marketing and Communication. <p>Humpty Calderon <br>All right and we are live. Welcome everyone who is joining us here, today. My name is Humpty Calderon, Head of Community at Ontology. We also have Raindy, would you like to introduce yourself?</p><p>Raindy Lu <br>Hi everyone, this is Raindy Lu, Head of Marketing and Communication at Ontology, glad to be&nbsp;here.</p><p>Humpty<br>Excellent, so for those of you who are unfamiliar with Ontology, Ontology is a blockchain for self-sovereign identity and data. There is a lot of technology that’s been built to facilitate identity; self-sovereign, credit data, marketplaces, DeFi, etc. If you are interested in getting a snapshot of what that is, you can go to <a href="http://ont.io">ont.io</a> to see a few of the different products and protocols that have been developed like ONT ID, Oscore, Wing Inclusive Pool within Wing, which is the proof of concept of decentralized credit and DeFi. There is ONTO Wallet, of course, which, no secret, is my favorite wallet; multi-chain digital asset management and the easiest way to create your digital identity.</p><p>Once you create an ONT ID, you can see how easy it is for you to do soft verification, hard verification, whatever you need. And then, of course, Saga and DDXF, some of which we are going to talk about today. Anything you wanted to add, Raindy, before we get started on the presentation?</p><p>Raindy<br>That’s fine, please go&nbsp;on.</p><p>Humpty<br> Okay cool, so we have shared a presentation here. If anyone is interested after this call to get access to this, just let us know either in the messages here or through Ontology’s social media or on Telegram. Say “Hey, I saw this really cool pitch deck. I really want to get one of those for myself because I want to learn more, I want to dive into any of these really complex topics to learn more about each of&nbsp;those.”</p><p>So like I said, Ontology is a blockchain for self-sovereign identity and data. In three steps, you can see what Ontology is, what it is offering and its ecosystem. We will probably explore these, step-by-step, throughout the presentation.</p><p>Ontology: high performance public blockchain, distributed collaboration platform; basically means really fast blockchain. Consensus has reached, I believe, finality under one second. So definitely one of the fastest blockchains that exists. It is efficient in terms of gas consumption and you are able to build on it. There is a lot here, maybe there will be a slide here but there is definitely one slide that I like that has to do with how open the blockchain is for developers. It isn’t just locked to those who are familiar with Solidity, for example, which of course is very popular but there are also various languages that you can use. In fact, here it is on this slide, it supports Python, Java, Golang, C++, so definitely it is an on-ramp for developers so that they can start working on blockchain development without necessarily having to learn a different programming language.</p> Ontology Providing DID solutions to Music Streaming Platforms, ROCKI <p>So if we move on through here we can see one of the partners that Ontology has recently onboarded to the blockchain or to its identity, I should say, solution, and that is Rocki. If you are not familiar with who they are they are, they are a music platform that is built for musicians, artists, creators, to share their music in a decentralized way. And as it says here, Ontology and Rocki have developed a strategic partnership to integrate the decentralized identity solutions developed by Ontology to verify their artists. We can certainly dive into that, in fact, I did earlier in today’s call and I have in other conversations that I have posted on Twitter and Clubhouse, where we look at why that is important, why is identity important when it comes to verifying the creator and verifying the digital assets. Of course, authenticity is key, especially if the reason why you are collecting something is because you want to support a particular creator.</p><p>Raindy did you want to add anything about Rocki and in terms of why Ontology sees that project as important and valuable for expanding decentralized identity?</p><p>Raindy<br>Cool, so we talked with Rocki for a long time, since the NFT market is blowing up right now and they do have the requirements about the KYC and AML login system. So they were looking for partners who provide DID solutions and they compared different projects among all the ones that are doing the same thing Ontology does and after the efforts from our both our business and technical team they finally choose Ontology because the think that Ontology is the leading expert in this area. So he objective for both Rocki and Ontology is that we want to transform the traditional login system for every creator on the Rocki platform, from a centralized way to a decentralized way. So through that way, all the users can have the power to control their own data and access without leaking the information to the platform, which is very important and also an innovative way for all the projects who care about protecting users’ identity and data. So through that way, now we are going to build up the whole system and then we will show our community members and also the users how it&nbsp;works.</p><p>I think that there won’t be much difference between the traditional login way and the decentralized way so users can just login like they do now but the new process protects their identity using our DID solution, which is really&nbsp;cool.</p><p>Humpty<br>Yeah, I think another thing worth noting, Rocki is actually built on the Binance Smart Chain. So this is a platform that is operating not an Ontology but it is operating on another blockchain. So it is important to note that Ontology has deployed these identity solutions to other blockchains, right, so can you tell us briefly what some of these blockchains are?</p><p>Raindy<br>Yes, so other than BSC, we are also proving DID solutions to Ethereum, Polkadot, Tron, and all the leading public chains, I would say. So you can find the W3C registration on their official site to see how many DID solutions and registrations are provided by the Ontology Foundation.</p><p>So, I think, no matter whether we’re talking about ONT ID or OScore, it is not only limited to Ontology chain and the ecosystem, it should be to the whole blockchain ecosystem. So we are supporting more applications and Rocki is a good start to encourage more projects building on BSC to consider DID solutions that can be employed on their projects.</p><p>Humpty<br>Absolutely, I really love that idea of interoperability and the portability of that identity. Because if you are creating identity solutions and you are locking them within a particular protocol, be it a platform like this or just one blockchain, there is value to the users but that value is&nbsp;limited.</p><p>It’s great that what Ontology is building in ONT ID d and OScore and all these other identity protocols is that interoperability. Because that way individuals who may, for example, utilize their identity on Binance Smart Chain, could take that identity to another blockchain like Ontology.</p><p>Raindy<br>Yeah, that is the idea, so everyone has their decentralized identity but they don’t want it to be individual. So it should work on all the chains. So that is what we’re doing; clearing all the barriers and limitations between the different chains to realize true cross-chain.</p><p>Humpty<br> Yeah, absolutely, I think over the last couple of years we have seen the value of interoperability, whether that is to create some sort of cross-chain bridge for digital assets or even within DeFi, that composability of these protocols so that they can create a more dynamic ecosystem, I think the same thing is going to be true for identity. There is going to be a need for that interoperability and composability to create richer experiences, a more robust and more secure experience for&nbsp;people.</p><p>Raindy<br>Yeah, definitely.</p><p>Humpty<br> So, just as we say that we show here another on the other slide that Ontology is the only decentralized identity partner for Binance Smart Chain. I think that is valuable to note because of opportunities like we saw on the previous slide where there are developers that are building technology that can leverage these identity solutions that Ontology has delivered to Binance Smart&nbsp;Chain.</p> Ontology &amp; MicroWorkers Partner to Enhance Global Freelancing Marketplaces <p>Humpty<br> Oh, this is a fun one actually so, this was recently announced maybe two months ago, the partnership between Ontology and MicroWorkers. Do you mind sharing a little bit of this because this is definitely not one of the ones that I am most familiar in terms of what MicroWorkers are using and why that is important.</p><p>Raindy<br>Sure, as most of the audience know, we have our own digital assets and data wallet called ONTO. So it is a decentralized and cross-chain crypto&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>So, when MicroWorkers comes to us and says they are looking for a new way to pay freelancers in crypto assets but they lack the devices between the platform and also the way they do it is through fiat. So Ontology has its amazing ONTO Wallet, we are talking deeply to get a way, so through ONTO Wallet it links the freelancers to payroll so they can finish their taxes on the MicroWorkers website. So, there will be multiple tasks to be finished and no matter where they are in the world, they just need to finish the task and they can get&nbsp;paid.</p><p>There is also a new option for them to get rewards via ONTO. Once they click on their ONTO wallet, they get paid in crypto assets and they will get additional rewards provided by ONTO. So through that way, it motivates users try a different way to get rewards and that invites them into the blockchain world.</p><p>So once they try it, they realize that it works very smoothly and there is no difference between a fiat system like Visa or Mastercard and I also get additional rewards. So why not try this new way which also helps people gain exposure to blockchain and crypto assets. So it helps promote crypto foster connections with real assets and the real world. So that is what Ontology is trying to do and additionally, we also give people the chance to try ONT ID. Everyone that gets rewards from ONTO gets an ONT ID, Ontology’s decentralized identity in the crypto world that fully protects their identity and data — this is a great move in the industry, I would&nbsp;say.</p><p>Humpty<br> Yeah, you know I think the one thing that I am hearing from what you are sharing right now is that what Ontology is doing is creating on-ramps for new people to find their way onto blockchain. One of the most difficult things right now is finding people who aren’t already crypto native,&nbsp;right?</p><p>Because a lot of the people that utilize blockchain and cryptocurrencies and DeFi protocols are the same people, so people keep fighting for the attention of the same people, over and over and&nbsp;over.</p><p>I think there is only so much attention people can have but it is very difficult to find new people and to give them a use-case that makes sense for them. Something that you said is, “Oh wow, this is very similar to what I am already using; this is something that I could use not just for this but let me continue to explore this further”, right, because there are those additional incentives and rewards that they are earning with ONTO. Furthermore, they have an identity that got created that’s going to then empower them even further, down the&nbsp;line.</p><p>So, I think that all of these things are really fantastic and just prove to me even further more than I already believe that what Ontology is is a bridge. They don’t just bridge technology, they don’t just bridge protocols, they bridge people, they bridge utility, they bridge decentralize with institutional, I mean I think that is really what Ontology is known for, they are a bridge in the blockchain, so that is really exciting.</p><p>So, here we have a slide that really breaks down what we’ve been talking about for some time now, at least since the beginning of this call, and if you joined us earlier in the call during the community call we dove a little bit into what an ONT ID is but you know I think something to note here is that ONT ID is based on the W3C standard and why is that important. Just like anything else, I think if you are building something from scratch, sure, that is great but if you want to scale, if you want that interoperability, you need to work with standards and I think the fact that ONT ID has been built on that standard is incredibly valuable, and as other projects will certainly create their own identity solutions, it is building with these standards that will allow them to interoperate between each other as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Raindy<br> Yeah, I want to add that from the beginning of the project, we were thinking about interoperability already and how it should be aligned with globalized standards as the official standard. So the W3C is the most widely used one with a good reputation and also it requires high demand on the technical side, so our tech team did make a lot of effort on this&nbsp;side.</p><p>Humpty<br> I think one of the more valuable things that I learned when I started exploring decentralized identity and looking at these W3C standards is the institutional adoption of W3C. We are not looking at just blockchain utilizing these standards, these standards are also used by institutions like Microsoft.</p><p>So, I think one thing that I’ve talked about, of course, all of this is just ideas and concepts because it is a really exciting space because it is so new, but there is a lot of potential for it is, I tell people: if you look at utilizing these standards like W3C, for creating ONT ID, you can imagine that at some point maybe there will be a way for you to interoperate between your institutional software like Microsoft Office, as an example, and then using that at the same time to access you DeFi protocol; it can potentially navigate all of these different systems because they are using standards that have been adopted by institutional developers as much as blockchain developers.</p><p>Raindy<br> Yeah, it is really exciting and also the tech team is getting fully involved in the regulation and standards making so they are attending their technical meetings with the W3C experts to find solutions to get the most balanced and widely used&nbsp;one.</p><p>Humpty<br> I think that that is also super important because regulation is key. When technology is new, it tends to go unregulated because it needs to continue to grow, scale, adapt, evolve, but as things start to become more standardized, regulation comes in and it is important for people, for developers that are building it to have a voice so that we get hopefully a more accurate representation of what the original intent was, even after regulation.</p><p>Raindy<br>Yeah, definitely.</p><p>Humpty<br>Okay, so this is a cool slide. I really like this and in fact I might make this my profile picture for a little while because I like that it shows the rich and deep ecosystem of ONT ID — the number of blockchains that it is currently on and you know this list is&nbsp;growing.</p><p>We see like you said some of the leading blockchains here; we have Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polkadot, Near, Elrond, Tron, Klaytn, Ontology obviously, so it is really great to see the development that is covering the gamut of blockchains. Just like you have your favorite token, you have your favorite blockchain; ONT ID is likely already&nbsp;there.</p><p>So, ONTO, my favorite wallet, go to Twitter you will see I talk about it enough. Is there anything that we don’t know about ONTO or maybe another perspective about ONTO that you think is valuable for us to know beyond the fact that it is a multi-chain, supports multiple tokens, and the fact that it is a simple way to create your decentralized identity.</p><p>Raindy<br> I think there are three points — the key points of ONTO. The first one is it’s a decentralized wallet, which is different from the centralized wallets. So they just keep your crypto assets on their server and there’s a risk if they do some harm to the assets. So ONTO can help users avoid these kinds of&nbsp;risks.</p><p>The second one is that it’s a truly cross-chain wallet. This means that once you have your ONT ID, once you download and open ONTO, it actually links to the other assets that are supported. As listed, there should be about 14 in total so you don’t need to have a mnemonic for for each ten, you only need to get one private key for everything. So it saves time for the users to manage their assets and even if they need to change their devices like they have a new phone then they can just download ONTO on their new phone and easily import their assets&nbsp;there.</p><p>So, the third one is that it is the only crypto wallet with the identity functionality, so it has ONT ID and you can also get your OScore with the ONT ID inside ONTO. The OScore calculation is based on your behavior on-chain, plus the crypto assets you have. This is really different and makes ONTO the leading crypto wallet among others, I would say Another thing is that it’s not only an app wallet; just last month we launched the ONTO web version which is Chrome extension. So no matter whether you’re using a mobile or desktop device, you can use the same wallet actually. It is easy to switch between the two and you still only need ONT ID to manage your&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Humpty<br>I think having that flexibility, being able to go from your desktop wallet — or should I say your browser wallet — and going to your mobile wallet, being able to utilize it not just for digital assets but for identity, I think it is this rich experience, this dynamic utility that you give people, I think that makes the wallet that much more valuable. It is one of the things that I say whenever I talk to people about digital wallets: I say, honestly, I think digital wallets have come a long way from the very beginning but you know there is still room for evolution, there is still room for improvement, especially as identity starts to become this critical element for helping blockchain and crypto&nbsp;mature.</p><p>I think we are going to see a ton of value in having wallets that have these solutions built-in, these identity solutions, and I am not saying I know what every wallet out there is doing but I don’t think that there is another wallet that has what ONTO has in terms of that flexibility and that rich utility that goes beyond just holding digital assets or beyond just working across multiple blockchains.</p> Why ONTO <p>Humpty<br> So, you know a little bit about why you want to use ONTO; you know it is a decentralized wallet, you own your assets, you own your keys, it gives you or enables you to have your identity as part of your digital wallet. I think that all of these are critical elements to making these wallets safer makes them more valuable to people as, like I said, blockchain continues to grow and&nbsp;evolve.</p> Beneficiaries of ONTO&nbsp;ID <p>Humpty<br> So, I don’t know if we are going to talk about OScore on one of these upcoming slides maybe we have already gone beyond it because we have talked about ONT ID, but I think maybe we shouldn’t get too far without talking about OScore, both kind of which go hand in hand together. OScore and ONT ID being your digital identity and then OScore being your reputation based on that identity. Can you maybe give us a quick introduction to what OScore is and why it is important from your perspective.</p><p>Raindy<br>Sure, so once everyone has their identity, it is like an identifier so people know who you are. But how can they judge your trustworthiness? That is why we have the OScore protocol in our ecosystem. So everyone is able to get an OScore that is based on their ONT ID and it links to all the behaviors they do on-chain but it can be customized according to their own demands. So I would say there is no limit or guidelines to tell people how your OScore is going to be generated because it is quite different, it depends on different demands. So, basically the one use-case right now is on Wing Finance, the DeFi platform that is developed by Ontology. So there is an Inclusive Pool which is a credit-based lending platform on Wing. Once you get your OScore, it makes it possible to be under-collateralized to lending out crypto&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Let’s say you have one thousand dollars as collateral in USDT and you have a very high OScore. This enables you to borrow about one thousand one hundred USDC maybe based on your good reputation on-chain. So this is a real application to let people benefit from their credentials and reputations. It’s a critical protocol for the blockchain world because it is kind of solving the problem of trust which is one of the purposes of blockchain, I would&nbsp;say.</p><p>Humpty<br> Yeah, I think there is such a synergistic relationship between ONT ID and OScore and the way they are utilized. Like you said, there is a lot of flexibility in how that score can be&nbsp;created.</p><p>I really like what Ontology has done with Wing because it really is proving that the future of DeFi, you know, it is still so early that it doesn’t have to be over-collateralized, that is not how the real world works. You have a reputation in the real world and that reputation is what enables you to borrow. So, with OScore and on Wing, as an example, like Raindy mentioned, you are able to then get better rates whether that is an under-collateralized loan or that is better incentives. It also depends on the protocol on which ONT ID and OScore are integrated, there may be a different use-case.</p><p>I see Alonzo here in the chat is asking “Is consumer loyalty systems a good case?”, absolutely. You imagine, right now, in the real world you have these loyalty cards and how many do you have or maybe you have to download the app and every time you go you have to scan this but really is this the best way, like, is there a way for you to be able potentially to take that reputation across all of the different stores and websites that you visit? If you do, maybe that is a more accurate representation of who you are. You’re going to five marketplaces and you’re saying, “Well, I want to buy the same things and I go everywhere, well with ONT ID, with OScore, potentially this information” — again this is your identity, your data, it’s up to you how much of this you want to share — you say, “I want to share this information with these five purveyors” and from that they can then dictate your loyalty and then give you rewards based on that, on-chain, in the real world, or on the web as well. Because, of course, most of the world has gone digital, so most of us buy all of our things online. So definitely a very good use case, airdrops, absolutely.</p><p>In terms of airdrops, maybe Raindy you could talk a little a bit about how that is being utilized today with ONT&nbsp;ID.</p><p>Raindy<br>Yeah, the team is working on the airdrop related use-case with ONT ID because in the crypto world, especially when new projects launch their tokens there will be massive airdrops. So, the project teams’ concern is how they can prevent bots from claiming the airdrops for free, which is harmful to real users and real community members. So through the ONT ID system — and we call it the DID SDK solutions provided to the projects that are seeking ways to evaluate individuals who participate in the airdrops as credit and also based on their previous records, on-chain. So this can help solve their problems and their concerns. I am not familiar with that use-case because Gloria, our Chief of Ecosystem Development Lead, is leading the project. So I think we can save that question in our notes and we will dig out more detailed information with her and give you the answers, directly.</p><p>Humpty<br> Yeah, I think that is a great thing. I think one of the valuable things about events like this is we get questions that, even though we are not either the technical person or don’t have all the information, we can use this to make sure that we can continue educating the community on all of these particular use-cases and even some of the ones that we may be exploring already.</p><p>Maybe just to touch on airdrops a little bit, in one of the calls that I have hosted on Clubhouse, someone brought up a really good example: UNI airdropped — Uniswap, I should say, — airdropped UNI across all of their user base but one of the questions that we ask ourselves in terms of the way that was distributed versus maybe if they had used some sort of identity solution is, if one person had used ten wallets and one person only used one wallet, do we believe that distribution was sent fairly because one person got a lot more than someone else because they — not that it is wrong that you are using ten different wallets — but now the distribution of that wealth of that token isn’t fair, it isn’t per person, it is now going to wallets so if we really want to look at ways to create a more fair distribution of these tokens, we can potentially look at solutions like ONT ID so that we can make sure we are sending it to real people. And how do we verify that these people are real? If you download ONTO you can see that there are ways to do it via social verification; you could also do it through some hard verification methods that utilize a KYC element. So certainly, there are a lot different ways that we can do this and the really cool thing is that there is a lot of areas that can be explored with identity.</p> SAGA <p>Humpty<br> Well, we’ve almost been here an hour, Raindy, so that is fantastic. Let’s see if we can get through this presentation. I know Saga is something that the team is currently developing and exploring use-cases for. Can you give us a very quick rundown? What is Saga and why is it important?</p><p>Raindy<br> Yeah, Saga is a decentralized data marketplace that is designed for both individuals and enterprises. I remember that there is a community member who mentioned his understanding of Saga: it is “the 1Inch of data”. So that is really impressive because he gained the main idea of it. So in most cases around the digital assets that is why we have so many DeFi platforms but we do have the requirements about data in the long term. That is the reason why we focus on data and as we mentioned before, Ontology is a blockchain not only for decentralized identity but also data and ONT ID is one of the critical elements of the&nbsp;project.</p><p>So, now you can log into the Saga website — it went live last year. You can try it out by logging in with your ONT ID and start accessing the data listed on the website. In the future, we are going to build more than that so it will be a truly decentralized data marketplace. It will be built on the Ontology chain but with interoperability with other chains. We hope the marketplace can develop more use-cases so that the Saga platform can have an official launch at a later stage. So right now, we are getting fully prepared to show our professionalism and also respect to the old users. So we don’t want to rush. We want to pay more attention to the details and to get it more well prepared.</p><p>Humpty<br> Yeah, that is fantastic. I think what Ontology is doing is creating a very complete ecosystem for identity and data. You have got your decentralized identity; you have your decentralized credit score; you have DeFi integration — which is the next slide that we are going to get to with Wing; you have the wallet (ONTO) that enables you to just utilize this entire ecosystem from creating your identity to utilizing these DeFi protocols to potentially, in the future, utilizing SAGA, which is the decentralized marketplace.</p> WING <p>Humpty<br>So, Wing, the first credit-based, cross-chain DeFi lending platform. That is a big sentence. Basically, the lending platform has traditional Flash Pools; currently, it is cross-chain because it is currently on Ontology, it is on Ethereum, and on OKchain, which it was recently launched on I believe a week or two&nbsp;ago.</p><p>The interesting or the very unique element of this platform is because Ontology has developed these technologies focused on decentralized identity, they were able to create a testing ground for how that could work and that is Inclusive Pool,&nbsp;right?</p><p>What we were talking about earlier, in terms of, under collateralized loans, better rewards — which is great and I think that the future of DeFi is going to be this. The more I listen to people talking about this subject on Twitter, on Clubhouse, on YouTube, a variety of media channels, people are seeing that currently the way that DeFi is built isn’t fair; it is only benefiting those with a lot of wealth. The word that I see being used a lot is “plutocracy”, meaning that if you have a ton more money then your voice counts for more. And really what blockchain crypto is trying to solve is to go against a lot of these traditional ways the economy works and it wants to be more fair. And I think with the introduction of decentralized credit scores and identity, there is a potential of leveraging your behavior, your reputation, to be able to get access to these markets without necessarily having this huge amount of digital assets to be able to back that&nbsp;loan.</p><p>Raindy<br> Yeah, I want to add that, besides the Flash Pool — the leading pool and the Inclusive Pool, the credit-based pool — we also launched the Any Pool, which is also a big thing in the DeFi world because it makes it possible to link real world assets to the crypto&nbsp;world.</p><p>As an example, if a user has a flat (apartment) in the real world and he wants to collateralize it in order to borrow crypto assets, it is possible using the Any Pool. The flat can be minted as an NFT, to be recorded on-chain as a credential. So it releases the liquidity of that flat’s value and you can borrow crypto assets by using it as collateral. So, that’s one use-case. And also, you can lend and borrow like the Uniswap V3 NFT and also there’s various different NFT projects. So they can collateralize their assets on the Wing platform — the Any Pool — to lend out crypto assets and also the other NFTs. So it overcomes the barrier between the real world and the crypto world. This is a big deal in the industry, as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Humpty<br> Yeah, I think that goes back to something I was saying earlier which is that Ontology is building bridges. It builds bridges, not just in the traditional sense — the way that we look at building bridges on-chain — but also is doing that in the traditional world. I know we also have some members in our team who are very possibilities with Any Pool because they can start lending not only their NFTs but their land because they’re living in an entirely different world and they want to be able to utilize all of these different assets that they have on these marketplaces. So I’m really excited about the possibilities that Wing enables, again, to continue to evolve and mature the DeFi&nbsp;space.</p> Ontology Community <p>Humpty<br> So, I think we are almost at the end of our presentation here. Raindy, did you want to make some closing remarks about Ontology and this very rich ecosystem?</p><p>Raindy<br> Yeah, I think through today’s talk and the presentation that people already understand what Ontology is doing. So, what we are doing is focusing on decentralized identity — that’s the first thing. The second thing is data. Listed on this info graph it shows what we have achieved on this aspect but more than that, we are still doing traditional things like all the crypto projects do: We are creating a rich ecosystem with all the public chains, wallets, DeFi projects and exchanges, and also the other protocols, and are aiming to build trust with everyone’s efforts. So as you can see, we have already have over 29 language communities and around 200 partners. I think it is more than that, recently. Also, regarding governance, we have a decentralized and global network. We have around 1000 nodes in total and 65 of them are candidate nodes.</p><p>For individual users, they can stake their ONT on any of the nodes to earn ONG, the gas fee which allows you to do transactions on the Ontology chain. What’s incredible is that now we have so many ONT IDs created on the Ontology chain. It is very good to see that so many people have a decentralized identity and I hope there will be more people who have their IDs and data controlled by themselves through in decentralized way. Ontology will keep moving forward and developing a more trusted world for everyone.</p><p>Humpty<br> I think these metrics both on this side and looking at the numbers on the other side, looking at the partnerships and that landscape that is very diverse. So it’s not just limited into one area because, of course, it’s a very multi-faceted ecosystem. One of the metrics that I love is — going back to ONTO is — the reason there’s so many ONT IDs is because it’s so easy to make ONT IDs. One of the more important things that, I think, the responsibility of every developer should be is creating on top of this very complex ecosystem is to make it accessible; to make it super simple and to be able to allow people to very simply create that decentralized identity just by creating a wallet — which is kind of standard in this space — I think it’s going to take Ontology a very long&nbsp;way.</p><p>From the landscape side, one we didn’t touch on and I think is super important and again, shows that multi-faceted nature of Ontology, is the automotive partnership with Daimler and the “Welcome Home” app, in order to prove how ONT ID could be utilized in the automotive industry as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Raindy<br> Yes, that’s also a real world application that shows how users can control their data. As an example, let’s say someone has a car in Germany and he’s used to it so all of his settings are saved in that car. Then he travels to Singapore and rents out the same car. All the settings are different, though. So using the “Welcome Home” app, he can import all his preferences so the neither the car nor the manufacturer, Daimler, won’t have access to his data. So it is fully controlled by him but can be simply applied to the new car. So he feels like he’s using his car back in Germany but in a new place and in a new car. This is really&nbsp;amazing.</p><p>Humpty<br> I’m smiling a little bit because I think maybe for most people who don’t have these very smart cars, it might not seem like a very big deal but as we move forward with these intelligent cars — just like the rest of the electronics that we own — we’re going to see a ton of value in terms of being able to record our preferences in a decentralized way, in a way that we have complete ownership of that data and then utilizing that, anywhere.</p><p>Going back to the question Alonzo asked earlier, if you go on a website and you’re constantly having to fill in the same information over and over, it might seem like a small little pain but if you could just automatically fill that information out in a way that you know that you control that data — that it’s not just getting utilized in whatever way that company wants to use it — I want to use that. I think that’s a future I want to be a part&nbsp;of.</p><p>Raindy<br> Yeah, I recommend everyone visit <a href="http://ont.io">ont.io</a> and our video showing our vision for the future of how your data is used and how you can manage your daily life with a decentralized identity. You can watch that video to get the&nbsp;idea.</p><p>Humpty<br> I’ve heard really, really positive things and I’ve heard “Oh my god, that looks really scary” but at the end of the day, all of your comments are important. Whether you think it’s really fantastic or you’re questioning something, I think the whole point of this conversation is to be able to facilitate a way to ask questions.</p><p>Alright Raindy, well I think we have reached the end of our chat, here. Thank you so much to CoinDesk for putting together this event and providing us with a space to have a conversation with the attendees, to be able to engage with the community, and hopefully to add value to the conversation and that there are things that you learned here&nbsp;today.</p><p>Raindy<br> Thank you, everyone.</p><p>Humpty<br>Bye.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Let’s power up the&nbsp;Machine! Ampere-hour token&nbsp;(Ah)<p>Upala is launching the Ampere hour (Ah) token. The goal is to award early contributors, find intrinsically motivated people and give contributors an advantage over investors.</p> Become a core team&nbsp;member   Developers are paid assuming that 1 Ah equals $1. Every job reward is negotiated the same way as one would do with&nbsp;fiat.  Ah tokens can only be acquired for a job done. Cannot be bought or traded (transfers are&nbsp;frozen).  No real money behind Ah token. We are just maintaining the record of contributions with it. The value though is in getting to the core team and receiving a share of the real Upala token when it is launched. Plus there’s an investment option (see&nbsp;below).  Only for developers. Non-technical people have something even better with Upala. All the artifacts they produce can be wrapped as NFTs, and sold under the Resistance “brand” (check out the <a href="https://medium.com/six-degrees-of-separation/starting-the-resistance-b9e49d4b150e">article</a> on starting the Resistance). This is disputable, though.  How many ampere-hours can you produce,&nbsp;human? Technical details   At the launch, the token is non-transferable. Ahs can only be received in exchange for a completed job. This is done to avoid speculation.  Transfers can be switched on in the future (if ever&nbsp;needed).  Zero token supply. Payments are made by minting new tokens on the go right to the receiver’s address.  <p>Deployed to <a href="https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0xeed9D0f7265892e84e43d05dA464c75add199260/transactions">0xeed9D0f7265892e84e43d05dA464c75add199260</a> on xDai. See source code on&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/upala-digital-identity/ampere-hour-token">Github</a></p> Economic details <p>The exact path of Upala launch is not decided yet. However whichever path we chose there will be a core team share in the total token supply. This is what you can get access to. After the Upala token launch, the core team share will be distributed according to Ah token balances.</p><p>I don’t want to put too many constraints by promising too much and want to leave some room for tweaking. Though the goal is to find intrinsically motivated people, I want to bring as much clarity as I can to the economic part. Here are some numbers to count&nbsp;on.</p><p>Core team share in total token supply. The minimum core team share will be&nbsp;10%.</p><p>My compensation. I’m on the same conditions as all other contributors (so that the whole team incentives are aligned and I’m interested in increasing Core team share in the total token supply). At the real Upala token launch, I will mint to myself [x] * [time] tokens. Where [x] is monthly compensation and [time] is the number of months since I started to work on the project full time (Jan’ 01 2019). My monthly compensation would be not less than $10k and not higher than the highest-paid developer in the team (this would allow hiring any skill&nbsp;level).</p> Investment opportunity <p>As the Ah token tracks contributions in dollars, an interesting opportunity opens up. A developer may find an investor and turn part of his/her Ahs into dollars. Still no speculation, as we are able to manually select investors (also sounds like a DAO). This is like retroactive investing, or accurate investing, or investing just-in-time if you will. Need a bit more coding to make it work trustlessly. Just an idea for now which we can start experimenting on.</p> Conclusion <p>Upala is solving one of the most acute and toughest problems in cyber-space — the Sybil-resistance problem (or simply, one human — one account problem). And damn it is&nbsp;fun!</p><p>See where you would love to apply force — check out the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Upala-infrastructure-9f9a09ea9f6b451fb8d39ea85ad5d5f2">infrastructure</a> and the <a href="https://www.notion.so/66cc454c551847d2aa3666b9782dfeb0">roadmap</a>.

Recently, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_2663">European Union unveiled plans for a digital ID wallet</a> for EU residents to access public and private services as a strategy to accelerate the shift to an online&nbsp;world.</p><p>Today, identity (ID) management remains one of the biggest challenges for humanitarian action. In fact, due to a lack of recognized proof of identity, roughly 1.5 billion individuals (World Bank, 2016) face challenges to accessing or enjoying basic rights and services, including humanitarian assistance. The current challenges regarding identity in humanitarian aid delivery&nbsp;include:</p>  Too much valuable NGO time and money spent managing duplicative enrollment efforts and inefficiencies: Every time an NGO wants to deliver aid, they must re-register beneficiaries for each project. There is also no way for NGOs working with similar populations to securely share beneficiary data across NGOs and projects, creating siloed, inefficient work&nbsp;streams.  Lack of access to aid for extremely vulnerable populations: Lack of ID prevents many individuals from accessing much-needed cash-based aid. For example, prior to the DIGID project, the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) struggled to provide aid to approximately 25% of its target beneficiaries because they did not have ID (a requirement for mobile money aid distribution via the popular mobile money vendor M-PESA often used by the KRCS for cash transfer distribution).  Lack of beneficiary data privacy and security: Currently, beneficiary identity data is stored in systems that do not provide optimal privacy and security for this sensitive data. Without a secure data system, NGOs run the risk of beneficiaries “double-dipping” to receive extra aid or, in some instances, non-qualified individuals tyring to receive aid meant for someone&nbsp;else.  <blockquote>Gravity and the DIGID consortium are tackling these challenges via portable, user-centric digital identity for humanitarian aid. Gravity helps NGOs overcome siloed aid delivery with a digital ID solution that beneficiaries can easily use to verify their identity and receive services across multiple organizations and aid projects.</blockquote> What is the DIGID&nbsp;Project? <p>The <a href="https://hiplatform.org/digid">Dignified Identities (DIGID) for cash assistance project</a> aims to address the issue of lack of official or recognized identity for recipients of humanitarian cash assistance by piloting Gravity’s digital identity solution in Kenya. The DIGID Project strives to give control and ownership of personal data back to individuals, and at the same time increase collaboration between NGOs and their beneficiaries, with user consent as a&nbsp;key.</p><p>Launched in 2021, the DIGID Project uses Gravity’s digital ID solution to help the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) distribute direct cash transfers to vulnerable Kenyans without IDs in urban and rural, remote&nbsp;areas.</p>Kenya Red Cross Society using Gravity’s digital ID platform for aid distribution.<p>To address the beneficiary technology gap, Gravity also designed its digital ID platform to suit the specific needs of all types of users, ensuring that even beneficiaries with little to no access to or knowledge of technology can create digital identities to access aid services.</p><p>The DIGID Project is made possible by some of the largest humanitarian organizations in the world, with the <a href="https://www.ifrc.org/en/who-we-are/the-movement/ifrc/">International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC)</a>, <a href="https://www.innovasjonnorge.no/en/start-page/about/our-mission/">Innovation Norway</a>, <a href="https://www.rodekors.no/en/english-pages/">Norwegian Red Cross</a>, <a href="https://www.reddbarna.no/om-oss/organisasjon/english/">Save the Children Norway</a>, <a href="https://www.nrc.no/">Norwegian Refugee Council</a> and <a href="https://www.kirkensnodhjelp.no/en/">Norwegian Church Aid</a> coming together to help tackle this challenge.</p> Gravity Digital ID Platform&nbsp;Overview <p>Gravity’s digital ID platform (referred to as the “Gravity Platform” moving forward) used during the DIGID Project is based on decentralized identity and <a href="https://medium.com/gravity-earth/gravitys-decentralized-identity-protocol-built-on-tezos-to-power-digid-project-in-kenya-a85069f2a027">blockchain technology</a>.

Persistent digital identities are important because they use blockchain technology to allow for the easy exchange of verifiable, consistent beneficiary data to different organizations while also protecting beneficiary data privacy and ownership.</p> Gravity Platform Benefits for NGOs — Key Learnings <p>After concluding the DIGID Project, the Gravity team met with all stakeholders to get their feedback for future projects using the Gravity Platform.</p>KRCS and Gravity debrief after DIGID Project cash distribution. For NGOs interested in using Gravity’s digital ID solution, the DIGID Project taught us that the Gravity Platform:  Saves NGOs money and staff time in the&nbsp;field <p>The Gravity Platform makes the overall process of NGO aid distribution faster and more efficient.</p><p>Time saved:</p><blockquote>During the DIGID project, it took approximately one minute to authenticate and verify a beneficiary with a digital ID via the Gravity Platform for aid services.</blockquote><p>Money saved: During the DIGID Project, the KRCS confirmed the identity of beneficiaries by scanning a QR code on the beneficiary’s phone or via a paper QR code given to them at the time of their digital ID registration. The cost per beneficiary of a printed and laminated QR code is $0.30 USD, compared to $2–5 USD for a smart card typically used by the KRCS for cash distribution.</p><blockquote>“These digital ID QR codes are good because beneficiaries won’t have to keep registering for cash transfers. It’s much easier this way for us volunteers and for the beneficiaries.”</blockquote><blockquote>-Kenya Red Cross Society volunteer</blockquote> Helps NGOs have a quicker aid response after a&nbsp;crisis <p>The Gravity Platform allows NGOs to quickly and accurately identify beneficiaries. As previously mentioned, it took approximately one minute to authenticate and verify a beneficiary with a digital ID to ensure that the correct person was receiving the cash disbursement. This process had previously relied on a chief or community leader to be present to individually verify each beneficiary’s ID at disbursement. If the chief/community leader could not be present at the time of aid distribution, there was also the risk that a person could falsely claim to be a beneficiary in order to receive a cash disbursement meant for someone&nbsp;else.</p><blockquote>“The [cash distribution] process was well organised.”</blockquote><blockquote>-Beneficiary, DIGID&nbsp;Project</blockquote> Facilitates interoperability across different aid organizations and&nbsp;projects <p>The Gravity Platform streamlines humanitarian action targeting the same beneficiary populations. During the DIGID Project, the Gravity Platform successfully integrated with KRCS vendor <a href="https://www.redrosecps.com/">RedRose</a>, a beneficiary and cash distribution management system used to facilitate the distribution of direct cash transfers to beneficiaries.</p> Helps NGOs put more money directly into the hands of target beneficiaries <p>The DIGID Project is the first time that the KRCS was able to provide many beneficiaries with direct cash transfers in lieu of mobile money transfers via mobile money service&nbsp;M-PESA.</p>Beneficiary biometrics being taken during the DIGID&nbsp;Project.<p>From the beneficiary feedback received after the DIGID Project, we learned that many beneficiaries prefer direct cash aid to M-PESA mobile money payments because the cash is put directly into their hands at the time of distribution without them having to worry about how to receive or access a mobile money&nbsp;payment.</p><p>By providing hard cash directly to beneficiaries at the time of distribution, the DIGID Project eliminated the need for beneficiaries to rely on more tech-savvy alternates/agents to handle M-PESA mobile money transfers on their behalf. With mobile money payments, beneficiaries may not know when they receive the payment, and in some instances, there is even the risk that an alternate/agent takes some of the money from beneficiaries without their knowledge, leaving them with less money than intended by the&nbsp;NGO.</p> Enables NGOs to provide aid to beneficiaries without ID that they could not access&nbsp;prior <p>With the Gravity Platform, it is now possible for NGOs to deliver aid to extremely vulnerable beneficiaries who are often left out of receiving services due to a lack of ID. Before this project, the KRCS struggled to provide aid to approximately 25% of its target beneficiaries because they did not have&nbsp;ID.</p><blockquote>During the DIGID Project, 95% of beneficiaries in Turkana had no official ID, but were able to receive KRCS aid with digital IDs created via&nbsp;Gravity.</blockquote> Supports all vulnerable populations, regardless of their access to or knowledge of technology <p>Gravity offers digital identity solutions for smartphone, basic phone and no phone users via QR codes. The Gravity Platform also works to close the technology gap by introducing beneficiaries to digital identity solutions that can help them gain access to and benefit from humanitarian aid.</p> Gives beneficiaries ownership and agency over their personal&nbsp;data <p>With the Gravity Platform, beneficiaries create digital IDs that allow them to control what personal data they want to share and who they want to share it with, ensuring that beneficiaries have a say in the privacy and management of their personal data at all&nbsp;times.</p> Organizations can use the Gravity Platform&nbsp;to:  1. Efficiently enroll beneficiaries with digital&nbsp;IDs <blockquote>The Gravity Platform is built to help organizations support all types of beneficiaries, regardless of their access to or knowledge of technology.</blockquote>During digital ID enrollment with a phone, the beneficiary receives a confirmation text message from Gravity when their data is shared with the&nbsp;NGO.<p>Shared beneficiary enrollment via the Gravity Platform means no more re-registering the same beneficiaries every time and improved coordination between NGOs. Organizations can sign up a beneficiary for a digital ID in three easy&nbsp;ways:</p><p>No phone user: NGO signs up beneficiary for a digital ID via a web portal.<br>Basic phone user: beneficiary signs up for a digital ID via an easy-to-use USSD Menu on their phone.<br>Smartphone user: beneficiary signs up for a digital ID via an easy-to-use web app on their&nbsp;phone.</p> 2. Easily issue credentials based on beneficiary information <p>NGOs manage beneficiary data all in one easy place via the Gravity Portal website. This data is encrypted and digitally signed to create a credential. The digital signature helps verify the authenticity and origin of the data accompanying it, ensuring that the beneficiary is who they say they are. It is extremely important to note that this data is securely stored in a decentralized credential repository, which ensures that no individual or third party (not even Gravity) apart from the beneficiary can access any of this data data without the beneficiary’s consent.</p> 3. Quickly authenticate beneficiary information to ensure that aid and services provided are going to the right individual <p>Organisations delivering assistance and services can use the Gravity Platform to request a beneficiary’s credentials to authenticate them, ensuring that the beneficiary is who they say they are. Organisations can request beneficiary credentials either: (1) directly through the Gravity Platform or an API for beneficiaries with phones, or (2) through a paper QR code for beneficiaries who do not have a&nbsp;phone.</p>Beneficiary view of their digital identity credentials on the Gravity Platform.<p>The Gravity Platform can be used by beneficiaries to:</p> 1. Share credentials and authenticate their identity with organizations to access&nbsp;services <p>Beneficiaries can share credentials that have been requested by an organisation by giving their consent and authenticating themselves via a PIN or other means, including biometrics.</p> 2. Manage their digital&nbsp;identity <p>Beneficiaries can view their own credentials to see the data that an NGO has collected about them. They can also request to update, delete and recover their data as&nbsp;needed.</p> Gravity Platform Deployment in&nbsp;Kenya <p>The Gravity Platform was developed through direct inputs from all types of end-users through <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b75620445776e4b290c0d96/t/603d14c5775eed6fbde2883b/1614615753940/%5BFinal%5D+DIGID+Kenya+User+Consultation+Report.pdf">user consultations</a> with local communities and NGO staff. After the development phase, an additional round of user acceptance testing in a controlled environment was conducted. In April 2021, the Gravity Platform was field tested in both rural and urban settings in Kenya within the framework of the DIGID Project cash transfer&nbsp;program.</p>KRCS cash distribution via Gravity’s digital ID solution took place in the remote, rural region of Turkana and the urban area of Mathare, Nairobi, Kenya.

<p>Jackson Shaw, technology sector veteran and Chief Strategy Officer at Identity Access Management firm Clear Skye, is to deliver a keynote presentation entitled <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4600" title="Jackson Shaw Keynote">Identity and the Rise of Platforms</a> at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021" title="European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2021</a>.</p>




<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Jackson Shaw some questions about his planned presentation.</p>
 
<p></p>
<p>You say we are entering a new era of SaaS with new kinds of enterprise platforms, what do you mean by that?</p>
<p>


What I'm trying to basically say is that what we've seen over the last 10 years is an explosion of SaaS applications that cover all kinds of different use cases. Every company out there is using many different SaaS applications, and in the identity space, that includes many things like governance, life cycle management, privilege account management, web access, [and] all kinds of different things.</p>
<p>But what I've been seeing over the last couple of years, is this whole dynamo of digital transformation. And we're seeing companies that are doing their digital transformation, but they're not doing digital transformation with identity as the&nbsp;centerpiece. They're doing digital transformation with some sort of a platform as the&nbsp;centerpiece. And it's through that platform that we see things growing like governance, life cycle management, provisioning, and many of the other core identity capabilities that are being built into these platforms.</p>
<p>So, my supposition or theory is that eventually we're going to see more and more of these capabilities in these platforms, which I believe is going to make for a very interesting marketplace where customers are going to be choosing between platform-based solutions that they're using for their digital transformation versus standalone identity solutions like they've used up until now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do you think traditional IAM vendors are going to face competition from enterprise platforms like ServiceNow and Salesforce?</p>
<p>


First of all, it's not just ServiceNow. You can see where this is starting to happen in other platforms like Atlassian, where they've started to add some of these capabilities. You see it even in Salesforce, you see it with the Okta acquisition of Auth0 and building more and more identity into theirs. And the stated future from Todd McKinnon, the CEO of Okta, is he wants to be a platform. So, it's nascent, and this is not something that's going to happen overnight, but you can definitely see where things, in the ServiceNow case where, for example, GRC is being added to ServiceNow, where security operations is being added to ServiceNow, where there's a lot of these capabilities that typically have been more identity focused and more separate.</p>
<p>So, I just think that you'll see over the next five to 10 years, where a lot more of the traditional capabilities that are&nbsp;in identity will start bleeding into these platforms, and then customers will be making a choice on what they want to use. And I think the biggest factor here is that for digital transformation, customers are picking these platforms as the&nbsp;centerpiece&nbsp;for their digital transformation. The identity piece is a supporting player, so to speak, but it's not the main course on the menu.</p>
<p>I think the problem that we're going to see - the tension between the platforms and the identity products - is that the money is going to be spent on the platforms. The strategic direction of a company is going to be on the platform, and the identity products that a company has, are going to have to fight to maintain their relevance within that sort of transformation as it occurs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How could competition from enterprise platforms shape the future of the identity industry?</p>
<p>


Well, I think what we've seen - again, if we look kind of a little bit historically - we've seen identity vendors start back in my day, doing email address synchronization, we've seen them do directory synchronization, [and] life cycle management. And then when we started seeing the identity vendors start acquiring other companies, when I was at Quest [Software], for example, we acquired 12 different companies to build our identity portfolio. So, you've seen all of these acquisitions occur with the intent of the identity vendor to build a suite of tools or in some ways, a platform, with the platform being built for digital transformation, whether it's ServiceNow or Atlassian or Microsoft Azure or any of the other products that are out there, or even Okta's intentions.</p>
<p>What we're going to see, is more and more of those capabilities become part of the platform, an easier and easier choice for a customer to say, I don't need to buy a specialized tool from a company that I don't really know and isn't part of my overall strategy. I'm going to go with my platform. And I think what we'll see is the pendulum shift from the identity players with a whole bunch of different products and different tools, back to where identity products are perhaps more niche-y. So, let's say five to 10 years, we're going to have a lot of specialized, very purpose-built identity products instead of these broad suites, and a lot of the general capabilities for identity that people are buying today, either as part of a suite or just general purpose, [will] now [be] inside the platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How is this trend going to affect traditional identity vendors – is it a question of adapt or die?</p>
<p>


Well, again, I don't know if I'm lucky or unlucky, but I've seen this over the last 30 years basically. And I was thinking about this the other day, of all the organizations I knew before the SaaS revolution happened, that are no longer here. Like ISOCOR, World Talk, Critical Path and Softswitch. There's a whole bunch of these vendors that are no longer with us for various different reasons, but certainly SaaS being one of them, or the evolution of SaaS.</p>
<p>So, I&nbsp;think what we'll see is - and I'll take [for example] one of my previous companies who acquired a whole bunch of companies and they've built a platform or they've built a set of products that are on-prem, [and then] they've built a SaaS platform, and now they're trying to manage all of these things. I believe digital transformation is&nbsp;going to evolve these platforms to start eating into their lunch. I believe that there's going to be a number of vendors, especially the bigger vendors in this space today, that are going to suffer the consequences of not being ready for this movement towards the platform and the digital transformation that's occurring in companies.</p>
<p>Will everybody disappear? Well, of course not. There are a lot of companies that [date from] back in the nineties, that are still with us. But I think there, there's going to be another one of these tectonic shifts, or maybe it's not a tectonic shift, but certainly a change in the marketplace over the next five to 10 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What could or should CIOs and other decision-makers at end-user organizations do in response to the trend you describe?</p>
<p>


The message I would want CIO's and the other people in the audience to take from this is that a number of these platforms are starting to provide significant value outside of a vendor like us, who have built on one of these platforms, but just in themselves. If we take ServiceNow as an example, it has a piece of software called Integration Hub. Integration Hub is 100% about integrating with other directories and systems. They connect to over 250 different systems. Why wouldn't a CIO want to use that because, well, in fact, they're already using it for things like Microsoft Teams and all kinds of other things internally. Why wouldn't they also want to use that for identity if the capability is there, which it is. So, what I want folks to take away from this presentation is that there is a rise happening with these platform vendors, and there will be a slow decline, in my view, of many of the identity vendors.</p>
<p>And if your digital transformation, your company's future, your customer experience, your employee experience, your partner experience is being focused on one of these platforms, you need to think about how identity can be a part of that digital transformation, instead of sitting to the side where it is now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you think that these huge platforms will increase dependency of companies using these platforms to such an extent that this could limit the growth of those companies?</p>
<p>


That's, that's an excellent question. [But] I almost want to flip it around, and say what's more appropriate for a company? Is it to be making a further bet - doubling down, to use a gambling term, on the platform that they're using, that they're betting their whole company on, versus an independent player, that might not be here tomorrow or the next day? When you look at the magnitude of the difference between, let's say the market cap of an Okta versus a ServiceNow or an Atlassian&nbsp;versus one of the other companies, we're talking about an order of magnitude. The same around&nbsp;Microsoft and their capabilities.</p>
<p>So, I think that there's more staying power, so to speak, more capability for those companies to continue to expand and buy into identity, than staying with a particular platform. You can just imagine it, for example, Okta, which just made a huge acquisition of Auth0 - Okta isn't immune itself from being acquired, right? It could be acquired by a Salesforce or a ServiceNow, or even a Microsoft. They have the capability and the depth. And that's my point. I think the platform players have more capability, depth, and&nbsp;long-term ability to do acquisitions and build more technology into their products.&nbsp;</p>

   You know how you will see an ad on Instagram for something that you just searched for hours earlier? This is in no small part due to a special API for iOS that allows app developers to track your behavior across apps, even those by different developers. Well, all of this is changing with the rollout of iOS 14.5, so let’s take a look at what exactly is changing and what this means for app developer

  <p>You know how you will see an ad on Instagram for something that you just searched for hours earlier? This is in no small part due to a special API for iOS that allows app developers to track your behavior across apps, even those by different developers. Well, all of this is changing with the rollout of iOS 14.5, so let’s take a look at what exactly is changing and what this means for app developers.</p>

<p>When Apple first launched Sign in with Apple in 2019, one of my favorite parts about it was the privacy-first stance they took on access to user data. Unlike most other social login providers, Sign in with Apple gives the user the option of hiding their name and email address from the app if they wish. With the release of iOS 14.5, Apple is taking user privacy one step further and letting users opt out of targeted advertising. This is part of Apple’s new App Tracking Transparency framework. Let’s break down what it is, how it works, and what this means for app developers.</p>

 What Is Apple’s Identifier for Advertisers? 

<p>First, let’s take a look at how Apple’s Identifier for Advertisers worked before this change. For the last several generations of iOS, Apple has provided an API that gives developers a unique ID corresponding to a particular iOS device. This identifier is known as the “Advertising Identifier,” or “Identifier For Advertisers “ (IDFA).</p>

<p>While the IDFA is just a random string and doesn’t contain any personal or identifying information itself, it is tied to a specific device and any app that reads it will get the same value, making it possible to link user information across apps by different developers. The classic use of this is in retargeting campaigns in advertising networks, so that a user who uses a certain app can receive related ads when inside other apps.</p>

<p>It has been possible for a user to disable this feature for quite some time, although the process to disable it wasn’t obvious, and so relatively few people actually did opt out of personalized ads. However that has all changed with the release of iOS 14.5.</p>

 What Changed in iOS 14.5 

<p>As of iOS 14.5, apps now have to explicitly request access to the advertising ID, and in doing so, will trigger an OS-level prompt asking the user if it’s okay for the app to track their activity across other apps. Similar to the location tracking prompt, the app developer gets to add a sentence that will be displayed in the prompt in order to explain to the user why they are asking for this access.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There is a fantastic gallery of these prompts from a wide variety of apps being collected at <a href="https://www.attprompts.com">https://www.attprompts.com</a></p>

<p>The options presented to the user are “Ask App Not to Track” and “Allow.” App developers and advertisers are worried that most users will not choose “Allow,” blocking advertisers’  access to this advertising ID. If the user doesn’t allow this permission, when the app goes to read the advertising ID, it will get a string of zeros.</p>

<p>So what does it mean if an app developer isn’t able to access the user’s advertising ID anymore? Without the IDFA, and without any sort of login mechanism, developers of two different apps have no way to know that the same user is using both apps, or that both apps are installed on the same device. Because of that, ad networks used within apps can’t track user’s activity across different apps, only within a single app. This means the inability to show users “personalized” ads based on information learned about them from outside the app.</p>

 Limiting All Forms of Cross-App Tracking 

<p>While returning all zeros as the advertising ID is a technical limitation Apple can put in place, Apple actually has taken this one step further and put guidelines in place in their App Store review process that prevent apps from attempting any kind of cross-app tracking for advertising purposes. This means if a user selects “Ask App Not to Track,” not only will the advertising ID be unavailable, the app is not allowed to do any sort of tracking with any other information for advertising purposes either.</p>

<p>There are plenty of techniques available to try to identify users in order to track them outside of the application, including everything from device fingerprinting to using social login, or really any sort of login. For example, if your app asked the user to log in with Twitter, and a completely different app asked the user to also log in with Twitter, both apps could share the user’s Twitter ID with an ad network to link the user between the two apps. This would also be possible with traditional login just asking for an email address and password, since both apps can share the user’s email address with the tracking service. However, this kind of cross-app tracking is explicitly prohibited by Apple’s new rules when used for advertising purposes.</p>

 What This Means for Your Applications 

<p>So what does this mean for your own applications? Will you have to show this prompt to the user if you are just asking them to log in? Not exactly!</p>

<p>Apple’s rules around the advertising ID and cross-app tracking are specifically written to address the advertising use case. If you are tracking users across apps for the purposes of advertising, then you do need to prompt the user and respect their decision if they choose “Ask App Not to Track”. However, this doesn’t affect non-advertising use cases—for example, asking users to log in so they can save their work. While this technically could be used for cross-app tracking, just providing a login feature doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be required to show the app tracking prompt, as long as you aren’t tracking the user in order to show them ads. And yes, this is definitely a judgment call more than a technical limitation, and whether your app complies with the rules will ultimately be judged by Apple during the App Store review process.</p>

<p>One thing to pay attention to as you’re developing your apps is which third-party libraries you’re including. It’s quite possible that some third-party libraries have code that will do some form of cross-app tracking even if you don’t do anything special with the SDK. For example, if you have included the Facebook SDK in your app to use Facebook login, you’ll want to make sure that you update it to the latest version before publishing an update of your app. Prior versions of the SDK included had no way of opting out of the cross-app tracking that the SDK performed. Facebook introduced a new “Limited Data Mode” in the SDK which avoids cross-app tracking. From their <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2021/01/19/facebook-login-updates-new-limited-data-mode/">announcement post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
When using the limited version of Facebook Login, the fact that a person used Facebook Login with this iOS app will not be used to personalize or measure advertising effectiveness
</blockquote>

<p>This introduction of the new “Limited Data Mode” gives your app a way to continue to use Facebook login while not breaking Apple’s rules around cross-app tracking.</p>

<p>Since we’ve seen some examples of how social login features can either intentionally or inadvertently be tracking users across apps, you might be wondering what this means if you’re using Okta’s own iOS SDKs. Okta’s SDKs support signing in with an Okta account as well as <a>Sign In with Apple</a> and other social login providers. The good news is Okta has never shared user identifiers with anyone else, so you don’t need to worry about accidentally breaking Apple’s rules by including the Okta SDK!</p>

<p>With Dock’s Proof of Stake (PoS) mainnet <a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-proof-of-stake-mainnet-will-launch-on-july-7th-2021/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=how-validation-works-in-docks-proof-of-stake">launch</a> coming up on July 7th, 2021 at 1pm GMT, we’re adding finishing touches to the network. In this post, we will discuss the requirements for participating in the PoS mainnet as a validator, steps for getting started, and how the network will reward its validators while keeping them motivated to carry out their duties properly.</p><p>As explained in our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/nominating-validators-on-docks-proof-of-stake-network/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=how-validation-works-in-docks-proof-of-stake">earlier article</a> about nomination, the Proof of Stake algorithm will select validators based on the combination of Dock tokens staked by each candidate and by nominators backing them. Once their validator node is up and running, candidate validators can set up their accounts, verify their identities, and stake tokens for their candidacy by following the steps described in our <a href="https://docs.dock.io/validators">validator documentation</a>.</p><p>Once validators are selected and begin producing blocks, the network will incentivize them to act responsibly by rewarding the validation activity while punishing negative behaviors. Each year, the network will release ~25% of the remaining token supply, with a total of 150 million tokens released over the next 25 years. Here is a table illustrating the token emission schedule:</p><p>Year</p><p>Tokens Released</p><p>Tokens Remaining</p><p>Total Issuance</p><p>1</p><p>36,652,688</p><p>109,958,063</p><p>890,041,937</p><p>2</p><p>27,489,516</p><p>82,468,547</p><p>917,531,453</p><p>3</p><p>20,617,137</p><p>61,851,410</p><p>938,148,590</p><p>4</p><p>15,462,853</p><p>46,388,558</p><p>953,611,442</p><p>5</p><p>11,597,139</p><p>34,791,418</p><p>965,208,582</p><p>10</p><p>2,752,056</p><p>8,256,167</p><p>991,743,833</p><p>15</p><p>653,076</p><p>1,959,227</p><p>998,040,773</p><p>20</p><p>154,978</p><p>464,934</p><p>999,535,066</p><p>25</p><p>36,777</p><p>110,331</p><p>999,889,669</p><p>The rewards, which consist of the tokens released by the network and transaction fees paid by network users, will be distributed among validators and their nominators. More information on rewards can be found <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/token-economics/econ-pos">here</a>.</p><p>If a validator misbehaves by being offline, equivocating, or engaging in any malicious behavior, the network will penalize them through slashing and/or chilling. In slashing, the harshest of the penalties, some or all of the tokens staked by the validator and their nominators would be taken away and distributed to the Dock Treasury and/or other validators. The amount of tokens affected will depend on the number of validators that are misbehaving, with a heavier penalty applied as the number of offending validators increases. In chilling, the offending validator would be removed from the validator set and prevented from participating in the next validator selection, hence barring them from earning rewards for some time. More information about these penalties can be found <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/governance/slashing">here</a>.</p><p>In order to get started, there are some technical requirements that all validators must meet:</p>  1 or 2 publicly accessible machines  At least 4 GB of RAM  At least 50 GB of SSD  Bandwidth of 10 Mbps over WAN  Some familiarity with provisioning machines (either cloud or on-prem) and some familiarity with Linux command line is needed to run the provided scripts to generate keys and deploy your node. Dock currently supports Ubuntu 18.04. Any cloud provider can be used to run a Dock node cost at minimal expense.  <p>If the technical requirements are met, candidates can start running their validator nodes by following the instructions posted <a href="https://docs.dock.io/validators/tooling/becoming-a-validator">here</a>.</p><p>We are looking forward to completing this important milestone, and will update the community when the Proof of Stake transition is completed in the mainnet later this week. In the meantime, we encourage you to learn more by reviewing our <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn">docs</a> and other articles on our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/">blog</a>, and to reach out to us via <a href="https://twitter.com/docknetwork">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/feW8KGf7r3">Discord</a> with any questions.</p>

<p>As a follow up to our recent teaser video, we are pleased to share more details about our set of trusted solutions for the health industry. The core functionality of ShareRing Health has been designed to be piloted at health centers for Covid-19 in advance of a wider rollout of use cases across the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ShareRing Health solutions use our proprietary blockchain to securely tie an individual’s digital identity to an encrypted, immutable record of health data. Our Personal Information Vault (PIV) allows users to then safely store these credentials for future use. The final stage of the cycle is when the individual uses these encrypted and verified credentials to access goods or services around the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Importantly, throughout this entire process ShareRing never stores any sensitive health information on our servers or the cloud, we utilise a no-knowledge proof of transfer. The user also retains complete control of their data thereby providing a truly self-sovereign identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Issuing the health credential</p>



<p>Health center staff conduct a visual identity check of the individual against their OCR-checked and face-matched ShareRing ID documents. This ensures the health data is tied to the right person in an encrypted and immutable structure, thereby reducing the risks of fraud. Depending on whether the health center has the technology to create a QR code or not will determine the route used to add the health credentials into the user’s PIV.</p>



<p>Credential ownership</p>



<p>Once the user receives the digital vaccination or test certificate from the issuer it is added to their secure PIV on their mobile device. This, combined with their OCR-checked and face-matched ID and other documents that will be added in due course, can be used to simplify their day-to-day lives as society moves forward. Due to the self-sovereign nature of the platform, users can rest assured knowing that their data cannot be viewed or accessed by anyone without their permission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consumption</p>



<p>ShareRing has&nbsp; and continues to build a variety of routes for businesses to consume these verified health credentials. We are initially responding to requests from sporting venues, hotels, and the wider tourism industry. These new features illustrate ShareRing’s dedication to restoring normality to the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Benefits</p>



<p>Benefits to corporate stakeholders include:</p>



  Enhanced customer experience and engagement  Improved operational efficiency  Secure data transfer  Blockchain-grade Security with immutable datasets  Reduced cybersecurity costs&nbsp;  Increased visibility and business potential resulting from being part of our wider ecosystem  



<p>Benefits to users include:</p>



  All key documents stored in one, secure, user-friendly app  Peace of mind with privacy-by-design  Contactless journey when accessing goods and services  Easy registration and on-boarding  Ability to locate nearby health centers or businesses  Seamless access to venues and events  Express check-in for hotels (where activated)  



<p>ShareRing&nbsp; contributes to and fully supports the Good Health Pass blueprint. Embracing this ethos, ShareRing Health has been developed to be interoperable, allowing a user to share their verified health data with other systems.</p>



<p>Throughout the entire data lifecycle we combine blockchain technology with self-sovereign identity and have eliminated the need to store sensitive personal information on our servers. The result is a platform which allows all stakeholders to share trusted and verified data with the highest forms of protection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond test and vaccination certificates, future uses within the health industry could be expanded to prescription issuance, operation and treatment records, allergies, training and vocational certificates for staff, as well as using trusted health records to assist with insurance policies.</p>



<p>To pilot our health solutions at your facility or venue please contact our sales team and request a demo today.

<p>Yesterday we announced the <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/the-holoport-alpha-program-f35324ba367d">HoloPort Alpha Program</a>, where HoloPort owners can earn in HoloFuel just for leaving their machines on. (I’m not kidding! Go read the announcement! There are some uptime requirements, and it might not be available in all countries, but that’s about it.)</p><p>What is this programme about? Haven’t we already been alpha testing the Holo network for ages? Well yes, that’s technically true. The difference here is the whole ‘paid in HoloFuel’ thing. And the reason for this is that we need a lot of HoloPorts to stay turned on all day. Here’s why.</p> Availability and scalability <p>As we start inviting people to test out Elemental Chat hosting via the web, we need to be assured that the HoloPorts assigned to store their messages will stay online. In the future we’ll have redundant backup for each user’s app instance, but for now our focus is more on stress-testing Holochain and the hosting infrastructure.</p><p>We also want to be able to serve lots of users and see how it performs. In order to do this, we’ll need to have lots of capacity online, ready to start serving apps to new sign-ups.</p> Parallel testing <p>Our current pre-release alpha testers have been wonderful — infinitely patient, supportive, rigorous in their testing and bug reporting. But as we invite in more testers, we want it to be a smoother experience — both for their sakes, and for the sake of our support team.</p><p>So as the dev teams keep building features and fixing bugs in Holochain, HPOS (the operating system on HoloPorts), and Elemental chat, we need to roll the updates carefully so we can roll them back if needed. Hosts who choose to participate in the Alpha programme will allow their HoloPorts to be remotely switched to staging or various different testing channels of HPOS. These tests will remain small — restricted to team members and the aforementioned pre-release members. Hidden bugs will get discovered before they’re released to the wider world, which will make everyone happier.</p> Holochain v0.0.101 released <p>The core dev team has released a new version of Holochain this week. It comes with a huge pile of changes (v0.0.100 was released in <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-pulse-91-hdk-stable-for-now/">February</a>, after all, and the <code>develop</code> branch has been changing fast since then). Here’s a short list:</p>  The storage engine has moved from LMDB to SQLite in preparation for sharded storage and the immune system.  Network traffic for entry publishing has been throttled back to avoid flooding the network.  The gossip algorithm no longer floods the network on each received operation, moving instead to a slow loop. It also uses Bloom filters rather than Merkle trees for syncing, which means brief CPU spikes but fewer bytes over the wire.  Wasmer, the WebAssembly engine Holochain uses to run hApps, has been updated to version 2. We’ve discovered a bug in this version of Wasmer that causes memory leaks and slows down execution. We’ve built some workarounds, but we’re waiting for the bug to be fixed upstream. In the meantime, you should only notice performance issues if you’re testing lots of instances of a single hApp in one conductor.  The admin API for installing apps has <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/665">changed</a>:<br>• There’s a new endpoint, <code>InstallAppBundle</code>.<br>• The endpoint <code>RegisterDna</code> can now take a <code>DnaBundle</code>.<br>• Breaking: The endpoint <code>InstallApp</code> now only accepts DNA hashes. Specifying DNAs by paths has been removed, as has the ability to specify properties at install time. Please move to using <code>InstallAppBundle</code> and <code>RegisterDna</code> instead.<br>• Breaking: When specifying DNAs by path, the endpoint <code>RegisterDna</code> must point to a DNA bundle, not a single DNA file.  The dev tool <code>hc</code> has had the <code>install_app</code> subcommand <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/665">temporarily removed</a> in favour of <code>install_app_bundle</code>.  Breaking: All references to <code>”uuid”</code> in the DNA have been <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/727">renamed to <code>”uid”</code></a>.  The HDK has two new crypto functions, <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.101/hdk/ed25519/fn.sign_ephemeral.html"><code>sign_ephemeral</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.101/hdk/ed25519/fn.sign_ephemeral_raw.html"><code>sign_ephemeral_raw</code></a>.  <p>Read the whole changelog <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/ea726cc05aa6064c3b8b4f85fddf3e89429f018e/CHANGELOG.md">here</a>.</p><p>Performance warning: We do expect performance to be better in some places and worse in others. Changes in the wire protocol have resulted in less network traffic, while changes to Wasmer and SQLite have both improved and degraded memory and CPU usage. Using v0.0.101 for development work should be fine, but we don’t recommend bundling it with user-facing hApps yet.</p><p>You can get the new Holochain by <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/install/">entering the Holonix shell</a> or downloading it from crates.io via <code>cargo</code> (<a href="https://crates.io/crates/holochain/0.0.101">conductor</a>, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/hdk/0.0.101">HDK</a>).</p> Errata and additions for last week’s developer ecosystem roundup <p>After I published all those lovely developer resources, a couple devs pointed out that I’d missed some pretty important ones. There are also a few new things that have popped up in the meantime.</p>  <a href="https://github.com/Sprillow/embedded-holochain-runner/">Embedded Holochain Runner</a> makes it easy to run Holochain as a library in your own app. This lets you bundle up everything in a single executable without any background services to manage. It’s already being used in <a href="https://github.com/h-be/acorn">Acorn</a>.  There’s the beginnings of a <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/geolocation">geolocation zome</a> that lets you tag and search for things by latitude and longitude. The developers are also talking about adding the ability to search within range, optimised by breaking the globe up into ‘cells’.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/cell-client">Cell-client</a> is a wrapper around the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-conductor-api/">JavaScript client SDK</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/Holo-Host/web-sdk/">Holo Web SDK</a> that makes it easy for your UI to target both self-hosted Holochain and Holo-hosted at the same time.  There’s a full set of <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/core-types">TypeScript typedefs</a> for Holochain core types; this is useful for interfacing your UI with your DNA.  Connor Turland has written up a great guide on unit-testing zome functions and validation callbacks, along with a <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/minimal-hdk-unit-test-example/tree/main/zome/src">minimal example</a> and some handy <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/minimal-hdk-unit-test-example/blob/main/zome/src/validate_helpers.rs">validation helpers</a>.  The community-created wiki is growing, with new articles on <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki/Writing-a-validation-hook-for-an-entry-type">writing good validation functions</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki/How-To-Write-An-Entry-Struct-with-an-Enum-Field-That-Serializes-Nicely-(Serde-Msgpack)">serialising Rust enums nicely</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki/How-to-create-a-Holochain-network-over-the-internet">creating a network</a>.  There’s a rich conversation happening on the forum about <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/overall-thoughts-from-developers-using-holochain/6348/7">what the developer experience is like</a> so far. If you’ve been doing any dev work with RSM, come over and celebrate/complain with other devs :)  <p>Do you have any developer resources I’ve forgotten? Post them in the comments section below and I’ll feature them in a future Dev Pulse.</p><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@sadswim?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">ian dooley</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/balloon-launch?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p>

In recent years, the growth in identities operating across cloud and digital services has seen vendors offering IAM solutions as a service to assist with this growing complexity and concomitant security challenge.

This is IDaaS designed by a third-party integrator using best of breed identity components to build an IAM solution that is bespoke to operational and budgetary requirements and can also be operated by the integrator if the customer chooses.</p>

<p>Introduction: The Cryptocurrency Mining Carbon Emissions Political Discussion</p>As Cryptocurrencies Garner Mainstream Coverage, A Specific Environmental And Political Issue Has Spawned: How Does Cryptocurrency Mining Affect&nbsp;Climate?<p>Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology have been making headlines over the past year, garnering mainstream adoption and attention for a variety of reasons. One specific issue has garnered massive political attention from some of the most influential and powerful people in the world and that issue is “how does cryptocurrency mining and creation affect the environment? Elon Musk, the wealthiest man in the world and founder of SpaceX, Tesla and Neuralink, has publicly stated his stance on cryptocurrency; Musk believes that cryptocurrency possesses a bright future, but believes it yields a massive carbon footprint. Elon Musk hasn’t been the only individual touting this rallying cry, but political commentators such as Bill Maher and Former Democratic Presidential Nominee Elizabeth Warren have consistently urged Congress to crack down on cryptocurrencies because of their impact on the environment and lack of regulatory oversight.</p><p>It is evident that cryptocurrency mining requires energy inputs and outputs, and the question of its impact on the environment has raised regulatory questions, specifically associated with massive centralized mining farms. According to The Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index at the University of Cambridge “The most reputable such estimate comes from the <a href="https://cbeci.org/">University of Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index</a>, according to which the global bitcoin network currently consumes about 80 terawatt-hours of electricity annually, roughly equal to the annual output of <a href="https://www.mcginley.co.uk/news/how-much-of-each-energy-source-does-it-take-to-power-your-home/bp254/">23 coal-fired power plants</a>, or close to what is consumed by the nation of <a href="https://www.iea.org/countries/finland">Finland</a>.” Fathom this for a minute, are these politicians and economic titans wrong on their perspective that Bitcoin is harmful for the environment based on the above quote, or are they just unaware that projects like Aergo have joined an entity known as the “Crypto Climate Accord” who’s aim is to immensely decrease the amount of carbon emissions cryptocurrency mining farms create. If mainstream adoption is to occur, it is incumbent that it doesn’t come at the cost of our planet, our&nbsp;home.</p>Bill Maher, Speaking Vehemently Against Bitcoin In A Recent “Real Time With Bill Maher: New Rules”&nbsp;Segment<p>The Crypto Climate Accord: Combatting Climate Change Through Decreasing Blockchain Carbon Emissions</p>Aergo Has Joined the Crypto Climate Accord And Aims To Give Preference To Projects Who Aim To Garner Net Zero Carbon Emissions<p>The Crypto Climate Accord, inspired by the Paris Climate Accord, is fighting back against climate change and the detrimental affects fossil fuels have on our environment. The Crypto Climate Accord’s main vision and goal is a planet where cryptocurrency thrives while our environment survives; how is this achieved, through net zero carbon emission blockchain platforms that transition to 100% renewables. The Crypto Climate Accord was created by three specific entities “Energy Web, The Alliance For Innovative Regulation and RMI Energy Transformed” and the Accord envisions a blockchain paradigm that decarbonizes the cryptocurrency industry at a record rate. The signatories of this Accord pledge to reduce their emissions to net zero emissions from electricity consumption by the year 2030. As of July 2021, over thirty companies have become ardent supporters of this Accord: some companies to name are Aergo, Enjin, Ripple, Polygon (Matic) and Terra Pool.” Industries from all over the globe that utilize electricity consumption have perpetuated the ideals and actions that facilitate decarbonization, and it is about time cryptocurrency does the same, and Aergo emphasizes such an&nbsp;ethos.</p>Aergo Will Play A Vital Role In The Expansion Of The Crypto Climate Accord And Intends On Putting Their Principles Where Their Mouths Are As A Show Of Leadership And Devotion: By Decarbonizing Their Own Blockchain<p>Aergo, is one of the projects that intends on fighting back against carbon emissions through their induction into The Crypto Climate Accord. Aergo is a hybrid-blockchain platform based out of South Korea that has joined “The Crypto Climate Accord” in an attempt to facilitate discussions and actions that lead to net-zero carbon emissions, not just through their platform, but through the entirety of the cryptocurrency sphere. Aergo intends on giving preference to companies, partners and projects who aim for zero net carbon emissions. Aergo is also aiming to lower its own carbon footprint to net-zero by the end of the decade. The primary focus for Aergo to preserve and expand the continuity of our environment is to require all block producers within the Aergo ecosystem to go carbon net zero by the year 2030. Aergo also has many unannounced partnerships with service and cloud providers that have ESG initiatives who aim to achieve net zero carbon emissions by&nbsp;2030.</p><p>ESG “Environmental, Social, Governance” initiatives are set standards for a company’s operation that socially conscious investors use to screen potential investment prospects. Environmental criteria consider how a company performs as a steward and a protector of nature and Earth. Social criteria examine how it manages relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities where it operates, including local, national or global entities. Governance deals with a company’s leadership, executive pay, and shareholder rights. Aergo aims to embody the principles of the Crypto Climate Accord through three core principles.</p><p>The Guiding Principles Of Aergo: A Healthier Planet Leads To Mainstream Adoption</p>Aergo’s Carbon Conscious Principles: A Better Environment&nbsp;, A Better&nbsp;World<p>The first principle is to build upon our existing progress; it is evident that carbon emissions are reducing in electrical sectors and Aergo aims to utilize tactics and strategies that have been proven successful surrounding lowering carbon emissions. The second principle is to move quickly; Aergo aims to have a completely carbon net zero blockchain by the year 2030 and it is necessary to comprehend how blockchain can benefit such an idea. The same decentralized technology underpinning the global crypto industry — blockchain — can bring transformational levels of data transparency and trust to decarbonization efforts; Aergo desires to facilitate such a notion ubiquitously throughout the blockchain sphere. The third principle is to be community driven. It is evident that the success of a project can be determined by the ethos of the community that backs it; Aergo aims to encourage its community to ensure that blockchain doesn’t further exacerbate climate change, but coordinates with Aergo and other projects to fight against this harmful paradigm. Aergo will be one of the stewards that will stand the test of time in the blockchain space for fighting back against carbon emissions.</p><p>Conclusion: Climate Consciousness: A Blockchain Necessity</p>Earth Gave Blockchain Life, Its Time To Return The&nbsp;Favor<p>Blockchain technology has become a dominant force to be reckoned with since the inception of Bitcoin in 2008, but like all new technological innovations, they’re accompanied by a host of dilemmas that must be rectified to transcend into its natural next step of technological evolution. Cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies, in order to garner mainstream attraction and utilization, must lower their carbon emissions and not facilitate the further decimation of our planet. Banking the unbanked can not come at the cost of unbanking the planet of its atmosphere and clean energy. The time to change is now, and Aergo will perpetuate such an environmentally conscious zeitgeist.</p><p>Helpful Links:</p><p><a href="https://cryptoclimate.org/">Home - Crypto Climate Accord</a></p><p><a href="https://www.aergo.io/">https://www.aergo.io/</a></p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency investing and gambling requires substantial risk, do not invest or gamble more than you can afford to lose!

   In the digital era, IT is increasingly being provided and consumed as cloud-based services, including Identity and Access Management (IAM). As more workloads and IT services move to the cloud, it makes sense to move IAM to the cloud as well. The most common path is to opt for an Identity as a service (IDaaS) solution, but this is not without its risks and challenges.

<p>At MATTR we’re always dreaming up ways to make decentralized identity and verifiable credentials easy and intuitive to use for as many people as possible.</p><p>From the start, it’s been a core part of our mission to make sure that end users understand the implications of decentralized identity and the control it affords them over their data and their privacy. This model offers users greater sovereignty over their own information by empowering individuals as both the holder and subject of information that pertains to them. Users are able to exercise their new role in this ecosystem by utilizing a new class of software known as <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/digital-wallets">digital&nbsp;wallets</a>.</p><p>We first released our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/onboarding/install/wallet">Mobile Wallet</a> for smartphones in June 2020, with a simple user interface to allow people to interact with and receive credentials from issuers as well as present credentials to relying parties. In the interim, we have developed a number of improvements and features to the Mobile Wallet to support advanced capabilities such&nbsp;as:</p>  Authenticating to Identity Providers over OpenID Connect to receive credentials via OIDC&nbsp;Bridge  Deriving privacy-preserving selective disclosure presentations from credentials using BBS+ signatures  Establishing a secure DID messaging inbox for users to receive encrypted messages and push notifications  <p>These changes have not only made the wallet more functional; they’ve also evolved to better protect users’ best interests — giving them privacy-by-design and surfacing the information and context that they need to confidently make decisions underpinned by the security of decentralized identity.</p>Timeline of MATTR wallet development<p>This journey has led us to realize the importance of creating a wallet experience that places users front and center. As these systems create more opportunity for user-driven consent and identity management, they’ve simultaneously created a demand for a wallet that can not only perform the technical operations required, but do so in a user-friendly way that surfaces the information that truly matters to people. Our latest feature release to the MATTR Mobile Wallet is a step in this direction.</p><p>With Human-Friendly Credentials, we have added the capability to render different kinds of credentials uniquely in the wallet interface according to the information they contain. Until now, the end user experience for verifiable credentials has been largely consistent across different categories of credentials and issuers. In other words, a credential containing medical data from your doctor looks exactly the same as an education credential from your university or a concert ticket from a music venue: they all appear to the user as a long list of&nbsp;claims.</p><p>In this release we change that. Thanks to the semantic information encoded in verifiable credentials, the wallet is now able to understand and interpret certain kinds of credentials to render them to the user in a way that makes the data easier to understand.</p><p><a href="https://learn.mattr.global/concepts/semantic-web#json-ld">JSON-LD</a> verifiable credentials have the ability to support common data vocabularies and schemas which are published on the web. For example, if a credential contains a claim describing the name of an individual, the claim can be defined via reference to an existing data vocabulary found here: <a href="https://schema.org/Person">https://schema.org/Person</a></p><p>Human-Friendly Credentials allow the wallet to start intelligently displaying known credential types and data types. This shows up in a variety of different ways in a user’s&nbsp;dataset.</p><p>For example, this update formats address fields to make them more readable; formats names and proper nouns where possible; makes URLs, telephone numbers and email addresses clickable; highlights images and icons for better trust and brand signaling; and creates basic rules for language localization that adjust to a user’s device settings. This logic allows the wallet to create a kind of information hierarchy that starts to draw out the important aspects of data included in a credential, so users can make trust-based decisions using this information.</p><p>These rules are applied to any kind of credential the wallet encounters. Whilst all of this is incredibly helpful for users, we have gone a step further: displaying entire credentials in a completely unique UI according to their type. The ‘type’ property of a credential expresses what kind of information is in the credential — is it a degree, a medical record, a utility bill? The usage of common credential types across different implementations and ecosystems is necessary for semantic interoperability on the broader scale. The wallet should be able to recognize these common credential types and display them to the user in a friendly&nbsp;way.</p><p>In this update, we have added custom rendering for both Personal Identity Credentials as well as Education Courses. These are common types we see occurring naturally across the decentralized identity landscape, and now the MATTR Mobile Wallet is able to recognize and display them properly.</p>Personal Identity Credentials and Education Course credentials<p>An important note to consider is that Human-Friendly Credentials only work for known data and credential types. As the ecosystem matures, we expect to add more data types and credential types in the future to support an even broader set of human-related processes and actions. In a general sense, we will also continue to iterate on our digital wallet offerings to provide a greater degree of flexibility and control for end users. We believe it’s a vital component to a healthy digital trust ecosystem.</p><p>To check out these changes yourself, download the latest version of our <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/onboarding/install/wallet">Mobile Wallet</a> to get&nbsp;started.</p><p>For more information on Human-Friendly Credentials, check out our tutorials and video content on MATTR&nbsp;Learn.</p><p>For everything else related to MATTR, visit <a href="https://mattr.global">https://mattr.global</a> or follow <a href="https://twitter.com/mattrglobal">@MattrGlobal on&nbsp;Twitter</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/rendering-credentials-in-a-human-friendly-way-e47f4a32fd4b">Rendering credentials in a human-friendly way</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>[ update Jul 1, 2021 4:51PM EST&nbsp;]</p><p>We’ve found another minor glitch that will result in a “success” transaction but no upgrade&nbsp;event.</p><p>This will not affect the total balance or prevent you from any other activities. This will consume gas much like a failed transaction.</p> Our diagnostic <p>We have found that the issue relates to our <a href="https://upgrade.shyft.network/">upgrade.shyft.network</a> dApp’s rounding of floating point numbers in comparison to the input fields (human readable) and the ‘wei’ value in the background.</p><p>We can see this in the first completed Upgrade that emits Logs and Events. The second has not completed, the transaction is a ‘success’, but no on-chain balances have changed, and no event logs&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Zooming in, we can see that the input value ends with ‘050000’ and the ‘Quantity’ of the actual tokens in storage in this address are ‘048192’. As the input value is higher than the actual value, the Upgrade event fails, and due to the fact that we could not modify the original contract, we could not get additional events/notifications in&nbsp;place.</p> Suggested Fixes <p>1. A bit more patience — We’ll get a new dApp up that does the mathematics properly in relation to the input fields, should be able to get it up later tonight, reasonable 100% estimate is Friday June 2nd at 5pm&nbsp;EST.</p><p>2.

 Paying for use of HoloPorts during&nbsp;Alpha <p>We are incredibly appreciative of our community of early adopters who pre-purchased HoloPorts. In previous months many HoloPort owners contributed greatly to our ability to release early milestones. These community testers are people who have monitors and keyboards connected to their ports and who’ve dedicated their time to actively participate with our delivery team during early test cycles. Huge&nbsp;thanks!</p><p>Now we need to expand testing. It’s becoming increasingly important for the continued evolution of the Holo platform. At this stage, Holo is looking to set up parallel test environments which require consistent support from hundreds of HoloPorts. This will better reflect how the infrastructure and applications will work when running at scale on the platform. Creating multiple test environments helps our development and QA efforts and is especially needed for the upcoming release of hosted Elemental Chat, as well as the subsequent Holo application milestones.</p><p>Because of that, Holo would like to offer HoloPort owners a new opportunity to make their port available for use by Holo during the Alpha testing&nbsp;period.</p><p>Participants in the HoloPort Alpha Program can choose to volunteer their HoloPort or receive a small stipend in HoloFuel based on meeting the minimum metrics each month. The reason we are offering this stipend now is because as we move forward, it is critical that the HoloPorts remain turned on and connected to the Internet while we are&nbsp;testing.</p><p>Here are the requirements for the HoloPort Alpha&nbsp;Program:</p>  HoloPorts must be updated to the latest version of&nbsp;HPOS  Participants must be signed up and accepted into the HoloPort Alpha&nbsp;Program*  HoloPorts must have monthly uptime of&nbsp;95%  HoloPorts must maintain SSH at an availability level of&nbsp;99%  <p>A stipend of 10,000 HF** will accrue monthly for each port and will be paid upon Beta launch (mainnet) of the Holo platform. We’ll send all participants a weekly report on metrics and a monthly report that details the stipend accrual. For the general public we’re also preparing a simple dashboard that aggregates network data about the HoloPorts active on the platform.</p><p>Registration for the HoloPort Alpha program will open up in July. To get ready, it’s important that you <a href="https://forum.holo.host/t/how-to-update-your-holoport/3379">update your HoloPort</a> to the latest version of HPOS. If you own a HoloPort please reach out to <a href="http://help@holo.host">help@holo.host</a> for your invite to the Holo Forum where you will find all HoloPort guidance as well as community support.</p><p>We will be holding an AMA later this month and you can <a href="https://holochain.typeform.com/to/RFsluzvz">submit questions with this&nbsp;link.</a></p><p>We’re excited to be expanding Alpha testing to the wider Holo host community!</p><p>– The Holo&nbsp;Team</p><p>* Holo may limit the program to certain jurisdictions as may be required by&nbsp;law.</p><p>** The stipend amount may change from time to time if there are material changes to the HOT&nbsp;price.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/the-holoport-alpha-program-f35324ba367d">The HoloPort Alpha Program</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o">HOLO</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Img source: NASA via unsplash.com<p><a href="https://www.transmute.industries/">Transmute</a>, the Verifiable Data Platform for global trade, is proud to announce that the United States Patent and Trademark Office has issued Patent №11,050,572 titled, “Systems and Methods for a Decentralized Data Authentication Platform.” The patent covers unique technology in Transmute’s Platform that immutably anchors verifiable credentials to decentralized identifiers to enable cryptographically provable integrity checks.</p><p>In the Transmute Platform, we often refer to this specific anchoring process as the “Transmute Integrity Check.” Customers need the ability to prove that a credential was issued at a specific moment in time, so we leveraged the existing open standards in a unique way to provide an extension to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> that allows them to be anchored to <a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> (DIDs) and checked for evidence of tampering at the same time the credential content is verified according to the standard process. This gives customers confidence that the data is authentic and has not been tampered with since it was anchored.</p><p>For example, an international shipping company can issue trade documents such as a verifiable commercial invoice using the Transmute Platform. This invoice can be cryptographically verified by any receiving party, agnostic of delivery method or technical system. Recipients like carriers, banks, consignees, or customs organizations can click a button or make an API call to run the Transmute Integrity Check ensuring that this exact invoice was in fact issued by the shipper at a particular moment in&nbsp;time.</p><p>“We built the Transmute Platform to solve the trust challenges inherent in multi-party transactions like moving goods through a supply chain from origin to end customer,” says Karyl Fowler, CEO and Co-Founder of Transmute. “We are known for our corporate commitment to open, interoperable global standards, and pragmatic implementation that meets customers on the systems they’re already relying on. Our technical approach builds atop these standards in a novel way that enables companies to securely share verifiable data across existing silos, and we patented this method to protect our customers’ ability to harness it at&nbsp;scale.”</p><p><a href="https://www.transmute.industries/">Transmute</a> combines the best of centralized and decentralized technologies to secure critical trade data related to suppliers, products, and shipments to give customers a competitive edge in the increasingly dynamic global marketplace. Our Verifiable Data Platform leverages open standards-compliant decentralized identifier-based technology to streamline and enforce identity authorization via key-based signatures, cloud-wallets, verifiable credentials, and immutable logging. The Transmute Platform and its underlying microservice components are being actively piloted with clients and enterprise partners in the global trade and IT industries.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/transmute-issued-u-s-patent-for-decentralized-data-authentication-18f54a13745b">Transmute Issued U.S. Patent for Decentralized Data Authentication</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Robots are producing a lot of data daily; some pieces of that data are quite valuable and could be monetized by a robot or its developer.</p><p><a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a> provides a ready-made platform to buy, sell, and utilize robot-generated data. The partnership aims to create a sandbox for testing collaboration of both technologies for further development of pilot projects and products in&nbsp;2021.</p><blockquote>With this collaboration, Ocean Protocol will help Robonomics to leverage their technology and discover new use cases in securely monetising plethora of data generated by robots and helping robots and related IoT devices become revenue generating machines.</blockquote><blockquote>– Manan Patel, Growth Accelerator at Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>With Robonomics, robots and IoT devices can become autonomous economic agents, meaning they can enter into legal obligations, own things, and do whatever humans can do on the open labor market and even&nbsp;more.</p><blockquote>Joint experiments of Robonomics and OCEAN teams on the crossing subjects, specifically launch of the cyber-physical-systems and processing produced data will allow merging teams knowledge and could lead to marvellous discoveries within 1&nbsp;year.</blockquote><blockquote>– Sergei Lonshakov, Software Architect at Robonomics</blockquote><p>One of the first milestones for this collaboration will be creating a course explaining how to launch a device on Robonomics Network, then store and monetize data on Ocean Protocol in a virtual environment.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value. Data owners and consumers use the Ocean Market app to publish, discover, and consume data assets in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.</p><p>Ocean datatokens turn data into data assets. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools. Projects use Ocean libraries and OCEAN in their own apps to help drive the Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>The Ocean token is used to stake on data, to govern Ocean Protocol’s community funding, and to buy &amp; sell data. Its supply is disbursed over time to drive near-term growth and long-term sustainability.

The full initial integration will also involve bridging OCEAN token from Ethereum Mainnet, and a new deployment of Ocean Market webapp components for Moonbeam. Once complete, this will enable users to publish data, stake on data, and buy data in the Polkadot ecosystem in an open, secure&nbsp;fashion.</p><p>The partnership between Ocean Protocol and Moonbeam will lead to additional updates. For example, assets from both Ethereum Mainnet and Moonbeam will be viewable side-by-side in the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a>. Further data privacy-enhancing features will be rolled out. And over time, there will be ways to bridge datatokens themselves across networks and to share liquidity.</p><blockquote>It’s our pleasure to work with the Moonbeam team to start engaging with the Polkadot ecosystem. We have long envisioned Ocean to be a data asset layer across many blockchain networks. Polkadot is all about interoperability among these networks. Since Ocean deployed initially to Ethereum Mainnet, then the clear starting point for Ocean in Polkadot is Moonbeam with its Ethereum compatibility.</blockquote><blockquote>– Trent McConaghy, Ocean Protocol Co-Founder</blockquote><p>The Moonbeam team is continuously working to simplify the implementation process for Ethereum developers who want to expand to Polkadot. Ocean Protocol chose Moonbeam as its expansion point because of its unmatched compatibility. Now, the Ocean team can use its existing Ethereum smart contracts to access the new and growing Polkadot ecosystem.</p><blockquote>We’re excited to work with the Ocean team on their first expansion outside of Ethereum. By deploying to Moonbeam, Ocean Protocol will provide the Polkadot ecosystem with access to a robust Web3-based data marketplace. Our partnership will enable privacy-preserving data for use cases that avoid centralized data concentration and&nbsp;abuse.</blockquote><blockquote>– Derek Yoo, PureStake CEO</blockquote><p>To start building on the Moonbeam TestNet, Moonbase Alpha, visit the <a href="http://docs.moonbeam.network/networks/testnet/">official project documentation site</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/nWbtA9x">join their Discord&nbsp;server</a>.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value.

Moving forward, this will enable Injective users to both create and trade on new derivative markets that utilize the data products deployed on <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean&nbsp;Market</a>.</p> Tokenized Data&nbsp;Futures <p>The collaboration will begin with the release of tokenized data futures. Users of Injective will be able to trade data assets with leverage. In addition, users will have the ability to create entirely new derivative markets which utilize these data&nbsp;tokens.</p><blockquote>With this collaboration, Injective users will be able to create and access decentralised derivatives for datatokens starting with Tokenized Data Futures. This is another step towards establishing datatokens as first class citizens of DeFi and introducing a new asset class into DeFi&nbsp;space.</blockquote><blockquote>– Manan Patel, Growth Accelerator at Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>The integration of the price feeds from Ocean will be made possible by Balancer, which is built on top of Ethereum. Given Injective Chain’s EVM-compatible execution environment for DeFi applications, we will be able to acquire dynamic pricing data in order to create both perpetual and expiry futures contracts.</p><blockquote>We at Injective are thrilled to be working with Ocean which continues to be a leading provider of digital assets pertaining to data. This collaboration will undoubtedly aid in opening up new ways for users to interact with data tokens as well as DeFi as a whole. We look forward to democratizing access to data assets globally alongside the team at&nbsp;Ocean.</blockquote><blockquote>– Eric Chen, Injective CEO</blockquote><p>Once the price feeds are live, users can take part in creating new indices, data tracking markets, etc. Market creation is entirely open and permissionless. This will allow anyone to both create a data market using only the price feeds from Balancer and deploy it to the larger Injective ecosystem. This can help to introduce new markets that were previously inconceivable within decentralized finance.</p> A Rapidly Growing Data&nbsp;Market <p>Ocean Protocol is a blockchain-based ecosystem that allows individuals and enterprises to easily unlock the value of their data and monetize it. Through <a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a>, data publishers can monetize their data while preserving privacy and control, whereas data consumers can access datasets that were previously unavailable or difficult to find. Publishing a dataset on Ocean amounts to an Initial Data Offering&nbsp;(IDO).</p><p>The data market is currently valued to be over $140B. This number is only expected to surge moving forward. Tokenized data assets of course present a profound opportunity to introduce new forms of capital allocation. Injective Protocol is seeking to take this one step further with the introduction of tokenized data futures which would help to unlock unlimited possibilities for trading data&nbsp;markets.</p> Looking Ahead <p>We look forward to nurturing the DeFi ecosystem further with the introduction of more innovative use cases for data as an asset. This will aid in both new forms of adoption for digital assets while also helping to signify the true flexibility of data&nbsp;markets.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value.

 Ontology first to support four smart contract platforms including the Ethereum Virtual Machine, providing faster block production speeds and lower handling&nbsp;fees. <p>At the start of 2021, Ontology’s technical team began developing the Ontology Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). In addition to NeoVM, Native (Ontology) VM and WasmVM, we are adding support for the EVM. The goal is to establish seamless interoperability between Ontology and the Ethereum platform, and offer an inclusive experience to developers and&nbsp;users.</p><p>On the third anniversary of Ontology’s MainNet launch, we announced that the development of Ontology EVM had been completed. The existing version adds the Ethereum account system, Ethereum transaction types, and Web 3 APIs. At the same time, the virtual machine layer and transaction pool are optimized and enhanced, and the blockchain browser is synchronized.</p><p>Below, we describe the design and development details.</p> Part 1: Ethereum Virtual&nbsp;Machine  EVM: General Introduction <p>Ethereum <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/">describes</a> the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) as a ‘single entity maintained by thousands of connected computers running an Ethereum&nbsp;client.’</p><p>It goes on to&nbsp;state:</p><p>The Ethereum protocol itself exists solely for the purpose of keeping the continuous, uninterrupted, and immutable operation of this special state machine; It’s the environment in which all Ethereum accounts and smart contracts live. At any given block in the chain, Ethereum has one and only one ‘canonical’ state, and the EVM is what defines the rules for computing a new valid state from block to&nbsp;block.</p> Ontology’s EVM: Introduction <p>The EVM developed by Ontology is a virtual machine compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem. It uses ONG as the gas fee for on-chain services and requires relatively low gas fee consumption. Our goal is to ensure that Ontology’s EVM is fully compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem.</p> Part 2: Design and Development Process  Goals <p>Ontology’s smart contract system adopts the multi virtual machine scheme and supports three kinds of contracts; Native contracts, NeoVM contracts, and Wasm contracts. Thanks to Ethereum’s strong community and ecosystem, adding EVM support for Ontology can facilitate more existing Ethereum ecosystem developers to use Ontology.</p><p>Our aim is to ensure frictionless interoperability between Ontology and Ethereum to reduce migration costs of developers, and at the same time, avoid significant changes to the existing platforms to ensure the continuity of the ecosystem development.</p> Development Process and&nbsp;Results <p>Our development process lasted over one month, with one iteration. Upon completion, Ontology and Ethereum can interoperate seamlessly with a high level of compatibility. Specific features: updated browser, supported Ethereum account system, infrastructure, RPC (remote procedure call), and additional Web 3 interfaces.</p> Enhancements: <p>1) Account System at the Ledger&nbsp;Level</p><p>The underlying ledger status of Ontology only stores contract data; account data is stored in various contract storage areas, including native ONT and ONG contracts. However, Ethereum ledger status consists of two layers of MPT. The first layer is the account status, including the Nonce (Number only used once), the Ethereum balance and the status root of the account data. The second layer is the key value pair data of the contract account. Due to the huge gap, adopting an Ethereum solution would lead to a large number of destructive updates to Ontology. Therefore, we opened up a storage space to store the Nonce and contract codes of accounts related to Ethereum transactions. The key value pair data of the contract account is consistent with Ontology, which not only takes into account the function of Ethereum, but also ensures the compatibility of Ontology&nbsp;itself.</p><p>2) Virtual Machine&nbsp;(VM)</p><p>Based on its existing multi-VM system, Ontology can easily add EVM support. Most of the instructions are exactly the same as those on the Ethereum platform, with a few EVM instructions suitable only for Ethereum, such as COINBASE and DIFFICULTY, which use default values on Ontology. Because they are rarely used in dApps, most contracts can be seamlessly migrated in practical applications. We provide support for Ontology EVM calls from existing NeoVM and Wasm virtual machines to facilitate the interaction between existing contract applications and EVM applications. At the same time, in order to avoid the expansion and bifurcation of EVM, we do not currently provide support for EVM cross virtual machine&nbsp;calls.</p><p>3) Transaction Structure</p><p>Ontology’s transaction structure is scalable and supports several transaction types on demand. We support Ethereum EIP-155 transactions on the basis of existing transaction types, so that the transactions issued by existing Ethereum ecosystem wallets are compatible with Ontology&nbsp;EVM.</p><p>4）Transaction Pool&nbsp;Updated</p><p>The order of Ethereum’s transaction record must be increased according to the Nonce value of the account. To ensure this feature, we maintain a list of EIP-155 transactions in the transaction pool. Only transactions meeting the conditions can be packaged into&nbsp;blocks.</p><p>5）Web 3&nbsp;API</p><p>At present, Ontology EVM provides rich interfaces such as RESTful, JSON-RPC, and WebSocket. Since contract development tools, wallets and dApps in the Ethereum ecosystem all use Web 3 API, we developed an additional interface adaptation layer to support Web 3 API, ensuring contract development tools and wallets such as Truffle, Remix, and MetaMask, can be directly used for dApp development on Ontology.</p> Part 3: Advantages <p>With the launch of the Ontology EVM, users can access Ethereum applications and wallets in one&nbsp;place.</p><p>Developers can use contract development tools such as Truffle and Remix to realize seamless connections between two chains and experience a more compatible blockchain ecosystem&nbsp;.</p><p>Ontology contracts development has the following advantages:</p>  Contracts supported: industry-leading VM support; multi-VM includes four kinds of contracts (NeoVM, Native, Wasm,&nbsp;EVM).  Fees and Velocity: Users can experience the Ethereum ecosystem on Ontology blockchain, with lower gas fees and faster block production.  Wasm support: <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg2NjA3OTY0NQ==&amp;mid=2247484341&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=c105c06477f45ee5d7172f1b8244922b&amp;chksm=ce510547f9268c5199b5a5ed3febd3d6f453e1e16c14c9fa570f6cc90866fb2aa2f0c89017e8&amp;token=1622747231&amp;lang=en_US#rd">Wasm</a> has performed excellently since its launch two years&nbsp;ago.   Part 4: Conclusion <p>When Multi-VM launched in 2020, the Ontology Technical team&nbsp;said:</p><blockquote>In the field of blockchain, the goal of virtual machine (VM) technology is to create a smart contract execution environment suitable for all transactions. However, from a technical point of view, the efficiency of contract execution, the complexity of supported transactions and the ability of cross-system cooperation are all key factors. In this process, different VMs have different application scopes. Ontology Multi-VM is committed to meeting a wider range of transaction requirements, bringing higher execution efficiency and lower gas fees. The design and launch of Ontology EVM is an important aspect of this goal, which will bring more transaction scenarios.</blockquote><p>On the basis of the underlying completed functions, more compatibility tests and enhancements of the Ethereum tool chain will be carried out in the future to further satisfy the requirements of trusted data interactions and bring more convenient and efficient experiences for developers and&nbsp;users.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>New regulations set to come into force on July 1st will have a significant impact on the online gambling industry in Germany. They will promote responsible gaming, making the industry safer for users and fairer for operators that comply.</p>
<p>But coming amidst a spike in online gambling activity will make it even more important for operators to get it right. Processing high volumes while still complying with regulations will be critical.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/2021-06-webinar-gambling/">expert panel from IDnow and operator GVC-Entain</a>, came together recently to discuss these regulations, implementation challenges, and the future benefits for the industry.</p>
 New Germany gambling regulations 
<p>As anyone in the gaming industry knows, regulation differs significantly between countries. Gambling in Germany is governed under the Interstate Treaty on Gambling law, and online gambling is heavily restricted.</p>
<p>New German gambling regulations will come into effect from July 1st, 2021. This will open up the online gambling market to new operators, but with many requirements for safe gambling. The regulations will impact many areas of online gambling – including onboarding and verifying users, moving to deposit limits, controlling advertising, and equal taxation for the industry.</p>
 Promoting responsible gaming 
<p>A major focus is to promote safer gambling. This includes protecting those who are underage, controlling advertising, and moving gambling away from the black market. Players will further be addressed with a database introduced to monitor user and operator interaction.</p>
<p>There will be uniform regulation across all states under a central gaming authority based in the state of Sachsen-Anhalt. Licensing will transfer to this authority in 2023.</p>
 Regulations will be challenging for some operators 
<p>Some areas of the regulations are more contentious. The introduction of a uniform tax rate of 5.3% on turnover is a key example. How this will play out in particular for smaller operators and new entrants to the market remains to be seen. During the webinar, Rayissa Armata,&nbsp;Head of Regulatory Affairs&nbsp;at IDnow, explained how this taxation is likely to be challenged.</p>
<p>Over the course of the webinar, we also shared experience of working with operators in such restricted markets. We were highlighting how some operators, particularly smaller ones without the proper knowledge, choose not to enter these more regulated markets. Participants agreed that we will have to wait and see how this plays out as regulations come into effect over time.</p>
 Changes will take time to be fully implemented 
<p>The new regulations come into force on July 1st. But it will take time for many of the changes to be introduced and for operators and the regulator to see the effects, with many areas experimental for the first year or more.</p>
<p>Rayissa explained how the introduction is a great first step, but there is much more to follow. She told the webinar:</p>
<p>“Some requirements are hard and strict and go into effect straight away, and other aspects of these requirements will develop over time.”</p>
<p>Some KYC and verification rules will come into effect immediately, for example. But moving from stake limits to deposit limits will be transitional, as will the introduction of a database.</p>
 KYC is a vital part of the changes 
<p>One of the most important parts of the new regulations is the onboarding and verification of users. As the industry moves to be safer, proper verification of users by all operators is vital. Transition phases for this have been in effect since October 2020, but regulations will be strengthened from July 1st.</p>
<p>Checks will include the verification of the user’s name, address, and date of birth. But KYC is about much more than just mandatory identity and age checks. It is also intended to prevent fraud, offer security, promote high conversion rates, and help operators avoid regulatory fines.</p>
 Important to balance regulations with user experience 
<p>Furthermore, we explained in our webinar how these KYC changes could impact users. The extra steps created during onboarding take time out of the user experience and can even create a sense of anxiety.</p>
<p>This experience is not uncommon. In fact, similar user behaviour has been seen in the crypto sector already where users were previously not used to being verified.</p>
<p>Using technology in the right way can help make the process as timely and seamless as possible.</p>
 Operators can make the most out of KYC 
<p>An important point to keep in mind is that proper KYC can help operators stand out as reputable.<br>
Roger Tyrzyk,&nbsp;Director Global Gambling &amp; Sales UK with IDnow, explained how it is important to “see KYC as an enabler rather than a distractor – nowadays people appreciate when they are being checked on.”</p>
<p>And Martin Lycka, SVP Compliance at GVC-Entain, supported this from an operator point of view. He noted that in some cases, it can be challenging to find the right balance, but in the long run, operators that embrace it will benefit.</p>
 Changes coming amidst a spike in gambling 
<p>These new regulations will be particularly impactful as they come during a period of high online gambling activity. Implementation will come mid-way through the Euro 2020 championship, with large spikes in activity expected.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it&nbsp;is not possible&nbsp;to&nbsp;simply dismiss the impact of the past events and the huge rise in online gambling with people watching from home. While sharing how betting at the 2021 Grand National was up 28% from 2019, we came to learn this conclusion:</p>
<p>“If we look at the Grand National, we’ve had an all-time record in the amount of volume we’ve seen in betting just on single events across exchanges and sports books of 92.8 million that was traded on the big races, that made up a 71% increase across the three-day festival.”</p>
<p>Onboarding a high volume of customers while complying with regulations presents a challenge. Martin provided some perspective from an operator’s point of view. He discussed how the launch might not be so straightforward with the date clash, but their systems are prepared for it.</p>
<p>He also expects that the phased introduction of the regulations will help with this, and the expected transition of existing licenses will ease the burden.</p>
 Responsible gambling in Germany is critical to industry success 
<p>Looking ahead beyond July 1st, though, what is the expected future impact on the gambling industry?</p>
<p>Martin provided some excellent context on this from an operator’s point of view, explaining his view that “Responsible gambling is absolutely critical to the long-term sustainability of in the industry. ”</p>
<p>He explained further how “We do see regulation as an opportunity to create markets that are sustainable in the long run company.” Currently, 99% of Entain’s revenue comes from regulated markets, or those with upcoming regulations.</p>
<p>He also stressed that to make it work, it will need to be implemented to the highest level of responsible gaming standards, and German authorities will need to take action against those who choose not to comply.</p>
<p>Going forward, there will be more benefits seen from verification. As users get more used to it, and operators handle higher volumes and greater accuracy, security should increase, and fraud will become harder.</p>
<p>There is plenty more to understand about these new regulations and their implementation. For some more insight from the experts, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/2021-06-webinar-gambling/">watch the full webinar</a>.</p>

What can companies do to increase the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">adoption of SSI</a> in the post-COVID world?</p><p>We asked <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sangyshin/">Sang Shin</a>, the Director of Digital Innovation at Singapore-based <a href="https://www.temasek.com.sg/en/index">Temasek</a>, and here are the excerpts of this interview.</p> What are the key trends that will shape the post-COVID world? <p>Though the infrastructure for this migration from a physical to a digital world was already in place, what was missing was a change in user behavior, and the COVID pandemic brought about this behavioral change.</p><blockquote>During the pandemic, users had to forcefully embrace the digital world to continue on with their everyday activities, and this eventually conditioned them to not just adapt well, but also make it an integral part of their lives now. In this sense, COVID was a catalyst for the digitization of&nbsp;mankind.</blockquote><p>COVID also showed us the power of a multidisciplinary approach, innovation, and collaboration of data, all of which led to novel ways of controlling and managing the disease, and this multidisciplinary approach is another key shift towards digitization.</p><p>When you extend this learning to digital identity, it translates to having an open mind and collaborating with different entities to enhance the quick adoption of&nbsp;SSI.</p> How to leverage these trends and create a lasting transformation? <p>A difficult question, given the complexity of the digital identity space and the many known and unknown factors working within&nbsp;it.</p><p>To build on what we have created and to sustain it, there needs to be a concerted effort from everyone involved such as the regulatory authorities, users, and companies operating in the private and public&nbsp;space.</p><p>In many ways, this is a multi-dimensional playing field. At the grassroots or bottoms-up level is the users’ drive to own their digital identity while at the top-down level, organizations must create a working economic model, and the two should meet at the midway point of the activity to ensure a digital identity solution that would work for both these entities.</p><p>The third component in this mix is the legislative and sovereign laws that are underneath all these activities. This is probably the most important aspect of sustainability because a sovereign nation must demand a secure digital identity for its residents.</p><p>All these three aspects have to come together for a lasting transformation.</p> The digital <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">identity wallet</a> announcement by <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">the EU</a> is seen as a stimulus for greater adoption of digital identity. What can companies do from&nbsp;hereon? <p>Companies must collaborate with entities from the private and public sector and take a multi-disciplinary approach to understand the needs of different user segments and come up with products that would cater to these&nbsp;needs.</p><p>Secondly, companies can strive to make an intelligent prediction of the general shift instead of making very specific predictions because of the many unknown aspects that can suddenly change the dynamics, like a new legislation or a change of government. To this end, it’s best to stay away from high-risk areas that are too dependent on sovereign legislation.</p><p>Alongside, it’s important to educate users and developers about the possible use-cases and market opportunities of self-sovereign identity, so companies can leverage this positive change in user behavior.</p><p>Finally and most importantly, companies must build an economic and incentivization model that creates a win-win situation for everyone involved. For example, offer discounts and better services for using the digital identity solution, and so&nbsp;on.</p> What’s the single most important aspect that can shape the future of digital identity? <blockquote>A person’s identity is the most personal thing that one can digitize because it represents YOU.</blockquote><p>Though we often get lost in technologies, frameworks, legislation, and economic models, it’s ultimately the human aspect that will define the future of the digital identity industry. Bearing this in mind can determine the heights we scale and how quickly we can get&nbsp;there.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/innovation-in-digital-identity-and-credentials-in-the-post-covid-world-f182a5743ce8">Innovation in Digital Identity and Credentials in the Post-Covid World</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 🔮Shyft Network v.2 Ethereum Contract&nbsp;Upgrade  V.2 Integrates critical components and features for Shyft Network’s use cases, and it paves the way for the launch of the&nbsp;network. <p>Shyft Network was designed as a cross-chain, general purpose, smart contract infrastructure to support use cases that require compliance, identity &amp; trusted data requirements.</p><p>As we move closer to the launch of mainnet, we have identified use cases and areas of opportunity where the network and it’s layer 2 smart contract infrastructure can truly shine. Our development team has rolled out a series of improvements to upgrade our Ethereum smart contract and we want to invite our community to join us in this exciting next step. This upgrade is critical to the next phases of use cases that the Shyft Network was designed to&nbsp;enable.</p> What is SHFT&nbsp;v.2 <p>The upgrade brings the following critical architecture updates as well as key feature sets into the Shyft Core smart contracts:</p>  Serves as bridging between the Shyft Network layer 1. This is critical to ensure users, use cases &amp; assets are 1:1 transferable across all EVM’s that support Shyft Network core contracts;  Creates the necessary upgrade requirements for the ecosystem to utilize institutional data &amp; asset composability architecture for dapps &amp; DeFi. These modifications allow the Shyft core contracts to utilize user, data &amp; asset routing tables enabling rule engines &amp; trust channels tooling for institutional liquidity requirements to be deployable on Ethereum;  Enables opt-in synthetic asset creation into the Shyft Network smart contracts for bootstrapping institutional liquidity pools;  Enables incentivized liquidity pools for community rewards to be easily utilized &amp; deployed, and  Fixes Etherscan &amp; related data requirements as well as minor changes that allow for smart contract extensions.   The Upgrade Process &amp; Philosophy <p>The Shyft Network smart contracts do not allow for automated upgrades so users &amp; VASPs (liquidity venues; exchanges) will have to utilize the upgrade paths in order to complete their migration. This is to ensure that, in the future, the community does not allow core developers to make changes to the smart contract system without users directly taking steps within the upgrade&nbsp;process.</p><p>We believe in decentralization &amp; while it is easier to allow for forced upgrades, we believe long term that these controls should be based on user opt in &amp;&nbsp;choice.</p> SHFT V2 Upgrade Information <p>The migration process is available starting today. It is advised that users complete the upgrade within a week from launch of upgrade. We want to ensure that the Shyft Network community transitions prior to new deployments, upgrades &amp; deployment, by the Node Federation, of the Shyft Network main&nbsp;network.</p> How to do the token&nbsp;upgrade:   Open the MetaMask Browser extension and log in to your&nbsp;wallet;  Scroll down and select “Add Token” and type in the SHFT v.2 Token Contract Address:<br>0xb17C88bDA07D28B3838E0c1dE6a30eAfBCF52D85<br>**Don’t worry about the other fields as they will&nbsp;autofill  Go to the token upgrade portal (<a href="https://upgrade.shyft.network/">https://upgrade.shyft.network/</a>) and connect to your MetaMask&nbsp;wallet;  Perform the token upgrade by clicking on “Max” and then “Upgrade”<br>**Make sure you have enough ETH in your MetaMask to cover gas fees or else you will be unable to upgrade your&nbsp;tokens**  Wait a few minutes to confirm your balance,&nbsp;and  Enjoy your V2 Shyft&nbsp;Tokens!   Wrapping Up <p>These are very exciting times for Shyft Network and we want the community to be able to fully utilize Shyft and see its use cases in action as quickly as possible. As we approach full decentralization, we are making sure that this transition takes place in the most coordinated fashion. Reach out to us should you have any questions.</p><p>Shyft Network aggregates trust and contextualizes data to build an authentic reputation, identity, and creditability framework for individuals and enterprises.</p><blockquote>Join our <a href="https://www.shyft.network/signup?userType=network">Newsletter</a></blockquote><blockquote>Telegram (<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">https://t.me/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Follow us on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/ShyftNetwork">https://github.com/ShyftNetwork</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our website (<a href="https://www.shyft.network/">https://www.shyft.network</a>)</blockquote><blockquote>Check out our Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t">https://discord.gg/ZcBNW37t</a>)</blockquote>

<p>Google is finally making a genuine commitment to privacy by cutting off Android app developers’ access to the unique Advertising IDs of users who opt out of receiving personalized ads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This change pretty much matches&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/apples-new-att-and-why-facebook-is-hitting-back-hard/">Apple’s new ATT</a>&nbsp;which allows users to say no to cross-app tracking by iOS apps for personalized ad purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the changes are rolled out later this year, Google will completely cut off app developers’ access to the Google Advertising IDs (AAIDs), instead showing a string of zeroes, for those users who opt out of cross-app tracking. The AAIDs are like Apple’s IDFAs, which uniquely identify a user’s device and companies use to track users everywhere they go online to customize ads to their interests and searches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Google change also means app developers won’t be able to use the AAIDs for non-tracking purposes either, such as fraud detection and analytics. Google promises a different solution for these areas in July this year.Google says Android app developers will still be able to use a persistent or proprietary identifier (no external linkability) but will need to make clear any data collection linked to this in their app privacy policies. They’ll also have to handle the data under the terms of Google’s&nbsp;<a href="https://play.google.com/about/developer-distribution-agreement.html#use">Developer Distribution Agreement</a>, as well as all relevant privacy laws.</p>



<p>This is the second big announcement from Google recently, but this one does more for user privacy than the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/googles-safety-section-doesnt-really-keep-pace-with-apple/">new safety section</a> in Google Play which came in response to&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/12/apple-forces-data-privacy-further-into-the-spotlight/">Apple’s privacy labels</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This time Google is keeping up with Apple’s new ATT but its move on cross-app tracking differs from the ATT in a couple ways. First, users won’t see an in-app opt-in prompt and won’t be able to adjust each app’s access to their IDFA. Instead, Android users will have the blanket option of opting out of&nbsp;all tracking for all apps. It’s worth reiterating that Google is asking users to&nbsp;opt out of tracking&nbsp;rather than to&nbsp;opt in like Apple, which some&nbsp;<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2021/06/google-to-let-android-users-opt-out-to.html">commentators</a>&nbsp;say might be to protect the tech giant from further antitrust backlash.</p>



<p>Google says it will start phasing in this latest change in late 2021. The change will initially affect apps running on Android 12 devices and move to other apps running on devices that support Google Play in early 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we know, consumers&nbsp;are&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/do-consumers-even-want-personalized-ads/">increasingly rejecting</a>&nbsp;personalized advertising over privacy concerns. Apple’s new ATT&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/only-5-of-us-consumers-want-to-be-tracked-for-ads/">got very low opt-in rates</a>&nbsp;for cross-app tracking—a loud message from consumers globally. Let’s see what users think of Google’s latest move.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Apple’s ATT, Google’s move on AAIDs is a good move for data privacy, but it doesn’t stop tracking within a single app. It’s only for cross-app tracking. You still need MySudo to keep your&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data </a><a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalized</a>&nbsp;and protected across different services.</p>

 Ontology Celebrates its MainNet’s Third Anniversary and Reflects on the Mission to Bring Decentralized Identity and Data Solutions to the&nbsp;World  Celebrating a major milestone: the third anniversary of Ontology’s MainNet&nbsp;launch. <p>Today we are proud to celebrate a major milestone in Ontology’s history, the three year anniversary of our MainNet launch. Over the past three years, <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a> has gone from strength to strength, growing into a unique infrastructure that supports our vision for decentralized identity and&nbsp;data.</p><p>A recent <a href="https://www.varonis.com/blog/cybersecurity-statistics/">study</a> on cybersecurity statistics revealed that data breaches exposed 36 billion records in the first half of 2020, alone. Coupled with heightened online activity and the growing virtual economy, these findings reflect the strong need for effective data protection and digital identity protocols in today’s digital age. Driven by a desire to address this need, Ontology has spent the last three years developing a host of products and protocols to support its vision of a safe and secure decentralized ecosystem. These include <a href="https://ontid.ont.io/">ONT ID</a>, a decentralized identity framework that helps users manage their own data and enables blockchain-based, multi-dimensional authentication provided by global verifiers. We were proud to see our use-case with Mercedes Benz-maker, Daimler, was highlighted earlier this year in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2021/02/02/blockchain-50/">“Forbes’s 2021 Top 50 Blockchain Things To Watch”</a>. Decentralized identity is also a key feature of <a href="http://wing.finance">Wing Finance</a> and our DeFi suite, playing a key role in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/oscore-everything-you-need-to-know-57aa88b7b96f">OScore</a>, our decentralized credit scoring&nbsp;system.</p><p>The next stage of our development sees big changes coming to the broader Ontology ecosystem, starting with the development of an Ethereum Virtual Machine, which will connect our trusted decentralized identity solutions with millions of developers and users in the EVM-based blockchain ecosystem upon completion, later this&nbsp;year.</p><p>Commenting on the anniversary, Li Jun, founder of Ontology&nbsp;said:</p><blockquote>Spurred on by Covid-19, the rapid expansion of the digital economy has made the protection of users’ digital identities and data all the more important. Rising to meet increased demand, Ontology has grown and developed into an interoperable, open blockchain, offering multiple privacy and digital identity focused products over the past three years. As we look to the future, we are excited to see our development, from new partnerships to technical advancements, as well as growth in our valued community.</blockquote><p>The Decentralized Identity and Data&nbsp;Journey</p><p>Humpty Calderon, Head of Community at Ontology&nbsp;added:</p><blockquote>Our diverse community is the support system that drives our growth at Ontology. To celebrate our valued community on this key milestone of our journey, we are excited to launch our Harbinger Program v2 soon, which will help to further expand our ecosystem across the world. We look forward to welcoming and rewarding new members who will be key in steering our journey and contributing to our success in years to&nbsp;come.</blockquote><p>Key Statistics</p><p>To keep up to date with the latest developments and future announcements, be sure to join the growing Ontology community, <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/join-ontology-global-community-73e3bd5ecb">here</a>.

<p>Ocean Protocol smart contracts and Ocean Market are running on Binance’s finance-centric chain</p><p>As part of Ocean’s <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-ethereum-mainnet-ba9be1aee0ce">multi-chain strategy</a>, we have deployed Ocean’s technology to <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/an-introduction-to-binance-smart-chain-bsc">Binance Smart Chain</a> (BSC). BSC has seen wide adoption with over 865 dApps, 700 million transactions, and 82 million unique addresses. BSC focuses on decentralized finance (DeFi) applications and draws on the strengths of <a href="http://binance.com">Binance.com</a> exchange.</p><p>BSC is EVM-compatible, which allows it to run Ethereum smart contracts and use Ethereum-style tokens. It’s a Proof-of-Authority (federated) chain with a small number of nodes, which allows it to have low gas fees and low latency compared to Ethereum&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>With Ocean deployed to BSC, this&nbsp;means:</p>  Users of <a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a> can publish, swap, stake, and consume data assets in BSC. They simply point their wallet in MetaMask to BSC, and Ocean Market will show data assets registered in the BSC&nbsp;network.  Data marketplace builders and other dApp developers can use Ocean libraries (ocean.js, ocean.py) and frontend components (market) with&nbsp;BSC.  Token holders can move their <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x967da4048cd07ab37855c090aaf366e4ce1b9f48">OCEAN on Ethereum mainnet</a> to <a href="https://bscscan.com/token/0xdce07662ca8ebc241316a15b611c89711414dd1a">OCEAN on BSC</a>, and back using <a href="http://binance.com">Binance.com</a> or <a href="https://www.binance.org/en/bridge">Binance bridge</a>. On Ethereum it follows the ERC-20 standard; the Binance equivalent is BEP-20. <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/how-to-get-started-with-binance-smart-chain-bsc">Here’s more info on how to&nbsp;bridge</a>.  <p>Ocean components supported in BSC include: Ocean smart contracts, Ocean Market, [BSC] OCEAN smart contract, Provider (for data services), Aquarius (metadata cache), and Ocean Subgraph (The Graph queries). For more details, visit our <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/#binance-smart-chain">Supported Networks</a>&nbsp;page.</p><p>The Ocean Protocol deployments to Ethereum mainnet and to Polygon (Matic) mainnet, and related services including Ocean Market, will continue as&nbsp;before.</p> Cross-chain Mental&nbsp;Model <p>Prior to BSC, Ocean Protocol was deployed on Ethereum mainnet, Polygon (née Matic), Rinkeby, Ropsten, and Ganache. An Ocean Market user could change the network by pointing their wallet (e.g. MetaMask) to a different network, and Ocean Market would show data assets that are on that network. Ocean.js and ocean.py drivers are similar; the dApp developer simply specifies the “network” URL. It’s the same for&nbsp;BSC.</p><p>This makes three “production” networks that Ocean is deployed to: Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, and now Binance Smart Chain&nbsp;(BSC).</p><p>In each of these networks, tokens on the network have real value associated, so there need to be token bridges across networks. For BSC this&nbsp;is:</p>  OCEAN on Ethereum mainnet gets bridged across as OCEAN on&nbsp;BSC.  ETH for gas fees on Ethereum mainnet corresponds to BNB for gas fees on&nbsp;BSC.   New Datasets and&nbsp;Services <p>People can choose to publish datasets and services in Ethereum, Polygon, or BSC. With Ethereum, there are higher gas fees and confirmation latency, but in exchange, the UX and familiarity of users is high. For BSC, the costs and latency are much lower, though users need to use the [BSC]OCEAN bridged&nbsp;tokens.</p> Previously Published Datasets/Services <p>Let’s say a publisher has an existing dataset/service as an Ocean datatoken contract published on Ethereum, along with a pool of sizable liquidity. They shouldn’t just publish a new datatoken contract to BSC for the same dataset/service. This would be highly unfair to their existing datatoken holders and stakers on Ethereum because value in the new token siphons value from the&nbsp;old.</p><p>Ideally, there would be bridges for datatokens, just like the bridge for OCEAN. This might seem like it would come out-of-the-box since datatokens follow the ERC20 standard, but alas, it doesn’t work because there are technical “gotchas” related to datatoken metadata and more. These issues are solvable and currently being worked on, but not in time for this&nbsp;release.</p><p>In the meantime, we have a pragmatic workaround for publishers and stakers called the Republish Rule. The basic idea is that publishers can republish if there’s sufficiently low liquidity in the original datasets. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-on-polygon-network-8abad19cbf47">Here are&nbsp;details</a>.</p> Further Resources on Ocean *&nbsp;BSC   <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/networks/#binance-smart-chain">Ocean-related tokens and services in&nbsp;BSC</a>  <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/bsc-bridge">Tutorial on bridging OCEAN in Ethereum mainnet, to OCEAN in&nbsp;BSC</a>  <a href="https://bscscan.com/token/0xdce07662ca8ebc241316a15b611c89711414dd1a">OCEAN contract in BSC blockchain explorer</a>   Announcement Statements <blockquote>Binance Smart Chain has been an excellent addition to the EVM ecosystem, considering the prohibitively high gas fees on Ethereum mainnet. Binance Smart Chain has created a top-tier platform for EVM smart contracts and for bridging across chains. We’re excited to deliver yet another milestone on our multi-chain strategy so that Ocean users may benefit from lower gas costs in Ocean Market and other emerging dApps and protocols that use Ocean technology.</blockquote><blockquote>– Bruce Pon, Founder at Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value. Data owners and consumers use the Ocean Market app to publish, discover, and consume data assets in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.</p><p>Ocean datatokens turn data into data assets. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools. Projects use Ocean libraries and OCEAN in their own apps to help drive the Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>The Ocean token is used to stake on data, to govern Ocean Protocol’s community funding, and to buy &amp; sell data. Its supply is disbursed over time to drive near-term growth and long-term sustainability. OCEAN is designed to increase with a rise in usage&nbsp;volume.</p><p>Visit <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">oceanprotocol.com</a> to find out&nbsp;more.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://blockfolio.com/coin/OCEAN_3">Blockfolio</a> | <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/">Blog</a> | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/oceanprotocol">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a> | <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/TnXjkR5">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-binance-smart-chain-6bfe715a492c">Ocean’s on Binance Smart Chain</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, IDnow has seen an extraordinary increase in demand for their solutions. IDnow’s products have been used 200% more compared to last year and many companies have decided to switch to fully digital application processes. The integration of ARIADNEXT will help to meet this rising demand by providing an outstanding, frictionless user experience.</p>
<p>Together we will work towards our clear joint vision of providing European businesses with a one-stop solution for identity verification, offered through a fully comprehensive and seamless identity verification platform.</p>
<p>Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow reveals a few more details about the deal:</p>
<p>What drew your attention to ARIADNEXT?</p>
<p>ARIADNEXT has built its impressive offering on the foundation of state-of-the-art technology, they have great products and a passionate team behind it. Our two companies share the same values of universality and simplicity as well as the constant strive for excellence, and I am excited about what our joint teams can achieve together in the future.</p>
<p>When did you first meet the management team at ARIADNEXT? </p>
<p>I have known ARIADNEXT’s founders Marc and Guillaume since February 2020. I admire what they have built and share their passion for the industry.</p>
<p>Will the founders and the team stay on board?</p>
<p>Of course, the team is the heart of every operation, and we are looking forward to welcoming them into our company as valuable members of the IDnow family. We love being curious and learning from each other on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Will you retain ARIADNEXT’s locations? </p>
<p>Yes, we will retain all locations for now. Firstly, it is important for all employees to retain their working space and in addition to this, keeping a presence across Europe supports our joint vision of becoming a Pan European leader in the industry.</p>
<p>At IDnow, we are also practicing a flexible remote working policy. In most roles you can work from wherever you feel most productive. It can be in the office in Munich – or in Rennes – or in your home office. Perhaps some of the new colleagues want to join us in our Munich headquarters or the other way round.</p>
<p>What are your plans looking into the near future?</p>
<p>We are very excited about the ARIADNEXT’s product offering and integrating our portfolios together. This will be a big step in enabling us to provide a comprehensive solution for all our joint customers and their needs.</p>
<p>We will also be very focused on bringing the companies together – their cultures, their organizational structures and of course the teams. We are accountable for this process and want to make sure all employees in both companies feel secure and also passionate about the acquisition and the future.</p>
<p>What does success look for ARIADNEXT and IDnow like in 5 years’ time?</p>
<p>We have a clear joint vision of creating a leading pan European identity verification platform however, success for us is not defined by an end result but the process of getting there. I would say a strong team spirit, collaboration, trust and achieving excellence in everything we do together.</p>

<p>Combined product portfolio will offer one of the broadest sets of identity verification solutions to the European market</p>
<p>Munich and Rennes, June 30th, 2021, IDnow, a German-based leader in identity verification-as-a-service solutions, today announced that it has agreed to acquire ARIADNEXT, a French company specializing in remote identity verification and digital identity creation.</p>

The combination further increases the services IDnow offers to the UK, French and German markets, as well as to international customers with identity verification needs across several jurisdictions and use cases.</p>
<p>On the back of strong adoption of digital identity products, IDnow expects to increase revenue 3x in 2021 versus 2019 and is on track to continue accelerating this growth momentum.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, IDnow has seen an extraordinary increase in demand for their solutions. IDnow’s products have been used 200% more compared to last year and many companies have decided to switch to fully digital application processes. The integration of ARIADNEXT, whose service usage has increased more than 130% per year over the last 5 years, will help to meet this rising demand by providing an outstanding, frictionless user experience.</p>
<p>“This combination with ARIADNEXT is an important step towards our vision of building the pan-European leader for identity verification-as-a-service solutions,” said Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow. “Identity verification saw a major turn towards digitalization over the past decade and this trend has been further accelerated by the pandemic. It is now critical for banks, insurers, mobility companies and others to shift towards safe, automated solutions. With ARIADNEXT, in addition to our recent acquisition of identity Trust Management AG, IDnow can provide our customers with an even broader suite of products through a single platform with a seamless user experience.”</p>
<p>“We are looking forward to joining a team of IDnow’s caliber, combining our experience and skills to work towards our shared vison of providing a pan-European secure and future-proof solution to customers,” said Guillaume Despagne, President of ARIADNEXT. “With a strong presence in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Poland and Romania, our combined product portfolios create an unmatched platform for customers across the European market.”</p>
<p>IDnow will retain ARIADNEXT’s locations in Rennes, Paris, Madrid, Bucharest, Iasi and Warsaw, as well as its over 125 employees. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals.</p>

The European Union is on a mission to achieve data sovereignty. This is supported by the European Digital Strategy, released last year. It is aimed at realising the EU’s vision of ensuring that, by 2030, the EU’s share of the data economy is in line with the region’s traditional economic weight. And the strategy itself is based upon empowering businesses and people with the right technology to gain control of their data.




 




But are we equally as concerned about data as the EU policymakers? Although incidents such as data leaks and data abuse of data fuel controversy and debate, they haven’t yet led to a mass exodus from platforms or social media channels.




 





 Data sovereignty and data sharing 




In recent years, the discussion around data sovereignty and data sharing has steadily increased. The public is more aware of what is right way to handle their data and that their data itself is a valuable asset. The General Data Protection Regulation has paved the way for organisations to be more responsible with people’s data. Now is the time for regulation to evolve and support individuals’ data sovereignty.




 





<blockquote>Meaningful control, ownership, and other claims to data articulated by a variety of agents ranging from individuals to countries. Data sovereignty alludes to a nuanced mixture of normative concepts such as inclusive deliberation and recognition of the fundamental rights of data subjects.<p></p>Data sovereignty: A review, Hummel et al. (2021)</blockquote>





 




Whilst it may be helpful to have a legal description of what data sovereignty means, we’re really interested in what it means in practical terms, and how it contributes to the development of a more equitable digital society.<br><br>How does it impact our daily life as citizens, employees, customers, patients and students?




 




How many of us really think about all the data we are producing, or what happens to it?&nbsp;<br><br>And what does data sovereignty mean to you? <br><br>The answers to all these questions and more will be published as part of the first Data Sovereignty Monitor, providing us with a dashboard of where we are today and how we are thinking about our digital life in the future. <br><br>Please spare a few minutes of your time to help us learn from one another by sharing your opinions in this anonymised survey on this important topic.

 Delivery versus Delivery (DvD) Transfers 
<p>DvD transfers allow the execution of trading security tokens with stablecoins, on a peer-to-peer basis between counterparties.</p>

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in July 2021.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>This month we take a look at the introduction of DvD (Delivery versus Delivery) transfers in our service offering.</p>
<p>As you know from our previous communications, the T-REX protocol and our platforms already support <a href="https://tokeny.com/security-tokens-conditional-transfer/">simple transfers and conditional transfers</a>. They allow an investor:</p>
 
 In the case of simple transfers: to transfer a position from his wallet, on a peer-to-peer basis to another investor’s wallet, as long as this other investor is already white-listed and satisfies the eligibility rules defined by the issuer for the token considered and; 
 In the case of conditional transfers: to transfer a position from his wallet to another (white-listed) investor wallet, upon prior approval of the transfer by the issuer (or his mandated agent). 
 
<p>We are now introducing and rolling-out a DvD transfer functionality – secured by a specific blockchain smart contract – allowing an investor to transfer a position of a T-REX compatible token against a position in any ERC20-compatible token.</p>
<p>The sequence for performing a DvD transfer is as follows:</p>
 
 Investor A instructs the delivery of a quantity of T-REX compatible security token Y from his wallet to Investor B wallet against a quantity of token Z; 
 Investor B receives a request for approval of the terms of the DvD transfer and validates (or rejects) it; 
 Upon validation of the request by investor B, the DvD transfer is executed on the blockchain i.e. the two positions of tokens are exchanged between the wallets of investors A and B simultaneously and inter-dependantly to mitigate counterparty risk. 
 

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			

		 
	 
        
	 
		 
			

		 
	 
    
	 
		 
			<p>Although this functionality could be used in other contexts, DvD transfers have primarily been designed to allow the execution of trades agreed on a peer-to-peer basis between counterparties where a quantity of T-REX compatible security token is exchanged against a quantity of “cash token”, “stablecoin”, “settlement coin” or equivalent.</p>
<p>The DvD transfer functionality is available as part of our services both on the Ethereum and the Polygon networks.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-proof-of-stake-mainnet-will-launch-on-july-7th-2021/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=nominating_validators_on_docks_proof_of_stake_network">announced</a> last week, Dock’s mainnet will be transitioning from Proof of Authority to Proof of Stake on July 7th, 2021 at 1pm GMT. To help prepare our community for this exciting step, in this post we will expand upon our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-proof-of-stake-testnet-is-now-live/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=nominating_validators_on_docks_proof_of_stake_network">earlier article</a> and explain how Dock token holders will be able to earn passive income by participating in the new network as nominators.</p><p>Nominators are an integral part of the new Proof of Stake mainnet, as they help secure the network by electing validators and extend the utility of the Dock token by using it as a tool for nomination. After candidate validators begin accepting nominations, nominators can review their details - e.g., identity, commission rate, and their current level of stake - and decide on which validators to support (a nominator can back up to 16 validators at a time). Nominators can then make a transaction on the Dock chain to stake (lock up) Dock tokens for the selected validator(s). When the nomination period is over, the Proof of Stake algorithm automatically selects the candidates with the highest stakes to become validators. Token holders can review validator information and stake tokens using our <a href="https://fe.dock.io/#/staking">network frontend application</a> once the mainnet launches on July 7th, 2021 at 1pm GMT. Step-by-step instructions on nominating using this platform can be found <a href="https://docs.dock.io/help-center/staking">here</a>.</p><p>Once a validator is selected and begins to successfully produce blocks on the Dock mainnet, the validator and their nominators start earning rewards in the form of Dock tokens. The rewards consist of <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/token-economics/econ-pos">emission rewards</a> released by the Dock network and the transaction fees paid by network users, and how they are split among the validator and the nominators depends on the validator’s commission rate and how many tokens each party has staked. It takes 7 days for the locked tokens to be unlocked (or unbonded) further to the processing of an unbond transaction. </p><p>For example, let’s say that a validator generates 100 tokens as rewards, where their own stake is 10% of the total stake behind the validator, their commission is 5%, and they have 3 nominators with 35%, 30%, and 20% stake each. In this case, the network would distribute 15 tokens (10 for staking + 5 for commission) to the validator, and provide 35, 30, and 20 tokens to the nominators. Here’s a table that summarizes this scenario:</p><br><p>Validator Stake</p><p>Validator Commission</p><p>Nominator 1</p><p>Nominator 2</p><p>Nominator 3</p><p>% of Total Stake</p><p>10%</p><p>5%</p><p>35%</p><p>30%</p><p>20%</p><p>Tokens Received (Out of 100)</p><p>10</p><p>5</p><p>35</p><p>30</p><p>20</p><p>We strongly recommend that nominators perform their due diligence on the candidate validators before locking up tokens on their behalf, as backing validators that misbehave on the network may result in having some or all of the staked tokens <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/governance/slashing">slashed</a>. In addition, nominators should be strategic when deciding which validator(s) to support and how much tokens to stake, because backing a validator who already has a large number of nominators or staking only a small amount could prevent a nominator from earning rewards. More information on these considerations can be found in <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/staking-and-nominating">this article</a> from our docs.</p><p>We are currently working with various partners to make it possible for DOCK holders to stake and nominate through exchanges, staking platforms, and hardware wallets. We will provide updates as soon as these methods become available. In the meantime, please feel free to review our <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn">docs</a>, read other articles on our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/">blog</a>, and reach out to us via <a href="https://twitter.com/docknetwork">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/feW8KGf7r3">Discord</a>.</p>

(He would very much appreciate your feedback/thoughts/discussions/etc.)</p><p>This week:</p>  Overview of the six antitrust bills that just passed the house subcommittee  What this means for antitrust and Big&nbsp;Tech  What people are&nbsp;saying  This week in antitrust  Chart of the&nbsp;week  Felix Salmon on Lina&nbsp;Khan  This week in&nbsp;crypto  This week in&nbsp;identity  Stuff happens   1. A quick overview of the six antitrust bills that just got approved by the&nbsp;House <p>Last week we <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-165-everything-you-need-to-know-about-new-ftc-chief-lina-khan-ea39ef54b384">talked about Lina Khan</a>, the new 32 year-old chair of the FTC. This week, let’s get into some of the nitty gritty of the six bills written and passed by the Judiciary Committee.</p><p>First — this is a really big deal, as <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/why-did-congress-just-vote-to-break">Matt Stoller points&nbsp;out</a>:</p><blockquote>This isn’t the end of the process, but it’s the first Congressional vote to actually restructure powerful firms since the 1996 Telecom Act, and the first real Congressional attack on concentrated corporate power since the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970. Congressman Mondaire Jones summed up the hearing where they voted to do so. “Unless we break these companies up,” he said, “they will continue to be above the&nbsp;law.’”</blockquote><p>The first two bills are general antitrust ammunition for antitrust enforcers. One pads the accounts, increasing the FTC’s budget from $351 million to $418 million. The other prevents companies from opportunistically moving cases to friendlier jurisdictions — a go-to&nbsp;tactic.</p><p><a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/why-did-congress-just-vote-to-break">Here’s Matt again</a> on the significance:</p><blockquote>These two bills might not seem like a big deal. However, if these two bills were all that passed, they would still comprise the single most important strengthening of Federal antitrust law in a generation. For decades, antitrust was just not important, and the Judiciary Committee didn’t bother to focus on it. So to have these markups, and pass these bills, is in itself meaningful.</blockquote><p>The other four are specifically aimed at Big Tech — directly addressing many of the issues presented by <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=3429">the antitrust subcommittee’s report last&nbsp;year</a>.</p><p>Overview, <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/why-did-congress-just-vote-to-break">courtesy of&nbsp;Matt</a>:</p><blockquote>1) The <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU00/20210623/112818/BILLS-117-3849-N000002-Amdt-3.pdf">ACCESS Act</a> mandates that big tech firms have to make their systems open to competitors and business rivals, in the same way that AT&amp;T customers can talk to T-Mobile customers, or users of different email systems can communicate with one&nbsp;another.</blockquote><blockquote>[We <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-165-everything-you-need-to-know-about-new-ftc-chief-lina-khan-ea39ef54b384">talked about the ACCESS Act last week</a> — basically the portability and interoperability act.]</blockquote><blockquote>2) The <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU00/20210623/112818/BILLS-117-HR3826-N000002-Amdt-4.pdf">merger bill</a> makes it harder for big tech firms to buy&nbsp;rivals.</blockquote><blockquote>3) The <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU00/20210623/112818/BILLS-117-HR3816-N000002-Amdt-5.pdf">nondiscrimination bill</a> is intended to ban the ability to big tech firms to preference their own products, the way Google substitutes its own reviews for Yelp reviews, even if Yelp’s reviews are&nbsp;better.</blockquote><blockquote>4) The <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/JU/JU00/20210623/112818/BILLS-117-HR3825-N000002-Amdt-6.pdf">break-up bill</a> is supposed to split apart big tech firms by prohibiting platforms from owning any line of business that uses that platform.</blockquote><p>All six of those bills were passed by the committee!</p><p>For context, we <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/why-did-congress-just-vote-to-break">bring back&nbsp;Matt</a>:</p><blockquote>What has been happening since the financial crisis of 2008, and what continues today, is nothing short of a revolution in the way Americans think about political economy and monopoly power. We haven’t had such ferment over these issues since the 1890s or 1930s, during the Gilded Age and New Deal. Any one of these bills put forward would be the biggest strengthening of Federal antitrust enforcement in at least fifty years, so that all six passed out of committee — especially the bill that breaks up these firms by statute — is remarkable.</blockquote> 2. What this means for the future of antitrust and Big&nbsp;Tech Photo: Alessio&nbsp;Jacona<p>To be clear, this is history making stuff. But it’s also just the first step with plenty of uncertainty ahead. Assuming these bills become law, there will still be wrangling over verbiage. Laws will be open to interpretation. Loopholes will be found. And we’re still going to rely on regulators and judges to enforce those&nbsp;laws.</p><p>It’s also unclear the ramifications of some of these laws — though well intentioned.</p><p>For instance, <a href="https://www.mnot.net/blog/2021/06/21/standards-competition-governance">here’s standards expert Mark Nottingham</a>:</p><blockquote>This bill requires designated platforms (likely candidates would be Google, Facebook and Amazon) to conform to interoperability standards set by new a new committee run by the FTC. If it passes, the APIs that define the next layer of the Internet will not be based upon broad community input, review, or participation.</blockquote><blockquote>Instead, the FTC will hand-pick the participants at its pleasure, and will retain change control over the APIs.3. Even if the right mix of people gets onto the committee, its role is explicitly ‘advisory’.4 Documentation for those APIs is only supplied to ‘competing businesses or potential competing businesses.’5 There’s no guarantee they’ll be&nbsp;public.</blockquote><blockquote>To be clear, I’m super-happy that Lina Khan is now the FTC Chair. Some big platform heads need kicking, and her boots are laced. That said, technical standards defined to force interoperability on big tech will inevitably become the de facto standards for the industries that they’re established within, potentially lasting far longer than the companies they’re designed to hobble (if they do their jobs well). That effectively makes the FTC a new Internet governance institution.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.mnot.net/blog/2021/06/21/standards-competition-governance">As Mark points out</a>, that’s not how current standards bodies like the W3C are set&nbsp;up:</p><blockquote>These bodies are set up for voluntary, not mandatory standards, and the spectre of mandatory implementation for some parties has a huge distorting effect. As someone who’s been involved in Internet and Web standardisation for more than twenty years, I’m not sure how it would go, and there are a lot of hard questions that would need to be answered.</blockquote><p>That doesn’t mean we won’t see a world where the W3C works closely with the FTC. Let’s hope they’re up to the challenge.</p> 3. What people are&nbsp;saying <p>Ina Fried,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-31388f70-6073-42bf-a8c5-e80ded9d3a0d.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Moderate Democrats raised questions about the breadth of the bills and their impact on innovation, even as the measures were largely propelled by Democratic support.</blockquote><blockquote>Meanwhile, a handful of Republicans joined Democrats in backing the proposals, while most GOP members said they failed to address the party’s biggest beef with tech — its alleged censorship of conservatives’ speech.</blockquote><blockquote>Between the lines: The Democrats’ split was especially notable in the California delegation, whose members represent three of the four targeted companies.</blockquote><blockquote>The intrigue: Lawmakers expressed concern that the bills would only apply to Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google and not other large companies like Microsoft, or even Walmart.com.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s next: These bills have moved quickly and decisively so far.

That bill, which advanced in a 24–20 vote, would, among other things, bar platforms from favoring their own products or services over those of others, keep them from restricting the interoperability of products or services and ban their use of customer or other businesses’s data to to help the platform’s own business interests.</blockquote><blockquote>Prior to the vote, Google and Amazon had asked the committee to slow its work on the package of bills, arguing that the changes would force them to degrade the quality of their products and services and harm consumers and small businesses.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/technology/antitrust-overhaul-congress.html">NYTimes</a>:</p><blockquote>“We think it’s an uphill climb for the toughest bills,” said Paul Gallant, a research analyst at Cowen and Company. “The Senate filibuster is always the highest hurdle, and I suspect it will hold back the toughest of these bills.

Jim Jordan (R., Ohio), a vocal critic of the legislation, said it represented a worrisome instance of big tech and big government “now marrying up and working together.” He complained that it would give unprecedented power to the FTC to set industrial policy and even impose its own political agenda on the affected companies.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>The battle is likely to intensify in coming weeks. While antitrust legislation remains one of the bigger vulnerabilities in Congress this year for the big tech companies, several of the committee’s more far-reaching bills face uphill fights to become law in their current&nbsp;form.</blockquote> 4.

<p>Ocean’s privacy-preserving marketplace solution will aid in Boson’s goal of truly liquid data markets, allowing consumers to derive fair prices for high-quality and diverse datasets.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/bosonprotocol/announcing-boson-protocols-partnership-details-with-ocean-protocol-b6cd3178af18">(This partnership was originally announced on March 26,&nbsp;2021.)</a></p><p><a href="https://bosonprotocol.io/">Boson Protocol</a> will build its Web3 commerce data marketplace on <a href="http://oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a>. Ocean’s architecture gives consumers the chance to unlock value from their data without compromising their privacy, and to be incentivized to do so. Within this powerful token economy, datatokens act as a missing link to more easily allow for the formation of an Open Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>Using Ocean’s architecture, the data itself doesn’t need to live on chain; just the agreement for data access control does. The concept itself is powerful, establishing fully decentralized on-ramps and off-ramps between data itself and tokenized crypto assets. This “Data Lego” allows for the easy movement of datatokens in and out of DEXes, as well as easy integration into the DeFi system. In the future, new brands wanting to make an educated beginning of their journey could buy anonymized commerce preference data in a data market and be able to make decisions just as elegantly as Big Tech is able to — without it necessarily taking years to aggregate it, or at prohibitively high&nbsp;costs.</p><blockquote>E-commerce platforms love data. This data comes from their users; it’s both personally sensitive and extremely valuable. With this Boson and Ocean partnership, for the first time ever, e-commerce users will be able to control their own e-commerce data, and monetize it if&nbsp;desired.</blockquote><blockquote>Trent McConaghy, Founder at Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>Why is this data so important? On its own, it is not. But acquiring customer preference data and then doing something with it is crucial for e-commerce businesses. Digital-native organizations such as Amazon have led the way and many legacy companies have struggled to move to a data-driven decision-making culture, hampered by a lack of expertise in decision architecture and data&nbsp;science.</p><p>Hence there is a huge market for this data, especially when aggregated. But until now, there was no easy way for individual users to accrue value from&nbsp;it.</p><p>Of course, it is entirely possible to use Boson Protocol for simply enabling decentralized commerce transactions and to opt to keep your data private. But ultimately, the power of token economies, running on permissionless, frictionless global networks, is that capabilities such as monetizing data, which is currently in the hands of few corporations, becomes a possibility to everyone.</p><p>We often talk about our data as a liability — something you need to keep safe, build a walled garden around, and trust third parties to keep safe. But the truth is that voluntarily shared data is an asset, and by creating a seamless flow between Ocean’s liquid markets for data and Boson’s game-changing dCommerce ecosystem, buyers and sellers will discover how valuable commerce data can&nbsp;be.</p><blockquote>This is an entirely new way of thinking about the role of each participant in the ecosystem. We can finally move from being farmed to playing a fulfilling role in an Open Tokenized Economy for Commerce.”</blockquote><blockquote>– Justin Banon, CEO of Boson&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>Just as Amazon uses data to give recommendations to customers, Boson’s dCommerce marketplace needs data too. It has both supply and demand of data: supply via past customer behavior, and more, and demand in order to give recommendations. Such commerce data is extremely valuable because other marketplaces can use it for recommendations as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Voluntarily opting into a data marketplace is a critical part of the decentralized commerce revolution and allows people to derive a fair price for their commerce data, which would otherwise be hoarded and have its value captured by the commerce giants, whose prime purpose is to&nbsp;extract.</p><p>Partnerships and integrations are key to the development of the Web3 ecosystem. This collaboration takes us another step toward reimagined data sovereignty.</p> Further Synergies <p>There’s a natural synergy between Ocean and Boson, since decentralized commerce markets rely heavily on data for their efficacy. We foresee further potential synergies: Boson borrows design patterns developed by us here at Ocean for data, and applies them to things. They do this at three levels: thing tokens, dCommerce marketplaces, and system-level design.</p>  Thing tokens: <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837">Ocean’s datatokens</a> turn data into data assets to enable data wallets, data exchanges, and data as collateral by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools. Similarly, Boson’s ERC20 thing tokens turn things into thing assets to enable thing wallets, thing exchanges, and things as collateral by leveraging crypto tools. Let innovation roam&nbsp;free!  dCommerce marketplaces: Ocean-powered data marketplaces use DEX tools to help price discovery, and aid curation via staking on data. Similarly, Boson-powered dCommerce marketplaces use DEX tools to help price discovery, and aid curation via staking on&nbsp;things.  System-level design: Ocean founder Trent McConaghy developed <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">the Web3 Sustainability Loop</a>, a system-level design pattern for Web3 projects for near-term growth and long-term sustainability. Ocean uses this pattern. Boson have adapted it for Boson’s own<a href="https://medium.com/bosonprotocol/introducing-the-dcommerce-sustainability-loop-1d72026636d0"> dCommerce Sustainability Loop</a>. It enables us to give grants from minimally extractive fees accrued in our protocol; such grants will foster more activity within the protocol; which will accrue more fees; which will power more grants. This is the flywheel in&nbsp;action!   About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value. Data owners and consumers use the Ocean Market app to publish, discover, and consume data assets in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.</p><p>Ocean datatokens turn data into data assets. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools. Projects use Ocean libraries and OCEAN in their own apps to help drive the Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>The OCEAN token is used to stake on data, to govern Ocean Protocol’s community funding, and to buy &amp; sell data.

BDP will launch the <a href="https://bigdataprotocol.com/datamarket">BDP Data Market</a>, powered by Ocean Protocol, focusing on commercially valuable data, with an existing network of 14,141 professional data providers.</p><p>This data marketplace will extend <a href="http://market.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Market</a> code (a fork), and connect to Ocean Protocol’s underlying smart contracts. In doing so, BDP leverages the technology behind a high quality, battle-tested Web3 data marketplace out of the box and gains a network of DeFi integrations.</p><blockquote>Ocean Protocol helps to unlock the value of data. Big Data Protocol’s massive network of professional data providers will benefit from our tech offerings while contributing greatly to Ocean’s ecosystem and, as a result, the greater Web3 Data Economy. This is an exciting opportunity for all players in the space, as we continue on this path of positioning data as an asset class. We’re excited to work with the Big Data Protocol team and see how this partnership further develops.</blockquote><blockquote>– Trent McConaghy, Co-Founder, Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>BDP Data Market comes with the following capabilities:</p>  Publishing data: BDP’s network of 14,141 professional data providers can launch data offerings and publish their data on BDP Data&nbsp;Market.  BDP Data Market armed with full Ocean Market functionality: datatokens released on BDP Data Market will be published, traded, and consumed on the BDP platform, and trading against the BDP&nbsp;token.  Value creation: fees generated from publishing, swapping, staking, and consuming datatokens on BDP Data Market go to publishers, BDP holders, and a percentage to the Ocean community.  BDP and Ocean synergy: cross-listing of BDP datatokens on Ocean Market (and listing of Ocean datatokens on BDP Data market), as well as sourcing, referral, and onboarding of data providers to both BDP and&nbsp;Ocean.  BDP datatokens get out-of-the-box access to Ocean’s current integrations and future improvements, including DeFi integrations (e.g. with lending and stablecoin protocols), third-party data ratings, datatoken derivatives platforms, and migration to Layer 2 on Ethereum, as well as cross-chain capabilities.  <p>The Ocean and BDP teams have worked closely together in the past, and the BDP team has served as data providers on Ocean Market. Our teams plan to deepen their collaboration by having BDP team members join Ocean’s Slack channels and team calls and contributing to the future development of&nbsp;Ocean.</p><blockquote>I have loved playing with Ocean Market ever since I found out about it. I have spent hours and hours doing everything there is to do on Ocean Market, including publishing, staking, trading, and consuming datatokens. It’s a fun and immersive experience. We’re proud to work with Trent, Bruce, and the whole Ocean team to make the BDP Data Market something that’s rewarding for our users and drives value to both the BDP and Ocean communities.</blockquote><blockquote>– Peter Chen, Co-Founder, Big Data&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>We are also proud to announce that the Ocean community can earn BDP tokens by staking OCEAN. This benefits and draws in Ocean’s strong group of holders and supporters.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value.

<p>The partnership will further expand the DeFi economy, enabling OCEAN holders to lend their Ocean tokens and earn interest, while collateral providers can borrow&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/benchmarkprotocol/ocean-protocol-partners-with-benchmark-protocol-to-list-ocean-on-lending-platform-c59125025980">(This partnership was originally announced on March 4,&nbsp;2021.)</a></p><p><a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Protocol</a> is collaborating with <a href="https://benchmarkprotocol.finance/">Benchmark Protocol</a> to further expand the Data DeFi economy. The Ocean token (OCEAN) will be listed on Benchmark’s lending platform, which is backed by the MARK token — Benchmark’s supply elastic stablecoin-alternative that connects traditional capital markets to DeFi. This will enable OCEAN holders to lend their Ocean tokens and earn interest, while collateral providers can borrow&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>For Ocean Protocol, a data exchange protocol for the Web3 Data Economy, the collaboration helps to create one more use of the Ocean token and further deepens its DeFi integrations. With this listing, OCEAN holders will be able to lend their Ocean tokens while keeping exposure to OCEAN and earning interest yield, without risk of impermanent loss.</p><blockquote>At Ocean Protocol, we try to maximize ways for OCEAN holders to utilize their Ocean tokens. This collaboration will enable OCEAN holders to earn interest from their Ocean token holdings while keeping exposure to OCEAN. In the future Benchmark will enable each of these datatokens to have their own lending market on their platform unlocking another utility for datatokens.</blockquote><blockquote>– Manan Patel, Growth Accelerator at Ocean&nbsp;Protocol</blockquote><p>Benchmark Protocol, a DeFi protocol that connects traditional financial markets to DeFi markets has its native asset MARK pegged to the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) asset. The SDR is a composite international reserve asset, consisting of the U.S. Dollar, Euro, Great British Pound, Chinese Yuan, and Japanese Yen. This provides a better hedge against vulnerable single-nation backed assets such as the&nbsp;USD.</p><blockquote>We look forward to the Ocean Protocol community taking advantage of our stablecoin-alternative, MARK. MARK opens the doors for truly decentralized smart contract collateral payments that are not subject to high volatility in the&nbsp;markets.</blockquote><blockquote>– Kurt Uhler, COO of Benchmark Protocol</blockquote><p>Ocean and Benchmark are exploring future collaboration together which would leverage Ocean Market, an open-source community marketplace for data, and the lending of Ocean’s datatokens, a data asset wrapped in an ERC20 token on Ocean Protocol.</p>  Ocean will help Benchmark Protocol monetize their DeFi data via Ocean Market, enabling the Ocean community access to these datasets.  Benchmark will source curated data from Ocean Protocol marketplaces to be able optimize the lending rates and possibly provide under-collateralized loans.  Benchmark will allow the lending of Ocean’s datatokens to help datatoken holders earn interest on their holdings.   About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean Protocol’s mission is to kickstart a Web3 Data Economy that reaches the world, giving power back to data owners and enabling people to capture value from data to better our&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data is a new asset class; Ocean Protocol unlocks its value. Data owners and consumers use the Ocean Market app to publish, discover, and consume data assets in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion.</p><p>Ocean datatokens turn data into data assets. This enables data wallets, data exchanges, and data co-ops by leveraging crypto wallets, exchanges, and other DeFi tools. Projects use Ocean libraries and OCEAN in their own apps to help drive the Web3 Data&nbsp;Economy.</p><p>The Ocean token is used to stake on data, to govern Ocean Protocol’s community funding, and to buy &amp; sell data. Its supply is disbursed over time to drive near-term growth and long-term sustainability.

The protocol operates as a rules-based utility that dynamically adjusts supply based on the CBOE volatility index (VIX) and deviations from the target metric — equal to 1 Special Drawing Rights (SDR) unit. Employing the SDR creates a larger use case rather than exposure to just one currency; the application of this creates a larger user base and delineated exposure to markets around the world. The DeFi space needs a collateral utility that retains its efficacy and increases inherent, baseline liquidity during periods of high volatility.</p><p>Benchmark is built on the Ethereum blockchain. The MARK token is the native asset in the Benchmark network and provides only the utility value available to it through the Benchmark network.</p>  Learn more by visiting the <a href="https://benchmarkprotocol.finance/">project&nbsp;website</a>.

<p>On June 29th, InfoCert will take part of the 34th EEMA Annual Conference, the leading independent European Think Tank focused on identity, privacy and trust. InfoCert will participate in a program of seven live and interactive webinars, focused on the theme of Securing Trust in the New Digital Reality. More than 40 countries will be represented during the free-to-attend conference, which takes place from 29th June – 1st July 2021.</p>



 <a href="https://annualconference.eema.org/#register">InfoCert Focuses on Self Sovereign Identity Paradigm Shift as a Platinum Sponsor of the 34th EEMA Annual Conference</a> 



<p>Chair of EEMA, Jon Shamah, states: “We are delighted that InfoCert has chosen to be a Platinum Sponsor for this year’s EEMA Annual Conference. InfoCert is a longstanding and active member of the EEMA community, and an organization at the forefront of innovation in Self Sovereign Identity, an area of specific interest for our members and partners.” One such innovation is Dizme, a Blockchain-based app developed by the DizmeID Foundation (of which InfoCert is a Premier Member), which incorporates the benefits of distributed identity, to provide individuals with direct control over the information they share with companies, with all of the legal value and trust of a Qualified Trust Service Provider.</p>



<p>Daniele Citterio, Chief Technology Officer at InfoCert and Chairman of the DizmeID Foundation, which is bringing together companies, institutions and other organisations interested in exploiting the power of Self Sovereign Identity (SS) and making it compliant to existing regulations explains: “SSI is creating a paradigm shift in Digital Identity Management, whereby Digital Identities will no longer be merely elements that support commercial transactions, but a new strategic asset to leverage to generate new business.” Daniele adds: “It is our aim is to implement a scalable technological solution that fully complies with the fundamental principles of SSI, to guarantee Privacy by Design and governance of the global ecosystem.”</p>



 <a href="https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_OyZYV0nJTN6fgQo-78p76w">“Decentralized Identity – what is missing before this is usable for Aunt Magda?” – Follow the session on 29th June (15:00-16.15 CEST)</a> 



<p>Attendees of the EEMA Annual Conference will have the opportunity to learn more about the work of InfoCert and Dizme, when Daniele presents a use case, based on SSI in an eIDAS-compliant governance framework. The session takes place on 29th June (15:00-16.15 CEST), when EEMA will host the webinar entitled ‘Decentralised Identity – what is missing before this is usable for Aunt Magda?’ Daniele will be joined by John Erik Setsaas, VP Identity &amp; Innovation, Signicat; Marc Sel, Director, Trust Warp, and Kaliya Young, Identity Woman, Expert, Consultant and a leader in the field of SSI.</p>

 The Price of Gas: <br>Why KILT Chose Polkadot Over&nbsp;Ethereum <p>By Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of&nbsp;BOTLabs</p><p>There are many reasons why we chose to build the KILT blockchain on <a href="https://www.substrate.io/">Substrate</a> and plan to run as a parachain in the Polkadot ecosystem (i.e. the <a href="https://kusama.network/">Kusama</a> and <a href="https://polkadot.network/">Polkadot</a> networks). One major reason is the fixed, low costs offered. For the first time, this will allow companies to incorporate permissionless blockchain into their business plans, knowing in advance what the costs of their transactions, and subsequently their product, will&nbsp;be.</p><p>To understand why this is a ground-breaking development for enterprise in general and us in particular, we first need to look at the history of blockchain.</p> Transaction costs on legacy blockchains <p>Blockchain first came to prominence after the Bitcoin white paper was released in October 2008. Bitcoin introduced two incentive models, providing a way for the developers running nodes (“miners”) to earn while maintaining the&nbsp;network:</p><p>1) By receiving newly minted Bitcoin tokens (BTC) for solving a cryptographic puzzle and winning a block (“mining”), adding it to the blockchain. This will occur until all the BTC tokens — a maximum of 21 million — are&nbsp;mined.</p><p>2) By receiving the “gas” (transaction fees) from any transaction within the&nbsp;block.</p><p>Ethereum, the next biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalisation, also has a system with gas costs. The user can choose how much gas they want to pay when making a transaction. The miners look at the amount offered and choose which transaction they want to carry out. Naturally, the more gas you offer to pay, the more attractive your transaction is.</p><p>Permissioned blockchain alternatives with stable gas costs do exist, but since the attraction of blockchain is that it can be trustless, i.e. the user can trust the mathematical system rather than having to trust in people, that was not an option for&nbsp;us.</p> Supply and&nbsp;demand <p>What we see with permissionless systems is that gas costs follow supply and demand. As a consequence, when the networks are busy many transactions end up in a memory pool on the network (e.g.<a href="https://mempool.space/"> Mempool</a>) waiting to be processed, sometimes for up to a day. This is a critical problem with transaction fees on permissionless blockchains, as you never really know how much you have to put in to avoid being stuck in a Mempool, and subsequently how much the transaction is going to cost if you want it carried out within a specified timeframe. While this can be calculated using interfaces such as the<a href="https://ethgasstation.info/"> Eth gas station</a>, it means that the cost of the transaction isn’t known in advance, since it depends on the current market situation. This makes it nearly impossible for businesses to create a reliable financial plan for their&nbsp;costs.</p><p>At KILT, we use blockchain technology to record the hash (a number representing the information) of credentials issued. This forms a core part of our goal to create revocable, anonymous credentials. Using legacy blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, we could create a credential, but couldn’t quote a regular price — it could be inexpensive one day, and it could be €100 the next. Or it could take up to 24 hours to&nbsp;process.</p><p>That made building ID services on legacy permissionless blockchains impossible for industrial use, as a fixed production cost could not be determined in advance. Since a product price consists of the production cost and the profit, the price could not be set without risking winning or losing on each transaction, making it impractical to build a business model as an attestor. What we needed was a system with a more predictable cost structure.</p> Transaction costs on&nbsp;Polkadot <p>Polkadot uses different incentive mechanisms. Like the first incentive mechanism in Bitcoin, Polkadot uses a system in which newly minted coins are earned by the people running the network — the validators — and the nominators backing them. Therefore, the gas price doesn’t need to be competitive, as the validators are already compensated for their work and not competing with each other on&nbsp;price.</p><p>The gas price in Polkadot, therefore, has a different purpose. It is mainly to disincentivise spammers from flooding the network or causing bottlenecks with useless or extraordinarily heavy transactions, as users have to pay a fee to write a transaction on the blockchain.</p><p>The funds raised by these gas fees go to the Treasury. Native token (KSM or DOT) holders can then propose referenda and vote on how the gas is spent — for keeping the system running smoothly, marketing, community events, etc. Gas not used is “burned” and taken out of the&nbsp;system.</p><p>The actual gas costs vary depending on the computer power needed, and the amount of data to be saved. For example, a simple transfer of DOT from one account to another needs less gas than a smart contract, and saving 10 bytes of data forever uses less power than saving a gigabyte. Behind the scenes, the gas fee the user pays for a transaction in the Polkadot ecosystem is calculated by multiplying the base fee by the data amount needed by the computing power needed. So while Bitcoin and Ethereum are driven by the market, Polkadot is designed to be driven by computer algorithms, with a constant, fair fee depending on the size of the transaction.</p> Transaction fees on&nbsp;KILT <p>For KILT, writing the hash on the blockchain doesn’t use much more computing power than a simple token transfer, so the base fee for credentials can be kept low — as little as a few&nbsp;cents.</p><p>Another element of our system includes the possibility of delegation, for example allowing a large company to delegate attestation rights to several employees. Setting up delegation trees requires more power and energy because they need to go through the validator, and will therefore cost more than recording the hash. These costs can, however, be anticipated and written into a business’s cost structure.</p> Keeping transaction costs stable on&nbsp;KILT <p>As gas costs (known as the “angel’s share” on KILT) are paid in KILT tokens, volatility in the price of KILT would affect the corresponding price in fiat. We aim to address this in several&nbsp;ways.</p><p>The initial cost of a transaction will be set at network&nbsp;launch.</p><p>Later, on-chain oracles — which automatically link the base fee of KILT to the current price of the KILT coin in fiat — could be used to keep the cost stable. Until these oracles are available, in the event of the fee going too high before Sudo is removed, we could adjust the cost. After Sudo is removed and before oracles are introduced, changes to keep the cost stable could be made by the community of token holders using on-chain governance.</p> Bringing blockchain to&nbsp;business <p>The fixed, stable costs of using permissionless blockchains via the Polkadot ecosystem will finally make blockchain technology practical and accessible to a wide variety of use cases in business. We look forward to being among the first parachains in the ecosystem and having our credentials available not only to those already using blockchain, but for traditional businesses and users. Using our <a href="https://www.kilt.io/developers/kilt-sdk/">open-source SDK</a>, even small companies could build solutions to meet their digital ID needs cost-effectively and without blockchain expertise. Finally, the advantages of trustless blockchain technology can be brought to the mainstream, bridging the advantages of the fairer, decentralised Web 3.0 to our current experience of the internet.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/the-price-of-gas-why-kilt-chose-polkadot-over-ethereum-6bef9006a305">The Price of Gas:&nbsp;

<p>The UEFA EURO was about to celebrate its 60th anniversary in 2020 with 3 million tickets and 5 billion global live viewers anticipated. The event initially was supposed to take place in June 2020, but due to the global COVID19 pandemic, it was moved to 2021.</p>
<p>For gaming operators, big sports events traditionally mean large spikes in user activity and especially new user registrations. More than ever, during this year’s EURO 2020, gaming operators are facing a high number of surges in new signups on a matchday. Unfortunately, with rising demand, there is an increase in fraud attempts coming along.</p>
 A new wave of sophisticated fraud 
<p>IDnow is constantly monitoring the fraud attacks on its customers to detect trends early and ultimately stay ahead of fraudsters. Recently IDnow has detected an increasing wave of highly sophisticated fraud attacks. These advanced fraud attacks were bypassing standard identity verification processes, making them very difficult to detect.</p>
<p>After investigating and analysing the sophisticated fraud attacks, IDnow discovered that fraudsters were utilising very well forged ID cards. The visual security features, like holograms and watermarks, were forged to perfection. In consequence, both humans and artificial intelligence were not able to visually detect fake ID cards.</p>
 If the ID cards were forged to perfection, how did IDnow spot them? 
<p>IDnow is not only looking at individual identity verification cases but is monitoring across all verifications, over long periods and across multiple customers with different use cases. This results in extensive data sets, allowing IDnow to detect fraud patterns and trends at scale.</p>
<p>This data enabled IDnow to detect two ident cases with two different identities, however the same person on appeared the biometric images. In other words, at least one or more likely both ID cards were fraudulent. After investigating the cases further and performing a manual review, the two used ID cards were proven fake by verifying the built-in electronic chip using NFC.</p>
<p>Below I highlighted some of the things that come up for my clients. The main question is how we ensure with NFC technology we reduce the increasing rate of fraud cases?</p>
 Sophisticated fraud attacks require more sophisticated identity verification solutions 
<p>When an ID document is forged to perfection, it requires verification solutions that look beyond visual security features. Today modern ID documents contain an NFC chip that stores a copy of the identity details. The information on the chip is secured and can be authenticated through an electronic certificate from the issuing government. Consequently, the NFC chip is far more complex to forge than visual security features, like holograms and watermarks. Validating the presence of a chip and the stored information using NFC offers an additional and more sophisticated security feature.</p>
 What’s NFC? 
<p>NFC stands for Near Field Communication, wireless communication technology for short ranges of 4 cm or less. Today NFC is well known through contactless credit cards and mobile payment solutions such as Apple- and Google Pay. Nowadays, most smartphones can read NFC ID documents, including both leading operating systems, Android and Apple iOS. As a result, you can scan your passport or ID card and identify yourself on your smartphone, just like you use to do at ePassport gates at airports. When scanning an identity document with NFC, the information gets read out automatically from the chip. Like at the airport, automatically scanning your passport is faster and more convenient than somebody visually checking your documents.</p>
<p>Read our Quick Guide: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/nfc-technology-for-id-verification/">Do you want to how NFC offers security and convenience for your identity verification?</a></p>
 How is NFC going to help our operators make the EURO 2020 a success? 
 
 Additional security layer:&nbsp;Validating an NFC chip adds a new form of physical security feature that goes beyond visual security marks. Further, the chip is highly complex to forge. Therefore NFC chips offer a higher level of security against fraudsters. 
 Higher Automation: Scanning an NFC document is fast and easy and eliminates user error, such as blurry pictures or poor lighting conditions. Instead, the identity details and the biometric picture are read out automatically. In consequence, NFC authentication requires less human intervention, thus improving gross margins for the company and more convenience for the end-users. 
 Regulatory Acceptance:&nbsp;More and more regulators have started evaluating and approving NFC-based ident methods. More recently, FINMA in Switzerland and ANSSI in France have approved NFC-based methods.&nbsp;Other regulators like in Portugal are considering it. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In summary, NFC offers a win-win for both gaming operators and football fans alike. For gaming operators, NFC presents an additional and more sophisticated security feature. At the same time, their customers get a fast and convenient onboarding process. That’s why we at IDnow believe that IDnow AutoIdent plus the new NFC feature provide the right combination of convenience and sophisticated security for the UEFA EURO 2020.</p>

 How Access Control Works 

<p>OIDC claims are a piece of information inserted about an entity. Name and picture are claim examples for users.</p>

<p>OIDC scopes are a group of claims.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we’ll define a new claim based on an Okta group. The claim will be included in all scopes defined. The OIDC plugin must check if the coming tokens have this specific claim to allow the Kong route consumption. Only users who are part of the Okta group will have the claim included in the token and will be able to consume the route.</p>

<p></p>

 Configure Okta 

<p>In my example, I already created two users and a group. The group has only one member.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The new claim will be based on this group, so only its members will have permission to go through the Kong route.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The new Kong claim definition is based on the Kong group. It’ll be included in any scope for each access token issued.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Let’s run a token preview to check the tokens and claim out. For the first request, we can try the user who’s not a Kong group member. As expected, the access token does not have a Kong claim inside of it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If we try the other user that belongs to the Kong group, the access token will be different. Here’s the Kong claim inside our token.</p>

<p></p>

 Enable OpenID Connect Plugin 

<p>Let’s check our Kong route with the OIDC plugin enabled. According to the parameters in the screenshot below, the plugin should check if the token has the Kong claim defined by Okta. So in this sense, the route should be consumed only by users who are members of the Kong group.</p>

 
   Config.Scope Claim: <code>kong_claim</code> 
   Config.Scopes Required: <code>kong_group</code> 
 

<p></p>

 Consume the Kong Route 

<p>Let’s have both users consume the route. The process will be similar to what we already did in Okta’s token preview process. For the first request, let’s try the user who isn’t in the Kong group. As expected, we shouldn’t be able to consume the route.</p>

<p>We are trying to consume the route, but since we don’t have any token injected inside our request, the API gateway redirects us to Okta to present our credentials.</p>

<p></p>

<p>And after getting authenticated, Okta is redirecting us back to the API gateway. However, since the token doesn’t have the claim inside it, the gateway says “forbidden” and won’t allow us to consume the route.</p>

<p>Let’s try the other user who is a member of the Kong group. Again, we try to consume the route, getting redirected to Okta, but we’re going to use the second user this time.</p>

<p></p>

<p>After getting authenticated, Okta redirects us back to the API gateway. This time, our token has the Kong claim we defined in Okta previously.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If we go to <a href="http://jwt.io/">jwt.io</a>, we will decode the JWT token and check the token and the claim inside it.</p>

Application-based threats happen when people download apps that look legitimate but actually skim data from their device. Examples are spyware and malware that steal personal and business information without people realizing it’s happening.</p>  <p>Web-Based Mobile Security Threats. Web-based threats are subtle and tend to go unnoticed. They happen when people visit affected sites that seem fine on the front-end but, in reality, automatically download malicious content onto devices.</p>  <p>Mobile Network Security Threats. Network-based threats are especially common and risky because cybercriminals can steal unencrypted data while people use public WiFi networks.</p>  <p>Mobile Device Security Threats. Physical threats to mobile devices most commonly refer to the loss or theft of a device. Because hackers have direct access to the hardware where private data is stored, this threat is especially dangerous to enterprises.</p>   <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/on-demand-uk-digital-id-verification/">How the trend of On-Demand Culture in the UK fuels the need for Digital ID Verification</a> <blockquote><p>Given that <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0025/217834/adults-media-use-and-attitudes-report-2020-21.pdf">85% of internet users</a> in the United Kingdom would rather access the internet via a smartphone, digital ID systems that are accessible on both web and mobile platforms will be considered on-demand compliant.</p></blockquote> MyData  <a href="https://mydata.org/2021/06/23/mydata-global-joins-team-data-spaces-to-support-the-eus-plan-to-create-data-spaces/">MyData Global Joins “Team Data Spaces” to Support the EU’s Plan to Create “Data Spaces”&nbsp;</a> <blockquote><p>MyData Global announces to have joined forces with ‘Team Data Spaces’ – a coalition of leading European players with experience in standardising, creating and operationalising data sharing – to facilitate the development of European data spaces which are at the heart of the EU’s data strategy.</p></blockquote> <a href="https://blog.meeco.me/support-centre-for-data-sharing-interview-with-meeco/">Support Centre for Data Sharing interview with Meeco</a> <blockquote><p>Meeco’s inception, its work so far and recent growth.

SSI is simultaneously the potential enabler of new modes of empowerment, autonomy and data security for refugees and a means of maintaining and extending bureaucratic and commercial power.

Meeco is looking for self-driven software engineers to contribute to the success of our product team developing our globally awarded personal data platform.  The Meeco platform is comprised of suite of products including a decentralised wallet, key management store, exchange for identity, credentials &amp; tokens and secure data enclave (vault).




 




At Meeco we build the tools to enable people and organisation to access, protect and create mutual value from personal data. We are personal data pioneers offering a range solutions powered by Meeco and decentralised on Hedera Hashgraph. <br><br>We are passionate about building a new digital economy where data is not refined, as is done with oil, for power and profit, for the benefit of a few mega corporations. Rather, we are committed to finding a new equilibrium where people and organisations enter a relationship of mutual value and build a new, more meaningful way to personalise digital services. <a href="https://www.meeco.me/manifesto">Read our manifesto</a> to learn more about our thinking and the vision that drives us.




 




We have built a diverse team, and we welcome everyone. Our team is spread across Australia, Belgium and the UK. Collectively we come from diverse cultural backgrounds, speaking a range of languages, and each bring a unique personal data story that advances our mission.




 





 About Us 





 




The product team currently consists of 15 people, responsible for designing, implementing, supporting and documenting Meeco’s secure decentralised and cloud solutions. Our products are modular and can be implemented as a single solution (decentralised wallet) or together with key backup and secure storage (vault). These products enable developers to build a range of applications for users and organisations to access, control and exchange identity, personal data, credentials and tokens.




 




Currently our technology stack consists mainly of&nbsp;Elixir and Node services on the backend, and Angular/NgRx/Ionic/Capacitor and&nbsp;Flutter apps on the frontend.




 




We take pride in building software that is easy to understand, clean, well-structured and properly tested. We have formed our own opinions on how to write good code, this is based on many decades of experience across the team. We are pragmatic and want to see positive change in the data world now – not years away. For these reasons we always seek to understand the user’s perspective and their “job to be done”, how to layer in privacy and security and then design a mutually beneficial solution.




 




• We favour the explicit over the implicit




 




• We treat frameworks as tools and not as an unquestionable authority




 




• We do test driven development




 




• We set quality standards for our code




 




• We review each other’s code




 




• When looking for solutions to problems, we brainstorm, we draw on virtual boards, we discuss




 




• We documents our decisions, workflows, architecture as Confluence documents




 




• We constantly work on improving our estimation skills.

 About You 




We are looking to appoint at least two people for the following roles:




 




Role 1 – Experienced frontend developer with a proven track record building hybrid mobile applications in TypeScript




 




Role 2 – Full-stack TypeScript developer




 





 




Here is what we are looking for to help us create awesome hybrid mobile applications:




 




• You have built a few cross-platform hybrid mobile applications




 




• The browser is a development environment where you feel at home and sometimes you have dreams about the DOM API




 




• If you have used Angular, NgRx, Ionic and Capacitor, we are looking forward to hear from you, don’t delay!




 




• If you’ve used another framework, please share with us why it is great




 





 




And here is how we see the role of the full-stack TypeScript developer:




 




• You know and love TypeScript




 




• You’ve built modern JS web applications




 




• You’ve used Node as the backend




 




• You use relational databases like Postgresql, Mysql with confidence




 




• You’ve deployed applications using cloud providers like AWS, GCP or Azure




 





 




Besides the above points for both roles, there are certain points we welcome in any developer:




 




• Someone that cares about clean code




 




• Ready to learn about new domains such as decentralised identifiers and verifiable credentials




 




• Like solving new problems and innovating




 




• Having a practical understanding of&nbsp;cryptography&nbsp;(is a big plus)




 




• Can learn a new programming language or a technology and consider it a improvement of you skillset




 




• Any experience building dApps, building on top of distributed ledger technologies, we would like to talk to you!




 




• If you have used Hedera Hashgraph, are interested in tokens and payments, we should definitely talk!!!




 





 




We don’t expect you to know everything from the start and we have great mentors to show you the ropes. A good set of solid programming fundamentals is most important.




 




You might have a degree in CS, or you might not. This is not what we are about. We care about what you know now and how you are improving yourself every day.




 




We have offices in Adelaide, Brussels, London, Melbourne and Sydney. A lot of the time, you are free to work where you work best, but we expect you to spend a few days a week in the office together with the team. For these roles we would prefer for you to be based in Adelaide, Melbourne or Brussels.




 




We value people who can work independently and manage your time, are supportive to each other and not afraid to ask for help when needed. A lot of what we are working on has not been done before, so the ability to explore, test, iterate and learn is an essential part of our culture. So we would like to iterate that asking for help is highly regarded!




 





 What we have achieved 





 




We are early pioneers in the personal data economy and have been campaigning for digital rights, data portability and data control since 2012




 




Funding; our founder and CEO bootstrapped the company for the first two years before raising private equity. We have a strong runway and revenues, so the focus for us now is building awesome products.




 




Brand &amp; Reputation: We launched our first product into the market in 2014 and have built a strong brand in the personal data community. Check out Meeco on Twitter or LinkedIn and you will see our consistent focus in helping build a global personal data economy. If you would like to know more about the exciting stuff we are working and have in store, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CM8tuZW5YU">check out this recent webinar</a>.




 




Awards: We have won nine international awards in Australia, UK, Netherlands, Germany, USA for personal data management, identity, innovation and FinTech services.




 




Market: During COVID we launched our developer portal so our partners could keep working with us remotely and we kicked off 2021 with some really interesting projects across a range of use-cases.




 




Partners: In early 2020 we started working in partnership with <a href="https://hedera.com">Hedera Hashgrap</a>h to develop our multi purpose wallet to support decentralised identity, verified credentials, micropayments and tokens.




 





 How to apply 





 




Unfortunately due to ongoing COVID restrictions we are not able to offer visa sponsorship at this time. Therefore,  Australian applicants must already be in Australia and have permanent residency. For Belgium, you must have the necessary rights to work in the EU. <br><br>By reading this you have reached the end, so if you feel you are the right person for the job, all you have to do is contact us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:jointheteam@meeco.me">jointheteam@meeco.me</a> or hit the button below:

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/tolbert">John Tolbert</a></p><p>Almost all enterprises have many security tools in place already, some of which are still focused on perimeters/DMZs and on hosts, such as servers and endpoints. Endpoint Detection &amp; Response (EDR) tools are becoming more commonplace in enterprises and SMBs. EDR tools depend on agents installed on endpoints to collect and transmit telemetry to the EDR console. EDR agents can be instructed by administrators and programmatically to respond to suspicious and malicious events, taking actions like gathering forensic evidence, terminating processes, removing malware, etc. EDR tools emerged as a second line of defense on endpoints in situations where Endpoint Protection (EPP), formerly known as Next Generation Anti-Virus, may have missed detection and prevention of execution of malware. EPP and EDR vendors have been merging and acquiring one another over the last few years, so a large part of the endpoint security market has essentially become Endpoint Protection, Detection &amp; Response (EPDR).</p>
<p>Many organizations today are also looking for security tools such as Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR) that provide additional visibility and controls at the network layer. NDR tools rely on sensors on the network for gathering data about traffic in a given environment. These sensors generally plug in to taps or SPAN ports on network switches and routers. Most modern enterprises have a mix of on-premises networks and cloud-based resources to cover with NDR solutions. NDR solutions mostly focus on analysis of traffic metadata, although some can do full packet capture and a few products even do packet decryption. Like EDR, the “D” and “R” in NDR emphasize the abilities to detect malicious behavior and respond to it. Examples of NDR actions are collect forensic evidence, terminate sessions, and block traffic by IP/host/domain.</p>
 Functional overlaps 
<p>Functional overlaps exist between EPDR, NDR, and Cloud Workload Protection Platforms (CWPPs). CWPPs provide malware scanning, remediation, and configuration management for IaaS instances, containers, and serverless environments.</p>
<p>Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) systems are centralized repositories that collect security telemetry and log files from many sources around an enterprise. Security Orchestration Automation and Response (SOAR) tools facilitate analysis of information in SIEMs and help orchestrate analyst responses across disparate downstream security tools.</p>
<p>XDR (eXtended Detection &amp; Response) solutions are an emerging category of security tools that are designed to consolidate and replace multiple point solutions such as Endpoint Protection Detection &amp; Response (EPDR), Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR), Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP), Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS).</p>
<p></p>
 Our view of XDR 
<p>In our definition and view, XDR must encompass endpoint, network, and cloud aspects. This means that XDR solutions must have agents for endpoints, sensors for networks, and agents for cloud instances and containers. As opposed to SIEMs, telemetry is pushed into XDR systems in real-time, not pulled from logs, which allows for real-time correlation and analysis, and therefore a reduction in time-to-detect and time-to-respond metrics. Companies conducting RFPs for XDR expect implementations of advanced Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) detection models and functions to reduce the labor needed for analysis, time-wasting false positives, as well as add value by improving anomaly detection and categorization, leading to an improved overall security posture.</p>
<p>As with SOAR solutions, XDR systems are tools that enhance security operations, and as such have consoles that are designed for deployment within Security Operations Centers (SOCs) at customer sites or Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) sites. SOAR tools prominently feature “threat hunting” interfaces. With XDR, the emphasis is on automation and continuous threat hunting, making threat hunting less of a manual activity.</p>
 XDR and SOAR: evolution or competition? 
<p>XDR and SOAR solutions are on a path toward either convergent evolution or competition, depending on the vendor. However, SOARs depend on SIEMs, and XDR solutions should be able to function somewhat independently of SIEMs. XDR systems can export relevant event data to SIEMs.</p>
<p>Though real-time detection is advantageous, we emphasize the response capabilities, because such leading-edge technologies should expand on the automation of mitigation actions. Therefore, the types of response actions available in EPDR and NDR must also be present in XDR.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advanced XDR use cases and solution capabilities may include active defensive measures, such as the deployment and maintenance of Distributed Deception Platforms (DDPs). DDPs are systems that are designed to simulate a variety of computing assets and environments for the purposes of drawing in would-be attackers to clearly alert IT security teams to the presence of attackers, drawing attackers away from real assets, and allowing IT security teams to study the TTPs of attackers in order to better defend against current and future attacks. DDPs therefore aid IT security teams in discovering anomalous and malicious behavior at various layers across the infrastructure.</p>

			  Mario Cámara is Full Stack Developer at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p></p>
<p>I love solving challenging problems with the help of technology to keep learning smarter ways to solve the next one. Currently, I’m settled in Spain with my family. In the past, I had brief spells in Moscow, Zurich, Edinburgh and Paris. Actually, who knows if we will move to Seattle, Vancouver, London, Shenzhen or Seville at some point in the future?</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>After doing diverse things in the past, like pursuing a PhD and an MBA, I created my own startup to help companies to tap into high skilled tech professionals that might not be actively looking for a new job.</p>
<p>Although this was a fruitful learning experience, I realized that I would be more useful in putting my expertise at the service of a growing startup. That’s when the opportunity to join Tokeny popped up,&nbsp;and I’m glad I made that choice to join and to be part of the team that’s making Tokeny flourish.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>It’s very interesting and enriching. The staff comprises multiple nationalities and extensive backgrounds. Management is approachable and very active in moving the company forward to hit new targets. However, I work mostly with the people in the tech team. Although they’re spread in several countries, there’s almost no friction coming from this. Besides that, they have high expertise that shows daily, and you can always learn new things from them. Additionally, they tend to welcome feedback on their pull requests or the product features. Overall, it’s a team that makes it significantly easier to ship great software.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>I love delivering products that exceed customer expectations. And I want to believe that it’s not only a saying, but I do really make that difference. Put bluntly, and as a wise person taught me: “Under promise and over deliver.”. Moreover, I also love learning about new things.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p><br>
As a firm believer in science and innovation, I can’t settle on a single dream or even a handful of them. There are still many things that humankind will achieve in the coming decades. Just to name a few: fully autonomous self-driving vehicles, flying cars, neural implants, decentralized and accessible finance, safe and clean nuclear power, hypersonic commercial flights, etc. On a personal level, I still keep some faith that, eventually, I’ll learn to play the piano.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>Again, there are many things to make the world a better place. But, if focusing at a local level and, provided that high-quality education is the base of modern and advanced societies, I’d love to see and help the Andalusian universities to reach the level of top-class European ones such as Oxford, Cambridge, the Imperial College, ETH Zurich, EPF Lausanne or MIPT.</p>

Full-stack model for next generation institutional capacities A sketch for the transformation of Italy’s&nbsp;cities <p>By <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-lockie-b294696/?originalSubdomain=uk">Sean Lockie</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/angelica-monaco-5b086722/?originalSubdomain=it">Angelica Monaco</a>, with contributions from <a href="https://twitter.com/indy_johar">Indy Johar</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/joostbeunderman?lang=en">Joost Beunderman</a> and Juhee Hahm. For Italian translation, see&nbsp;<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/un-piano-da-oltre-200-miliardi-2da3eef0552">here</a></p><p>Italy, like many nations, is facing a major strategic transition. Many Italian cities are seeing a cocktail of intensifying challenges and future risks, including the brain drain of young skilled people to bigger cities and other parts of Europe; economic stagnation and aging infrastructure; poor air quality, growing heat island impacts, and increasing incidence of flooding. All this has been exacerbated by COVID, which has deeply affected Italy’s communities and economy; it has both revealed and deepened inequalities. Already, we are seeing signs of a growth in exploitative labour patterns and the deprivation of minimum rights; in terms of social and psychological distress we are seeing growing incidences in violence both in the street and domestic sphere, and a worrying increase in self-harm. Italy’s society is hurting, and it needs a deeply strategic approach to investing in the infrastructures of tomorrow.</p><p>Beyond incrementalism</p><p>The transition required is systemic — this is not an incremental or additive transition, but a fundamental one. We know, for example, climate change not an isolated crisis: it is fundamentally a symptom of a structural problem in how we govern and how our relationships in the world are governed — in terms of our relationship with the future, our relationship with the natural and material world and our relationship with each other. As the evidence of growing social divisions and the perspective of <a href="https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020">3+ degrees Celsius climate change</a> becomes more and more unmissable, we must allow ourselves to re-think a series of fundamental social, economic, human and planetary relationships to forge a thriving future for Italian cities. And with a once-in-a-generation level of capital being made available through Italy’s National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR), this is perhaps the best opportunity we have — which implies a huge responsibility on all of us as professionals and citizens.</p><p>The pandemic has seen levels of fiscal and policy coordination within the EU not seen before. For example, the capital to be raised to finance the Covid-19 recovery fund for fiscal stimulus packages across the EU was a collective response. The fund will be distributed over the next five years, in a mixture of grants and loans to EU countries, and direct EU spending; approximately 1/3 (€250bn) is to be spent on funding the green economy. The Commission plans to start borrowing in the markets in June of this year, and this now creates a precedent for other fundraising activities in Europe. The plan requires agreement on a new tax on goods imported into the EU from countries adhering to less aggressive CO2 emissions goals, new levies or surcharges on emissions in the transport sector, and a digital tax. The €250bn to be allocated to the green economy should provide the basis for the fiscal innovation to occur in the climate change space, e.g. to look at the feasibility of a climate change impact bond that could enable Europe to lead the way and invest in a clean, healthy and just future. All this comes on top of a very ambitious Italy-wide energy efficiency major retrofit programme called the ‘Superbonus’ scheme addressing fabric, renewable and heat source upgrades. Administered through Italy’s Revenue Agency there will be a subsidy of 110% of the installation costs paid back over only five years through tax savings. An impressive amount of organisations have been executed around this scheme involving banks, the tax department, consultancies, technical supply chains (insulation, plumbing, architecture, engineering) municipalities and citizens.</p><p>The pandemic also showed that places have to be able to transform fast, and that we need to develop this sort of institutional resilience and agility to deal with unpredictable events — so that we are not just responding reactively to crisis, but ensure our recovery measures are transformative and reduce future vulnerabilities. Milan, for example, was of the first large cities in Europe to lock down, and the city has responded with a broad set of initiatives, which included fast-track active mobility strategies, use of the home as a means of production, and schools deploying online learning at scale to address a digital divide and create more opportunity for self learning.</p><p>A multi-dimensional recovery programme</p><p>As the transformation is multidimensional, it has become very clear now that the processes to make it happen are of utmost importance. All recovery measures to be deployed in the near future need to go beyond one-dimensional quick-fixes, and instead target multiple co-benefits and synergies. For example, this includes the opportunity to leverage further the ‘superbonus’ subsidies to create an inclusive retrofit programme that addresses sustainability at street by street level. Such a retrofit programme should tackle not just the energy performance of the housing stock but the potential for greater social cohesion and long term benefits through residents generating and distributing their own energy, the enhancement of the public realm that connects the buildings, and repurposing space dedicated to the car to urban parks that allow residents to enjoy to exercise, birdlife, urban meadows and eventually community gathering (farmers markets&nbsp;etc).</p><p>In setting out such a multi-dimensional recovery programme, a first challenge relates to how we understand the interconnected and cascading risks that we face (e.g., air pollution, fuel poverty, health impacts, job losses and precariousness, lack of appropriate education and community cohesion as well as climate change). Secondly, we need to re-think how we build portfolios of mutually reinforcing interventions against such future liabilities, enabling us to set a clear directionality of the transition but be open to uncertainty and emergence of new opportunities as well as possible new crises. This also means building distributed capacity to build, iterate and learn from early interventions, to create dynamic transition portfolios that have proximity and agility to evolve with ongoing new issues, opportunities and problems and insights as they emerge. After all, we live in an age of both chronic emergency and emergence — meaning centralised, slow moving institutions are by definition not up to the&nbsp;task.</p><p>Next gen institutional capacities</p><p>In practice this means building the institutional capacity in both the public sector (municipalities), private sector (developers, energy companies etc) and civic sector to understand and act on emergence in a collaborative way. This is about fundamental institutional properties: the distributed capacity to make sense of complex data and weak signals, distributed capacity to innovate, and distributed capacity to forge new coalitions. We aren’t able to 1:1 predict what the problems are, where our greatest liabilities lie, and what the solutions might&nbsp;be.</p><p>One dimension where such institutional capacity needs are particularly urgent is innovation in maintenance. We have to radically reduce the bureaucratic and the management costs of maintaining, adapting and upgrading our existing cities as a whole if we are going to unlock the current infrastructure upkeep backlogs and unlock new value in the existing built environment. This is particularly relevant in Italy where there are many layers or control and bureaucracy which hold cities back in the procurement and government of such works. A ‘<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/nextgengov-the-big-boring-bureaucratic-revolution-39ccc3a6c9f8">boring revolution</a>’ in local empowerment, accountability and simplification of procedures is essential for the country to spread its wings and take flight to new levels. Italy needs to change its mindset from “we have always done it this way” to one of “these are extraordinary times, let’s give this a go and learn from&nbsp;it”.</p><p>To get there, we need to take a value chain approach to investing. This looks at investing across value chains, such as enabling the real estate development and construction sectors to move into bio based and circular materials. Critically, such value chain transitions and deep and structural shifts need to be approached from a ‘just transition’ perspective. If we limit ourselves to point based innovations, we are going to see the consolidation of capital and wealth in the hands of the few. So recognising the SME and family-based nature of the economy in Italy, how do we invest in an inclusive, economy-wide revolution of the whole value chain, driving digitised production and whole-life-cycle performance capacity, emphasising the new skills and ways of working essential to new machine-human automation capacities?</p><p>We know that in the 21st Century, if we are going to talk about prospecting for the future, we are fundamentally operating in the domain of new machine-human capabilities. This requires the setting up of new institutional and financial infrastructures, both to crystallise what our future risks are and to integrate a more sophisticated understanding of those liabilities into how we invest in a range of human, technological and physical transition infrastructures. Our infrastructure investments have to move well beyond the familiar ‘cranes on the horizon’ — financing also the long-term capacity for companies, whole sectors and communities to be part of imagining and innovating within the transition.</p><p>For example, cities are increasingly taking seriously the need for massive investment in green infrastructure, with Milan, Turin and Bologna being among many European cities with plans to plant millions of trees. But it is impossible to build truly integrated approaches unless we have integrated e.g. flooding, heat island, health and biodiversity liabilities into the models of the utility companies that own the flood risk and the energy companies that own the capex requirements for heat island effects - integrating them with the impacts on health, and involving insurance companies across these risks or rewards, and building a collective outcome buying capacity which integrates those risks and liabilities across the public and private sector. Multiple-benefit infrastructure solutions like (peri-) urban forests can manage these risks simultaneously and produce co-beneficiary results. So the pooling of those liabilities and being able to build frameworks for companies, communities and other long-term focussed organisations to set up <a href="https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/november-2019/heres-a-way-for-governments-to-buy-positive-outcomes/">community driven outcome buying contracts</a> to allow the investing towards collaboratively defined priorities become fundamental tools. This sort of innovation in procurement lets the public sector and communities describe the outcome they want and then leave space for new innovation to occur. We are on the cusp of seeing this innovation in some places where health authorities for example are investing in changes to the built environment because they result in say less obesity or respiratory disease or a community with reduced mental health stresses. We are seeing cities like Vienna and London starting to grapple with these systemic challenges.</p><p>The social contract for transition</p><p>What becomes apparent in all this is that Italy must invest in the citizen-level capability for innovation. We have to build citizen understanding of the transition and appetite for innovation, almost at an everyday level — it is an essential part of <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/climate-city-contracting-for-humane-thriving-39153a2ba5ab">the social contract required for a legitimate transition</a>. The street level capability, the mass democratic capability to innovate is a fundamental component in this thesis. Bologna is a great example where this already starting to happen, through the Fondazione Innovazione Urbana and its “I Laboratori di Quartiere”, patient and democratic spaces for discussion at neighbourhood level. The goal is to activate on-going processes of listening, dialogue and collaboration in each neighbourhood, to bring out priorities, needs, indications and proposals, imagining shared solutions on how to regenerate and enhance spaces in the various areas of the city through public assemblies in the neighborhoods, thematic sessions and physical or on-line meetings.</p><p>Or take Ferrara, where the Climb Project has boosted active and sustainable home-to-school mobility through a mix of behavioural change, internet of things and gamification; it aims to change the attitude of children, their families and their community to embrace environmentally sustainable travel solutions by creating eco-friendly mobility habits as a fun and social experience. Local communities can use the lessons learned from the project to create a civic movement with other co-benefits too. These projects all start at a grass roots level and are seeing important levels of citizen participation.</p><p>Or take the Silk Project in Rovereto aimed at creating a cultural and economic district of silk-based activities following an integrated development approach: regeneration and reclamation of the uncultivated land; promotion of a social and sustainable agriculture project for the production of mulberry trees and silkworms, with job placements for people in difficult situations. Finally, in the circularity space there are numerous examples of innovation that are at the point of scaling in Italy. Bioplastics from grape residue in the Valdobbiadene area for example, or the numerous examples of new business models we are seeing in places like Milan around circular housing concepts, where there are developer models being refined that bring residents together to not only manage their building but to help with child care, asset sharing (mobility) and food production. These are the projects we need to find and learn from, whether to grow in scope and / or replicate, or in order to enable lessons learnt to drive systemic impact, using the recovery funds to catalyse this change and bring these new climate resilient value chains and business models to the&nbsp;market.</p><p>Building lead markets in Italian&nbsp;cities</p><p>Ultimately we need a culture change in how we view such transition initiatives. If for example we invest in digitally enabled street ‘de-pavings’ creating space for micro-meadows and urban trees all across a city, and if we create new models of <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/civic-ai-1890d93eb8ce">Civic AI</a> to get communities to engage with their public assets like urban meadows, allotments and other Nature-based Solutions — then we are not just making cities better and communities more resilient. By making such machine learning models open source and looking at the social network capital that builds the capacity to then retrofit whole streets and districts in an integrated way, that allows you to generate demand for the value chain innovation and regulatory innovation which builds a high value economy for the 21st Century. So it’s not just de-paving: it’s an intentional pathway to inclusive transition and new ‘lead markets’ that create sustainable jobs, livelihoods and positive place identity.</p><p>Clearly, this type of fundamental transition demands a deep reflection on and investment in <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2018/andy-haldane-speech-given-at-the-oxford-guild-society">institutional capacity fit for the 21st Century</a>. We have discussed investing in value chains, civic collaboration capacity and financial instruments like outcome buying. Another dimension is the educational investment for human development in the machine age. What are the new 21st century schools and development agenda that Italy wants to prepare for? Do we need radical new schools or universities which are transformed? Do we need a whole new area of human development infrastructure? Currently there are still several areas of the country suffering the digital divide and this is having significant consequences on the ability to attend schooling online, affecting the level of competences of future generations. There are world leading examples of AI occurring in Italy in the regions in Piemonte in Turin, Bologna, Modena, Reggio Emilia where research centres and companies are partnering. The challenge here is to learn from the insights created for system-wide benefit, so that such innovation is shared nationally in a more evenly distributed way.</p><p>The other aspect is government acting as a lead market. Government procurement should not just be focused on efficiency but actually on purposeful creation of new lead markets through investing in and ‘buying’ innovation in key sectors. How do governments actively support the emergence of new behaviours through what they procure? Governments and cities have great potential here but there are many obstacles in practice. Civil servants get worried about the risk of failure so go with the middle ground and we miss the chance for the big innovation to occur. Alongside regulatory innovation, acting strategically in this domain is going to be&nbsp;vital.</p><p>The final dimension is building the infrastructures for regulation to be less about control oriented to one of enabling. A control orientated governance and regulatory system works in a world of predictability. But that is not the world we live in — now less than ever. So if this is the case we need not just a series of immediate regulatory adjustments enabling a green recovery, but also to create agile new ways to evolve our regulatory frameworks on an on-going basis for a complex emergent world focused on innovation and transition. This is particularly true in Italy, where a deep change in public administration is needed whether in procurement, recruitment, authorization procedures and or know-how on public-private-civic collaboration.</p><p>The PNRR offers great opportunities. But it cannot be a sticking plaster. Driving an innovative, resilient, and thriving society in the 21st Century cannot be achieved with the tools and practices of the 20th century. We must create tangible pathways towards a next generation governance system at urban level and beyond — through collaboratively building portfolios of new instruments and tools right across the domains we mention in this piece: a ‘boring revolution’ of institutional infrastructures to enable the more visible aspects of recovery and resilience in our&nbsp;cities.</p><p>If you want to find out more about this initiative contact <a href="http://sean@tomorrowscities.partners">Sean Lockie</a>, <a href="http://angelicamonaco67@gmail.com">Angelica Monaco</a> or <a href="http://joost@darkmatterlabs.org">Joost Beunderman</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/the-great-200-billion-euro-plan-384fe16dcfe1">The great 200 billion Euro Plan</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Per la versione inglese vedi&nbsp;<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/the-great-200-billion-euro-plan-384fe16dcfe1">qui</a>.</p><p>L’Italia, come molte nazioni, sta affrontando un’importante transizione strategica. Molte città italiane stanno assistendo ad un cocktail di sfide crescenti e rischi futuri, inclusi la fuga di cervelli di giovani qualificati verso città più grandi e altre parti d’Europa; la stagnazione economica e le infrastrutture che invecchiano; la scarsa qualità dell’aria, gli effetti negativi delle isole di calore e l’aumento dell’incidenza delle inondazioni. Tutto ciò è stato aggravato dal COVID, che ha profondamente colpito le comunità e l’economia italiana rivelandone e amplificandone le disuguaglianze. I modelli di sfruttamento del lavoro con privazione dei diritti minimi si stanno diffondendo; mentre in termini di disagio sociale e psicologico stiamo assistendo a sempre più episodi di violenza sia in ambito domestico che nelle strade e ad un preoccupante aumento dell’autolesionismo soprattutto tra i giovani. La società italiana sta soffrendo.</p><p>Oltre l’incrementalismo</p><p>La transizione richiesta è sistemica: non si tratta di una transizione incrementale o aggiuntiva, ma radicale. Sappiamo, ad esempio, che il cambiamento climatico non è una crisi isolata: è fondamentalmente un sintomo di un problema strutturale nel modo in cui governiamo e in cui sono governate le nostre relazioni nel mondo: il nostro rapporto con il futuro, il nostro rapporto con la natura e il mondo materiale, il rapporto tra di noi. Man mano che le divisioni sociali e la prospettiva di un riscaldamento globale di <a href="https://www.unep.org/emissions-gap-report-2020">3+ ​​gradi Celsius</a> diventano sempre più probabili, dobbiamo metterci nelle condizioni di ripensare una serie di relazioni sociali, economiche, umane e planetarie per forgiare un futuro florido e sostenibile per le nostre&nbsp;città.</p><p>Il Piano Nazionale di Ripresa e Resilienza (PNRR) con la sua irripetibile dotazione di capitale, rappresenta forse la migliore opportunità che abbiamo e comporta un’enorme responsabilità per tutti noi come professionisti e cittadini.</p><p>La pandemia ha visto livelli di coordinamento finanziario e politico all’interno dell’UE senza precedenti. Ad esempio, la raccolta di capitale per il fondo di ripresa Covid-19 per i pacchetti di stimolo fiscale in tutta l’UE ha registrato una straordinaria risposta collettiva. Il fondo sarà distribuito nei prossimi cinque anni, con una combinazione di sovvenzioni e prestiti ai paesi dell’UE e spesa diretta dell’UE; circa 1/3 (250 miliardi di euro) andrà a finanziare l’economia verde. La Commissione prevede di iniziare ad emettere titoli nel giugno di quest’anno creando un precedente a livello europeo per altre attività di raccolta fondi sui&nbsp;mercati.</p><p>Il piano richiede l’accordo su una nuova tassa sui beni importati nell’UE da paesi che perseguono obiettivi di taglio delle emissioni di CO2 meno ambiziosi, nuovi prelievi o sovrattasse sulle emissioni nel settore dei trasporti e una tassa per il settore digitale.</p><p>I 250 miliardi di euro da stanziare per l’economia verde dovrebbero fornire la base per l’innovazione finanziaria nel settore del cambiamento climatico, ad es. esaminare la fattibilità di bond legati all’impatto del cambiamento climatico per consentire all’Europa di aprire la strada agli investimenti in un futuro pulito, sano e&nbsp;giusto.</p><p>Tutto questo si aggiunge a un programma di retrofit di efficienza energetica molto ambizioso a livello nazionale, “Superbonus”, che si occupa del miglioramento dei materiali, degli impianti energetici e dell’incremento di fonti rinnovabili. Amministrato attraverso l’Agenzia delle Entrate, prevede un sussidio del 110% dei costi di ristrutturazione e installazione, che verrano rimborsati attraverso un bonus fiscale nell’arco di pochi&nbsp;anni.</p><p>Attorno a questo schema si sta mobilitando una quantità impressionante di organizzazioni come le banche, l’agenzia delle entrate, le società di consulenza fiscale, un insieme di fornitori per la parte tecnica e di realizzazione (isolamento, impianti, architettura, ingegneria, imprese edili, etc.), comuni e cittadini.</p><p>La pandemia ha anche dimostrato che i luoghi devono essere in grado di trasformarsi rapidamente e che dobbiamo sviluppare resilienza e agilità istituzionali per affrontare eventi imprevedibili, per rispondere alle crisi non solo in modo puramente reattivo, ma garantendo che le misure di ripresa siano veramente trasformative e capaci di ridurre le vulnerabilità future.</p><p>Milano, ad esempio, è stata una delle prime grandi città in Europa a dover attuare un lockdown. La città ha risposto con un’ampia serie di iniziative, che hanno incluso la realizzazione a tempo di record di strategie di mobilità attiva, la trasformazione dell’ambiente domestico in luogo di lavoro, l’attivazione su larga scala della didattica on line facendo fronte al divario digitale e creando maggiori opportunità di autoapprendimento.</p><p>Un programma di ripresa multidimensionale</p><p>Poiché la trasformazione è multidimensionale, è molto chiaro ora che i processi per realizzarla sono della massima importanza. Tutte le misure di ripresa da implementare nel prossimo futuro devono andare oltre le soluzioni temporanee unidimensionali e mirare invece a molteplici co-benefici e sinergie. Ad esempio si potrebbero sfruttare le agevolazioni “superbonus” per creare un programma di retrofit inclusivo che porti la sostenibilità a livello di quartiere. Un tale programma di riqualificazione dovrebbe affrontare non solo il rendimento energetico del patrimonio abitativo, ma anche realizzare una maggiore coesione sociale e benefici a lungo termine attraverso la generazione e la distribuzione della energia prodotta dagli stessi residenti, la valorizzazione delle aree pubbliche che collegano gli edifici e la conversione di spazi dedicati alle auto a parchi che consentono ai residenti di praticare attività fisica, godere della natura e organizzare mercati di prossimità (prodotti agricoli&nbsp;ecc.).</p><p>Nel definire un programma di recupero multidimensionale di questo tipo, una prima sfida riguarda il modo in cui comprendiamo i rischi interconnessi che dobbiamo affrontare (ad esempio, inquinamento atmosferico, povertà energetica, impatti sulla salute, perdita di posti di lavoro e precarietà, mancanza di istruzione adeguata e coesione della comunità, cambiamento climatico).</p><p>In secondo luogo, dobbiamo ripensare a come costruire portafogli di interventi che si rafforzino a vicenda contro tali passività future, permettendoci di stabilire una chiara direzionalità della transizione ed essere aperti all’incertezza e all’emergere di nuove opportunità, nonché a possibili nuove&nbsp;crisi.</p><p>Ciò significa anche sviluppare una capacità distribuita di costruire, iterare e imparare dai primi interventi, creare portafogli di transizione dinamici, agili e capillari capaci di evolversi man mano che emergono nuove problematiche, opportunità, problemi e intuizioni&nbsp;. Viviamo infatti in un’epoca di continua comparsa di difficoltà/opportunità e crisi emergenziali e le istituzioni centralizzate si muovono lentamente e non sono, per definizione, all’altezza del&nbsp;compito.</p><p>Le capacità istituzionali di prossima generazione</p><p>In pratica questo significa costruire la capacità istituzionale di comprendere e agire sull’emergenza in modo collaborativo sia nel settore pubblico (comuni), nel settore privato (costruttori, società energetiche, ecc.) che nella società civile. Si tratta di proprietà istituzionali fondamentali: la capacità distribuita di dare un senso a dati complessi e segnali deboli, capacità distribuita di innovare e la capacità distribuita di creare nuove coalizioni. Non siamo in grado di prevedere 1:1 quali sono i problemi, quali sono le nostre maggiori responsabilità e quali potrebbero essere le soluzioni.</p><p>Una dimensione in cui tali esigenze di capacità istituzionale sono particolarmente urgenti è l’innovazione nella manutenzione. Dobbiamo ridurre radicalmente i costi burocratici e di gestione della manutenzione, dell’adattamento e del miglioramento delle nostre città nel loro complesso se vogliamo recuperare l’arretratezza nella manutenzione delle infrastrutture e liberare nuovo valore dell’ambiente costruito esistente. Ciò è particolarmente rilevante in Italia, dove ci sono molti livelli di controllo e di burocrazia che frenano le città nell’approvvigionamento e nella gestione di tali lavori. Una ‘<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/nextgengov-the-big-boring-bureaucratic-revolution-39ccc3a6c9f8">boring revolution</a>’ (una ‘rivoluzione noiosa’) nell’empowerment locale, nella responsabilità e nella semplificazione delle procedure è essenziale affinché il paese dispieghi le ali e prenda il volo. L’Italia ha bisogno di cambiare mentalità da “abbiamo sempre fatto così” a “questi sono tempi straordinari, proviamo e impariamo ”.</p><p>Per arrivarci dobbiamo adottare un approccio all’investimento a livello di filiere / catene di valore, che presuppone investimenti su varie filiere produttive, come ad esempio quelli necessari per supportare il passaggio a bio materiali e circolarità nei settori dello sviluppo immobiliare e dell’edilizia&nbsp;. È cruciale che cambiamenti profondi e strutturali siano affrontati assicurando una “transizione giusta”. Se ci limitiamo a innovazioni puntuali, vedremo il consolidamento del capitale e della ricchezza nelle mani di pochi. Quindi, riconoscendo il ruolo delle PMI e della natura familistica dell’economia italiana, come possiamo investire in una rivoluzione inclusiva dell’intera catena del valore, spingendo la produzione digitalizzata e la capacità di rendimento dell’intero ciclo di vita, enfatizzando le nuove competenze e modi di lavorare essenziali per la moderna automazione uomo-macchina?</p><p>Sappiamo che nel 21° secolo, se vogliamo parlare di prospettive per il futuro, operiamo fondamentalmente nel dominio delle nuove capacità uomo-macchina. Ciò richiede la creazione di nuove infrastrutture istituzionali e finanziarie, sia per cristallizzare i rischi futuri sia per integrare una comprensione più sofisticata di tali responsabilità con il modo in cui investiamo in infrastrutture umane, tecnologiche e fisiche per la transizione. I nostri investimenti in infrastrutture devono andare ben oltre le familiari “gru all’orizzonte”, finanziando anche la capacità a lungo termine di aziende, di interi settori e della comunità di essere soggetti attivi della transizione, portando ciascuno immaginazione e innovazione.</p><p>Ad esempio, le città stanno prendendo sempre più in considerazione la necessità di massicci investimenti in infrastrutture verdi come Milano, Torino o Bologna, tra le tante città europee che si sono dotate di piani di forestazione urbana da milioni di alberi. Ma è impossibile costruire approcci veramente integrati senza considerare le inondazioni, le isole di calore e la biodiversità, come fattori essenziali nei modelli delle società di servizi e multiutilities che gestiscono i rischi e gli investimenti per farvi fronte. Questi a loro volta devono andare di pari passo con la valutazione dei rischi sulla salute, il coinvolgimento del mondo assicurativo e la costruzione di una capacità collettiva di acquisto basata sui risultati (outcomes based contracts) che integra tali rischi e responsabilità nel settore pubblico e&nbsp;privato.</p><p>Le soluzioni infrastrutturali multi-benefici come le foreste (peri-) urbane possono gestire questi rischi simultaneamente e produrre risultati per più beneficiari. Quindi la condivisione di tali responsabilità e la creazione di un quadro di riferimento per aziende, comunità e altre organizzazioni per i contratti di acquisto basati sui risultati (Outcomes Based Contracts),diventano strumenti fondamentali per dare agli investimenti priorità definite in modo collaborativo.</p><p>Questo tipo di innovazione negli appalti consente al settore pubblico e alle comunità di descrivere il risultato che desiderano e quindi di lasciare spazio a nuove innovazioni. Stiamo iniziando a vedere sperimentazioni di questi tipo in alcuni luoghi in cui le autorità sanitarie, ad esempio, stanno investendo in cambiamenti all’ambiente costruito perché si traducono in meno obesità, meno malattie respiratorie o meno stress per la salute mentale. Città come Vienna e Londra stanno iniziando ad affrontare queste sfide sistemiche.</p><p>Il contratto sociale per la transizione</p><p>Ciò che diventa evidente in tutto questo è che l’Italia deve investire nella capacità di innovazione a livello di singolo cittadino. Dobbiamo costruire nei cittadini la comprensione della transizione e la voglia di innovazione, quasi a livello quotidiano: è una parte essenziale del <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/climate-city-contracting-for-humane-thriving-39153a2ba5ab">contratto sociale necessario per una transizione legittima</a>. La capacità a livello di strada o quartiere, la capacità democratica di massa di innovare è una componente fondamentale di questa tesi. Bologna è un ottimo esempio in cui questo sta già iniziando a succedere, attraverso la Fondazione Innovazione Urbana e i suoi “I Laboratori di Quartiere”, spazi pazienti e democratici di confronto a livello di quartiere. L’obiettivo è attivare processi continui di ascolto, dialogo e collaborazione in ogni quartiere, per far emergere priorità, bisogni, indicazioni e proposte, immaginando soluzioni condivise su come rigenerare e valorizzare gli spazi nei vari ambiti della città attraverso assemblee pubbliche nei quartieri, sessioni tematiche e incontri fisici o&nbsp;on-line.</p><p>Oppure Ferrara, dove il progetto Climb ha promosso la mobilità casa-scuola attiva e sostenibile attraverso un mix di cambiamento comportamentale, internet delle cose e gamification; il progetto mira a cambiare l’atteggiamento dei bambini, delle loro famiglie e della loro comunità ed abbracciare soluzioni di viaggio eco-sostenibili creando abitudini di mobilità eco-compatibili come un’esperienza divertente e sociale. Le comunità locali possono utilizzare le lezioni apprese dal progetto per creare un movimento civico che porta anche ad altri benefici collaterali. Tutti questi progetti iniziano dal basso e hanno portato a importanti livelli di partecipazione dei cittadini.</p><p>Oppure si pensi al Progetto Seta di Rovereto volto a creare un distretto culturale ed economico delle attività seriche secondo un approccio di sviluppo integrato: rigenerazione e bonifica dei terreni incolti; promozione di un progetto di agricoltura sociale e sostenibile per la produzione di gelsi e bachi da seta, con inserimento lavorativo di persone in situazioni difficili.</p><p>Infine, sul tema della circolarità ci sono numerosi casi di innovazione che si stanno sempre più diffondendo in Italia. Bioplastiche da residui d’uva nella Valdobbiadene, i numerosi esempi di nuovi modelli di business che stiamo vedendo in luoghi come Milano attorno a concetti abitativi circolari, dove si stanno affinando modelli di sviluppo che riuniscono i residenti per aiutare con la cura dei bambini, la condivisione delle risorse (mobilità) e la produzione alimentare. Questi sono i progetti da cui imparare, sia per ampliarne la portata e / o replicarli, sia per consentire alle lezioni apprese di guidare l’impatto sistemico, utilizzando i fondi per la ripresa per catalizzare questo cambiamento e portare queste nuove filiere e modelli di business climaticamente resilienti a&nbsp;mercato.</p><p>Costruire mercati guida nelle città&nbsp;Italiane</p><p>Infine, abbiamo bisogno di un cambiamento culturale nel modo in cui consideriamo tali iniziative di transizione. Se, ad esempio, investiamo nella de-pavimentazione stradale supportata dall’uso di strumenti digitali creando spazio per microprati urbani e alberi in tutta la città, e se creiamo nuovi modelli di <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/civic-ai-1890d93eb8ce">intelligenza artificiale civica</a> per convincere le comunità a impegnarsi su beni pubblici come i prati urbani, terreni ad uso pubblico e altri interventi naturali, stiamo facendo di più che migliorare le città e territori più resilienti.</p><p>Rendere open source tali modelli di machine learning e tenere in conto il valore dei social network che creano la capacità di riqualificare intere strade e quartieri in modo integrato, consente di generare domanda di innovazione di filiera e normativa e costruire un’ecoonomia ad alto valore aggiunto nel 21° secolo. Quindi non si tratta solo di de-pavimentazione: è un percorso intenzionale verso una transizione inclusiva e nuovi “mercati guida” che creano posti di lavoro sostenibili, mezzi di sussistenza e identità positiva del&nbsp;luogo.</p><p>Chiaramente, questo tipo di transizione radicale richiede una profonda riflessione e un investimento in <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2018/andy-haldane-speech-given-at-the-oxford-guild-society">capacità istituzionali adatte al 21° secolo</a>. Abbiamo parlato degli investimenti in catene del valore, di capacità di collaborazione civica e di strumenti finanziari come gli Outcomes Based Contracts. Un’altra dimensione è l’investimento educativo per lo sviluppo umano nell’era dell’automazione.</p><p>Quali sono le nuove scuole del 21° secolo e il programma di sviluppo a cui l’Italia vuole prepararsi? Abbiamo bisogno di nuove scuole o università? Abbiamo bisogno di infrastrutture completamente nuove per lo sviluppo&nbsp;umano?</p><p>Attualmente sono ancora diverse le aree del Paese che soffrono il digital divide e questo ha avuto conseguenze significative sulla capacità di frequentare la scuola online, incidendo sul livello di competenze delle generazioni future.</p><p>Ci sono esempi di leader mondiali di AI in Italia, a Torino, Bologna, Modena, Reggio Emilia, dove i centri di ricerca e le aziende stanno collaborando. La sfida qui è imparare dalle conoscenze generate estendendone i benefici a livello di sistema, condividere l’innovazione a livello nazionale e distribuirla più uniformemente.</p><p>Un altro aspetto importante è relativo al ruolo che hanno i governi nel guidare il mercato. Gli appalti pubblici non dovrebbero concentrarsi solo sull’efficienza, ma anche sulla creazione mirata di nuovi mercati guida attraverso l’investimento e l’”acquisto” di innovazione in settori chiave. In che modo i governi sostengono attivamente l’emergere di nuovi comportamenti attraverso ciò che acquistano? I governi e le città hanno un grande potenziale, ma nella pratica ci sono molti ostacoli. I dipendenti pubblici si preoccupano del rischio di errore, si adotta una via di mezzo e si perde l’occasione che si realizzino grandi innovazioni. L’’innovazione normativa è uno degli strumenti per attuare una strategia sistemica e trasformativa.</p><p>La dimensione finale è relativa alla costruzione di infrastrutture affinché la regolamentazione sia meno orientata al controllo e più orientata all’abilitazione. Un sistema di governance e regolamentazione orientato al controllo funziona in un mondo di prevedibilità. Ma questo non è il mondo in cui viviamo, ora meno che mai. Quindi, se questo è il caso, non abbiamo bisogno solo di una serie di aggiustamenti normativi immediati che consentano una ripresa verde, ma anche di creare nuovi modi agili per far evolvere i nostri quadri normativi su base permanente per un mondo complesso incentrato sull’innovazione e la transizione. Ciò è particolarmente vero in Italia, dove è necessario un profondo cambiamento nella pubblica amministrazione negli appalti, nelle assunzioni, nelle procedure di autorizzazione e / o nel know-how sulla collaborazione pubblico-privato-cittadino.</p><p>Il PNRR offre grandi opportunità. Ma non può essere un cerotto. Non si può guidare una società innovativa, resiliente e florida nel 21° secolo con gli strumenti e le pratiche del 20° secolo. Dobbiamo creare percorsi tangibili verso un sistema di governance di prossima generazione a livello urbano e oltre, attraverso la costruzione collaborativa di portafogli di nuovi strumenti e di souluzioni come quelle menzionate in questo articolo: una ‘boring revolution’ delle infrastrutture istituzionali per abilitare e valorizzare le componenti di resilienza e ripresa nelle nostre&nbsp;città.</p><p>Se sei interessato a continuare la conversazione, contattaci <a href="http://sean@tomorrowscities.partners">Sean Lockie</a>, <a href="http://angelicamonaco67@gmail.com">Angelica Monaco</a> o <a href="http://joost@darkmatterlabs.org">Joost Beunderman</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/un-piano-da-oltre-200-miliardi-2da3eef0552">Un piano da oltre 200 miliardi</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  A case study of using Fission's UCAN to power lightweight, verifiable credentials for discounts, offers, and other deals between businesses on the web.

<p>How do you coordinate among many business units in one company, or with many independent businesses across the web? Fission's UCAN approach makes for lightweight, verifiable credentials that can help businesses coordinate without tight integration or coordination ahead of time. </p> "At a Doughnut Shop Near You!" <p>Let's say that you've recently realized your lifelong dream to open an independent doughnut shop. To welcome you to the neighbourhood, the coffee shop next door wants to run a promotion to drive awareness of both businesses (what's better than coffee and a doughnut, right?) If someone buys a cruller from you, the coffee shop will give the them a brew coffee at half price.</p><p>To keep things simple, customers only need to show a receipt from your shop issued in the last 24 hours at the coffee shop. To prevent them from being claimed multiple times, the cafe will track the receipt ID in their system. Non-coffee drinking customers can hand off their doughnut receipts to their friends, who gratefully take the 50% off, and drives even more business to the area. Foot traffic is up, and profits soar.</p><p>Time goes on, and this arrangement is working so well that the other shops in the area want to also offer collaborative deals. They want to do all kinds of things: some keep the single-use deal offer, but others want to offer permanent discounts to members of their co-op, over different time periods, or recurring offers (e.g. "every Friday").</p><p>You could absolutely create a coordinated system with a central database for the entire neighbourhood, but that shows everyone how many sales are being done at the other stores, and requires ongoing maintenance. You want to offer specials and deals without coordinating with the entire business association! You keep the system that's been working: record the receipt IDs, and leave it up to each retailer how they want to run their offers.</p> The Online Equivalent <p>The above story not only sounds reasonable, but is done in real life with physical receipts. It's ground-up, requires little coordination, has no service outages, and anyone can participate. No one has to ask the doughnut shop if they are allowed to use their receipts, and no one is maintaining a complex system of rules for these offers.</p><p>Historically, doing this online has been less straightforward. Because permissions are done per company, offering a discount code requires coordination between at least two teams: the doughnut shop in the above story suddenly needs to either:</p>  Know all of the discount codes for all of the participating shops, or  Register the user ID as being eligible for deals, and wire up the two company's back-ends  <p>These both work, but they depend on a high level of coordination, and rules to be maintained across systems. They're permissioned, and top-down. There must be a simpler way, closer to the bottom-up version from our doughnut shop story, right?</p> Enter the UCAN <p>At Fission, we've developed a version of distributed auth called UCAN:</p><blockquote>User Controlled Authorization Networks (UCANs) are a way of doing authorization where users are fully in control. OAuth is designed for a centralized world, UCAN is the distributed user controlled version.<br><br>– <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/auth-without-backend/">Fission blog: UCAN: Authorizing Users without a Backend</a></blockquote><p>As well as being like a distributed variant of OAuth, UCANs are also stateless by default ("REST for auth"), so it continues to work client-side, P2P, and even offline.</p><p>UCANs are used anywhere that we need to authorize a user to perform side-effects: time-based expiry, rights delegation, authorized access, writing to a database, and so on. Fission is a platform that helps people create apps, so we made it extensible: it can support arbitrary use cases as long as they're well understood by the issuer and verifier.</p><p>It turns out that UCANs are able to fully support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">verifiable credential</a> use cases, in a different format, with the added flexibility of delegation. This makes them work much like the receipts in the doughnut shop story, thanks to the following properties:</p>  Permissionless —&nbsp;anyone can accept UCANs issued without bothering you  Bearer Credential —&nbsp;you only need the UCAN itself (like a receipt)  Delegable — can be passed around to friends, and prove that they're allowed  Non-fungible — uniquely identifiable, even when delegated   Use Case: Decentralized Coordination <p>We have been exploring use cases with a few teams, including a Fortune 500 publishing company. They have many properties under their umbrella, and collaborate with many third parties to offer perks to their subscribers. Like many companies offering running at scale today, they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law">solved for team agility with microservices</a> — each team can move their publications forward independently. Users have a single account across publications, and so all logins and billing get funnelled through the auth service.</p> Internal Decentralized Coordination <p>If you have ever read a physical magazine, you'll be familiar with their leaflets enticing you to sign up for their other publications and partners. You typically mail the leaflet that's already prefilled with your account number back to the publisher. How would we replicate these offers digitally?</p><p>The centralized auth server works well, but that auth server is a both a technical and team bottleneck: if Publication A wants to give a trial offer for Publication B, they need to encode this logic directly in the auth server. The auth and billing teams are suddenly responsible for maintaining the complex rules across all teams' marketing deals. Teams A and B now have a hard dependency on the roadmap of the auth team, which is also responsible for servicing all of the other teams.</p><p>By placing all the information needed to describe and validate an offer right in the token, teams can ship independently.</p> Easy Third-Party Integration <p>The same applies to teams outside the company: anyone with a valid credential can be used as authorized proof that you have an account, despite having totally separate auth systems. It can be as simple as signing up with the same email that's in the credential, or having a challenge code signed into the UCAN chain.</p><p>What this can't tell you statelessly is that the holder is currently a subscriber, only that they were when the credential was made. For this reason, these credentials generally have an expiration date. They can absolutely be made stateful by requiring a lookup — it's always easier to go that direction than from stateful to stateless —&nbsp;but in our experience it's not required for the 95% use case.</p><p>What this enables is that business and marketing teams can make discounts, offers, and other specialized deals anywhere, with any company, with low effort and without developer coordination overhead, while still having verifiable credentials, and without sharing more than a single fact about users.</p> Contemporaries <p>It turns out that it's not just us! This pattern is being picked up elsewhere, too.</p> Google Macaroons <p>Until fairly recently, Google had a similar centralized auth setup as the publishing company. Being at Google scale means that their auth servers were dealing with an enormous volume for logins and auth across Gmail, YouTube, Google Play, Google Docs, Stadia, and so on. To make this scale better, they developed the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/macaroons-resources/527">Macaroons</a> system to delegate auth responsibilities to the individual services, which still remaining interoperable with a single account.</p><p>In many ways, UCANs are like Macaroons taken to their logical conclusion: they fully decentralize auth, are stateless by default, and work well permissionlessly across teams.</p> Passport <p><a href="https://twitter.com/BenThompson">Ben Thompson</a> of the excellent <a href="https://stratechery.com/">Stratechery</a> has recently released <a href="https://stratechery.com/2021/passport/">Passport</a>, which is also aimed at a subset of the problem space. From the linked article:</p><blockquote>The second reason to build Passport is to provide a better experience &nbsp;for my subscribers. One of the downsides of relying on a menagerie of &nbsp;different services is that there were both more rough edges exposed to &nbsp;users, and also an inability to provide more personalized offerings. &nbsp;Passport is an improvement on both fronts.</blockquote><p>We had a number of people send us this article, saying that it reminded them of how Fission worked. Definitely, these are the types of use cases that we think can be created and enabled across the web as an open, interoperable standard. And some of it crosses into the work we're doing as <a href="https://blog.fission.codes/fission-demo-day-may-2021/">part of the Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, too.</p><p>It feels like this idea's time has come!</p> Your Turn <p>Interested in implementing UCANs to coordinate offers? Have a use case we haven't thought of? Want to poke holes in the whole concept? We'd love to hear from you!</p><p><a href="https://calendly.com/borismann">Book a time in our calendar</a>, or <a href="https://fission.codes/discord">drop by our Discord chat</a> with any further questions.</p><p>You can find all the <a href="https://talk.fission.codes/t/user-controlled-authorization-networks-ucan-resources/1122">collected UCAN resources in our developer forum »</a></p>

   We’re excited to announce that Dock’s mainnet will transition to a Proof of Stake (PoS) network on July 7th, 2021 at 1pm GMT.

<p>We’re excited to announce that Dock’s mainnet will transition to a Proof of Stake (PoS) network on July 7th, 2021 at 1pm GMT.</p><p>As discussed in our <a href="https://blog.dock.io/docks-proof-of-stake-testnet-is-now-live/?utm_source=dock_blog&amp;utm_medium=organic_article&amp;utm_campaign=docks_proof_of_stake_mainnet_will_launch_on_july_7th">earlier blog post</a>, this transition will further decentralize the Dock blockchain by basing validator selection on the amount of tokens staked by validators and token holders, and introducing a new governance structure that allows anyone with Dock tokens to vote on proposed changes to the network.</p><p>This transition also comes with a change in the network’s consensus algorithm, from Aura to BABE (you can read more about these algorithms <a href="https://docs.dock.io/learn/consensus">here</a>), and this will require starting a new chain that runs the BABE algorithm. However, we’re taking the following steps to minimize the impact of creating a new chain on our network users:</p>  The new chain’s genesis block will preserve the state (accounts with balances, DIDs, schemas, etc.) of the existing Proof of Authority (PoA) mainnet.  We will retain the history of the PoA mainnet blocks and have it publicly available on a separate explorer, whose link will be shared soon after the new chain is launched.  <p>The upgrade to PoS will involve stopping the block production on the existing PoA mainnet, exporting the state of the PoA network, and starting the new PoS chain that preserves the PoA network’s state. This process will begin at 10am GMT on July 7th, and will take around 3 hours, during which transactions will not be possible. We apologize in advance for any inconvenience caused by this, but we're sure you’ll agree that the benefits outweigh the disruption.</p><p>In the coming days we’ll publish more detailed information on how token holders can participate in the new network, and keep the community updated on our progress in taking this important step!</p>

<p>Guest post by Nasubo Ongoma, <a href="https://qhala.com/">Qhala Limited</a>, email: nasubo.ongoma@qhala.com</p>Natasha, a woman driver receiving a client request on her phone in Nairobi, Kenya. Photo credit: Natasha (driver).<blockquote>“Digital channels are actually the lifesaver when it comes to these challenges females&nbsp;face.”</blockquote><blockquote>- Lizzie, 24, freelancer and research participant</blockquote><p>We are starting a new research project — and we’d like you to join us on the journey. Over the course of 2021, Qhala and Caribou Digital, with the support of the Mastercard Foundation, will work to understand the impact of COVID-19 on young women’s experiences working or selling through online platforms in&nbsp;Kenya.</p> Why this research&nbsp;now? <p>There is growing conversation on how platformization (broadly, the use of digital technologies to get work or sell) has increased access to work and markets for young women. Despite consistent calls for gender equity and <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/report/2016/leaving-no-one-behind">narrowing</a> the gender gap worldwide, in many emerging markets, such as Kenya, there is much more to learn about how platforms impact women’s lives, especially during and after COVID-19.</p><p>COVID-19 deprived people of sources of income and led to the closure of businesses, vending sites, and marketplaces, and women were among the <a href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/policy_brief_on_covid_impact_on_women_9_apr_2020_updated.pdf">worst</a> affected. The pandemic and its effects on livelihoods emerge in the context of global <a href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/publication/wcms_771749.pdf">findings</a> by ILO that a majority of workers on digital labor platforms are highly educated and male. How can women compete in this economic sphere dominated and enabled by men? Understanding the experience of platform livelihoods from women’s perspective is key to identifying the enablers, barriers, opportunities, and challenges for women as they strive to get platform work during and after the pandemic.</p><p>This research builds on Qhala and Caribou Digital’s previous work on <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/">Platform Livelihoods</a>, which explores the effect of “platformatization” on different livelihoods for Kenyan youth. Through an <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/evidence-gap-map/#tab-egm">extensive literature review</a>, Platform Livelihoods describes in detail the experiences of youth workers in farming, creative sectors, logistics (motorcycle drivers), and small businesses. (The full report is in publication; frameworks and the gender-specific literature review can be found <a href="http://www.platformlivelihoods.com/gender">here</a>). Through interviews with workers, the differences between male and female youth economic opportunities and participation became clear. This includes <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/access-to-work-is-there-work-for-those-who-want-it/">access</a> (access to capital, freedom of movement, devices, and safety), <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/flexibility/">flexibility</a> (juggling productive and reproductive roles and responsibilities for women), <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/earnings/">earnings</a> (reflecting a difference in how skills are valued their skill is based on gender) and <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/objectivity-professionalism/">professionalism</a> (societal perception about what kinds of jobs or roles women and men are best suited for). Milly is an onion farmer in Kajiado County. Her quote below illustrates the complexity of female Kenyan gig worker experiences:</p><blockquote>“Yes of course there is always that — a little bit of male chauvinism around. I won’t lie. There is a lot of sexism that is around. But there is also the advantage of the fact that you are a woman that people will easily believe you or trust in you. You know? So you look at it in both ways. It’s an advantage sometimes and sometimes a disadvantage. Yeah. But I think it has worked for me rather than it has worked against me.” — Milly, 26, Farmer, (Platform Livelihoods, report in production)</blockquote><p>Women participants (especially in the creative sectors) mentioned that there is sexism. For example, in the music and artistic industries, women face the expectation to sell their products cheaper than men or face harassment:</p><blockquote>“There are people who are going to take advantage of you. They come to you with other intentions, not businesswise.” — Lynn, 25, Visual Artist (Platform Livelihoods, report in production)</blockquote><p>The gig sector is known for its flexibility and earning potential. However, with stiff competition emerging in the platform economy, will women be able to thrive and succeed in this sector, in terms of earnings and finding opportunities? Further, women were disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Some were out of work. Others considered a career change and ventured into the platform economy. Understanding women’s economic participation experiences in the gig economy is thus necessary to generate evidence to describe the enablers and barriers including coping mechanisms, and then inform gender policy and program considerations to improve livelihoods through platformatization.</p> About the&nbsp;research <p>The questions we will ask in our gender-focused Kenya research will be informed by our initial global findings and gender, work, and platformatization. From the Platform Livelihoods literature review, sectoral reports on <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24732/w24732.pdf">ride-hailing</a> platforms outline notable differences in wages, attributed to experience on the platform, driving experience, choice of where to work and live, as well as safety issues as they carry out the work. There are also notable differences for women freelancers when bidding for work. Foong et al. (2018) found that <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3274322">women bid less</a> than men and as a result have to bid for more work to <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=527000067124025066094116074070107108039003024042071075093072121088117122097095002067114102007027106035006118100121071013027083005082039040022084028076126102024076010057077009093030069067114126083085115085011092008094101027115097072008067001006102100001&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE">compensate</a> for this disparity in earnings.</p><p>Although women dominate the trade and services sectors, female gig workers allude to the skewed power dynamics that privilege clients over workers. (It is worth noting that men may also experience the same, and some platform economy critics point out that we talk more about women and platforms than men and platforms). These sectors are also heavily <a href="https://cdn.odi.org/media/documents/women_in_the_gig_economy_final_digital.pdf">dependent</a> on <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-64697-4_7">ratings</a>; many young women report wanting more bargaining power in terms of the jobs they bid for, time put in the work, and the quality of&nbsp;work.</p><blockquote>“Let’s say I have been booked for five hours [.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.]. It will be a big house that does not even tally with those five hours [.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.] but the client expects me to finish that job, so I am forced to add hours [.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.]. The client will be putting pressure on me to work fast, but if I work fast, I will get a bad rating attributed to not cleaning properly as the job was rushed. There is a serious problem there.” — Faheema, FGD participant, Cape Town (<a href="https://cdn.odi.org/media/documents/women_in_the_gig_economy_final_digital.pdf">Hunt et al</a>.,&nbsp;2019)</blockquote><p>A gender analysis of the platform economy is therefore timely to assess the enabling factors of and barriers to economic participation by young women in Kenya, especially in the informal sector. Notably, women’s involvement in the informal sector has been increasing, particularly in the platform economy, given its potential for women’s economic opportunities and participation for empowerment. By articulating the supports, barriers, and risks associated with the platform economy, this study will provide key learnings and understanding to address inequalities that may challenge young women’s economic participation. This study will begin in Kenya, followed by complementary research in Ghana (with the <a href="https://www.ug.edu.gh/">University of Ghana</a>) and Nigeria (with <a href="https://www.lbs.edu.ng/">Lagos Business School</a> and <a href="https://v4w.org/">Value for Women</a>). The sample population is young women aged 18–35 years from rural and urban Kenya working on the gig/ platform economy (with parallel populations in Ghana and Nigeria).</p> Young women turn to digital platforms in&nbsp;Kenya A visual artist posting her art work on Instagram. Photo courtesy of Wanja (Visual&nbsp;Artist).<p>Digital platforms encompass social media too. With a <a href="https://kenyanwallstreet.com/digital-gig-economys-potential-to-solve-youth-unemployment.">rapidly expanding</a> youth population and limited opportunities for formal employment, Kenya’s workforce is shifting towards the informal sector which offers endless economic opportunities. The informal sector in Kenya has grown exponentially in the last two decades and presents innumerable opportunities for youth and women. For example, in several <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/98644.html">African countries</a> the employment contribution of the informal sector is estimated at approximately 80% for non-agricultural jobs.</p><p>Within the informal sector, women account for a disproportionate percentage of workers from street vendors, to domestic workers, subsistence farmers, and seasonal agricultural workers. These economic opportunities are often labor intensive, low-income, short-term unsecured work characterized by informality without proper structures and guidelines for operations. However, what we have seen in Kenya is that while digital companies have tried their hand in these sectors due to the abundance of workers, many initiatives for “platformatizing” informal work have not taken off due to the reliance of a trust based system, where clients prefer referrals from their closed networks/circles. For example, domestic help is more likely to be sought through a friend in a one-on-one message or closed WhatsApp group than contracted through a platform.</p><p>Beyond this, however, other types of work are thriving online. Platforms are capitalizing on the economic potential of the informal sector to create marketplaces for buyers and sellers, or clients and independent contractors. As we begin interviews, three primary topics are of interest: COVID-19 and its effects, the influence of offline gender norms, and policy regulations in&nbsp;Kenya.</p> The effect of&nbsp;COVID-19 <blockquote>“It affected us because most of our clients were employed through some offices so the offices when they closed, we lost some clients, we had some losses.” — Pauline, 21, MSE (Food&nbsp;Vendor)</blockquote><p>Unfortunately, with the <a href="https://rstmh.org/news-blog/news/the-evolution-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-in-kenya">onset of the COVID-19 pandemic</a> informal sector economic opportunities easily available for youth and women in Kenya were the worst hit as containment measures and health directives such as social distancing, <a href="https://techweez.com/2020/03/27/uber-kenya-suspends-night-pickups-due-to-curfew/">restricted movement</a>, and lockdown brought businesses to an impromptu standstill, with some eventually <a href="https://disrupt-africa.com/2020/11/ride-hailing-startup-safeboda-quits-kenya-citing-impact-of-covid-19/">shutting</a>&nbsp;down.</p><p>COVID-19 exacerbated pre-existing problems, especially for women, <a href="https://data.unwomen.org/sites/default/files/documents/Publications/COVID-19%20Gender%20Assessment%20-PopularVersion.pdf">most of whom</a> lost jobs or business and could no longer work for pay after COVID-19. There was also an increased burden of work, including unpaid care and domestic&nbsp;work.</p><p>This <a href="https://www.mercycorps.org/blog/covid-19-gig-workers-social-protection">left workers</a> on their own. Some report <a href="https://www.cgap.org/blog/covid-19-exposes-risks-and-opportunities-kenyas-gig-economy">cutting back</a> on non-food items and reducing their number of meals to cope with decreased income. The number of <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/04/08/tackling-kenyas-domestic-violence-amid-covid-19-crisis">domestic violence</a> cases attributed to COVID-19 increased. Some sectors, on the other hand, found <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/portfolio/dorcas/">new success</a> with an upsurge of <a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2001365681/boon-for-delivery-apps-as-city-eateries-shut-on-virus-fears">demand</a>, for instance, <a href="https://www.capitalfm.co.ke/business/2020/05/sendy-launches-a-home-delivery-solution-to-help-flatten-the-curve/">deliveries</a>, food industry, pharmaceutical corporations, cleaning companies, and online&nbsp;work.</p> Offline gender&nbsp;patterns <p>Social norms and perceived women’s roles still limit women’s engagement in the platform economy. In the previous Platform Livelihoods study (study to be published), each of the four sectors displayed long-standing dynamics. For instance, in logistics, female drivers are scarce and are seen as courageous for taking up the&nbsp;job.</p><blockquote>“[People tell me] Madam, congrats. You are doing work that even most men can’t do.” — Brenda, 29, Motorcycle Rider</blockquote><p>However, it does seem to be the case that young Kenyan women are successfully navigating social commerce and even social agriculture (using social media platforms to buy and sell produce). This demonstrates that there may be new barriers to be confronted, challenged, or changed. Women are faced with formal and informal structural barriers manifested in the perceptions of the work they do. For instance, societal bias to what work is decent: if educated e.g with certain academic qualifications, family may not understand why a worker is doing that work as opposed to looking for more formal employment or working during late hours for married women may be shunned. It is key to understand the role of actors who may enable or hinder women’s growth and development. These could be peers, spouses, and sometimes family members like parents or siblings.</p><p>While women engage in the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/03/why-women-hold-the-keys-to-africas-future/">informal sector</a> that is labor intensive and time-consuming, women still have to fulfill their traditional roles which then means they have a <a href="https://www.academia.edu/24738395/Gender_planning_in_the_third_world_Meeting_practical_and_strategic_gender_needs">triple burden of work</a>. Women’s workload often includes the unmeasured, unpaid domestic work demanded by their reproductive and productive roles. Further, the informal arrangements in informal sector operations subsequently limit women from fully accessing benefits and entitlements of labor engagement. For instance, working without clear human resource laws that govern the workers time, level of engagement, working conditions and negotiated pay.</p><p>According to Kenya’s gender mobile access <a href="https://www.gsma.com/mobilefordevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GSMA-Connected-Women-The-Mobile-Gender-Gap-Report-2019.pdf">outlook</a>, over 82% of women own a mobile phone, but only 28% of these have access to mobile internet. Furthermore, women are significantly disadvantaged in accessing credit, land, or financial products, which prevents opportunities for them to start a company or make a living by managing&nbsp;assets.</p> Taxation, women, and platform work in&nbsp;Kenya <p>In 2020, the Kenyan government launched COVID-focused fiscal, monetary, and social insurance policies to <a href="https://home.kpmg/xx/en/home/insights/2020/04/kenya-tax-developments-in-response-to-covid-19.html">moderate the impact of COVID-19, such as tax exemptions</a>. However, these policies <a href="https://www.fes.de/referat-afrika/neuigkeiten/how-the-pandemic-is-affecting-the-informal-sector-in-kenya">hardly benefit those in the informal sector</a>, where a large percentage of young women work. Additionally, for increased revenue collection, the government is now targeting <a href="https://www.bmmusau.com/electronic-commerce-law-with-a-special-emphasis-on-the-kenya-legal-tax-and-regulatory-challenges/">emerging e-commerce, which includes online business for tax returns</a>, yet more young Kenyan women are increasingly turning to this sector for work. <a href="https://voxeu.org/article/income-tax-gender-discrimination">Empirically</a>, when taxation is linked to labor supply, women’s labor supply compared to that of men is more responsive to their after-tax wage. With a reduction of taxes, the participation of women increases. The government tax on e-commerce coupled with the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic effects portend serious economic, social, and security consequences for young&nbsp;women.</p><p>These barriers in the informal sector notwithstanding, <a href="https://www.cgap.org/blog/how-are-kenyas-youth-experiencing-gig-economy">young women</a> continue to strive to source incomes from available opportunities. For those who can access and navigate digital technologies, online platforms present new<a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/"> business lines and shifts in livelihoods</a>, especially in the gig economy, namely: platform work, small and medium enterprise, logistics, farming, and creatives.</p><p>There could be a reprieve for Kenyans on the digital tax with a <a href="https://citizentv.co.ke/business/relief-for-kenyans-in-digital-service-tax-waiver-11466752/">proposed</a> 2021 finance bill that will instead tax only non-residents or foreigners as opposed to local businesses. However, in foreign platforms this cost is passed down to users, and will impact overall earnings of anyone working online. For instance, UpWork will add the Digital Service Tax on services provided through their platform, and AWS (Amazon Web Services) will pass those extra costs to platform providers.</p>Caption: Information on the Digital Service Tax. Courtesy of Kenya Revenue Authority <a href="https://www.kra.go.ke/images/publications/Brochure--Digital-Service-Tax--final.pdf">KRA</a> The upcoming research&nbsp;process <p>As more women join the platform economy, they will have to overcome pre-existing barriers to participation, including offline gender patterns, new policies that make it harder to do business, and the effects of the pandemic on earnings and employment. From this study, then, there is a need to further explore and detail the gender dynamics in the platform economy. Qhala is thus setting out to upscale from the initial 2020 study and conduct in-depth research to provide detailed insights into gender and platform work in Kenya. The study is anchored in <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jid.3210">Cornwall’s women’s empowerment framework</a>, which calls for cutting away the tangle of assumptions and stereotypes that fill the field of gender and development.</p><p>The study will project the voices and unique perspectives of young women as actors in the platform economy to articulate the nuanced barriers and enablers including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings will also facilitate mapping of the context and provide gender perspectives in the gig economy when regarded as a sector that has potential for increasing young women’s economic opportunities and participation to contribute to the realization of empowerment and sustainable livelihoods.</p><p>The study will adopt a mixed method research design including:</p>  Flash conversations via closed social media groups where women work in the platform economy. Women discuss issues they face getting work or selling on online platforms. This is a key methodology, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic where women are turning to online groups for&nbsp;support.  In-depth interviews and focus group discussions with female gig workers with select male partners to understand the experiences of women workers and actors responsible in shaping their work experience.  Participatory video storytelling to dig deeper into the lived experiences of select female workers by giving them the tools (a phone, video training, and mentoring) to tell their story. <a href="https://www.platformlivelihoods.com/covid-19-video-project/">See our previous participatory video storytelling work&nbsp;here</a>.  <p>We would welcome any feedback, from useful literature you think we should consult to methods we might have missed.

<p>Accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/468663/uk-internet-penetration/">internet penetration rate in the United Kingdom is at an all-time high</a>. 46% of people in the UK attributed increased mobile device usage to the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>Britons now spend an average of 3.5 hours every day on the Internet — the statistic is much higher for Britons who work and live through e-commerce establishments.</p>
<p>The unstoppable rise of the internet opens up a plethora of questions that technology providers need to answer. The most important questions revolve around building security and trust especially in a way that does not frustrate end users.</p>
<p>How do we keep every Briton safe and secure when they access the Internet — without hampering user experience?</p>
 On-Demand Culture in the UK and the Digital ID Surge 
<p>The proliferation of digital products and services for the everyday consumer today has many effects — some intended, others unforeseen.</p>
<p>As is customary when people have multiple choices, an unpleasant one-time experience is enough to negatively affect customer experience, leading them to switch between brands that provide more pleasurable experiences. This is the most important rule guiding a frequently increasing on-demand culture in the UK.</p>
 On-Demand Culture in the UK 
<p>The term “on-demand culture” pays homage to a 21st-century consumer trend of heightened consumer convenience.</p>
<p>A major example of the on-demand culture in action is the expectations of mobile phone users.&nbsp; For mobile devices, users want digital service providers to deliver top-notch services and software solutions — search engines, financial apps, instant messaging —&nbsp; that can work securely and efficiently anywhere in record time.</p>
<p>In line with the on-demand culture in the United Kingdom, end-users require the most of Digital ID verification systems. Consumers want an identity verification system that is fast, reliable, and accessible on cue.</p>
 How to be ‘on-demand’ compliant? 
<p>Given that<a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0025/217834/adults-media-use-and-attitudes-report-2020-21.pdf"> 85% of internet users</a> in the United Kingdom would rather access the internet via a smartphone, digital ID systems that are accessible on both web and mobile platforms will be considered on-demand compliant.</p>
<p>Consumers will waste no time switching brands whose ID systems they consider to be unavailable or often inaccessible. Tech service providers need to always prioritise solutions that fit the on-demand culture. Digital identification solutions, no matter how complex the backend operations, are no exception.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Digital ID solutions that fall short of the on-demand culture expectations risk losing consumers, who will undoubtedly lay claim to poor customer experience.</p>
 Security and Trust: The Digital ID Surge 
<p>As of the turn of 2021, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/748192/number-of-contactless-transactions-in-the-uk/">an aggregate of 939 million contactless transactions</a> have been made in the United Kingdom. As more people decide to function digitally, there’s a corresponding increased responsibility on the part of public and private stakeholders to ensure that the internet is safe, secure and trustworthy.</p>
 What are digital identity and Digital ID (identification)? 
<p>Digital identity and Digital ID verification present the way out of the digital world’s security maze. These concepts are fast becoming an all-important requisite for smooth operations in the on-demand digital economy — and the digital world.</p>
<p>Digital ID verification systems provide processes to digitally authenticate a person’s identity whenever the need arises. For Digital ID verification systems to work, people need to have individual digital identities.</p>
 The Digital ID Surge 
<p>The United Nations (which the UK is a member of) recognises the need to bring trust back to digital operations. Together with the World Bank’s ID4D initiative, the plan is to provide every person on earth with a legal identity by 2030.</p>
<p>Providing security for consumers through digital ID verification is crucial for all digital service providers who want to stay ahead of the curve. As part of the on-demand culture amongst Britons, businesses that do not provide a robust digital ID framework for their customers are very likely to lose out.</p>
 Nipping the “fraud” bud 
<p>Fraud, money laundering and a swathe of financial crimes are what you get in a world where Digital ID is not taken seriously by both private and public stakeholders.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom, according to <a href="https://www.uswitch.com/broadband/online-fraud-report/">research findings by Uswitch</a>, was the highest-ranked nation in Europe for money lost by online fraud in 2020. A mind-boggling amount of 376.5 million pounds was lost to e-commerce fraud.</p>
<p>There’s still a lot more to lose to fraud because the threat still exists. For the end-users, especially on digital payment service platforms, the threat of fraud is a big-enough incentive to switch to more reliable and secure solutions.</p>
<p>Digital ID solutions that are accessible, operable and usable by Britons anywhere will surely change the racecourse, favourably.&nbsp; A workable digital ID process should combine national identity documents with company-specific consumer data (biometrics, to facilitate on-demand electronic identification) for every financial transaction.</p>
<p>This effectively prevents fraud and other financial crime cases to create the kind of secure environment that ultimately ensures Britons trust in the digital economy.</p>
 The Government’s place in Digital ID 
<p>The United Kingdom government has not had the best of times where implementing a national digital identity project is concerned. The cost-intensive “Verify” digital identity project has fallen short of its goals — meaning that the UK does not yet have a national standard identity verification system.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the British government is still keenly aware that digital ID systems are the key to a future of financial inclusion and security in the United Kingdom. It is precisely why the Government Digital Service is working on another digital identity project.</p>
<p>Following further amendments to financial regulations, the government’s position — under <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework/the-uk-digital-identity-and-attributes-trust-framework">the trust framework</a> — is to make it mandatory for service providers to have effective, robust, flexible and scale identification verification systems. For service providers, nothing should be more important than picking the right identification verification service to work with.</p>
 A user-centric Digital ID system 
<p>Building a hugely secure Digital ID system is important. That said, building one that is not just simple but also requires minimal effort to operate is far more important — because it really is all about the end-user.</p>
<p>In line with the on-demand culture in the UK, companies need identity verification solutions that excel in: security, compliance and versatility.</p>
 Get in touch with IDnow 
<p>Simple and effective digital identity verification systems are not as straightforward as they sound. These systems require massive data input, immense technological capabilities and strict compliance with the government’s identity regulations.</p>

<p>Given the many <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">hacking and identity theft</a> incidents that have happened in the last few years, all of us are concerned about our online privacy and the safety of our Personally Identifiable Information.</p><p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> is emerging as a solution for these apprehensions as it gives complete control and ownership of data to the individual entities as they can decide what data to share and with&nbsp;whom.</p><p>Beyond this encompassing vision, let’s drill down into the specifics to understand what you can and can’t do with&nbsp;SSI.</p> What You Can Do With&nbsp;SSI? <p>What are the things you can do and the benefits you derive from using SSI? Let’s&nbsp;explore.</p> Protect your Data from Centralized Storage&nbsp;Systems <p>With SSI, you have control over where your information is stored and shared. This means you can choose to move your information from centralized storage owned by companies to an <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">identity wallet</a> that only you can&nbsp;access.</p> Monetize your&nbsp;Data <p>In the currently popular <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/compare-and-contrast-federated-identity-vs-self-sovereign-identity-227a85cbab18">Federated Identity Management</a> system, companies like Google and Facebook monetize your data through ads. With SSI, you can monetize your data and even choose which companies you want to share it with for&nbsp;money.</p><p>A possible way for data monetization is through a VC marketplace that is akin to an online eCommerce platform like eBay or Airbnb where buyers and sellers come together to buy/sell&nbsp;data.</p> Safeguard your&nbsp;PII <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-ssi-safeguard-your-information-from-hackers-1b256d3eb6cd">Security</a> is probably the most important benefit you get as you know who has your data and what it is being used for. Unauthorized users can’t access your data and use it for the wrong purposes.</p><p>Also, since your data doesn’t sit in a centralized database, there’s little incentive for a hacker to spend time and resources to steal a single person’s&nbsp;data.</p><p>All these are sure to keep your data safe from cybercriminals.</p> More ROI for Businesses <p>If you’re a small business owner, you can earn more returns from your business because you no longer have to spend resources on protecting customer data and complying with data regulations.</p> What You Can’t Do with&nbsp;SSI? <p>SSI is undoubtedly one of the most revolutionary technologies that can change the way you think about your data and handle it. But it is not without pitfalls either. Instead of turning a blind eye to these pitfalls, understanding and navigating through them will help you to better leverage the SSI benefits.</p><p>So, what are some of the things you can’t do with&nbsp;SSI?</p> Pass on the Responsibility <p>With SSI, you can no longer pass on the responsibility of protecting your data to large companies. Remember, companies invest millions of dollars each year to protect the data stored in their systems and still get hacked. So, it can be a huge responsibility for&nbsp;you!</p><p>While the architecture of SSI makes it difficult to hack your data, still the responsibility to safeguard it is all yours. This means you will have to know the security policies of the entity using your data and the onus of picking a secure vendor lies completely on your shoulders.</p><p>For example, let’s say you’ve stored your identity details in a digital wallet that’s protected by a public-private key pair. Here, it’s your responsibility to remember the private keys, as no one can recover it for&nbsp;you.</p><p>A possible workaround can be to use a custodial wallet like the one offered by <a href="https://www.affinidi.com/api#operation/GetCredentials">Affinidi</a>, but then you lose some level of decentralization.</p> Seamless Transfer <p>The SSI space is highly fragmented now with each company developing its applications and possibly even ecosystems. As a user, this translates to a lack of interoperability between different applications or ecosystems. You may have to change the format of data each time you send it to a different user.</p><p>This is undoubtedly inconvenient now, but it could change as the technology matures and eventually leads to the creation of a marketplace where companies can offer their services and you can pick a service provider and send your data for validation and for using the services&nbsp;offered.</p><p>Since the marketplace can have a common format, your data can be interoperable across the applications of companies who participate in this marketplace. Until then, you’ll have to make changes to your data’s&nbsp;format.</p> Cannot Avoid Middlemen <p>The heading can sound counterintuitive. After all, SSI and decentralized identity are all about removing companies, centralized storage, and middlemen, right?</p><p>Well, yes, but you can’t avoid middlemen in all situations. The idea of a marketplace we talked about earlier is a middleman of some&nbsp;sort.</p><p>Likewise, we saw that you can monetize your data if you chose to. Most likely, you’ll need a common marketplace or some other way through which you can inform companies about your willingness to sell your data. This entails a middleman as&nbsp;well.</p><p>So, you can’t avoid middlemen altogether, though their roles can&nbsp;change.</p> Verdict: Should You Go with&nbsp;SSI? <p>Absolutely YES, because the benefits far outweigh the downsides. Also, remember SSI is a relatively new technology and it could take some time for people to jump on its bandwagon.</p><p>Nevertheless, SSI is likely to stay, as is evident from the many proactive steps that the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/european-digital-identity_en">EU</a> and other countries are taking in this direction. It may not be long before other governments follow suit, so SSI is undoubtedly a part of the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Affinidi provides building blocks for an open and interoperable Self-Sovereign Identity ecosystem.</p><p>Follow us on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>.

 The Coming Storm 
 
<p>On April 28th, 2021 the <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/news/national-news/2021/census-2021-portuguese-dpa-cnpd-suspended-data-flows-usa_en" title="European Data Protection Board announced">European Data Protection Board announced</a> that The Portuguese Data Protection Authority (CNPD) ordered INE (National Institute for Statistics) to suspend the sending of personal data from the Census 2021 to the United States. CNPD has issued a <a href="https://www.cnpd.pt/decisoes/deliberacoes/" title="decision">decision</a> addressed to INE for the suspension within 12 hours of any international transfer of personal data to the United States or other third countries without an adequate level of protection in the context of Census 2021 questionnaire.</p>
<p>If this were your organization, would it be able to weather this storm?</p>
 
 The Fair Weather Cloud 
 
<p>Most organizations have been using cloud services for some time. This has been what could be called “fair weather” use. Where the impact of service failures has been limited. This is revealed by various studies that show only a small proportion of business-critical workloads have been moved to cloud services.</p>
<p>However, the COVID pandemic has accelerated Digital Transformation and cloud usage. This is making organizations much more dependent upon their IT services and the impact of failure has become much higher.</p>
<p>What is needed is a “Cloud for all Seasons” which organizations can exploit today’s complex IT environment to obtain the benefits that cloud services can bring in a secure and compliant manner.</p>
<p>The common business risks from the use of cloud services can be summarized as:</p>
 
 Loss of business continuity – from individual element failures as well as cyber-attacks such as ransomware and denial of service. 
 Data breaches – loss, leakage, or unauthorized access to the applications or data stored or processed within the cloud service. 
 Compliance- results in failure to comply with obligation imposed by laws or regulations. 
 
<p>These arise because the existing internal security and compliance controls do not take account of cloud use. Furthermore, there is often confusion resulting from the way responsibility is shared between the CSP (Cloud Service Provider) and the cloud tenant.</p>
<p></p>
 Inconsistent Governance 
<p>Many business-critical applications now depend upon multiple services from multiple providers. The service levels must be set by business needs - but mapping multiple SLAs is difficult.</p>
<p>In addition, each cloud service provides their own disparate management capabilities and tools. This imposes an extra management burden for each cloud service.</p>
<p>When IT services are delivered on premises the security and management capabilities are chosen by the organization. For cloud services most of the tools and capabilities are specific to the service.</p>
<p>You may also need additional tools such as SASE (Secure Access Service Edge), CASB (Cloud Access Security Brokers) and CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management).</p>
<p>This all leads to a costly and inefficient ad hoc approach to security and management.</p>
<p>Organizations need consistent approach to governance across the delivery models.</p>
 
 Zero Trust Cloud 
 
<p>Can you trust your cloud to protect your data? The Schrems II judgment in July 2020 found that there is a risk because governments are able to override contracts to seize data held in outsourced IT services.</p>
<p>Contracts, Supplementary Contractual Clauses and Binding Corporate Rules are not sufficient protection. <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/sites/edpb/files/consultation/edpb_recommendations_202001_supplementarymeasurestransferstools_en.pdf" title="According to the EDPB">According to the EDPB</a> organizations need to take supplementary technical measures to protect their where it is transferred to a Third Country.</p>
<p>While this judgment applied to personal data – is your <a href="https://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/5122014519132358461949.pdf" title="business-critical data safe">business-critical data safe</a>?</p>
<p>Organizations need to take a Zero Trust approach to cloud services – never trust always protect your data. Confidential computing provides the technology to help with this.</p>
 
 Cloud for All Seasons 
 
<p>Organizations need their cloud usage to be storm proof. This involves not only how you choose the cloud service but also how you govern all of your IT services – however they are delivered. It also requires adoption of common frameworks as well as transparency on the part of the cloud service providers</p>
<p>For more details on this subject attend our <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/2021/07/cloud-strategy-optimization" title="KCLive Cloud Strategy Optimization">KCLive Cloud Strategy Optimization</a> event on July 7th.</p>
<p>During the live event, we will discuss the future workplace trends such as De-Materialization &amp; Anywhere Computing, Workplace-Consumerization, KyE (Know Your Employee), How to Balance Zero Trust requirements with easy access and more.</p>

<p>The state of California recently <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/news/california-launches-new-digital-tool-giving-residents-convenient-access-to-their-covid-19-vaccine-record/">announced their Digital COVID-19 Vaccine Record system</a>. It allows Californians to access a digital copy of their vaccine records, rather than having to depend entirely on their physical copy. The main entry point is a QR code containing a rudimentary Verifiable Claim (VC), which makes for great ease of use. However, Blockchain Commons has concerns over how the user experience (UX) design might negatively affect both privacy and security; we are working to address these with our new <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Gordian QR Tool</a> for the iPhone, Blockchain Commons’ first Apple appstore release.</p>

<p>
For a while now, increasingly personal information has been getting encoded as QRs. During the pandemic, COVID tests were  often stored as QRs. There has also been extensive use of QR codes to transmit secure information across an airgap. Many people first saw this use of QRs when they read a QR code for a two-factor authentication seed into their phone’s Authenticator app. At Blockchain Commons, we similarly use QR codes as an encoding method to transmit seeds and keys.</p>

<p>Some possible architectural issues arise from using QR codes for confidential data, such as the fact that you’re actually transmitting the data (not a proof of the data), that the QRs tend to contain all of the data (not just a selection), and that there’s no way to rescind a QR or expire it. Those issues will have to be dealt with at a foundational level as we figure out what can safely be encoded as a QR — and more importantly how to offer restricted proofs rather than complete information.</p>

<p>However, there are also security &amp; privacy UX issues related to the storage of QR codes that need to be resolved no matter what is encoded. The state of California itself demonstrated the bad habits that we’re already developing when they said in <a href="https://cdt.ca.gov/news/california-launches-new-digital-tool-giving-residents-convenient-access-to-their-covid-19-vaccine-record/">their official press release</a>: “individuals are encouraged to screenshot the information and save it to their phone files or camera roll”.</p>

<p>Now, storing QRs as photos on a phone does meet some minimal security requirements. Most phones are closely held and protected by  a PIN, a thumbprint, or a faceprint. They’re often backed up to a cloud service and that cloud data is mostly secured as well. Still, there are numerous opportunities for problems.</p>

<p>That’s in large part due to the fact that photos are built to be shared. It’s very easy to send a photo to a friend or a social network, which is great for photos, but less so for your QR codes. In addition, photos are built to be synced. Though your data might be relatively safe if it’s synced to the cloud, it’s not that secure when synced to your desktop computer, which is vulnerable to malware and other attacks.</p>

<p>Photos also aren’t built to be searched and their categorization systems are usually rudimentary. Even if your QR code was safe, you might not be able to easily find it.</p>

<p>
That’s where Blockchain Commons’ <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Gordian QR Tool</a> for the iPhone comes in. Though we can only make sure that our own uses of QR codes are architecturally secure, we can definitely provide better ways to store QR codes, and that’s what QR Tool does.</p>

<p>QR Tool lets you scan any QR code into an encrypted vault. It then protects your code with two-factor authentication: you initilally log in with your Apple login and password, and then anytime you want to view your codes, you additionally must use a biometric authentication, such as a fingerprint. Unlike your semi-porous camera roll, QR Tool was built to keep confidential information secure.</p>

<p>QR Tool also provides proof that your codes weren’t changed. Using <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/LifeHash">Lifehash</a> technology, QR Tool links each code to a unique, evocative, and unchanging graphical color representation. This will prove particularly useful when the Lifehash specification is adopted by other companies, so that you can transfer a QR code between applications and verify immediately that it’s the same — something that’s difficult with the QR code alone.</p>

<p>Finally, QR Tool resolves the problem of categorization by automatically recognizing a wide variety of QR codes and giving you the opportunity to change those categorizations as you see fit.</p>

<p>If the future we hope to see more fully featured <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, but there’s no doubt that QRs are with us for the moment, and we need to make sure that they remain secure and easy to use. This is why we released QR Tool. It’s a reference implementation for the Gordian Principles, demonstrating how to store confidential data in a way that’s independent, private, resilient, and open: QR Tool ensures that you hold your own QRs, that they’re safe, and that you can easily transmit them to other services.</p>

<p>If you’ve got QRs of your own to secure, you can purchase QR Tool from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-qr-tool/id1506851070">Apple Store</a> or you can compile it directly from the source code found at the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianQRTool-iOS">QR Tool repo</a> on GitHub.</p>

					 Decentralized Identity opens the doors for safe travel and tourism 
				 
				
			 
				
				
			   
				
				
				
				
					 
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Learn how Indicio and SITA worked together using privacy-preserving technology to reshape contactless health information sharing.  
			   
				
				
				 <p>Proof of testing or vaccination has become central to how we reopen travel to countries, admit visitors, and bring tourism economies back to life. Providing privacy and control for people is the key to establishing public confidence in a system for proving one’s health status.</p>
<p>A digital proof of a Covid negative test or vaccination must be designed to protect individual privacy. It should enable a medical or test center to directly provide that information to an individual—and involve no one else storing or managing their data. It should be tamper proof and incapable of being faked. And it should be easy to download and quick to use.</p>
<p>This is why Indicio.tech, a public benefit corporation that provides decentralized identity software solutions, and SITA, the leading global technology provider for the air transport industry, have used open source, privacy-by-design technology to build a solution that allows airports, airlines, and all elements of the tourist economy to use verifiable digital credentials to safely and securely return to life.</p>
<p>How to reopen travel and tourism and preserve privacy<br>Decentralized identity uses distributed ledger technology, cryptography, and a new way to provide an individual with control of their digital information. This means identity credentials that contain health information are issued directly to that person’s digital wallet, without any handoff to or management by third-parties. Trusted organizations can quickly issue millions of credentials without any of the information they contain being collected and stored in a third-party database.</p>
<p>Then, when the person decides they want&nbsp; to share all or just part of the information, such as the specific details of their test status, the authenticity and original source of that information can be definitively proven. This makes the digital credential compliant with health and data privacy law (HIPAA, GDPR).</p>
<p>The advantages of this decentralized identity ecosystem are that it can:</p>
 
 Replace paper cards with fully digitized identity information 
 Increase efficiency by automating many tasks involved in presenting personal&nbsp; health status 
 Ensure consent and control when sharing personal data 
 Allow a user to select which information they want to disclose while obscuring the rest 
 Enhance security through privacy-by-design, user-friendly digital records, and tamper-evident distributed ledger technology 
 Avoid the problem of fraudulent health cards or paper forms from being presented 
 Scale to include millions of participants, including employees, travelers, and residents, with just a few writes to a public ledger and an inexpensive mobile application 
 Speed recovery of reopening venues and countries 
 
<p>Open and manage public spaces<br>Indicio’s identity ecosystem is built using Cardea, a complete ecosystem for the exchange of privacy-preserving digital credentials, open sourced as a project in Linux Foundation Public Health. Based onHyperledger Indy and Aries open source technology, its flexible design means it can be easily adapted and deployed by any company, government, or organization that needs a privacy preserving digital credential for managing access.</p>
<p>Indicio’s implementation of Cardea for SITA and the Government of Aruba features a mobile interface in the form of a mobile app for users and a second mobile app for use by venues to receive and verify credentials from users. Software called mediator agents and enterprise agents allow for scaling and automation of the credential issuing and verification processes. Distributed ledger technology provides cryptographic assurance that the data within any given credential has not been tampered with or altered.</p>
<p>Cardea’s architecture protects privacy and aids compliance by separating issuers, holders, and verifiers of credentials. Issuers cannot know where credentials were used by those holding them, and verifiers (receivers) of credentials are able to limit the amount of data they receive and retain.</p>
<p>Successful test deployment in Aruba<br>The island of Aruba and global air transport technology provider SITA came to Indicio to create a trusted traveler system that makes it easy for visitors to share their health status privately and securely using their mobile device.</p>
<p>Aruba is focused on finding innovative ways to strengthen its tourism industry while minimizing the risk of Covid-19 infection from visitors. Unlike immunity passports, the verifiable digital credential system from Indicio allows visitors to share a trusted proof of their health status. This trust is possible because the traveler has shared their health status and had it verified by a public health agency.</p>
<p>Once a test result is approved, the traveler is issued a second credential by the public health agency to confirm that they have tested negative. This credential contains no medical data whatsoever and is used only to prove the person’s test status. The Happy Traveler Card, as this credential is called in Aruba, is verified by hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues that the traveler visits. It is an easy way for even their smallest businesses to ensure the safety and health of their guests.<br></p>
 The Happy Traveler Card in action 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Machine readable governance enabled businesses and venues to trust that tourists had been tested on arrival by Aruba’s health department. Visitors using the digital Aruba Happy Traveler Card could be swiftly and reliably verified with a phone app. This freed both businesses and the government from the burden of mechanically collecting data with the attendant risk of error or fraud.</p>
<p>The Cardea ecosystem enables Aruba to move toward a privacy-first approach to supporting their tourism industry, which in 2019 accounted for 98.3% of Aruba’s GDP and supported 47,000 jobs—99% of all employment on the island.</p>
<p>Build on our experience for your solution<br>The tourism and hospitality identity solution for SITA is highly replicable for use cases in any industry and easy to integrate with existing systems. With a professionally staffed global network for verifiable digital credentials supported by many of the leading companies in this space, Indicio is building the future of identity. Open source and interoperable software means your solution is scalable and&nbsp; sustainable. Our expert team of architects and engineers can create and customize a solution quickly for business, governments, and organizations who need a privacy-first identity solution and they can deploy it in weeks.</p>

However the paradox of data sharing is that it generally means the recipient needs the data in order to fulfil an obligation, such as deliver a service, validate identity, deliver a package or customise an experience. <br><br>So the issues are often not about sharing, but about trust and transparency. Helping customers understand why the data is required and providing evidence that it is being used as intended is a great way to establish trust. Another way to boost trust is to focus on designing services that minimise the amount of data collected whilst maximising the value created.





When designing data sharing services, consider how to minimise collection whilst delivering maximum value. It might be as simple as only holding the data for the maximum time needed to complete the service and then sharing evidence that it has been deleted.






 




In this thought provoking interview Raymonde asks about Meeco’s inception, its work so far and recent growth. Some of the the exciting projects discussed include <a href="https://miks-it.com/">mIKs-it, the safe multimedia app for children</a>, developing a decentralised identity and verifiable credentials wallet and how innovators like <a href="https://vela.solutions/">VELA Solutions</a> are transforming workforce management and <a href="https://mylifecapsule.com/">My Life Capsule</a> are helping their customers be prepared for a family emergency.



Other questions and topics covered include:




 




+ How the idea of Meeco was conceived




 




+ Why is there a need for data sharing?




 




+ What is the data sharing lifecycle at Meeco?




 




+ Examples of use cases at Meeco




 




+ What specific licensing or standards to share data are used at Meeco?




 




+ In order to share data proper;y going forward, do we need more or less regulation?




 




+ Where would you see Meeco and ultimately the digital world in 10 years from now?




 




And finally, the most difficult question we weren’t prepared for “What would be the working title of a movie starring Meeco?” to find the answer to this and more click below to listen or watch the interview.

   Google has&nbsp;pre-announced&nbsp;plans to introduce a “safety section” in the Google Play store to help people understand how Android apps, including its own, use the&nbsp;personal data&nbsp;they collect about their users.&nbsp; If this sounds like Google’s answer to&nbsp;Apple’s privacy labels, introduced in December 2020, it is —&nbsp;kind of.&nbsp;Critics&nbsp;say Google’s new feature isn’t a

<p>Google has&nbsp;<a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-safety-section-in-google-play-will.html">pre-announced</a>&nbsp;plans to introduce a “safety section” in the Google Play store to help people understand how Android apps, including its own, use the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>&nbsp;they collect about their users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If this sounds like Google’s answer to&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/12/apple-forces-data-privacy-further-into-the-spotlight/">Apple’s privacy labels</a>, introduced in December 2020, it is —&nbsp;kind of.&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/following-apples-launch-of-privacy-labels-google-to-add-a-safety-section-in-google-play/">Critics</a>&nbsp;say Google’s new feature isn’t a privacy move so much as a justification for why a user can trust an app with their data. As Google puts it, the new section “will help people understand the data an app collects or shares, if that data is secured, and additional details that impact privacy and security”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Google’s not really saying apps shouldn’t collect the data in the first place — which is increasingly Apple’s position, particularly with its new&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/apples-new-att-and-why-facebook-is-hitting-back-hard/">App Tracking Transparency</a>&nbsp;(ATT) feature.</p>



<p>So what can we expect from the Google Play store safety section?&nbsp;At a glance, app developers will be asked to declare:</p>



  What personal data they collect, including users’ names and email addresses, and any information from the device, such as location data, contacts and photos and videos&nbsp;  What they’re using that personal data for — is it for a better user experience or personalized ads, for example?&nbsp;  Any good security and privacy practices they already have in place, such as data encryption or protecting children under Google’s&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.android.com/google-play/guides/families">Families policy</a>  Whether the app needs the data it collects to function or whether users have a choice about their data being shared (as they do on iOS apps through Apple’s new ATT)&nbsp;  Whether the app’s safety section is verified by an independent third&nbsp;party  Whether they will service the user’s right to data deletion requests if the user chooses to uninstall the app.&nbsp;  



<p>As we said, Google’s safety section and Apple’s privacy labels are not really a case of comparing apples with apples (pardon the pun). Critics are&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/06/following-apples-launch-of-privacy-labels-google-to-add-a-safety-section-in-google-play/">saying</a>&nbsp;Apple privacy labels focus on the data apps are collecting for tracking purposes and what’s linked to the end user, whereas Google’s safety section is more about an app’s best practices and trustworthiness in collecting and handling a user’s personal data. While the independent verification on the Google labelling doesn’t happen on Apple’s privacy labelling, it is optional, and it also remains to be seen how rigorous it will be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To us, this is all part of Google’s predictable misunderstanding of what safety means to many people. Yes, it’s about security of data, but Google’s repeated ploy to bait-and-switch a privacy concern into a security solution is missing a big aspect – what companies do themselves and how they share our personal data with other parties. No amount of security-only thinking results in a privacy solution in this case. What’s more, Google going on about the evils of data sharing are moot since they are the biggest data hoarder there is.</p>



<p>Like Apple did when it announced the ATT feature, Google is giving developers plenty of time to get used to the idea. The safety section in Google Play store won’t become mandatory for all apps until Q2 of 2022. In fact,&nbsp;this feels like Google is giving its app developer community longer than Apple did from announcement to required implementation. Perhaps that’s an indirect acknowledgement by Google that the data handling practices of its huge app dev community needs more time?</p>



<p>Once the requirements are mandatory, app developers who don’t comply will face sanctions.</p>



<p>Like all the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/how-will-adtech-face-google-apple-privacy-changes/">privacy changes we’re seeing in the ad tech space</a>&nbsp;lately, consumers will ultimately determine whether this new move from Google goes far enough in protecting their personal data. As iOS apps have seen with the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/only-5-of-us-consumers-want-to-be-tracked-for-ads/">low opt-in rates for cross-app tracking</a>&nbsp;from Apple’s new ATT, Android apps might be in for a rude shock.</p>

 In this post, we’re going to show you how to secure a fast and SQL-y app! 

 First we will need some authentication, which is how we identify

 Bear Management Service Architecture 

<p>What, you expected TodoMVC?</p>

<p>Our app allows authenticated users to register their own bears and view the bear population at large. It consists of two separate services: (1) a front end through which users authenticate with Okta, and (2) a back end that exposes an extensive API for creating and retrieving bears.</p>

 Set Up Okta 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:8080/login/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:8080</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/react/create-okta-application/">Create a React App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Once your new Okta application is created, the Okta CLI will print out its <code>Issuer</code> and <code>Client ID</code> properties:</p>

   <code>$ okta apps create

...

Okta application configuration:
Client Id:     &lt;YOUR CLIENT ID&gt;
Issuer:        https://&lt;YOUR OKTA DOMAIN&gt;/oauth2/default
</code>   

<p>Create a file named <code>.env</code> in the project’s root directory with the following contents:</p>

   <code>CLIENT_ID=&lt;YOUR CLIENT ID&gt;
ISSUER=https://&lt;YOUR OKTA DOMAIN&gt;/oauth2/default
AUDIENCE=api://default
</code>   

<p>After creating the <code>.env</code> file in the project root, symlink it into the <code>okta-hosted-login</code> subdirectory so that both the front end and back end projects have access to the same configuration parameters:</p>

   <code>$ ln -s ../.env okta-hosted-login/.env
</code>   

 Start the React Front End 

<p>In the <code>okta-hosted-login</code> directory, run <code>npm install</code> to install dependencies and then <code>npm start</code> to fire up the React front end.</p>

<p>Once the app is up and running, navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> in your browser. Click the <code>Login</code> button and enter your Okta credentials when prompted. Successfully signing in should redirect you back to your front end, where you’ll be greeted with your name (courtesy of Okta), a ‘Create a new bear’ form, and a list of bears:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The list will be empty because our back end service isn’t running. Let’s change that now.</p>

 Start the FastAPI Back End 

<p>While the React app runs happily in the background, open a new terminal and <code>cd</code> to the project’s root directory. In the root, create and activate a new virtual environment, and then install dependencies:</p>

   <code>python3 -m venv venv &amp;&amp; source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
</code>   

<p>Finally, start the FastAPI server:</p>

   <code>uvicorn app.main:app --reload --reload-dir=app
</code>   

<p>If you reload <code>http://localhost:8080</code>, you should see the list of bears populated with a number of very good bears owned by various members of Example.com, Inc:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Go ahead and create a few new bears of your own.</p>

<p>Our app is now open for business. In fact, it’s  too open. Every authenticated user can see everyone’s bears — even users who have been banned for trying to create koalas. It’s time to put a stop to this madness.</p>

 ABAC, As Easy as 1-2-3 🕺 

<p>Oso is an <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso">open source</a>
authorization system that we’ll use to secure our app. Oso is flexible enough to support <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/python/learn/examples.html">any access control pattern your heart desires</a>, but for this example we’ll focus on <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/python/learn/abac.html">attribute-based access control (ABAC)</a>.</p>

<p>ABAC is all about representing fine-grained or dynamic permissions based on who the user is and their relation to the resource they want to access.</p>

 The Bear Necessities 

<p>First, after pressing Ctrl+C to exit FastAPI, we’re going to install the <code>oso</code> and <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> packages:</p>

   <code>pip3 install oso sqlalchemy-oso
</code>   

<p>Once pip finishes pipping, open up <code>app/main.py</code> using your favorite text editor and make the changes that you see below. The following is a <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff">Git diff</a> of the change — if you’re following along, add the lines that start with a single <code>+</code> symbol to your local copy of <code>app/main.py</code>:</p>

<p>Next, create an empty Oso policy file in the <code>app</code> directory:</p>

   <code>touch app/policy.polar
</code>   

<p>This is where we are going to write all of our authorization logic
using Oso’s declarative policy language called Polar.</p>

<p>Load the new policy file into our Oso instance in <code>app/main.py</code>:</p>

<p>Before we start filling that policy file with authorization rules, we first need to register the application data types that we’re going to use in our authorization policy with Oso. Registering the application types allows us to reference them in our Polar policy as <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/python/reference/polar/polar-syntax.html#specialization">specializers</a>.</p>

<p>We’re going to use the <code>register_models()</code> helper from the <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> library to register our SQLAlchemy models with Oso in bulk. <code>register_models()</code>
registers all descendants of a SQLAlchemy base class with Oso; otherwise, we would have to call <code>oso.register_class()</code> for each individual class that we wanted to register:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Oso is deny-by-default, and we currently have an empty policy file. In the next section, we’ll write our first authorization rule to allow real bear lovers to create real bears.</p>

 Add Your First <code>allow()</code> Rule 

<p>For our first foray into writing a policy, we’re going to use Polar to add a rule that prevents banned users from creating new bears.</p>

<p>Open up <code>app/policy.polar</code> and add the following rule:</p>

 <code>allow(user: User, "create", _bear: BearBase) if
    not user.is_banned;
</code> 

<p>The rule works by matching the inputs provided by the application:</p>

 
   <code>user</code> - an instance of the <code>User</code> class. 
   The action is the string literal <code>"create"</code>. 
   <code>_bear</code> - an instance of the <code>BearBase</code> class. 
 

<p>And then checking that the provided user’s <code>is_banned</code> field is false.
We don’t yet need to check anything further about the <code>bear</code> resource,
so we prefix it with an underscore to indicate that it won’t be referenced in the body of the rule.</p>

<p>NOTE: To learn more about Polar syntax, head on over to <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/learn/policies.html">the Writing Policies guide</a> in <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/">the Oso documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Save the file, flip back to <a href="http://localhost:8080/">localhost:8080</a>, and you should once again be able to create new bears (assuming you haven’t set your own user’s <code>is_banned</code> property to <code>True</code>). All law-abiding bear enthusiasts have had their access restored, and the koala lovers are left out in the cold. (Does it get cold in Australia? We’ll investigate in a future blog.)</p>

 Deal with List Endpoints 

<p><code>oso.is_allowed()</code> worked perfectly for securing the <code>create()</code> endpoint, but it’s not the best tool for the job when it comes to securing <code>index()</code>. The difference is that <code>create()</code> operates over a single record, while <code>index()</code> operates over a potentially very large collection. If performance weren’t an issue, we could load the collection from the database and iterate over it,
calling <code>oso.is_allowed()</code> on every record to filter out unauthorized entries. However, we all know that Zoomers lose interest and click away from your website if it takes longer than a few Planck time units to load, so we need a better solution.</p>

<p>And now, presenting… a better solution. Data filtering! The cure to all of life’s performance issues.</p>

<p>The <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> library is built on top of Oso’s data filtering feature. In a nutshell, the logic engine at the core of the Oso library can turn your authorization policy into a set of constraints similar to the <code>WHERE</code> clauses used to filter records when querying a relational database. The <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code> library then applies those constraints directly to your app’s SQLAlchemy queries. In this way, only authorized records are loaded from the database in an efficient operation instead of loading all records and then iterating over the collection to determine the authorized subset.</p>

<p>Without further ado, let’s wire up our app so that we can efficiently filter some bears.</p>

<p>First, we need to modify <code>app/main.py</code> to import <code>authorized_sessionmaker()</code> from the <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code>
library:</p>

   <code>diff --git a/app/main.py b/app/main.py
index f2a17d0..1fa9573 100644
--- a/app/main.py
+++ b/app/main.py
@@ -9 +9 @@ from oso import Oso
-from sqlalchemy_oso import register_models
+from sqlalchemy_oso import register_models, authorized_sessionmaker
</code>   

<p>Next, we’ll create a new <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/dependencies/">FastAPI dependable</a> that mirrors our existing <code>get_db()</code> function but yields an Oso <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/python/reference/api/sqlalchemy.html#sqlalchemy_oso.session.AuthorizedSession">AuthorizedSession</a> instead of a regular SQLAlchemy <a href="https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/orm/session_api.html#sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session">Session</a>. To do this, add the following code below the <code>get_db()</code> function in <code>app/main.py</code>:</p>

   <code>diff --git a/app/main.py b/app/main.py

<p>Save the file, reload <a href="http://localhost:8080/">localhost:8080</a>, and… no bears. They’re still happily growling away in the database, but we haven’t added any Oso rules permitting access. Let’s change that.</p>

 Flesh Out Your Authorization Policy 

<p>To start off, let’s add a rule to <code>app/policy.polar</code> that permits all users to list all bears:</p>

 <code>allow(_: User, "index", _: Bear);
</code> 

<p>Save the file, reload <a href="http://localhost:8080/">localhost:8080</a>, and you should see every bear again. But something else is missing. The <code>Owner</code> column is empty! When we serialize bear records in the back end, we include the email address for each bear’s owner — a piece of data that comes from our SQLAlchemy-backed <code>User</code> model. Access to <code>User</code> data is now protected by Oso because <code>User</code> is a subclass of the <code>Base</code> SQLAlchemy class we registered via <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code>’s <code>register_models()</code> method. Let’s add one more blanket <code>allow()</code> rule, this time permitting users to view user data at the <code>index()</code> endpoint:</p>

 <code>allow(_: User, "index", _: User);
</code> 

<p>Do the save-and-reload dance, and the <code>Owner</code> column should once again be populated.</p>

<p>Next, let’s add some constraints to our <code>"index"</code> rule for bears so we can see Data Filtering in Action (coming soon from Manning, probably).</p>

<p>Perhaps users should only be allowed to see their own bears:</p>

   <code>diff --git a/app/policy.polar b/app/policy.polar

</code>   

<p>Save, reload, and confirm you can no longer see anyone else’s bears. If you want to see some bears, you’ll need to create them for yourself.</p>

<p>The index view is now private, but it feels wrong to prevent our fellow bear enthusiasts from viewing polar bears, the sweetest and most mild-mannered of all bears. To right that wrong, we can register the <code>Species</code> enum as a constant so that we can reference it in our policy:</p>

 Learn More About Oso, FastAPI, and Python 

<p>In this post, we started out with a very fast and SQL-y application built on FastAPI and SQLAlchemy. We created and configured a new Okta application to handle identity management and authentication for our app. Then we used Oso to add efficient, fine-grained authorization to our back end API.</p>

<p>The full example is available on <a href="https://github.com/osohq/fastapi-sqlalchemy-okta-oso-example">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re up for it, here are a couple exercises to try:</p>

 
   Add roles to the app using <code>sqlalchemy-oso</code>’s <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/python/getting-started/roles/builtin_roles.html">built-in roles</a> feature.
Perhaps every bear lives in a sanctuary, and a user can have a particular
role in each sanctuary, e.g., “Visitor”, “Friend”, or “Shepherd”. 
   Add a “Delete” button next to every bear in the list, and wire up each button to send
a DELETE request to the back end. Secure your new <code>delete()</code> handler with
Oso, and add a rule to the policy that only allows users to delete their own
bears. 
   Join <a href="https://join-slack.osohq.com">our slack</a> and let us know what your favorite bear is and why
it’s the polar bear. 
   Learn more about other use cases of Oso, other languages it supports,
and more in <a href="https://docs.osohq.com/">the Oso documentation</a>.

Immutable, Trustless And Immune To Fraud: The Blockchain Expansion Of Democratic Republicanism<p>Introduction: The Great Fraud: Blockchain’s Rectification</p>Can We Trust Traditional Paradigms Of Ballot Counting For Fair And Equitable Elections Without Blockchain?<p>It has become evident that democratic-republicanism is under-threat by tyranny, despotism and elusive election tampering. Throughout the globe, voter fraud has become a prevalent topic of discussion from major political entities to the citizenry; ballots don’t make results, the counters do. The last three elections within the United States have succumbed to political parties accusing one another of voter fraud, through substantiated and unsubstantiated claims; how can we rectify such a broken paradigm that threatens republicanism, blockchain is the&nbsp;answer.</p><p>Blockchain technology is an immutable system that is immune to fraud and provides users with an innovation that is highly secured, decentralized and anonymized with audible chains of records. Blockchain technology has revolutionized and transformed numerous different industries which include supply-chains, escrow, invoices, healthcare, crowdfunding and cloud storages etc. and now it is time for blockchain to perpetuate the ethos of democracy as the catalyst of the demise of voter fraud. Blockchain in its purest of forms and most simplistic of terms is a digital ledger that is peer-to-peer that mitigates the avaristic intent of centralized entities. Encryption makes these records incorruptible and easy to verify. Voters can utilize blockchain and can be assured that their vote will not be tampered with and simultaneously, their vote stays anonymous; this is the true ethos and incorruptible paradigm of voting that should become the foundational bedrock of republicanism. This dynamic change in transparency surrounding voting is incumbent for democracy to expand and flourish into the 21st century, especially with ongoing investigations surrounding voter-fraud, not just in the United States, but throughout the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Aergo’s Understanding And Desire To Decimate Voter Fraud: The Pikkle Construction</p>Pikkle Is The First Blockchain Voting Mechanism On The Aergo Platform: Enhancing Global Participation Of Transparent Blockchain Voting<p>Pikkle is the first of its kind; built on the Aergo platform by Blocko, Aergo’s technology partner and utilized by the Korean Broadcasters Association, Pikkle aims to resolve a variety of dilemma’s that plague traditional voting paradigms and mechanisms. Pikkle resolves issues such as cost inefficiencies, resolving voter processes that creates substantial costs that coincide with targeting voters, identity verification, ballot counts and check lists. Pikkle aims to mend the public trust of voting paradigms which, throughout the world, many voters have lost confidence in voting mechanisms because of the continuous onslaught and investigations of voter fraud. Pikkle ensures that trust is consolidated back into the consciousness of the populace; unfortunately, since the advent of social media, it has become evident that votes can be easily manipulated and influenced for the platforms own self-interest. We saw this occur consistently among some of the most prominent social media platforms during the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections within the United States. With voter fraud corrupting democracy, one must ask, are we in a democracy, or a democracy masked by corruptible despotism; it is not power that corrupts, but it is magnetic to the corruptible and Pikkle aims to change this&nbsp;notion.</p><p>The Korean Broadcasters Association aims to utilize Pikkle as the standardized go-to platform for reliable voting services for all users involved. Pikkle collects users information and views and assists in decision making through an application service rather than traditional cold-calling and text voting spams. Pikkle resolves voter fraud by storing data-components of voters such as identification of voters and voting results utilizing blockchain technology; an immutable digital ledger that cannot be hacked, tampered with or corrupted, unlike traditional voting systems. Convenience has become a crucial component of almost every single part of our daily lives so Pikkle encourages the seamless usage of QR codes to participate in voting actions, insured by the public and private trust of blockchain technology. Centralized entities have attempted to garner similar approaches, but since the public trust in these entities has waned over the last fifteen years, it is evident that an app like Pikkle can replace traditional voting mechanisms. Through the utilization of blockchain technology, stake-holders, companies, governmental organizations, criminal enterprises and political parties can no-longer shake the foundational bedrock of pure democracy, and Pikkle emphasizes and embodies such a notion. The app’s identity verification service, which eliminates the need for a physical ticket, enables efficient and easy entry into cultural events and festivals, a hallmark of South Korean tradition. Fun fact, the word Pikkle derives itself from two words “pick” and “people”, the people pick the electoral incumbents, not the despots and politicians.</p><p>The Korean Broadcasters Association: Blocko And Aergo: Unified Under The Consciousness Of Mending Public Voter&nbsp;Trust</p>Mending Public Trust Through Blockchain Voting Platforms: The Pikkle&nbsp;Paradigm<p>On April 23rd, The Korean Broadcasters Association, Blocko and Aergo signed an MOU to ensure the practical application and construction of a blockchain based audience participation application and voting system. The Korean Broadcasters Association is an organization that is almost half a century old with an aim to unify South Korea through domestic terrestrial broadcasts. The Korean Broadcasters Association has worked with the largest broadcasting stations in all of South Korea which include joint ventures when counting exit polls alongside the KBS, MBC and SBS. Through offering various cooperation to provide the 40 members with high quality and diverse broadcasting services, the KBA is continuously trying its best. The KBA intends on utilizing Pikkle for a variety of services which include, but are not limited to, media content and voting systems to select winners for Korea Broadcasting Prizes and the Seoul International Drama Awards on the Aergo platform. Blocko also plays a crucial role in the development and expansion of Pikkle as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Blocko is Aergo’s main technology partner that was established in 2014 and has worked with some of the largest institutions in all of South Korea which include the Bank of Korea, Financial Security Agency, Shinhan Financial Group, Hyundai Motor Group and many more. It is incumbent to reference that Blocko is South Korea’s largest blockchain infrastructure provider that has built blockchain based services for financial, political and public institutions throughout the nation. Blocko has commercialized enterprise blockchain platforms based off of Aergo, an open-sourced hybrid blockchain protocol powered by the native cryptocurrency AERGO optimized for hybrid deployments for public and private institutions.</p><p>Conclusion: Mending Democracy: The Pikkle Mission Confirmed</p>Pikkle Aims To Integrate With Broadcasting Systems And Festivals By Q3 Of This Year And Intends To Launch NFT’s Next&nbsp;Year<p>It is evident that the public trust of traditional voting mechanisms has all but collapsed over the last decade. Aergo comprehended this notion and seeks to rectify public trust themselves through the utilization of Pikkle on a consolidated frontier between Aergo, Blocko and the Korean Broadcasters Association. Pikkle is the first of its kind surrounding blockchain voting, enabling immutable and incorruptible data to be stored on the blockchain which has the ability to rectify our globally broken electoral system. Blockchain technology can transform democracy, and Pikkle can perpetuate its transcendence.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/digitized-voting-democratized-the-aergo-blockchain-voting-paradigm-df70da14e2d">Digitized Voting Democratized: The Aergo Blockchain Voting Paradigm</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 GiD Report#165 — Everything you need to know about new FTC chief Lina&nbsp;Khan <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-164-what-apples-missing-about-digital-identity-1d587693e285">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The 20-something Yale student that made antitrust cool  What people are&nbsp;saying  What it means for Big&nbsp;Tech  Everything Lina Khan + Big&nbsp;Tech  What people think about Big Tech platforms  Chart of the&nbsp;week  BONUS: Every platform is Clubhouse now  Stuff happens   1. The 20-something Yale student that made antitrust cool Photo: Lexey Swall / linamkhan.com<p>Lina Khan shot to unlikely national recognition after the publication of her seminal work while still at Yale, <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox">Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox</a>. An overnight sensation, the paper helped reframe decades of consensus around antitrust frameworks — which at the time were formulated around pricing. Instead, we should focus on structural power, Lina&nbsp;argued.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/technology/monopoly-antitrust-lina-khan-amazon.html">the NYTimes</a> back in&nbsp;2018:</p><blockquote>Over 93 heavily footnoted pages, [Lina Khan] presented the case that the company should not get a pass on anticompetitive behavior just because it makes customers happy. Once-robust monopoly laws have been marginalized, Ms. Khan wrote, and consequently Amazon is amassing structural power that lets it exert increasing control over many parts of the&nbsp;economy.</blockquote><blockquote>Amazon has so much data on so many customers, it is so willing to forgo profits, it is so aggressive and has so many advantages from its shipping and warehouse infrastructure that it exerts an influence much broader than its market share. It resembles the all-powerful railroads of the Progressive Era, Ms. Khan wrote: “The thousands of retailers and independent businesses that must ride Amazon’s rails to reach market are increasingly dependent on their biggest competitor.”</blockquote><p>Lina, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/technology/monopoly-antitrust-lina-khan-amazon.html">at the&nbsp;time</a>:</p><blockquote>“As consumers, as users, we love these tech companies,” she said. “But as citizens, as workers, and as entrepreneurs, we recognize that their power is troubling. We need a new framework, a new vocabulary for how to assess and address their dominance.”</blockquote><p>Thanks to Lina’s paper and her ability to bring newfound attention to an old challenge, new frameworks and vocabularies have been bubbling below the surface over the last few&nbsp;years.</p><p>In that time, our stance on Big Tech has rapidly shifted. From being darlings of capitalism and innovation, we now view the corporate titans that control our digital world with a heightened sense of skepticism.</p><p>Our political leaders have taken the hint. The issue of monopoly power is, today, a bipartisan issue — though sometimes for different reasons.</p> 2. What people are&nbsp;saying <p>Now, 32, Lina Khan is the new chair of the&nbsp;FTC.</p><p><a href="https://www.axios.com/lina-khan-will-chair-federal-trade-commission-c7ea8e06-25de-4d8d-b188-2297169cd3fa.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Why it matters: Khan, an antitrust expert well-known for her ideas for applying competition law to the tech industry, is sure to spook tech platforms.</blockquote><blockquote>Khan, 32 years old, is a hero to critics of tech who want to see the government act more aggressively against what they see as anti-competitive behavior from companies like Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57501579">BBC</a>:</p><blockquote>Worryingly for Big Tech too, a number of bipartisan bills have also been put forward in Congress to rein in the power of Big Tech. That there are Democrats and Republicans who support antitrust action makes her position even more powerful.</blockquote><blockquote>Ms Khan’s appointment is the clearest sign yet that President Biden means business when it comes to clipping the wings of companies like Amazon and&nbsp;Apple.</blockquote><p>Wired in a piece titled, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/government-finally-moving-at-speed-of-tech/">The US Government Is Finally Moving at the Speed of&nbsp;Tech</a>:</p><blockquote>The result is that we find ourselves living in a world that looks very different from the one we were living in just a few years ago. New antitrust cases against tech giants are popping up left and right, keeping the issue firmly in the public consciousness. The companies are devoting unprecedented sums toward lobbying, advocacy, and advertising to try to avert a crackdown. And in the sharpest break with the past, Congress and the White House are taking concrete steps to restructure markets that have been left to their own devices for two and a half&nbsp;decades.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s all so much, so fast, that it’s hard to keep track of the various subplots. The introduction of the five House antitrust bills and the elevation of Khan to FTC chair, for example, look like two separate stories. But they’re really two parts of the same story: Khan was herself the key investigator behind the House antitrust subcommittee’s investigation of Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google, begun in 2019. The bills introduced last week are the fruits of that investigation. (While the time between the start of the investigation and the release of legislative proposals has felt like an eternity to those of us who follow this closely, it wouldn’t be bad for a Silicon Valley product launch. It took Amazon three years to bring the Kindle to&nbsp;market.)</blockquote><p>Matt Stoller, <a href="https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/the-antitrust-revolution-has-found">The Antitrust Revolution Has Found Its&nbsp;Leader</a>:</p><blockquote>Khan is something rare in progressive politics, someone with academic credentials and mastery over a dense technical subject, but also connected with a broad-based populist social movement that crosses partisan lines. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve spoken to in business, Republicans as well as Democrats, who talk in reverential tones about Khan. It’s not just that she is an important thinker, it’s that she *understands* what they are going through, the coercive power they are up against. And that’s because she got her start understanding the economy not in a classroom or at a law firm, but as a business journalist, listening to business people and workers facing monopolists.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>To call this appointment remarkable understates the point. That Khan is on the commission, with Republican votes, is surprising enough, but for her to be Chair is downright shocking. It’s too soon to know what Khan is going to do in her new role, but her appointment is already sending shock waves in the enforcement community globally. Antitrust policy is run by a small yet international community of lawyers and economists who know each other. In every country, some of them are cheering this move, while others are horrified. But they all know it matters, because as goes the U.S. on antitrust, so goes&nbsp;Europe.</blockquote> 3. What it means for Big&nbsp;Tech <p>For one, they’re on high alert. Here’s <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/big-tech-s-uneasy-future">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>And on Tuesday, tech stocks barely flinched at the news. But Khan’s arrival is likely to put Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft on the defensive in a way the past few years of heated anti-tech rhetoric have&nbsp;not.</blockquote><blockquote>That’s because Khan’s appointment to lead the agency, one of two antitrust enforcers in the U.S. along with the Justice Department, poses perhaps the most serious threat yet. Although she is just one person on a five-member commission, as chair she will set the enforcement and policy priorities for the agency. That could very well mean an antitrust case against Amazon, given her law school paper outlining the antitrust problems with the online retailer. A Khan-led FTC also is likely to bring enforcement actions to rein in not just the technology sector, but corporate America writ&nbsp;large.</blockquote><p>We’ll be watching to see how Lina Khan intends to leverage her new position of power. But it’s worth noting that antitrust is about a lot more than just trust busting — say, forcing Facebook to break up Instagram and WhatsApp. As Greg has mentioned in the past, the cat’s out of the&nbsp;bag.</p><p>Instead, we could see new rules around key issues such as interoperability and portability — <a href="https://www.project-disco.org/privacy/061721-tech-regulatory-overhaul-series-the-excess-of-access/">including this recently introduced bill</a> (via&nbsp;/m):</p><blockquote>This post assesses H.R. 3849, the “Augmenting Compatibility and Competition by Enabling Service Switching (ACCESS) Act of 2021” introduced by Representatives Scanlon (D-PA) and Owens (R-UT). The bill would impose sweeping requirements on specific covered platforms to build new technical interfaces to transfer data to competitors and potential competitors and to enable interoperability between their services.</blockquote><p>Here’s Mitja on the subject, comparing it to when telco companies finally allowed phone number portability:</p><blockquote>This bill might end Facebook’s monopoly, but one of the interesting and important things to note is interoperability which enables users to switch from one social network to&nbsp;another.</blockquote><blockquote>In this case, “switch” could be defined similarly to when the UsSs government forced wireless companies to let you take your phone number with you when you switch carriers — a similar move may be called on social networks to let you take your identity and social content and transfer it elsewhere.</blockquote><p>With Lina, anything’s on the table. But these are early days and she still has her work cut out for her, as WIRED reminds&nbsp;us:</p><blockquote>None of this is to say that the movement to break up Big Tech, or rein it in, or whichever bumper sticker you prefer, has achieved victory. The legislative agenda in particular remains a long shot until proven otherwise. While it’s noteworthy that the bills have bipartisan support within the House antitrust subcommittee, they might not have enough to clear the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, even in altered form. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy has already come out in opposition, and even those Senate Republicans who might be sympathetic have yet to publicly support the agenda. (Even if the bills become law, there’s no guarantee they will achieve the desired results.) Ted Cruz, who appears to revel in browbeating social media executives as much as anyone, voted against Khan’s confirmation. So did Mike Lee, the ranking Republican member of the Senate antitrust subcommittee.</blockquote><blockquote>But even if legislation stalls, Khan’s overwhelming confirmation — she received support from 21 Republican senators — means change is coming to the FTC. Several experts have argued that the agency has enormous, mostly untapped power to structure markets. Two of those experts now make up two-thirds of the commission’s Democratic majority: Khan and her former boss, Rohit Chopra, who last year published an article arguing for the agency to use its authority to issue rules about unfair competition, rather than relying exclusively on litigation. They now have an opportunity to put that theory into practice.</blockquote> 4.

Chart of the&nbsp;week <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-industrys-glory-days-in-washington-are-over-11623936187?mod=djem10point">WSJ</a>:</p><blockquote>“In the last four or five years, the pendulum has swung in an overly dramatic fashion from ‘tech can do no wrong’ to ‘tech can do no right,’ ” said Adam Kovacevich, who spent 12 years as one of Google’s top lobbyists. He now leads a new tech group called Chamber of Progress aimed at wooing back Democrats.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>As five House tech bills came together this month, lobbyists for the companies that would be most affected said they were frozen out of the process and that the lawmakers did everything they could to keep drafts of the proposals out of their&nbsp;hands.</blockquote><blockquote>“The industry was very much treated as the enemy, and one to be isolated,” one lobbyist said. As a result, the bills are tougher on the industry than if lawmakers had sought their input to craft something that they could&nbsp;support.</blockquote> 7.

 Encoding Trust that Travels with Data — A New Product Introduction Case Study Powered by Solutions Design with Transmute  This case study describes supply chain innovation work completed by <a href="https://www.gs1.org/">GS1</a>, <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/">GS1 US</a>, and <a href="https://gs1ca.org/">GS1 Canada</a> and <a href="http://transmute.industries">Transmute</a> during the second half of&nbsp;2021. <p>About <a href="http://www.gs1.org">GS1</a>: GS1 is a neutral, not-for-profit organisation that develops and maintains the most widely used global standards for efficient business communication. GS1 is best known for the barcode, named by the BBC as one of “the 50 things that made the world economy”. GS1 standards improve the efficiency, safety and visibility of supply chains across physical and digital channels in 25 sectors. GS1’s scale and reach — local Member Organisations in 115 countries, 2 million user companies and 6 billion transactions every day — help ensure that GS1 standards create a common language that supports systems and processes across the globe. Find out more at <a href="http://www.gs1.org">www.gs1.org</a></p><p>About <a href="https://www.transmute.industries/">Transmute</a>: Transmute is a US-based technology company that uses next generation identity and credentialing technologies to provide comprehensive solution design and software to define, digitize, and share verifiable data at scale. Transmute partners with innovative enterprises and governments to build digital trust ecosystems where this data can be securely exchanged across diverse stakeholders and technology vendors. Transmute specializes in trusted information about global supply chain products, actors, and transactions.</p> Project Overview <p>In 2021, GS1 and Transmute worked together to test the business and technical feasibility of combining <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/industries/emerging-topics/gs1-digital-link">GS1 standards</a> with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> for product-related claims.There was mutual interest in moving from theory to practice to illustrate the tangible value of leveraging Verifiable Credentials for creating trust that travels with&nbsp;data.</p><p>This project was guided by these key questions:</p>  How can GS1 create trust that travels with data by issuing authoritative information about companies and products?  How might <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/industries/emerging-topics/gs1-digital-link">GS1 Digital Link</a>, Verifiable Credential, and Decentralized Identifier standards be leveraged together to create business value related to product&nbsp;claims?  <p>Through our collaboration we discovered particular value in the area of new product introduction — or the process of procuring new products as a retailer. As consumers we rarely think about how the things we buy arrived on the physical (or virtual) shelf. Behind the scenes it can take months for retailers and brands to establish relationships, validate products, complete distribution, and ensure quality before making those goods available to consumers. We found multiple opportunities to improve the speed and security of these processes by leveraging Verifiable Credentials in conjunction with GS1 standards and identifiers.</p> Solutions Design Process: GS1 + Transmute Collaboration <p>Our companies worked through a step-wise approach to move from broad theory to a targeted application of our combined technologies for new product introduction.</p><p>Collaborative working sessions including GS1 experts and the Transmute team were conducted over several months to identify the most feasible and impactful possibilities. We drew from the international standards, supply chain, and technical expertise of GS1 team members. Transmute combined this information with our decentralized technologies expertise to propose specific credentials, workflows, and businesses narratives to address the product claims focus. These solutions are technically supported by the Transmute platform and open source libraries.</p><p>Our group went through multiple iterations as a part of early solution design work. This stage includes detailed business narratives for a variety of supply chain use cases, workflow mapping, brand interviews, sample credentials, and early prototypes, culminating in a Solution Design Report. This phase of work ultimately drove the narrowed focus to the new product introduction use case as the highest value opportunity for illustration of immediate industry&nbsp;value.</p><p>Next we built a Proof-of-Concept demonstration — including an interactive prototype and technical libraries — to show how these credentials can be issued, exchanged and verified seamlessly across brands. You can see the prototype in action&nbsp;here:</p> New Product Introduction Description <p>The following written description provides further detail about the business story portrayed in the video above. If you already watched the video you can also jump to the subsequent section.</p><p>Brand Healthy Tots wants to sell its natural baby food products for the first time with retailer Sell Anything &amp; Everything (SA&amp;E). SA&amp;E will start by selling the Healthy Tots product in its online store, with the future possibility of also selling it in brick and mortar locations.</p><p>Typically new product onboarding is a lengthy process, requiring submission of PDF documentation and requesting data from a variety of parties, often leading to duplicated costs and effort. These documents and sites are also very easy to fake, giving false confidence in product&nbsp;claims.</p><p>Healthy Tots provides SA&amp;E with verifiable evidence of its GLN and the product GTINs, and the process kicks off instantly. SA&amp;E uses the <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/industries/emerging-topics/gs1-digital-link">GS1 Digital Link</a> resolver to immediately discover locations of all related product information. SA&amp;E’s system can then request relevant information from the associated locations, providing evidence where needed that it is authorized to do so. For example, it is able to request third party issued organic certification, allergen information, and product&nbsp;images.</p><p>SA&amp;E receives this information in the form of Verifiable Credentials signed by the original issuing parties, and is able to confidently populate the new product listing. SA&amp;E can do so automatically because the issuer of the information can be identified and confirmed, allowing data they issue to be passed through relatively unknown or untrusted parties like Healthy Tots systems. The SA&amp;E system can even automatically check that the issuing parties possess appropriate accreditations and/or GLNs to make sure such statements about the product are authoritative. This includes going all the way back to GS1 Global as a root of&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Healthy Tots can fill in any additional product details that SA&amp;E needs, and the product can be listed for sale within minutes. Relevant pieces of verifiable information such as certified organic and allergen information can also be passed through to the consumer’s view, providing deeper confidence in the legitimacy of the product and associated accreditations.</p> Testing Business&nbsp;Benefits <p>This novel approach to sharing product data can lead to the following benefits:</p>  Reduced administrative burden and faster timeline from engagement to product on&nbsp;shelves.  Automation for the retailer, working with hundreds or even thousands of vendors and tens of thousands of products. This protects brand reputation and allows elevation to human review when risk is detected.  Unambiguous documentation requirements that meet regulatory needs and further speed up processes.  More broadly, an encoded process for establishing trust in data that persists across systems, data pools, and unknown intermediaries.  <p>One of the next steps for this work is deeper testing of these benefits to measure cost savings, efficiency gains and strategic insight.</p> Building Trusted Ecosystems with&nbsp;GS1 <p>The demo scenario is underpinned by GS1 as a root of trust in the network — continuing a rich history for GS1 in this role. GS1 licenses and identifiers are and will continue to be at the foundation of trusting products and companies. Combining current practices with verifiable credential, decentralized identifier, and <a href="https://www.gs1us.org/industries/emerging-topics/gs1-digital-link">GS1 Digital Link</a> standards disambiguating products builds business reputation for just-in-time engagement while keeping information up to&nbsp;date.</p><p>We believe that institutions like GS1 are critical in paving the foundations for trusted data to move across ecosystems in the future. Ultimately, trust has to flow from one or more sources whose reputation allows businesses to act with confidence. The advantage of the approach taken in this POC is that the distance between verifiers and root-of-trust organizations can be much greater without losing confidence in the information being presented. As long as the chain of trust retains integrity, the possibilities are&nbsp;endless.</p> Next Steps <p>This new product introduction demonstration is now being used to test, validate, break, and refine assumptions about how the involved standards and technologies can best be leveraged to generate value for individual businesses and the broader ecosystem.</p><blockquote>“GS1 is moving forward with work to extend existing standards in order to better support the evolving needs of our member companies and create a consistent, common path forward for the scale of digital credentials.” — Melanie Nuce, Senior Vice President, Innovation and Partnerships, GS1&nbsp;US</blockquote><blockquote>“Verifiable Credentials are an exciting opportunity for GS1 to extend its identification system, improve data quality, and secure the supply chain in ways never before possible.” — Kevin Dean, Special Projects Consultant, GS1&nbsp;Canada</blockquote><p>Transmute is working with customers to continue designing, building, and growing digital trust ecosystems — from Solution Design work to bringing businesses onto the Transmute Platform to experience issuance, exchange, and verification of Verifiable Credentials integrated with existing business infrastructure.

 The once fictional concept of a “Metaverse” is fast becoming a reality — and Ontology is set to be an integral part of this evolving ecosystem. <p>The term metaverse combines the prefix “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta">meta</a>” (meaning “beyond”) with “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe">universe</a>”. The Metaverse refers to a collective, virtual space, encompassing the totality of virtual worlds, augmented realities, and the internet. The concept originates in Snow Crash, a science-fiction novel by Neil Stephenson depicting a futuristic world in which people operate virtual avatars in an online world known as the Metaverse.</p><p>The kind of metaverse imagined by Stephenson is yet to be realized in the real world. However, the building blocks of a potential future Metaverse are already beginning to appear. Considering recent developments in science and technology, we can roughly define the Metaverse as: the next generation internet based on XR (including VR, AR, and MR), computer technology, internet communication technology, and social networks. More broadly, the Metaverse is a virtual reality world representing ‘real’ world experiences, such as working, studying, and investing. Users can transition freely between the offline and online&nbsp;realm.</p><p>A widely accepted definition of the Metaverse comes from Dave Baszucki, CEO of Roblox. He outlines eight characteristics of the Metaverse, which include: identity, friends, immersion, low latency, diversity, anytime and anywhere, economy and civilization. Based on this outline, we explore the contributions Ontology expects to make to the Metaverse of the&nbsp;future.</p> Identity <p>In the era of Big Data, unprecedented amounts of information can be stored and shared. This has enabled the growth of online encyclopedias, video streaming services, and social networks. Such technologies allow information to be accessed globally. But due to their scale, they are vulnerable to attack from bad actors aiming to obtain private information, a commodity that has become increasingly valuable in the digital&nbsp;age.</p><p>Centralized organizations such as Facebook and Google control the identities, data and assets, of their users. The accumulated data are used to create targeted advertising campaigns. Platforms owned by the likes of Facebook are ostensibly free to use, with users sacrificing their privacy for the convenience that comes with using them. Most platforms require users to register a separate account for each platform, meaning each user may operate many accounts simultaneously.</p><p>To return to the concept of a Metaverse, how can we develop a system allowing users to migrate between parts of the Metaverse with a consistent identity, whilst ensuring their data and privacy are respected? Ontology’s “ONT ID”, a decentralized identity (DID) framework, and “OScore”, a self-management scoring system, aim to do just&nbsp;that.</p><p>ONT ID is a decentralized identity framework based on the W3C decentralized identifier specification, blockchain and cryptography. It can quickly identify and connect people, assets, objects, and events, with the characteristics of decentralization, self-management, privacy protection, security, and usability. In short, ONT ID is not governed by any centralized authority, and allows users to securely manage their identities and data, independently.</p><p>At the same time, Ontology’s DDXF (Distributed Data Exchange Framework), provides a decentralized way to exchange data, which collaborates with ONT ID to improve users’ privacy protection. In addition, OScore generates scores for users based on their on-chain data, which they can authorize third parties to access. Users can also bind their OScore data and off-chain data using ONT ID, in order to seamlessly transition between the on-chain world and the off-chain world.</p><p>ONT ID, DDXF and OScore, are all central features of Ontology’s decentralized solutions, designed to allow users to manage their identity, data and assets, independently, in a decentralized way. Based on the interoperability and verifiability of decentralized identity, our solutions not only solve the pain points of social trust, but also enrich the whole trust ecosystem.</p><p>Ontology’s ONT ID is equipped for the Metaverse of the future, allowing users to easily traverse different environments within the Metaverse, in addition to enabling migration in and out of the virtual world. Whether online or offline, trust is an integral feature of a functioning society. OScore, the credit review system, bolsters trust and reliability when transacting, benefitting both individuals and organizations alike.</p> Economy <p>In the Metaverse economy, users can earn wealth through work, education, investment, and trade. By doing so, the whole ecosystem expands. However, it’s worth noting that this kind of ecosystem is not closed-loop. The Metaverse is not a purely virtual world. It must be closely connected with the real world, in order to realize its potential. Users can earn money not only by working in the real world, but also by playing games in the virtual world. These two kinds of assets are highly liquid and contribute to the overarching ecosystem.</p><p>Ontology is not only engaged in research and technological development. It is also dedicated to launching blockchain-based products that build connections between online and offline ecosystems. In the service sector, Ontology has partnered with<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/on-the-move-new-adoption-of-ontology-in-the-new-energy-logistics-vehicle-industry-9f46c1da0c4"> Kai Yun Delivery</a>, a comprehensive logistics service provider focusing on urban transportation and terminal-end deliveries. Kai Yun provides data attestation solutions, implementing the business scenario of “online consumption + instant delivery”, and empowers the new energy vehicle industry by solving the problem of low efficiency and high cost. In the field of digital assets, Ontology provides technology support for <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/250-million-pieces-of-ogq-digital-asset-content-to-be-housed-on-the-ontology-blockchain-428d385092ba">OGQ</a>, a leading digital assets and content platform in South Korea, helping content creators protect their copyrighted material. In the mobile and travel industry, Ontology and Daimler Mobility AG Blockchain Factory, which was established to bring the benefits of blockchain innovation and application to the automotive finance and mobility industry, jointly developed the “<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/daimler-mobility-partners-with-ontology-to-leverage-high-performance-technologies-and-transform-b469aa46e671">Welcome Home</a>” application. The app integrates cutting-edge technologies such as digital identity to bring a new driving experience to car&nbsp;drivers.</p><p>Finally, in the field of job recruitment, Ontology has successfully integrated its cross-chain wallet, <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a>, into global freelancing marketplace leader, <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-microworkers-partner-to-enhance-global-freelancing-marketplaces-adef34dbe2f9">Microworkers</a>, providing more economic opportunities to freelancers. Based on information such as resume matching and job intention, freelancers establish labor relations with recruiting companies. After they complete the work, companies can compensate freelancers with ONT or other tokens, according to the contract. Candidates can use ONTO to transfer the received digital assets to their wallet address or personal assets terminals. During this process, ONG serves as the gas fee. This is Ontology’s dual token model. Such a model can be applied online and offline, acting as a circular token in the economic system of Metaverse, helping to enrich the ecosystem.</p><p>In addition to the economic and ID-based solutions, mentioned above, the Metaverse can also benefit from blockchain technology on other&nbsp;levels.</p>  Low latency: Relative to the high fees and congestion that has become the norm on Ethereum, the transaction confirmation rate on Ontology is very fast. On Ethereum, the average transaction cost is tens of US dollars, with some transactions costing over $100. However, on the Ontology chain, each transaction only consumes 0.05 ONG (equivalent to $0.05). At the same time, Ontology has been continuously researching the latest Layer 2 technology. Ontology is exploring the possibility of integrating with Ethereum Layer 2 solutions and is committed to overcoming the technical barriers between Ontology and Ethereum. Ontology hopes Ethereum users can enjoy the same high-efficiency and low-fees as Ontology users. This coincides with the low latency attribute of the Metaverse. Whether in the real world or the virtual world, transaction speed greatly affects the user experience.  Diversity: On the Ontology chain, users can create multiple ONT IDs to log in on different terminals, based on their specific needs. For example, you can use different ONT IDs to independently manage ONTO and Wing or, if you prefer, you can use the same ONT ID for both. Whether in real life or in the Metaverse, you can generate multiple identities based on your own needs. The diversity of ONT ID is consistent with the diverse nature of the Metaverse. A variety of identities enrich the virtual world’s ecosystem and greatly enhance the sense of immersion.  Anytime and Anywhere: ONTO is a decentralized identity mobile terminal. It provides an all-in-one service for management of decentralized identities and data. Wherever you are, you can manage your assets, data and identities, in the palm of your hand. This kind of portability is indispensable in the Metaverse.  Civilization: The Metaverse originates in the human imagination. Blockchain is the underlying technology that will enable the Metaverse to become reality. Since its inception, Ontology has been developing blockchain technologies such as DID and data management tools, aiming to contribute to the global advancement of science and technology. At the same time, Ontology also hopes to inspire more people to participate in the blockchain revolution by developing new technologies and fostering a global community.  <p>Ontology is committed to accelerating the arrival of the coming Metaverse via the research and development of blockchain and further upgrades to its decentralized identity and data solutions.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

  <p>Organizations around the world have been rapidly modernizing their access management infrastructures in response to increased cyber-attacks and data breaches, enactment of security and privacy regulations, and a shift to remote working.</p>
<p>Access management modernization is quick shift away from insecure passwords, which time and again facilitate criminals to gain access to corporate networks and data. A recent survey on the <a href="https://www.insightsforprofessionals.com/en-us/it/security/the-psychology-of-passwords-neglect-is-helping-hac/download" title="Psychology of Passwords">Psychology of Passwords</a> found that 59% of the respondents use the same password repeatedly, at home and in the office. The main reason behind this dangerous trend is the fear of forgetting the login information.</p>
<p>It is therefore time for businesses to evolve their approach to identity proofing to mitigate the risks of an increasingly remote workforce. As the corporate boundaries disintegrate, organizations require a new defensive playbook to address emerging business risk and remain secure.</p>
 A Zero-Trust approach to risk mitigation 
<p>When the concept of Zero-Trust was first conceived, it was about zero trust networks. However, today and in the future, corporate users and partners are accessing data through a plethora of networks – corporate, private, mobile. Hence, it is not efficient to discuss about securing access networks – it is almost impossible to do so.</p>
<p>The security perimeter of corporate assets had to shift to another frontline. The evolution of Zero-Trust is about securing the access points to apps and data. Since everyone is literally an outsider in cloud environments, there is a need to “never trust, always verify” the identity of the individual or the device requesting access to data and apps.</p>
<p>While Zero-Trust is not a single technology solution, it is the paradigm that can assist businesses support securely requirements for accessing a “constellation” of apps and data from everywhere. By validating the identity of the individual or device at every access point, organizations can mitigate the threats introduced by the proliferation of multi-cloud and hybrid computing environments and secure their digital transformation initiatives.</p>
<p></p>
 Access management trends towards a Zero-Trust future 
<p>As technology evolves, organizations can evolve their access security to meet the increasing demands of cloud computing and pave their path towards a Zero-Trust culture. Businesses need to be aware of the various emerging trends on access management, evaluate them and tailor them to their business needs.</p>
<p>According to many security experts, the following trends will shape the access management and security ecosystem:</p>
 
 Identity-first security - Now that organizations operate fully (or mostly) remote, this trend has become vital to address. The result of these technical and culture shifts is that “identity first security” now represents the way all information workers will function, regardless of whether they are remote or at their office. 
 Managing machine identities as a critical security capability - As digital transformation progresses, organizations are experiencing increased numbers of non-human entities – containers, apps, services, mobile devices – IoT devices. Managing machine identities has become a vital part of the security strategy. As the number of devices increases, establishing an enterprise-wide strategy for managing machine identities, certificates and secrets will enable the organization to better secure digital transformation. 
 
<p>Shared security model in the cloud will be the defining factor for managing access requests. The old security model of “inside means trusted” and “outside means untrusted” has been broken since most digital assets and devices are outside the enterprise, as are most identities. The shared security model provides a more integrated, scalable, flexible and reliable approach to digital asset access control than traditional security perimeter controls.</p>
<p>Organizations are already opting for these integrated, cloud agnostic access security platforms which embed strong access management controls, such as verification and authentication of users for privileged account access via single sign-on (SSO) and multi-factor authentication (MFA). These features add a multitude of risk mitigation benefits and create sources for contextual adaptive access controls.</p>
<p>Thales SafeNet Trusted Access platform can help business today reach a Zero-Trust access management future. SafeNet Trusted Access has been recognized by <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/ev80547/thales-safenet-trusted-access-platform/">KuppingerCole</a> as “a market leading Enterprise Authentication and access management solution. It offers a variety of hard and soft token solutions as well as FIDO compliant authenticators. It is highly scalable and built for environments that require the highest security levels.”</p>
<p>The report highlights, as strong points and benefits of SafeNet Trusted Access, the compatibility with FIDO 2.0 protocol, a good out-of-the-box selection of connectors for a variety of apps, integrations with most IAM and IDaaS products, strong anti-tampering mechanisms, and machine learning risk detection models.</p>

<p>Bloom makes its first donation to the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF), Claims and Credentials Working Group</p> The DIF and Working Groups <p>The <a href="https://identity.foundation/">DIF</a> is a Joint Development Foundation project that facilitates IPR-protected co-development among large and small industry players in the decentralized identity space. It produces open-source code, pre-standard specifications, market collaboration, and non-technical documentation.</p><p>Working Groups (WG) are at the core of DIF. These groups are scoped by functional areas and are designed to drive emerging standard specifications backed up by open-source code. </p><p>Bloom is a member of the <a href="https://identity.foundation/working-groups/claims-credentials.html">Claims and Credentials WG</a>, which focuses on standards and technology that create, exchange, and verify claims and credentials in a decentralized identity ecosystem. The Claims and Credentials WG &nbsp;hosts specifications for projects like the <a href="https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/">Presentation Exchange</a> and Credential Manifest. Although these specifications outline the data models for requesting and issuing Claims, they don't specify how the data is sent between the holder and issuer/verifier. Enter WACI! </p> Wallet And Credential Interactions (WACI) <p><a href="https://identity.foundation/waci-presentation-exchange/">WACI</a> was introduced at the <a href="https://github.com/windley/IIW_homepage/raw/gh-pages/assets/proceedings/IIW_32_Book_of_Proceedings_Final%20A%201.pdf">annual IIW32 Workshop</a> &nbsp;with a very warm response. Its goal is to specify how interactions between a wallet and Relying Party (RP) such as an issuer or a verifier happen. At its core, WACI is a handshake of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519">JWT</a>s, where the RP signs a JWT that is given to the wallet, and the wallet signs another JWT containing the initial token as a "challenge" claim. This allows the wallet to prove ownership of its DID. <br><br>The easiest way to see the benefit of WACI is to offer a way to log into an application without a password with Verified Credential (VC) based authentication that cannot be faked. </p><p>A picture (demo video in our case) is worth a thousand words:<br></p> Next Steps for Bloom and C&amp;C WG   Achieve v1 release of WACI-Presentation-Exchange <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/wallet-and-credential-interactions">specification</a>  Fold back in lessons and extensions from #1 and then flush out remaining sections to achieve v1 feature-completeness for v1 of the WACI specification and sample implementation  Register a custom URI schema (<code>waci:</code>//)

 Lessons from place-based strategic innovation in Europe, Asia and&nbsp;Africa <blockquote>This is the third in a series of DM notes that we will write about the insights from our work on the ground, which follows internal learning sessions called the DM Downloads that are organized every two weeks or so. The aim is to make our practice more legible, for us as well as for&nbsp;you.</blockquote><blockquote>DM Note #3 is a preview of our international portfolio around place-based strategic innovation, from the city to country levels, across Europe, Asia and&nbsp;Africa.</blockquote> In theory — What do we mean by place-based strategic innovation? <p>Innovation involves something new coming into existence. Whereas we see place-based strategic innovation to be something new coming into existence with the purpose of interacting with, and actively changing, the systems that shape a&nbsp;place.</p><p>In theory, we understand place-based strategic innovation to manifest with a focus&nbsp;on:</p>  Learning / Capability &amp; Capacity Building / Potential for Systems&nbsp;Change  Grand Challenge / Complex&nbsp;Problem  Traction / Tangibility / Visibility  Connectivity / Cross-cutting  Systemic Nature / Transformational  Catalytic / Multiple Horizons / Multiple&nbsp;Impacts  Stakeholder Diversity / Deep Engagement / Movement Building.  <p>What does it look like at the city&nbsp;level?</p><p>To pursue transitions on the scale and depth required to address deep-rooted challenges faced by cities, we must recognise that urban environments are made up of a complex web of dynamic and adaptive systems and act upon them accordingly.</p><blockquote>From single-point solutions &gt; to systems innovation and transformation</blockquote><blockquote>From portfolio of projects &gt; to portfolios of strategic experiments</blockquote><blockquote>From single-lever experimentation &gt; to multi-lever ‘full-stack’ experimentation</blockquote><p>An urban transition portfolio works to accelerate and deepen change in a city by marking out new pathways at the forefront of action. The insights and actionable intelligence that emerge, help inform the strategic decision making and investment required.</p><p>Strategic innovation in&nbsp;cities</p><p>There is no single, unifying theory of change that guides us. It combines at least the following:</p>  Product innovation — identifying discrete problems and developing products as solutions to test&nbsp;out.  Capability building — identifying outdated approaches / ways of working that aren’t conducive to strategic innovation and seeding alternative habits, rituals &amp; norms in strategically significant people and organisations.  Movement-building — developing new narratives that galvanise ‘coalitions of the willing’ and form the bedrock of legitimacy for&nbsp;change.   Overview of a few initiatives in that&nbsp;domain  Healthy, Clean Cities — Deep Demonstration across&nbsp;Europe <p>While political leaders across the continent are setting ambitious targets to achieve net-zero emissions, how to deliver on this at a pace and scale necessary remains&nbsp;unknown.</p><p>Dark Matter Labs has been supporting <a href="http://climate-kic.org/">EIT Climate-KIC</a> to work with the most ambitious mayors and municipalities in Europe to co-create a portfolio of joined-up strategic experiments that provide them with new knowledge, innovations and capabilities that can aid them in their Climate Action Plans — from mobility to waste to energy to health to the built environment — and help other cities to navigate the great transitions required for ‘Transformation in Time’. For more information on this initiative, <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/accelerating-city-transitions-3baadbfdcd68?source=collection_home---2------4-----------------------">click&nbsp;here.</a></p> NextGenCities Program: Zimbabwe +&nbsp;Angola <p>As part of the <a href="https://undpinnovationdays.com/Harare">2019 Harare Innovation Days</a> (HID), Dark Matter Labs worked with UNDP country office staff, ‘strategic urban risk holders’ and edge experimenters from 23 countries across Africa under the banner of #NextGenCities to build shared understanding of the interdependencies and complexities facing Africa’s diverse urban realities, with clear clusters of common challenges — such as urban economies and informality, water management, the jobs deficit and waste services — you can read more about the context of HID in a <a href="https://medium.com/@undp.innovation/african-cities-disrupting-the-urban-future-5a774b101e58">blog</a> published before the&nbsp;event.</p><p>We then developed a #NextGenCities pilot program that sought to build capabilities for designing mission-based strategic portfolios of interventions to tackle wicked issues and dynamics that COVID merely surfaced and accelerated. As<a href="https://www.africancentreforcities.net/people/edgar-pieterse/"> Edgar Pieterse</a> of the African Center for Cities in Cape Town, African cities desperately need <a href="https://journals.openedition.org/poldev/2626">“a more coordinated, sequenced and integrated approach to infrastructure planning, investment, delivery, maintenance and repair.”</a> Two countries qualified for the program, Zimbabwe and Angola and we spent four months with teams from UNDP’s Accelerator Labs working on food security and urban markets for Zimbabwe and Angola respectivelys.

The NDS is also being prepared against a backdrop where European countries are dealing with the health, economic and social crisis presented by the Covid-19 pandemic to lay the foundations to “build back better”, in a way that delivers a healthy future for everyone.</p><p>Building System Intelligence in Bhutan, Philippines and&nbsp;India</p><p>Dark Matter Labs has worked with UNDP Asian Pacific Regional Innovation Centre, UNDP Bhutan, Philippines and India, which look at youth unemployment and food security issues. These two systematic challenges have a clear intention of building system intelligence: sense-making capacity and transitional capacity to understand the interdependent nature of local/national/global problems and create governance opportunities for shared learning beyond the boundaries of ‘nation’. The project aims to create a shared, cross-cutting portfolio of interventions and transnational governance innovation for both India &amp; the Philippines rather than making comparisons as the food systems/crisis cannot be solved by one nation in isolation. You can read more about one of these initiatives in the following blog: <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/breaking-the-silos-through-participatory-systems-mapping-fccf9c2d01ab">Breaking the Silos Through Participatory Systems&nbsp;Mapping</a>.</p> In practice — Key&nbsp;lessons <p>Strategic innovation cannot be the starting point, it needs to sit within a context. People and organisations are more willing to ‘lean into’ strategic innovation if it builds upon local identities, pre-existing strategies, strength and&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Strategic innovation cannot be held by only one stakeholder. Designing and deploying strategic innovation in a meaningful way requires deliberate ecosystems of technical expertise and local partners / brokers. This entails working with a consortium of partners, which presents its own challenges.The sheer amount of coordination and management of politics and personalities cannot be under-estimated.</p><p>Strategic innovation is political. Political realities dictate the permission for strategic innovation, the power dynamics that shape strategic innovation and the pace by which strategic innovation can be pursued in a place. It dictates the pace and orientation of&nbsp;change.</p><p>For innovation to be strategic, we need to understand the broader picture. Reframing the problem / opportunity space can help unleash strategic innovation — sowing the seeds of new mental modes that flourish further down the line. It is no longer about this single problem or solution.</p><p>For problem owners, strategic innovation is as much about organisation &amp; culture change as it is about problems and solutions. Understanding how each organisation needs to change in order to be more systemic &amp; strategic in the way they approach innovation is a real journey that takes&nbsp;time.</p><p>Strategic innovation at a national level can help test many approaches against machineries of policy making and programme delivery across the whole spectrum of national priorities, cascaded down across regions to municipalities. It helps create various adaptations of the same idea at different levels.</p><p>Strategic innovation at the national scale means we need to be much more strategic, political and adaptable in our own language. We will need to also be more practical and proactive on strategies. For instance, we had to create a glossary on what our terms meant so that when these new concepts were translated into local languages to make sure the value of the innovation would not be&nbsp;lost.</p><p>In strategic innovation, there is a delicate balance between the watering down of the purity of ideas VS greater societal and political acceptance that brings a framework for implementation (and often funding to do the work). On the one hand, we want to be precise and creative the language to open up new ways of seeing, and at the same time we want to ensure that the words we use don’t alienate the people we work with, as well as the people they&nbsp;serve.</p> Get in&nbsp;touch <p>If you enjoyed this DM Note, please also read <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/dm-note-1-7ec5cfb1c093">DM Note #1</a> and <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/dm-note-2-f5f270d13428">#2</a> here, follow us on Medium for more to come and “clap” the article to show appreciation.

<p>In Canada, where I live, spring is coming to an end and summer is getting started. I love this time of year; the progression of flowers bursting like a well-funded fireworks show, the lettuce unfolding and gracing the dinner table every evening, the strawberries that are not quite ripe enough but you stuff your face with them anyway.</p><p>I see the Holochain developer ecosystem going through a similar flush of growth. I’ll be honest: we’re still young and small, but that means the developers generally know each other and support each other well, and we’re able to support them well too. This seems to be creating a lot of vitality, sort of like those two small garden boxes in your backyard that thrive because they’re just enough for you to take care of.</p><p>Here are a few things that have caught my eye lately. If you’re a developer, I bet you’ll find them useful.</p> Holochain Gym: exercise those hApp dev muscles <p>The <a href="https://holochain-gym.github.io/">Holochain Gym</a> is a wonderful set of exercises that take you through the basics of Holochain. There are three sections:</p><p>There are two sections:</p>  <a href="https://holochain-gym.github.io/concepts/">Concepts</a> gives you a grounding in the fundamentals of Holochain. I love the interactive visualisations using Guillem Córdoba’s <a href="https://holochain-open-dev.github.io/holochain-playground/">Holochain Playground simulator</a>; they turn very abstract concepts into things you can see and touch. I especially love the one that shows how Holochain handles the <a href="https://holochain-gym.github.io/concepts/validation-rules/#but-what-happens-with-51-of-malicious-nodes">dreaded 51% attack</a> (or worse) without <a href="https://artbrock.medium.com/">miners or consensus</a>.  <a href="https://holochain-gym.github.io/developers/">Developers</a> introduces you to the building blocks of hApp development — data structures, host API calls, built-in patterns. There are code-along exercises that give you experience writing DNA code.  Holochain Playground simulator showing six bad actors who try to stage a 60% attack. Through a few rounds of validation and ‘warranting’ (publishing evidence of malicious activity), the four good actors isolate themselves from the bad actors.<p>This project is a collaboration between a few active community members, and it’s still in its early stages. If you’re already familiar with hApp development and would <a href="https://github.com/holochain-gym/">like to contribute</a>, I’m sure they’d be super grateful.</p> Holochain Open Dev: libraries for use in your own hApps <p>I’ve reported on the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev">Holochain Open Dev GitHub org</a> since the Holochain Redux days. Now with a rapidly maturing Holochain RSM and a bunch of hApps being built, it’s gaining new modules while the existing ones are getting refactored. Here are a few ones that looked interesting:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/profiles">https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/profiles</a> lets users choose a nickname (AKA screen name, username, or handle) and save profile information as key/value pairs. It also comes with a sample UI to show you how to use it on the front end. The interesting thing about this module is that nicknames are not exclusive — just like in real life, it’s perfectly okay for two people to have the nickname <code>stina_nilsson</code> if that’s what their name actually is. This demonstrates the beauty and weirdness of an agent-centric, consensus-free system.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/contacts">https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/contacts</a>, from the Kizuna team, lets users store lists of friends (contact list) and enemies (block list), as in a social media or communication app. I didn’t see any documentation, but the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/contacts/blob/main/zome/zomes/contacts/src/lib.rs#L26-L64">module’s API</a> looks pretty self-documenting.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/holochain-time-index">https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/holochain-time-index</a>, from the Perspect3vism and Junto teams (more on them below), is one solution for retrieving data by time range. This is good for social media, blogs, financial records, and other time-based data. It also eliminates DHT hotspots that would normally come from putting a zillion links on one anchor. This repo is exquisitely documented and gives rationales for the design.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/calendar-events">https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/calendar-events</a> implements a basic calendar. This looks like it would be great for shared personal calendars, events, or resource booking. As with <code>profiles</code>, it includes a sample UI.  <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/file-storage">https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/file-storage</a> is a generic blob-storage module. It ‘chunks’ files behind the scenes — this prevents DHT hot spots (imagine some poor peer with a 32GB smartphone having to store your hour-long holiday video in their DHT shard) but also may make it possible to implement streaming videos. (And besides, there’s a 16MB limit on DHT entries anyway.)  <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/reusable-module-template">https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/reusable-module-template</a> is just what it sounds like — a template that lets you scaffold modules that you want other developers to use.   Holochain In Action: a community of co-learning <p>I’ve been following the work of the Holochain in Action group for a little while, and I’m excited about what they’re doing. This group meets every Tuesday to learn, teach, share, and develop together. There’s a big focus on exploring and implementing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">design patterns</a> that are appropriate for Holochain, which I think is important work.</p><p>If you’re a developer and want to get involved, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">jump to the forum</a> and fill out the application form. You can also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJwIuwkCI5HMSzHJpKys-RQ">watch their past videos on YouTube</a> — looks like there are a lot of good presentations.</p><p>Finally, you can check out the app they’re working on, called <a href="https://github.com/holochain-in-action/peer-share">Peer Share</a>, which lets people share content of all sorts with each other. They’re using it to explore various patterns, including an interesting one called the JSON-Schema pattern. Instead of having to define entry types at compile time, DHT administrators can create new types on the fly using the <a href="https://json-schema.org/">JSON-Schema</a> vocabulary to validate content that’s supposed to conform to those types.</p> Ad4m and Perspect3vism: a unique take on application development <p>I find this a very intriguing project. I’m still wrapping my head around it; it feels like it could have profound implications for the way we construct our online experiences. And when I say that, I mean users, not developers. It appears to be <a href="https://ad4m.dev/">an agent-centric approach</a> to building an online life, consisting of ‘languages’ (ways of expressing oneself, such as a tweet, a to-do list, or a chess move) and ‘perspectives’ (spaces in which one wants to participate) that a person can combine in ways that suit them best.</p><p>The architectural approach reminds me of Holoscape, and the vocabulary reminds me of the Junto social app, which shouldn’t be surprising: it’s a collaboration between Holo team member <a href="https://github.com/lucksus/">Nicolas Luck</a> and <a href="https://junto.foundation/">Junto</a> lead developer <a href="https://github.com/jdeepee">Josh Parkin</a>.</p> Holo-REA: a toolkit for cooperative economics <p>I get pretty passionate about non-coercive, appropriately sized, regenerative economies. It’s possibly the biggest reason I got involved with Holochain — because I saw that it had the potential to be a platform for these sorts of initiatives.</p><p>So I’m thrilled that Holo-REA is nearing maturity. Holo-REA is a toolkit for economic applications, particularly ones in which the players do their accounting out in the open (though it doesn’t exclude a bit of privacy either). The folks behind Holo-REA are building it to support a <a href="https://www.lowimpact.org/value-flows-model-lynn-foster-mikorizal-part-1/">big vision</a> of true-cost accounting, or considering all the costs of producing a good or delivering a service. This is something the current economic system <a href="https://youtu.be/KVTLLrP9uOg">isn’t great at</a>.</p><p>Holo-REA implements a business ontology called <a href="https://valueflo.ws">ValueFlows</a>. It looks complicated, but it’s really just a formalisation of things that <a href="http://mikorizal.org/ValueFlows-Story.pdf">people do all the time</a>. This gives me hope that Holo-REA, and the applications that’ll be built on it,</p><p>You can find the source code for Holo-REA, along with lots of good literature on the why and how of the project, at <a href="https://github.com/holo-rea/holo-rea">https://github.com/holo-rea/holo-rea</a> . Lots of people who are building on Holochain are already getting excited about it and <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/digital-environment-for-material-commons-based-peer-production-with-sensorica/5659">planning to use it</a> in their own projects.</p> Dev Camp postponed until September; lots of opportunities before then <p>The response to the next community-run dev camp has been overwhelmingly positive — and overwhelming!</p><blockquote>More than 700 people have registered, which has resulted in the organisers changing their plans.</blockquote><p>It’s moving from June to September, and they’ll be working with us at Holo to provide more learning opportunities — both during and before.</p><p>You can still register, and the organisers will send you updates by email so you know what’s going on.</p><p>The theme of the Dev Camp sounds really cool:</p><blockquote>During DevCamp 8 we’re going to be building a multiplayer game: “Tragedy of the Holocommons”<br><br>We will bring every economist’s favorite game to life as a Holochain app! The heart of this game is a demonstration of consensus-seeking in an eventually consistent environment - a crucial part of building any decentralized application!<br><br>Of course, we’ll also cover all the other essential building blocks of a Holochain application, with little adjustments to make it more fun and cool!</blockquote><p>Reaching agreement without relying on global consensus is a challenging thing to understand, but it’s at the core of what makes Holochain Holochain. This will be a great opportunity to understand more about that in a hands-on way.</p><p><a href="https://holochain.org/dev-camp">Register for the Dev Camp today!</a> And if you have any programmer friends who are disenchanted with blockchain, share it with them too. Maybe they’re ready for something fresh and new.</p> Can we have some updates on Holochain and Holo too? <p>Of course! Here are some of the most recent updates:</p>  Holochain has been having some serious performance issues in stress-testing, and it looks like it’s caused by a memory leak in Wasmer, the virtual machine that runs hApp DNAs. The Wasmer team have been great at tracking down the bug and sharing <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-wasmer/pull/64">workarounds</a>, and we expect that they’ll fix the bug soon as well.  DHT sharding is <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/833">in</a> <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/799">active</a> <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/834">development</a>. There’s been a lot of work to make gossip efficient in a DHT that includes lots of multi-user machines, as well as the previous work of <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-gets-some-parts-upgrades/#lmdb-to-sqlite-the-road-to-infinite-scalability">moving the storage backend from LMDB to SQLite</a> which made performant gossip possible in the first place.  Both dev teams are focusing on improving performance everywhere. Some of these improvements (like batching database writes) will stick around, while others will become obsolete once DHTs can be sharded.  There’s a new <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/830">standalone bootstrap server</a> that doesn’t require you to use Holo’s or <a href="https://github.com/holochain/bootstrap/">deploy</a> your own on CloudFlare. This was created for testing, but it could be useful for applications that want to run their own infrastructure. Note that it doesn’t persist any peer information on restart; it’s all in-memory. (If you’re not familiar with the bootstrap server, it makes introductions between peers so they can start communicating with each other.)  The Holochain dev team is getting ready for the second public release of Holochain RSM, which will include all the changes since the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-pulse-91-hdk-stable-for-now/">first release in February</a>. Many developers have been tracking the changes in the <code>develop</code> branch; this will support developers who prefer something a bit more stable, as well as ones who prefer not to work in Holonix.  BREAKING CHANGE: all the DHT retrieval functions are disabled in validation callbacks except <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/812">three new ones</a>: <code>must_get_entry</code>, <code>must_get_header</code>, and <code>must_get_valid_element</code>. This serves two purposes: first, validation functions should <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/7_validation/#guidelines-for-writing-validation-rules">always be deterministic</a>, and this removes the DHT as a source of non-determinism; and second, it removes a lot of boilerplate because you don’t have to manually handle all the different error types when a piece of DHT data can’t be retrieved. All you need to do is use <code>?</code> at the end of your DHT retrieval function, and the validation will automatically return the right sort of error to the host. Note: this change is not in <code>develop</code> and won’t be until after the next version of Holochain is released.  The Holo team has been working on dev-ops infrastructure that makes it easy for them to switch their HoloPorts to testing channels and back. This is because Holochain development is progressing rapidly and they need to be able to reliably reproduce environments to test apps against different commits. This won’t matter much to you, dear reader, except that it’ll speed up testing and get us to the next alpha milestone a bit sooner!  <p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@seffen99?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Sven Brandsma</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/planting-garden?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

 Martedì 22 giugno, a partire dalle ore 09:30 – evento in live streaming 



 



 
 <a href="https://forumpa2021.eventifpa.it/it/event-details/?id=9885">Scopri di più</a> 
 



 



<p>InfoCert sarà fra i protagonisti del talk “Il Domicilio digitale e i trusted services”, discussione che ha come obiettivo quello di fornire un quadro di riferimento e le fasi di attuazione del domicilio digitale dei cittadini e dei soggetti non obbligati. Al tempo stesso intende fare un bilancio e alcune riflessioni per il futuro in merito all’adozione in Italia dei servizi fiduciari come previsti dal regolamento eIDAS, con alcuni dei principali protagonisti sullo scenario europeo e nazionale, anche alla luce dell’evoluzione dello scenario europeo di riferimento.</p>



<p>Introdurrà il talk Massimiliano Roma – Responsabile Comunicazione e Relazioni Istituzionali con gli Enti pubblici di FPA, moderatore della sessione Francesco Tortorelli – Direttore Responsabile Direzione Pubblica Amministrazione e Vigilanza di AgID; intervengono Claudio Petrucci – Responsabile Gestione servizi infrastrutturali di AgID, Riccardo Genghini di Studio Genghini &amp; Associati, Andrea Sassetti – AD Aruba PEC, Trust Services Governance and General Affairs Director di Aruba Enterprise.</p>



<p>In particolare, Danilo Cattaneo interverrà per fornire la visione strategica di InfoCert quale importante QTSP a livello europeo, analizzando lo scenario internazionale che si sta delineando a seguito delle ultime evoluzioni del regolamento eIDAS, e su quello nazionale in vista delle opportunità che si prospettano con l’approvazione del PNRR.</p>



<p>La manifestazione si conferma punto di incontro e confronto tra pubblica amministrazione, imprese, mondo della ricerca e cittadini nonché occasione di approfondimento delle più importanti tematiche inerenti l’innovazione e l’introduzione delle nuove tecnologie nella PA. AgID sarà presente con due appuntamenti mirati ad approfondire importanti progetti di digitalizzazione, di grande interesse per amministrazioni e cittadini.</p>

<p>In our last post we briefly presented <a href="https://veramo.io">Veramo</a> and how it evolved from the challenges faced with uPort’s libraries. In this next series of articles we will give <a href="https://veramo.io">Veramo</a> a proper introduction and answer some of the basics: why it exists and what it does, followed by articles describing the architecture in more detail, and how to build applications using <a href="https://veramo.io">Veramo</a>. While our name may have changed, the original vision of allowing individuals and organizations to own their own data and maintain privacy, has&nbsp;not.</p><p>The Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) space has been moving fast by establishing standards for decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) which simply did not exist when uPort set out five years ago. What began as a niche has caught wider attention. In Apple’s WWDC last week their Verifiable Health records appear to be <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/samples/accessing_data_from_a_smart_health_card">using W3C VCs</a> under the hood. The European Commission recently proposed a new <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_21_2664">electronic identity regulation</a> that aims to make identity wallets mandatory for various public and private sector service providers. This progress validates our theory that the task of managing DIDs and VCs is important work.</p><p>Enter Veramo</p><p><a href="https://veramo.io">Veramo</a> is built with several goals in mind. First, we aim to simplify creating and managing identifiers and issuing and receiving credentials through straightforward APIs which run across backend, frontend, and mobile. We aim to provide the ability to do this in a spec compliant way with interoperability in mind. The framework should also be flexible enough to allow for many configuration options (multiple environments, hybrid deployment models, data storage, key management, etc.) and also to accommodate future advances in the space. With <a href="https://veramo.io">Veramo</a>, we took feedback to heart and combined these features into a single framework over the outwardly confusing set of uPort libraries: uport-connect, uport-credentials, uport-transports, and uport-mobile.</p><p>The Veramo&nbsp;Agent</p><p>The entry point to managing identifiers, credentials, messages, keys and more is the <a href="https://veramo.io">Veramo</a> Agent. The Agent provides a common interface for core and custom plugins to operate and orchestrates them through an event system. An Agent can be run as a CLI, backend service, within a mobile app, or in the browser and we have tutorials for each on <a href="https://veramo.io/docs">veramo.io/docs</a>. Agents can also work remotely, so you can have multiple agents with specific capabilities that work together to provide tailored functionality as&nbsp;one.</p><p>The <a href="https://veramo.io">Veramo</a> Agent takes care of low-level details so you can focus on building your app. Once instantiated, it exposes methods for creating and managing identifiers through the did-manager plugin. Out-of-the-box support is available for <a href="https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ethr-did-resolver/blob/master/doc/did-method-spec.md">ethr-did</a> (Ethereum address), <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">web-did</a> (DNS domain), and <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">did-key</a> (simple public/private key&nbsp;pair).</p><p>For credentials, the credentials-w3c plugin combined with the messaging plugin handle issuing, receiving, signing, and sending W3C VCs from one DID to another. The data-storage and key-manager plugins handle storing the identifiers, credentials, messages and the keys for signing and encryption.</p><p>Running an agent will depend on your use-case and environment. To get started, take a look at our documentation and tutorials on <a href="https://veramo.io">veramo.io</a>. The CLI tool is the quickest way to see how it works, and we also have tutorials for Node, React, and React-Native. Hit us up at hello@veramo.io or <a href="https://github.com/uport-project/veramo/discussions">GitHub Discussions</a> with feedback or questions.</p><p>Coming soon: Part 2 will go deeper on architecture details and Part 3 will show how to build applications using&nbsp;Veramo.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/uport/introducing-veramo-5a960bf2a5fe">Introducing Veramo</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/uport">uPort</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>When uPort began at ConsenSys in 2015, the self-sovereign identity space was also in its infancy. Early concepts existed as little more than academic theories with few attempts at implementation. Despite the lack of standards or the guidance of a marketplace, uPort began experimenting with our first architecture using smart-contract based identities.</p><p>Over time the technical limitations with on-chain identities began to pile up, which led to <a href="https://medium.com/uport/next-generation-uport-identity-app-released-59bbc32a83a0">uPort’s 1.0 architecture</a> and pioneering the use of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) with our open-source libraries. At the time DIDs, together with verifiable credentials (VCs) were proposed W3C standards and are now nearing official status. Dozens of projects are still using several of our popular libraries: uport-connect, uport-credentials, uport-mobile, did-jwt, and did-resolver, to name a&nbsp;few.</p><p>While successful, some of these libraries also presented challenges of their own. Maintaining libraries across different tech stacks (web, mobile, backend) became an impediment to the rapid iteration so critical in a space where standards evolve quickly. Around 18 months ago, we began work on the next iteration of our architecture, a project internally known as DAF (DID Agent Framework).</p><p>The primary goal of DAF was to create a flexible, modular architecture based around a library of core functionality that would run on each primary stack (web, mobile and backend), and could be easily extended through add-on packages. This approach allows us and the developer community to easily add the application specific functionality they need, whether it be additional DID methods, key management functions, new protocols, and many more possibilities without needing to modify the core&nbsp;library.</p><p>Earlier this year, we released the culmination of these efforts, informed by years of open-source work, learning, and iteration, as&nbsp;<a href="https://veramo.io/">Veramo</a>.</p><p>This next major iteration also makes it necessary to begin deprecating the previous uPort mobile app, libraries, and services. The following is an outline of the schedule and what will be affected. If you currently depend on any of these, or simply have a question or two please send us an email at hello@veramo.io.</p><p>uPort Mobile</p><p>uPort Mobile will be removed from the Apple AppStore and Google PlayStore as of June 1st, 2021. The code is already open-source and will remain available in an archived github&nbsp;repo.</p><p>Libraries and&nbsp;Services</p><p>First, we will be archiving the deprecated github repos. Open-source code will still be available for reference, but no further changes/updates will be made. In addition, we will be shutting down hosted services, some of which will cause issues in libraries and/or the mobile&nbsp;app.</p><p>Chasqui: a server that allows communication between dApps, mobile apps (like uPort Mobile) and servers. Shutting down Chasqui will cause breaking changes in uPort Mobile and uport-transports. Shutdown date: June 1st,&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Caleuche: an event hub service which allows the backup and sync of uPort mobile app events. Shutdown date: June 1st,&nbsp;2021.</p><p>Pututu: a server that allows dApps and servers to send push notification messages to any uPort Mobile App. Shutdown date: June 1st,&nbsp;2021.</p><p>The services below are related to proxy-contract identities and will be shutdown a couple weeks&nbsp;earlier.</p><p>Sensui: uPort Transaction Funding Service.

<p>Are digitally encrypted certificates the way forward?</p>



<p>COVID-19 has brought an unprecedented shift in our ability to meet, socialize and interact throughout the world. Almost overnight, we became subject to contact tracing and the need to keep social distance from everyone including family and friends. Since contact of any kind carried the risk of COVID-19 transmission, especially as variants multiplied, there seemed little hope of communities, countries and the world being able to reopen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we take the first steps towards the safe opening of different regions, an increasing number of governments are requiring people to provide validated proof of COVID-19 vaccinations or test results. These certifications must be verifiable and linked to official identity documents to travel, gain access to local venues or anything involving social gatherings.</p>



<p>The good news is there’s been significant advances in the ability to digitally link verified vaccination certificates and COVID-19 test results to an individual’s identity. Many organizations and governments are now looking to create a contactless verification process as part of this digital transformation. Additionally, they need something that will prioritize data privacy. As these solutions are developed and rolled out, several important issues have hit the headlines such as:</p>



  Being able to trust how the data will be used and stored&nbsp;&nbsp;  How to protect against fraud when certificates are often hard copies only and partly handwritten&nbsp;  How to prove the certificate is tied to a specific individual&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>In this series, we’ll look at the real-world benefits of digitally verifying credentials. We’ll discuss problems surrounding proof of identity and keeping data safe. We’ll highlight how your customers can have peace of mind knowing their data is encrypted, never stored anywhere other than their own personal device and can only ever be shared with their explicit instructions and consent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using an elegant, safe and user focused smart application that people can use to confidently gain access to venues and travel is the answer.&nbsp; People need security knowing that despite any requirements to provide proof of vaccination or test results they remain in complete control of their own data and are able to start enjoying life and allowing businesses to thrive again.</p>



<p>After months of lockdowns and restrictions governments are looking for safe ways to gradually open the doors and encourage people to come out of their homes and be social again.&nbsp;However, allowing people to travel and attend events still carries big risks, particularly as new variants spread rapidly. Governments are looking to be able to provide documentary evidence ensuring all travelers and visitors are fully vaccinated or have recent negative test results as a requirement of entry. This in itself brings new challenges. If verification remains a manual process, the individual will need to carry and produce several documents that authorities will then need to scrutinize for authenticity and manually check against the individual’s official identity documents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ability to minimize physical contact, including the handling of passports and vaccination cards, is a critical element in containing a pandemic. If the existing verification processes also include fingerprint scanning and the need to type in a secure PIN on a publicly used device, then this further increases the risks of virus transmission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Contactless technology is the key to creating an effective solution. Companies are starting to recognize the need to evolve and offer streamlined processes that embrace digital verification. Digital verification is actually not a new concept; the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web published the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials Data Model</a> back in 2019 which references digital certification and best practices. The need for safe and secure digital verification of personal identity and certification documents becomes even more critical if we are to address and contain the pandemic.</p>



<p>ShareRing’s solution to the current challenges is both innovative and simplistic. It leverages the immutability of blockchain technology to build the highest levels of security, privacy and consumer trust into a flexible digital verification system.</p>



<p>ShareRing has created a complete ecosystem for the issuance, ownership, and consumption of documents. For both the issuer and the consumer of the document/data, the ShareRing system provides fundamentally greater levels of confidence in the validity of the document. It eliminates the opportunity for fraudulent manipulation of data that’s been uploaded onto the ShareRing blockchain platform. For the user, our independent custom-built&nbsp;blockchain platform is available&nbsp;to anyone with a mobile device. And its no-nonsense interface makes it easy for anyone to use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ShareRing app includes many unique features providing users with a Personal Identification Vault and Health document access. This allows users to safely store and easily share multiple documents, including their COVID-19 vaccination, passport, national ID card and more, in an encrypted format. None of these documents are held centrally and remain only on the individual’s personal device. Our transformative products offer the highest level of security providing reassurance that documents can’t be accessed by anyone without the owner’s expressed consent.&nbsp;Once the documents are uploaded to their personal device a digital “fingerprint” of those documents are stored on the ShareRing blockchain. This means they are not open to hacking and/or personal data theft, as has been the case with many database-dependent systems in the past.</p>



<p>For businesses and operators who wish to consume the data, we have developed an easy contactless digital journey which allows them to use QR Codes scans to request and check the information they require from the individual. This not only streamlines and speeds up the journey, but it also significantly increases the reliability of their checks since the documents will have been uploaded at source and/or verified using face matching and OCR checks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The issuer of a document or certificate can be confident that the certificates they are issuing to an individual will not be tampered with or misused by a third party.</p>



<p>Using COVID-19 vaccinations certificates is one example of how our ecosystem works. It also includes actions by:&nbsp;</p>



  A vaccination center that will issue the COVID-19 certificate at the point of vaccination. They then send an encrypted digital copy to the user, which only the user can access using a private key. At the same time a digital “fingerprint” or hash of that document will be uploaded to the blockchain.  The user who receives the digital copy of the vaccination certificate from the issuer and uploads it to their Personal Information Vault on their mobile device, alongside their OCR and face matched identity document which they uploaded when they created their ShareRing account.  A consumer of the data, for example a customs official at an airport or a ticket attendant at a venue, who scans a QR code from the user’s mobile phone which will, with the user’s explicit real-time consent, allow them to see the verified COVID-19 vaccination certificate alongside the user’s ID. The process automatically checks the digital fingerprint on the blockchain. Even if a single pixel of the image has been altered or the document on the user’s device has been tampered with in any way it will be rejected by the system.  



<p>Additional, optional features include the ability for an issuer to allow a user to find their nearest COVID-19 testing or vaccination center, book an appointment and prove health status in a private and trusted way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the ShareRing app, you can have confidence that your customer:&nbsp;</p>



  ID and accompanying information are valid&nbsp;  Will have the security to travel and access venues and events&nbsp;  Will feel safe knowing their information is always secure&nbsp;  



<p>ShareRing is their contactless and digital way to freedom allowing them to unlock the world.

<p>The Inception Of NFT’s Has Created A Craze: Will It Last And Have NFT’s Progressed Beyond Just&nbsp;Hype?</p>NFT’s Have Sold For Millions: So Did ICO’s In 2017: Can We Draw A Fair Comparison?<p>Introduction: Hype vs. Utility: Which Foundational Ethos Causes The Transcendence of Blockchain Ecosystems?</p><p>Throughout the history of blockchain, it has become more and more evident and obvious that hype is a cornerstone of a blockchain ecosystems success, specifically surrounding token price and awareness of the project. Ethereum’s infrastructure smart contract code capabilities transformed the zeitgeist of blockchain, enabling different projects to be built on Ethereum. This notion conceived of the “Great ICO Bubble Of 2017” which led to new projects skyrocketing in valuation without real-world utility. When “The Great Bear Market of 2018” commenced, investors succumbed to digital shell-shock, coming to the clear realization that many of these projects were extremely hyped but lacked utility. Fast forward to 2021, although hype is still a fundamental zeitgeist of the blockchain sphere, utility is becoming the superior and aggrandizing force. Will NFT’s meet the same fate as the ICO Bubble of 2017, or is there something deeper that is incumbent to analyze surrounding real-world utility? Lets delve deep into the intricacies of NFT’s and how projects like AERGO have created revolutionary innovations surrounding NFT expansionism.</p><p>What Are Non Fungible Tokens? The Modern Day Tulip Craze, Or Real World&nbsp;Value?</p>NFT’s, Amalgamated With DeFi, Have Been The Cornerstone Of The 2021 Bull Run, But Why&nbsp;NFT’s?<p>NFT’s have exploded during The Great Bull Run Of 2021, and it is important to recognize the intricacies of what NFT’s are. Non Fungible Tokens is a digital asset(s) that represents real-world objects such as art, music, in-game items, videos, collectible cards, an essay, a unique-sneakers and clothes etc. NFT’s are similar to cryptocurrencies in a variety of different ways, specifically highlighted by their similarities in cryptographic coding. The inception of NFT’s began in 2014, but their popularity has soared over the last two years, and since 2017, over 174 million dollars has been spent on NFT’s. But where do NFT’s garner their value, and&nbsp;why?</p><p>NFT’s main valuation proposition is the inception of digital scarcity. In the traditional exterior world, rarity breeds value, surplus leads to hollowness in many circumstances (see every single monetary currency that has succumbed to runaway inflation since the dawn of humanity). Within the digital world, rarity also breeds value, specifically in an entire consolidated web of an infinite supply of the majority of creations. It is evident that NFT’s hold a value proposition, but how far has NFT’s evolved since the Great NFT Craze of 2020&nbsp;began?</p><p>Value In Non-Fungibility: The NFT Paradigm Of Evolution</p>Beeple’s “EVERYDAYS: The First 5000 Days” Sold At Auction For 69.3 Million&nbsp;Dollars<p>Since the inception of NFT’s, many artistic renderings have been anything but unique. Many NFT’s began as a digital copy of a creation that was already in existence somewhere else. Clips from iconic sporting events to securitized versions of artistic expression that already existed on social media outlets such as Instagram, Facebook and Twitter all became amalgamated under the umbrella term known as an NFT. So if NFT’s can be basically seen, screenshotted, downloaded and/or printed, how does this create an exterior value proposition; the answer is ownership. NFT’s allow the buyer to own the digital item; NFT’s enable such a digital feat through digitized authentication which can lead to owners garnering a sense of uniqueness surrounding their ownership of such a unique piece of data. Since the creation of NFT’s in 2014, the function and maxim’s of owning these pieces of data have evolved substantially, and we’re going to find out why and&nbsp;how.</p>Digitized Authentication=Legitimate Unique Ownership<p>NFT’s have created numerous different opportunities for celebrities, musicians, and artists to expand their business models in a variety of different ways. Artists, to begin, can utilize and add stipulations to an NFT to ensure that they receive a portion of proceeds every-time that specific NFT is sold. NFT’s, because they provide digital ownership rights through a unique paradigm, eliminate the need to track an asset’s progress and the need to enforce entitlements associated with any sale of that property. NFT’s can also benefit musicians who can utilize them to provide special perks to fans. It is also evident, to any collector, that it can be extremely difficult to point out what is a genuine collectors item or a reproduction; NFT’s end that dilemma. NFT’s with clear transaction histories back to the original creator would eliminate such an issue that has plagued collectors for far too long. NFT’s have the potential to transform the paradigm of digital ownership, and I believe NFT’s have evolved into the “Vision and Real World Application” stage, rather than blatant hype without a valid sense of&nbsp;utility.</p><p>The Dilemma Of NFT’s: The Great Expense: Different Blockchains Look To Solve The&nbsp;Issue</p>NFT’s Provide Real World Value And Utility: But Their Biggest Dilemma Are Minting&nbsp;Fees<p>The largest breeding ground for minting NFT’s, as of 2021, is Ethereum. Unfortunately, just like expensive transaction fees that plague the Ethereum Blockchain, minting an NFT has unfortunately met the same fate. Although there is a complete guarantee of decentralized digital ownership when an NFT is issued on Ethereum, scalability and high costs plague the network. Many blockchains have attempted to rectify the high cost dilemma of minting NFT’s, blockchains such as Tezos have created scalable solutions that allows for NFT’s to be mint in as little as two minutes and cost approximately&nbsp;.50 cents per&nbsp;mint.</p><p>Blockchains such as Aergo and ICON have also created their own NFT platforms where individuals can ensure the movement and minting of their NFT’s for a fraction of what it would cost on Ethereum. Scalability and high transaction costs have plagued blockchain networks since the inception of Bitcoin and different blockchain projects have been working tirelessly to create a seamless, affordable and efficient digital paradigm for NFT’s to be minted and sold&nbsp;on.</p><p>Future Use Cases Envisioned: The Practicality of&nbsp;NFT’s</p>Changing The Dynamics Of Ownership<p>Ownership has unfortunately been in the hands of middlemen before the birth of NFT’s, but future potential can rectify this paranoia of changing hands of ownership. Similarly to smart contracts, NFT’s enable a reliable transfer of information between two or more parties. NFT’s enable assets to reliably move around within a blockchain system, and blockchain systems such as Aergo are creating bridges where NFT’s can be transferred from a side-chain of the network to a main network. NFT’s can resolve a variety of issues that coincide with land and vehicle ownership. Did you know that less than 40% of the global population has their land registered to the rightful property owner? NFT’s can fix this! Individuals who lack verifiable defined rights find it much more difficult to access financial services and credit. With NFT’s, individuals can verify their rights through original ownership attached to their property through digitized verifiable authentication.</p><p>Aergo’s Merkle Bridge: Bridging The Gap: Rectifying Dilemmas</p>NFT’s Merkle Bridge Provides An Interoperable And Cost Effective Approach To Data Transfer And&nbsp;NFT’s<p>Ask yourself a focal and important question about interoperability from a humanistic and primal standpoint; if tribes can’t communicate through a similar language, how can civilization evolve as a whole? Its a simple answer, we couldn’t of. In the 21st century, one of the main dilemmas blockchains face (as digital tribes) is the inability to communicate with one another. Interoperability is blockchains next step, its destiny as a digital innovation.</p><p>The Merkle Bridge is designed to become a bridge between different blockchains and side-chains, enabling blockchains to talk with one another and exchange value in a cost effective manner. Multi-sig operators are the main and predominant form of data transfers in blockchain systems, unfortunately, a lack of security and increased costs plague this type of transference paradigm. Small transfers cannot exist with this type of paradigm because costs are incredibly high. Aergo fixes such a notion through the utilization of the Merkle Proof Tree, which is less costly and more efficient than the Ethereum Patricia Tree; however, Aergo intends on developing bridges between Aergo and Ethereum. Now how can this benefit NFT’s when utilizing the Merkle&nbsp;Bridge?</p><p>Merkle Bridge’s technology can benefit not only individuals attempting to transfer tokens, but data and information as well such as NFT’s. Merkle’s Bridge can be seen as a type or oracle-feed between different networks that are interconnected through the Merkle Bridge. Many centralized institutions and blockchain projects have issued their own NFT’s without the ability of cross-chain functionality and transference. With Merkle Bridge, NFT’s can be transferred to “wallets” that connect to Aergo and Ethereum and in the future, other blockchain projects connected to Merkle Bridge. Interoperable NFT transfers, as interoperable protocols are inevitable, the future of NFT’s are fated to be consolidated with the interoperable paradigm.</p><p>AERGO Incubated: An NFT Use Case Utilizing CCCV</p>Aergo Has Incubated A Project That Creates Member Vaccine Verifications<p>Since February 2020, it is evident that COVID-19 has conceived of an onslaught against our modern civilization that hasn’t been seen for at least 100 years. Nations closed and economic regimes were brought to their knees against an ancient paradigm that humanity has never truly conquered and risen victorious: The Great Biological War. Blockchain enterprises realized that immutability and transparency thereof could assist in the inception of tracking the virus through vaccine verifications; Aergo understood this notion to the fullest extent. Aergo and Blocko XYZ conceived of an incubated project known as CCCV which enables individuals who have their COVID vaccination to identify themselves as vaccinated by adding a real-time badge and sticker that can be shown to others who utilize the platform. In South Korea, an apparent dilemma is that COVID badges are only given to individuals over the age of 65, that leaves a massive age demographic where identifying who is vaccinated and who isn’t is incredibly difficult to track. CCCV solves this dilemma. Although companies have created COVID vaccination tracking apps, security and standardization have been a focal issue; with CCCV, users can request a badge and a sticker and when the document of their verification is authenticated, it is uploaded to their account. Now how does this tie into NFT’s, Ill tell&nbsp;you.</p><p>CCCV has garnered over 2 million subscribers (roughly 1.3 times the population of the island of Manhattan) and offers numerous different services which include NFT services. CCCV is a social networking platform and professional person validator, simultaneously, NFT’s can be implemented into this platform and its 2 million plus subscribers! Fake online impersonations, false influencer credentials and fraud are unfortunate but occur incredibly often in cyberspace and NFT’s can solve such an issue through unique-original-digital-ownership through the utilization of CCCV. NFT’s service as an authenticity technology that prevents users from succumbing to SNS linkage and enables individuals to create unique personalized design badges that emphasizes personal ownership and authenticity of ones profile. The platform is blockchain based: immutable, trustless and reliable. NFT’s also enable individuals to control the ownership of their own credentials and CCCV provides such a service utilizing this technology. CCCV has a multitude of use-cases which amalgamate digital identity verification, COVID-19 vaccination status and authenticating digital ownership through&nbsp;NFT’s.</p><p>Conclusion: Envisioning An Evolved NFT&nbsp;Paradigm</p>NFT’s Have Come So Far, Yet We Have A Far Way To&nbsp;Go<p>It is evident that since the inception of NFT’s in 2014, the concept and expansion of non-fungible tokens has occurred exponentially over the last seven years. We have seen over 170 million dollars spent on NFT’s since 2017, different blockchain projects creating their own NFT marketplaces, effectively competing with Ethereum by creating low-cost and scalable alternatives, and we’re beginning to see the availability of cross-chain NFT technology. The overall future prospect of NFT’s is yet to be seen, but for what we can empirically observe now, we can presume that NFT’s have a bright&nbsp;future.</p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency and NFT investing requires substantial risk, do not invest more than you can afford to lose!

 Java has been able to invoke native programs on an operating system for decades. Invoking native programs is often done using JNI (Java Native Interface) and JNA (Java Native Access). In the last few years, Java has also gained the ability to run JVM apps as native apps. That is, they’re binary executables that have no dependency on the Java runtime.

<p>Java has been able to invoke native programs on an operating system for decades. Invoking native programs is often done using JNI (Java Native Interface) and JNA (Java Native Access). In the last few years, Java has also gained the ability to run JVM apps as native apps. That is, they’re binary executables that have no dependency on the Java runtime.</p>
 
 
<p>This is huge! Mostly because it gives Java apps the ability to start up in milliseconds (as opposed to seconds). If you’re scaling up to handle millions of requests and using a serverless environment to save costs, this is a game-changer. Developers have enjoyed using Node.js, Python, and Go on serverless environments for years. The ability to use Java (or Kotlin) opens this world up to a massive swath of the developer community.</p>
 
 
<p>This post will show you how to run a secure, OAuth 2.0-protected, Java REST API that allows JWT authentication. I’ll showcase the three leading Java frameworks: Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot. First, I’ll show you how to run them with Java and access their data. Then, I’ll show you how to build and test native images with each framework. I’ll mention a few gotchas I ran into along the way.</p>

 Get Started with Native Java Frameworks 
 
 
<p>I created a GitHub repository you can clone and run to get started with all three frameworks quickly.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/native-java-examples.git</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This project has directories with the latest versions of Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot (at the time of this writing). I’ll show you how I created them in individual sections below.</p>
 
 
<p>Open the <code>native-java-examples</code> directory in your favorite IDE, so you have easy access to each framework’s project files.</p>
 
 






If you want to see how to build native images in each framework, skip to the <a>build native images for Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot</a> section.



 
 
 
 
 Install a JDK with GraalVM 
 
 
<p>You will need a JDK with GraalVM and its <code>native-image</code> compiler. Using SDKMAN, run the following command and set it as the default:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>sdk install java 21.1.0.r11-grl</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Add the native extension to the JDK:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>gu install native-image</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Launch a Micronaut Java API 
 
 
<p>In a terminal window, cd into the <code>micronaut</code> directory and run <code>mn:run</code> to start it.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd micronaut
./mvn mn:run</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you open another terminal window and try to access it with HTTPie, you’ll get a 401 Unauthorized error.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>$ http :8080/hello

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
connection: keep-alive
transfer-encoding: chunked</code> 
 
 
 
<p>To make it so you can access this endpoint, you’ll need to generate an OAuth 2.0 access token and update the JWKS (JSON Web Key Sets) URL to yours (in this project’s <code>application.yml</code>).</p>
 
 






If you’re unsure what OIDC and OAuth 2.0 are, see our <a>Illustrated Guide to OAuth and OpenID Connect</a>.



 
 
<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>
 
 
<p>Use <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>https://oidcdebugger.com</code>.</p>
 

  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>https://oidcdebugger.com</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Single-Page App</a> for more information.</p>


 
<p>Take note of the <code>clientId</code> and <code>issuer</code> values. You’ll need those to get an access token and to configure each framework for JWT authentication.</p>
 
 
<p>Open <code>micronaut/src/main/resources/application.yml</code> and change the Okta URL to match yours.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>micronaut:
  application:
    name: app
  security:
    enabled: true
    token:
      jwt:
        enabled: true
        claims-validators:
          issuer: /oauth2/default
        signatures:
          jwks:
            okta:
              url: /oauth2/default/v1/keys</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Stop your Micronaut app with Ctrl+C and restart it with ⬆️+Return.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvn mn:run</code> 
 
 
 
 Generate an OAuth 2.0 Access Token 
 
<p>An easy way to get an access token is to generate one using <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a>. First, you must configure your application on Okta to use OpenID Connect’s implicit flow.</p>
 
 
<p>Run <code>okta login</code> and open the resulting URL in your browser. Go to the Applications section and select the application you just created. Edit its General Settings and add Implicit (Hybrid) as an allowed grant type, with access token enabled. Then, make sure it has <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code> in its Login redirect URIs. Click Save and copy the client ID for the next step.</p>
 
 
<p>Now, navigate to the <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OpenID Connect Debugger</a> website. Fill in your client ID, and use <code>/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code> for the Authorize URI. The <code>state</code> field must be filled but can contain any characters. Select token for the response type.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Click Send Request to continue.</p>
 
 
<p>Once you have an access token, set it as a <code>TOKEN</code> environment variable in a terminal window.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>TOKEN=eyJraWQiOiJYa2pXdjMzTDRBYU1ZSzNGM...</code> 
 
 
 






You might want to keep OpenID Connect &lt;debugger/&gt; open to copy your access tokens. It allows you to quickly start over and regenerate a new access token if it expires.



 
 
 
 Test Your Micronaut API with HTTPie 
 
<p>Use HTTPie to pass the JWT in as a bearer token in the <code>Authorization</code> header.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should get a 200 response with your email in it.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Build a Native Micronaut App 
 
<p>To compile this Micronaut app into a native binary, run:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw package -Dpackaging=native-image</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This command will take a few minutes to complete. My 2019 MacBook Pro with a 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor and 64 GB of RAM took 1 min. 28 s. to finish.</p>
 
 
<p>Start it with <code>./target/app</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 $ ./target/app
 __  __ _                                  _

  Micronaut (v2.5.6)

17:20:23.980 [main] INFO  io.micronaut.runtime.Micronaut - Startup completed in 25ms. Server Running: http://localhost:8080 
 
 
 
<p>You can see it starts pretty darn quick (25ms)! Test it with HTTPie and an access token. You may have to generate a new JWT with <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com">oidcdebugger.com</a> if yours has expired.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN"</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Make a Micronaut App from Scratch 
 
<p>You might be wondering, "how did you build a secure Micronaut app"? Did I just hide the complexity? No, it only takes five steps to create the same app.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Use <a href="https://sdkman.io">SDKMAN!</a> to install Micronaut’s CLI:</p>
 
 
 sdk install micronaut 
 
 
 
 
<p>Create an app using the <code>mn create-app</code> command and rename the project’s directory:</p>
 
 
 mn create-app com.okta.rest.app --build maven
mv app micronaut 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add Micronaut’s libraries for JWT security:</p>
 
 
 <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.micronaut.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;micronaut-security&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.micronaut.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;micronaut-security-jwt&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add a <code>HelloController</code> in <code>src/main/java/com/okta/rest/controller</code>:</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.controller;

import io.micronaut.http.MediaType;
import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Controller;
import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get;
import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Produces;
import io.micronaut.security.annotation.Secured;
import io.micronaut.security.rules.SecurityRule;

import java.security.Principal;

@Controller("/hello")
public class HelloController {

    @Get
    @Secured(SecurityRule.IS_AUTHENTICATED)
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello(Principal principal) {
        return "Hello, " + principal.getName() + "!";
    }

}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Enable and configure JWT security in <code>src/main/resources/application.yml</code>:</p>
 
 
 <code>micronaut:
  ...
  security:
    enabled: true
    token:
      jwt:
        enabled: true
        claims-validators:
          issuer: /oauth2/default
        signatures:
          jwks:
            okta:
              url: /oauth2/default/v1/keys</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>That’s it! Now you can start the app or build the native image as shown above.</p>
 
 
<p>Now let’s take a look at Quarkus.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Run a Quarkus Java API 
 
 
<p>Open a terminal, cd into the <code>quarkus</code> directory, and run <code>quarkus:dev</code> to start the app.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>cd quarkus
./mvnw quarkus:dev</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Update the URLs in <code>quarkus/src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to use your Okta domain.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=/oauth2/default/v1/keys
mp.jwt.verify.issuer=/oauth2/default</code> 
 
 
 
 Test Your Quarkus API with HTTPie 
 
<p>Generate or copy an access token from OpenID Connect &lt;debugger/&gt; and use it to test your Quarkus API.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should see your email in the response.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Did you notice that Quarkus hot-reloaded your <code>application.properties</code> file updates? Pretty slick, eh?!</p>
 
 
 
 Build a Native Quarkus App 
 
<p>To compile this Quarkus app into a native binary, run:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw package -Pnative</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The native compilation step will take a bit to complete. On my 2019 MacBook Pro, it took 1 min. 9 s.</p>
 
 
<p>Start it with <code>./target/quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner</code>:</p>
 
 
 
 $ ./target/quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner

<p>Supersonic Subatomic Java (in 14ms)! Test it with HTTPie and an access token.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN"</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Create a Quarkus App from Scratch 
 
<p>You can create the same Quarkus app used in this example in five steps.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Use Maven to generate a new Quarkus app with JWT support:</p>
 
 
 <code>mvn io.quarkus:quarkus-maven-plugin:1.13.7.Final:create \
    -DprojectGroupId=com.okta.rest \
    -DprojectArtifactId=quarkus \
    -DclassName="com.okta.rest.quarkus.HelloResource" \
    -Dpath="/hello" \
    -Dextensions="smallrye-jwt"</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Edit <code>src/java/com/okta/rest/quarkus/HelloResource.java</code> and add user information to the <code>hello()</code> method:</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.quarkus;

import io.quarkus.security.Authenticated;

import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Context;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import javax.ws.rs.core.SecurityContext;
import java.security.Principal;

@Path("/hello")
public class HelloResource {

    @GET
    @Path("/")
    @Authenticated
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello(@Context SecurityContext context) {
        Principal userPrincipal = context.getUserPrincipal();
        return "Hello, " + userPrincipal.getName() + "!";
    }

}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add your Okta endpoints to <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code>:</p>
 
 
 <code>mp.jwt.verify.publickey.location=/oauth2/default/v1/keys
mp.jwt.verify.issuer=/oauth2/default</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Modify the <code>HelloResourceTest</code> to expect a 401 instead of a 200:</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.quarkus;

import io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusTest;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import static io.restassured.RestAssured.given;

@QuarkusTest
public class HelloResourceTest {

    @Test
    public void testHelloEndpoint() {
        given()
            .when().get("/hello")
            .then()
            .statusCode(401);
    }

}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add HTTPS support to the native profile at the bottom of <code>pom.xml</code> with the <code>quarkus.native.additional-build-args</code> property:</p>
 
 
 <code>&lt;properties&gt;
  &lt;quarkus.package.type&gt;native&lt;/quarkus.package.type&gt;
  &lt;quarkus.native.additional-build-args&gt;
    --enable-url-protocols=https
  &lt;/quarkus.native.additional-build-args&gt;
&lt;/properties&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>The last step is not necessary if you’re running with Maven, but it is for the native image. Quarkus <a href="https://quarkus.io/guides/native-and-ssl">includes SSL for many extensions</a>, but not for SmallRye JWT. The good news is <a href="https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/17929">Quarkus will enable SSL by default for SmallRye JWT in Quarkus 2.0.0.Final</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Last but certainly not least, let’s look at Spring Boot.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Start a Spring Boot Java API 
 
 
<p>In your IDE, update the issuer in <code>spring-boot/src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to use your Okta domain.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=/oauth2/default</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, start your app from your IDE or using a terminal:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run</code> 
 
 
 
 Test Your Spring Boot API with HTTPie 
 
<p>Generate an access token using ttps://oidcdebugger.com[oidcdebugger.com] and use it to test your Spring Boot API.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN"</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should see a response like the following.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>But wait, doesn’t Okta <a>have a Spring Boot starter</a>? Yes, we do—however, it <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot/issues/192">doesn’t work with GraalVM yet</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>However, we’re calling in an expert to help us fix it! Join us next Tuesday, June 22, 2021, on <a href="https://twitch.tv/oktadev">twitch.tv/oktadev</a> for a session with <a href="https://twitter.com/starbuxman">Josh Long</a>. We’ll attempt to fix things live!</p>
 
 
 
 Build a Native Spring Boot App 
 
<p>To compile this Spring Boot app into a native executable, you can use the Spring Boot Maven plugin:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw spring-boot:build-image</code> 
 
 
 
<p>The native compilation step will take a bit to complete. On my 2019 MacBook Pro, it took 2 min. 56 s.</p>
 
 
<p>Start it using Docker:</p>
 
 
 
 $ docker run -p 8080:8080 docker.io/library/demo:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT

<p>Bootiful! Test your API with HTTPie and an access token.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>http :8080/hello Authorization:"Bearer $TOKEN"</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Start a Spring Boot App from Scratch 
 
<p>To create the Spring Boot app used in this example, it’s just five steps.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Use HTTPie to generate a new Spring Boot app with OAuth 2.0 support:</p>
 
 
 <code>http https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
     bootVersion==2.5.1 \
     dependencies==web,oauth2-resource-server,native \
     packageName==com.okta.rest \
     name==spring-boot \
     type==maven-project \
     baseDir==spring-boot | tar -xzvf -</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add a <code>HelloController</code> class that returns the user’s information:</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.controller;

import org.springframework.security.core.annotation.AuthenticationPrincipal;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

import java.security.Principal;

@RestController
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello(Principal principal) {
        return "Hello, " + principal.getName() + "!";
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Configure the app to be an OAuth 2.0 resource server by adding an issuer to <code>application.properties</code>:</p>
 
 
 <code>spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=/oauth2/default</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Add a <code>SecurityConfiguration</code> class to configure JWT authentication:</p>
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest;

import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configurers.oauth2.server.resource.OAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer;

@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests(request -&gt; request.anyRequest().authenticated())
            .oauth2ResourceServer(OAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer::jwt);
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
<p>Enable HTTPS for native builds by adding a <code>@NativeHint</code> annotation to the <code>DemoApplication</code> class.</p>
 
 
 <code>import org.springframework.nativex.hint.NativeHint;

@SpringBootApplication
@NativeHint(options = "--enable-url-protocols=https")</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>You can build and test a Spring Boot native image using the steps I outlined above.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 Build Native Images for Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot 
 
 
<p>To recap, Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot all support building native executables with <a href="https://www.graalvm.org/">GraalVM</a>. Yes, there are other frameworks, but these three <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=micronaut,quarkus,spring%20boot">seem to be the most popular</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>The commands to build each app are similar but not quite the same.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Micronaut: <code>./mvnw package -Dpackaging=native-image</code></p>
 
 
<p>Quarkus: <code>./mvnw package -Pnative</code></p>
 
 
<p>Spring Boot: <code>./mvnw spring-boot:build-image</code></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Of course, they all support Gradle too.</p>
 
 
 Startup Time Comparison 
 
<p>Performance comparisons are complex, but I’m going to do one anyway. Since this post is all about native Java, below is the data I gathered that shows the average milliseconds to start each native executable. I ran each image three times before I started recording the numbers. I then ran each command five times.</p>
 
 
<p>These numbers are from a 2019 MacBook Pro with a 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor and 64 GB of RAM. I think it’s important to note that my WiFi connection was 340 Mbps down and 246 Mbps up (according to the Speedtest app).</p>
 

Table 1. Native Java Startup times in milliseconds







Framework
Command executed
Milliseconds to start




<p>Micronaut</p>
<p><code>./target/app</code></p>
<p>20.4</p>


<p>Quarkus</p>
<p><code>./target/quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner</code></p>
<p>13.4</p>


<p>Spring Boot</p>
<p><code>docker run -p 8080:8080 docker.io/library/demo:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</code></p>
<p>60.6</p>



 
<p>The chart below should help you visualize this comparison.</p>
 

 

 
<p>The Spring Boot startup times looked a little long, so I contacted my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/starbuxman">Josh Long</a>. We did a debugging session over Zoom and discovered the longer startup times are because Spring Security is doing OIDC discovery with the issuer.</p>
 
 
<p>Spring Boot’s "initialization completed" time seemed to be right around 30ms. The duration between that and the "Started in …​" time is the time it takes to make the call to Okta. We tried optimizing it by just using the JWKS URI. For example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.jwk-set-uri=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/keys</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This only improved the startup time by 1.6ms (59ms on average).</p>
 
 
<p>We also experimented with using <code>./mvnw package -Pnative</code> for Spring Boot. This allows you to create a native binary and run it with <code>./target/demo</code>. There’s no need for Docker with this command. Startup times are relatively the same in my and Josh’s experience.</p>
 
 
<p>Our hypothesis is Micronaut and Quarkus do the JWKS lookup on the first request rather than at startup. That’s how they achieve faster startup times.</p>
 
 






We later confirmed this hypothesis with <a href="https://github.com/JasonTypesCodes">Jason Schindler</a> (from Micronaut) and <a href="https://github.com/sberyozkin">Sergey Beryozkin</a> (from Quarkus).



 
 
<p>If I just take the value of the "initialization completed" time from Spring Boot, the numbers look a little more even.</p>
 
 

 
<p>I also tested the startup times on a Linux laptop with 64 GB of RAM. I used the value the framework displays for startup time and did not make the "initialization complete" adjustment for Spring Boot.</p>
 
 

 






If you disagree with these numbers and think X framework should be faster, I encourage you to clone <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/native-java-examples">the repo</a> and run these tests yourself. If you get faster startup times for Spring Boot, do you get faster startup times for Micronaut and Quarkus too?



 
 
 
 
 
 Testing Native Images 
 
 
<p>When building native images, it’s essential to test them as part of an integration testing process. This post is already long enough, so I won’t explain how to test native images in this post. We’ll publish a post in the future that covers this topic.</p>
 
 
<p>I do like how Quarkus generates a <code>NativeHelloResourceIT</code> that’s designed specifically for this, though.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>package com.okta.rest.quarkus;

import io.quarkus.test.junit.NativeImageTest;

@NativeImageTest
public class NativeHelloResourceIT extends HelloResourceTest {

    // Execute the same tests but in native mode.
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>However, this test did not help me <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67977862/quarkus-jwt-authentication-doesnt-work-as-a-native-app">detect an issue with my Quarkus native image</a> when writing this post. That’s because I was lazy in writing my test and changed it to confirm a 401 instead of <a href="https://quarkus.io/guides/security-openid-connect#integration-testing">testing it with Quarkus' OIDC testing support</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>In the meantime, see <a href="https://medium.com/graalvm/gradle-and-maven-plugins-for-native-image-with-initial-junit-testing-support-dde00a8caf0b">Gradle and Maven Plugins for Native Image with Initial JUnit 5 Testing Support</a>.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Learn More About Java and GraalVM 
 
 
<p>In this post, you learned how to develop, build, and run native Java apps with Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot. You learned how to secure them with OpenID Connect and access them with a JWT access token.</p>
 
 
<p>If you’re a Spring Boot aficionado, I recommend you watch Josh Long’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsUAGJqdvaA">Spring Tips: Spring Native 0.10.0</a> video.</p>
 
 
<p>You can find the source code for all the examples used in this post on GitHub in the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/native-java-examples">native-java-examples repository</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Server-side apps that serve up REST APIs aren’t the only thing that’s gone native in Java. <a href="https://twitter.com/gluonhq">Gluon</a> has done a lot of work in recent years to make JavaFX apps work on iOS and Android using GraalVM. See <a href="https://twitter.com/gail_asgteach">Gail Anderson</a>'s <a href="https://foojay.io/today/creating-mobile-apps-with-javafx-part-1/">Creating Mobile Apps with JavaFX – Part 1</a> to learn more about this emerging technology.</p>
 
 
<p>In the beginning, I mentioned JNI and JNA. Baeldung has some tutorials about both:</p>

<p>The regulators are coming. The regulators are coming.</p>



<p>Whether it’s FATF, FinCEN, CFTC, or one of many other governing bodies, lawmakers have been incrementally shaping new legislation aimed at further regulating centralized finance and DeFi. Most recently, the World Economic Forum <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/wef-defi-white-paper">published a white paper</a> to help policy makers understand DeFi, so that better guardrails may be designed for the ecosystem.</p>



<p>A confusing regulatory landscape</p>



<p>Companies in this new ecosystem, though, remain unclear on how to lawfully proceed. As we talk to companies about Civic age verification, log-in and KYC, we continue to hear a similar message from them: what should we do about compliance?</p>



<p>As an advisor offering identity services, it’s become clear to us that Civic can bring greater value to our existing and potential customers by offering more of what we do well.</p>



<p>That’s why we’re proud to share a window into the future of digital identity’s role in the DeFi ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Civic Compliance is coming soon</p>



<p>The new DeFi ecosystem makes it possible for anyone to trade using simply an internet connection and open-source code. The fact that these new marketplaces have proliferated illustrates the need for next generation financial services, but these solutions must begin to operate within the context of necessary compliance guardrails. Fortunately, digital identity with built-in compliance will help blockchain protocols, liquidity providers, and individuals create trust and comply with evolving regulations all at the same time.</p>



<p>More specifically, our newest offering, <a href="https://www.civic.com/solutions/compliance/">Civic Compliance</a>, will help DeFi companies and individuals know their counterparties, so that all parties can ensure KYC, AML requirements are met.</p>



<p>Civic is uniquely positioned to create decentralized identities, putting users in control of their own personally identifiable information (PII) so they can access compliant DeFi services. Users of Civic Compliance may sign up once and then re-use their “attestation” again and again. This gives protocols and liquidity providers visibility into each and every user transaction. And, it gives users more control over their PII.</p>



<p>Partners in compliance</p>



<p>Whether it’s KYC, AML or regulations not yet in place, Civic is a partner in meeting DeFi regulatory requirements, all while putting users back in control over their unique digital identities. We’re looking forward to sharing more about Civic Compliance.</p>

By providing a self-sovereign system of data authorization and ownership confirmation, ONT ID puts the power in the hands of&nbsp;users.</p><p>With ONT ID, ID generation, storage, and other critical operations, are fully automated and decentralized, allowing users operating within the ecosystem full control and ownership over any data associated with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Discrete IDs linked across various ecosystems can have multiple delegates and attributes. With verifiable credentials, entities (i.e. individuals, enterprises, institutions, devices) can make and verify claims related to data ownership, access rights, and validation.</p> Verifying Credentials with ONT&nbsp;ID <p>ONT ID allows you to verify credentials, whilst protecting your data and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>You can verify many different kinds of credentials such as passports, national IDs, and social media accounts. Verifying credentials is one way to boost your OScore (more on this&nbsp;later).</p><p>The beauty of ONT ID is that you, the user, decide who has access to your verified&nbsp;data.</p><p>For example, imagine a third party required you to verify an aspect of your identity, such as your nationality. With ONT ID, you could share this single data point whilst keeping your name, date of birth, home address, and any other sensitive information, completely private.</p><p>You can <a href="https://medium.com/onto/how-to-register-an-account-on-onto-wallet-96943997df2b">create an ONT ID</a> now by downloading <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a>, Ontology’s decentralized cross-chain wallet.</p> OScore <p><a href="https://www.ocredit.io/">OScore</a> is an independent on-chain reputation system, generated using on-chain data including your ONT ID, engagements, assets, and credentials.</p><p>Your <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/oscore-everything-you-need-to-know-57aa88b7b96f">OScore</a> is based on data authorized by you and is updated to reflect changes in behavior and lending practices.</p><p>OScore is not associated with your off-chain identities. In other words, it respects user privacy and supports full anonymity.</p><p>Your OScore increases as you add more decentralized data to your ONT&nbsp;ID.</p><p>A higher OScore brings with it certain benefits such as better lending rates on platforms like <a href="https://wing.finance/">Wing Finance</a>, Ontology’s credit-based DeFi platform.</p><p>OScore also benefits credit grantors, helping them decide whether to open a credit line and how much credit to extend to a particular borrower.</p> Summary <p>Let’s put together everything we’ve learned so&nbsp;far.</p>  Ontology’s decentralized identity (DID) framework is called ONT&nbsp;ID.  Create an ONT ID with <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a> to start verifying credentials.  Verifying credentials using your ONT ID helps boost your decentralized credit rating, aka&nbsp;OScore.  Having a higher OScore entitles you to certain benefits.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p> Simplifying access to IT services by building on platforms for IT workflows and beyond 
<p>ServiceNow, over the past few years, has emerged as one of the leaders in the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kclive10_2020_10_01_kuppinger" title="ITSM">ITSM</a> (IT Service Management) market and beyond to what today is named ESM (Enterprise Service Management). In fact, the evolution of that market has helped ITSM leave the bunker of IT, and become a strategic element for businesses.</p>
 ESM today is much bigger and more important than ITSM ever was 
<p>The reason is that ESM supports organizations in business process optimization, based on central platforms with centralized data management and workflow capabilities. ESM is way bigger and more essential than ITSM has ever been, because it is business-centric and user-centric, instead of the technical, IT-centric approach exemplified by ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library), one of the foundational principles of traditional ITSM. Yes, ITIL still plays a vital role for the IT core of ITSM and thus ESM, but it is just a small piece of the puzzle today.</p>
<p></p>
 For a seamless experience, Identity and Access Management must be integrated with ESM 
<p>Essentially, ESM combines the ability to automate and improve processes with the workflow capabilities on common platforms that allow customers as well as partners to extend the reach. While there is the potential risk of lock-in to such a platform, the advantages outweigh this risk for many buyers (or are buyers just ignoring the lock-in risk, e.g. to ServiceNow?). ESM provides (relatively) user-friendly access to IT services. This is of ever-increasing importance, driven by trends such as Cloud Computing and Cloud first, Work from Home, and Citizen Development.</p>
<p>Cloud Computing: With more and more services procured from the cloud, and a higher rate of change in the use of services, managing these services and making them accessible to the users becomes of ever-increasing importance. Managing access and the identities of users, must integrate with the ESM platforms for a seamless experience.</p>
<p>Work from Home: We’ve all learned over the past 15 months that the delivery of new services must become seamless. Walking to the desk of the user and administering the local machine does not work anymore in the age of WfH. Seamless procurement of services is essential in today’s dispersed work environments.</p>
 Usability is not only a matter User Interfaces but of ubiquitous digital identity thinking 
<p>Citizen Development: Low-code and no-code platforms are changing the way of developing solutions. Many solutions are built by the business. They still need management. Platforms that unify initiatives and that help in getting a grip on all services, become essential.</p>
<p>ESM is an approach that helps address many of the emerging needs of businesses in delivering their services, where IT is not IT anymore, but ubiquitous across all parts of the business. Strategic platforms can help here, despite the lock-in risk. But they will only work with the context of the user: Who can do what, who is allowed to access which service, etc. Usability is not only a matter of UI, but of ubiquitous digital identity thinking across these platforms – and the platforms might also serve as an element or even the foundation of the IAM infrastructure.</p>

<p>Tim is the technical director at the Urbit Foundation, and wrote the backend for the Urbit Bitcoin wallet. He is currently managing <code>volt</code>, a project to integrate a Lightning client into Urbit.  This workshop will be interactive — Tim will take questions throughout, and will conduct another session later if material remains.</p>
<p>As always, there will be an informal call afterwards to hang out. We will also open a Bitcoin development channel on Urbit specifically to handle follow-ups from this and for those who can't make it live.</p>

It would be useful to be able to attach arbitrary metadata to a user, both in textual format to describe them, graph-store links to materials they've written, automated lists of groups they're in, and programmatically-accessible metadata that can be used for filtering and permissioning.</p>
<p>These contact lists could then be shared between ships as a way to jumpstart people into your social network. Alternate interfaces to chats could give read/write access to them.  While it's unlikely that this exact product would be what people finally use, it would go a long way towards feeling out the user-metadata design space.</p>
<p>This project would be great for someone who wanted to learn more about how Urbit data storage and sharing between apps works, as well as understanding how to interact with <code>graph-store</code>.</p>
 User Stories 
<p>As a user I can:</p>
 
 add text data to another user 
 add permissions/markers to another user 
 create a collection of <code>graph-store</code> links with data about the user 
 automatically collect known groups the user is in 
 search the user's written materials in <code>graph-store</code> (using <code>graph-query</code> or similar). 
 share metadata about users with other ships, along with ways of merging it.

<p>Do consumers&nbsp;even&nbsp;want personalized ads&nbsp;on their devices?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer is yes and no.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, they want a personalized shopping experience for all the reasons marketers&nbsp;cite&nbsp;in defense of their practices: targeted ads&nbsp;matched to immediate needs and interests&nbsp;save shoppers time and money&nbsp;and&nbsp;can&nbsp;enhance their online experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But&nbsp;also&nbsp;no,&nbsp;increasingly consumers&nbsp;don’t want personalization when it comes&nbsp;at the expense&nbsp;of their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And that’s the kicker, isn’t it? As&nbsp;brands&nbsp;continue&nbsp;to&nbsp;embrace data-driven sales strategies&nbsp;and&nbsp;invest in technologies like&nbsp;artificial intelligence&nbsp;and&nbsp;machine learning to go beyond&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-future-of-personalization-and-how-to-get-ready-for-it">personalization</a>&nbsp;into&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/smartkarrot/hyper-personalization-the-next-wave-of-customer-engagement-9e68c7a7c9ad">hyper-personalization</a>&nbsp;(think web sites that already know your clothing size and color preferences, for example), consumers are&nbsp;growing louder&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">their demand</a>&nbsp;for better&nbsp;data&nbsp;protection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s the business challenge of this&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">decade</a>: how to engage and convert customers&nbsp;in a&nbsp;fast-paced digital&nbsp;market&nbsp;while being&nbsp;good&nbsp;and&nbsp;compliant&nbsp;stewards&nbsp;of their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal data</a>?&nbsp;There are two sides to this coin: personalization is improving the user experience, but&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">data abuse is growing</a>—and consumers are noticing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those of us in the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/">privacy space</a>&nbsp;completely understand the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/8-key-takeaways-from-the-rise-of-privacy-tech-panel-with-our-co-ceo-dr-paul-ashley/">problem</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;fix&nbsp;and are&nbsp;helping brands rapidly&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">bring it to market</a>:&nbsp;building privacy-first products and services that&nbsp;give&nbsp;consumers power over their privacy,&nbsp;and&nbsp;companies an easy way to engage without collecting, managing and risking personal data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s a&nbsp;‘middle ground’&nbsp;solution that brands must rapidly engage or risk alienating their customers.&nbsp;The stats tell the story:&nbsp;</p>



  As far back as 2012, Pew Research found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2012/03/13/internet-users-dont-like-targeted-ads/">68 percent</a>&nbsp;of US consumers&nbsp;don’t like targeted ads and disapprove of the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-the-data-economy-and-why-should-we-care/">invasive data surveillance</a>&nbsp;that drives them.&nbsp;  Seven years later&nbsp;in 2019 Pew Research found&nbsp;an even higher number of US consumers, at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/">81 percent</a>,believes&nbsp;the&nbsp;potential risks&nbsp;from data-driven products and services&nbsp;outweigh the benefits.&nbsp;  This past February in Europe,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/blog/do-people-really-want-personalised-ads-online/">YouGov</a>&nbsp;polled 2,000 consumers&nbsp;in France and Germany&nbsp;and found 57 percent don’t want personalized ads on their devices and feel&nbsp;“deeply uncomfortable” about the granular categorization&nbsp;based on highly personal&nbsp;information,&nbsp;such as illness, pregnancy and religion,&nbsp;that drives it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>Media and ad&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2020/12/07/media-an-advertising-outlook-in-2021/?sh=6b4aa47e70cc">experts</a>&nbsp;get the point:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yashina&nbsp;Burns, Director, Data Privacy and Legal Affairs at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.deepintent.com/">Deep&nbsp;Intent</a>, told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2020/12/07/media-an-advertising-outlook-in-2021/?sh=6b4aa47e70cc">Forbes</a>: “While CPRA won’t become law until 2023, other states will likely create similar regulations in the interim and further push the ad industry to adopt targeting technologies that are more conscious of consumer privacy. Marketing leaders need to get ready now by focusing on privacy-friendly solutions that limit the use of sensitive personal information. Publishers and platforms that offer compliant data collection across platforms – especially in the healthcare space where privacy is of the utmost importance – will be well-positioned to continue the services they offer to marketers amid the coming regulatory change.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mike Edmonds,&nbsp;CEO&nbsp;of global digital&nbsp;services giant&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pacteraedge.com/">Pactera EDGE</a>&nbsp;says similar:&nbsp;“The challenge moving forward into 2021 will be the continued delivery of personalized experiences while maintaining compliance with existing privacy laws and those regulations appearing on the horizon.&nbsp;It’s a delicate balancing act marketers will have to pull off as consumers&nbsp;increasingly embrace the hyper-personalization experience, but also demand transparency when it comes to how their information is being used.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/blog/do-people-really-want-personalised-ads-online/">YouGov</a>&nbsp;poll of consumers in France and Germany we mentioned earlier says it’s the&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/02/beware-the-dark-patterns-trying-to-steal-your-data/">behind the scenes</a>&nbsp;or back door nature of personalization that gives people the creeps.&nbsp;This perception isn’t helped&nbsp;by the fact consent to&nbsp;datapractices&nbsp;is&nbsp;often so&nbsp;convoluted and tied&nbsp;to&nbsp;long-winded&nbsp;terms and conditions&nbsp;and privacy policies&nbsp;that&nbsp;consumersdon’t know exactly what&nbsp;it is&nbsp;they’re agreeing to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The YouGov research&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/blog/do-people-really-want-personalised-ads-online/">commissioning agency</a>&nbsp;says,&nbsp;“The EU has a unique opportunity to tackle these issues by making sure existing privacy rules are enforced and by bringing in new rules via the Digital Services Act (DSA). We’re calling on Members of the European Parliament to amend the DSA to ensure users can see all the ways they’ve been targeted and prevent surveillance overreach.” &nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re still&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/a-us-national-privacy-law-looks-more-likely-than-ever/">waiting to see</a>&nbsp;how US consumers&nbsp;might&nbsp;get similar,&nbsp;national data and privacy protections.&nbsp;In the meantime, we suggest brands recognize&nbsp;both the&nbsp;opportunity to deliver consumer applications with <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/how-we-apply-the-7-principles-of-privacy-by-design/">privacy at their core</a>, and the&nbsp;responsibility to comply with <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">tightening regulations</a>.&nbsp;Discover how&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo&nbsp;Platform</a>, our complete business toolkit for rapidly developing branded privacy and cybersecurity solutions,&nbsp;can help.&nbsp;</p>

 Plug-and-play Passwordless Authentication with Magic and Gatsby.js <p>If there’s one thing web developers know better than anyone else, it’s this: authentication sucks. Authentication is one of those things that seems simple yet oftentimes ends up being a frustrating, overly-complicated process. Even worse, your production app might be completely dependent on your auth server — if it goes down, you’re in&nbsp;trouble.</p><p>This is where <a href="https://magic.link/">Magic</a> comes in. With only a few lines of code, you can integrate Magic into your application to enable passwordless authentication using magic links (similar to Slack and&nbsp;Medium).</p> ✨ Why Magic&nbsp;Links? <p>In my opinion, passwordless is simply better than the typical username/password authentication. It provides developers with a seamless development experience, users love the idea of not having to keep track of a password, and best of all: it works like magic; passwords disappear and everyone’s lives are just made&nbsp;easier.</p><p>Passwordless authentication is secure. Over 59% of people reuse their passwords everywhere, leading to poor passwords accounting for 81% of all security breaches [<a href="https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/2017_dbir.pdf">source</a>]. (Gentle reminder to update your passwords! I recommend rotating them every few&nbsp;months.)</p><p>Magic leverages blockchain-based, standardized pubic-key cryptography to achieve identity management. When a new user signs up via your Magic integration, a public-private key pair is automatically generated for&nbsp;them.</p><p>In order to authenticate requests, a user’s private keys are used to sign cryptographic proofs to verify their identity. Thus, your resource server will no longer need to store and manage (1) hashed + salted passwords or (2) user sessions in its database&nbsp;table.</p><p>To learn more about Magic’s enterprise-grade security thanks to the cutting-edge identity tech they use involving zero-knowledge proofs, delegated key management and decentralized ID tokens, visit their <a href="https://docs.magic.link/security">security page</a> or read <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/3flqaszoigwis5b/Magic%20Whitepaper.pdf?dl=0">Magic’s Whitepaper</a>.</p> 💻 An Enhanced Developer Experience <p><a href="https://magic.link/">Magic</a> is a developer SDK that you can integrate into any application to enable blazing-fast, hardware-secured passwordless authentication with just a few lines of code (even if you already have an existing auth solution). The Magic SDK currently offers support for <a href="https://docs.magic.link/#start-building">32+ ecosystems</a> — from Social Logins like Google, Facebook, and Github to Blockchains like Ethereum, Polkadot, and&nbsp;Solana.</p><p>Here’s how it&nbsp;works:</p><p>When a user wants to sign up or log in to your application:</p>  User requests a magic link sent to their email&nbsp;address  User clicks on that magic&nbsp;link  User is securely logged into the application  <p>In this tutorial, we’ll demonstrate just how easy it is to get started integrating with Magic in just a few lines of&nbsp;code.</p> 👩🏻‍💻 Integrating Magic with Gatsby.js <p><a href="https://gatsbyjs.com">Gatsby.js</a> is a <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>-based static site generator powered by <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/">GraphQL</a>. Gatsby essentially takes the best parts of React, Webpack, GraphQL, and various front-end tools to provide a seamless developer experience. If you’re new to Gatsby, you can learn more from their documentation <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs">here</a>.</p><p>I’m personally a huge fan of Gatsby and have built dozens websites with it. It’s great for building portfolio sites or blogs, both of which you can easily integrate with Magic — which I’ll demonstrate below.</p> 🛠 What We’ll&nbsp;Build <p>In this tutorial we’ll be integrating Magic to a static Gatsby.js site and deploying it to Netlify. Feel free to view and try out the production application live on Netlify&nbsp;<a href="https://magic-gatsby.netlify.app/">here</a>.</p> Step 1: Clone the Starter Template &amp; Install Dependencies <p>To get started, clone the starter template from Github <a href="https://github.com/morganrmarie/passwordless-authentication-tutorial">here</a>. We’ll be working out of the dev/ directory, but feel free to play around with the final code in the prod/ directory. I recommend following along with the tutorial before jumping into the production code.</p><p>To clone the starter template, run the following command from your terminal:<br>git clone <a href="https://github.com/morganrmarie/passwordless-authentication-tutorial.git">https://github.com/morganrmarie/passwordless-authentication-tutorial.git</a></p><p>Change to the tutorial’s directory:<br>cd passwordless-authentication-tutorial</p><p>And install the project’s dependencies from the root directory:<br>cd dev &amp;&amp; npm install<br>cd prod &amp;&amp; npm&nbsp;install</p><p>If you’d like to try the final application, you can run the production application locally from the root folder:<br>npm run start:prod</p><p>Otherwise, to follow along with the tutorial, spin up the development server (also from the root folder):<br>npm run start:dev</p> Step 2: Initialize Magic <p>Before we get started integrating Magic into our application, I recommend you take a look at <a href="https://docs.magic.link/">Magic’s documentation</a>. They’ve got easy-to-follow documentation and helpful <a href="https://magic.link/guides">guides</a> on other most commonly used developer tools.</p><p>The starter template for this tutorial lies in the dev/ directory of this tutorial's codebase. To begin integrating Magic, we'll need to install the Magic Client SDK in the dev/ directory:<br>npm install --save magic-sdk</p><p>By default Gatsby supports two environments: development and production. To support both environments, we’ll create two files in the root of the dev/ and prod/ directories:&nbsp;.env.development and&nbsp;.env.production. Copy the contents (it's only one variable) of&nbsp;.env.example to both&nbsp;files.</p><p>Before we initialize Magic, you’ll need to sign up to the <a href="https://dashboard.magic.link/signup">Magic Dashboard</a> to get your own API keys.

 Consortium Partners, Jungheinrich AG and Evan Developing a Blockchain-based IoT Infrastructure Utilizing Self-sovereign Identities for Sharing Machines 
<p>Dresden, Germany,&nbsp; June 16, 2021&nbsp; – Evan GmbH, a subsidiary of Blockchains, Inc., announced that it has begun the implementation phase of its ID-Ideal Consortium project in the&nbsp; <a href="https://id-ideal.hs-mittweida.de/">Secure Digital Identities Innovation Competition</a> . Implementation is the second part of the multi-month, two-phase competition sponsored by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi). After being named a winner during the first phase of the competition in November 2020, the ID-Ideal Consortium project was awarded approximately 15 million euros in funding, to be paid out over the next three years.</p>
<p>The mission of the ID-Ideal Consortium is to create a blockchain-based trust network where digital data can be securely exchanged between companies, citizens, and administration. The consortium currently consists of 40 partners including evan, which also provides <a href="https://evan.network/">evan.network</a> , the infrastructure where consortium partners can engage securely.</p>
<p>“We are honored to have been chosen and to be awarded this funding from the BMWi. It will enable us to drive innovation on secure digital identities together with the partners of the ID-Ideal Consortium and to illustrate the importance and value of these on real use cases, ”says Thomas Müller, CEO of evan GmbH. “Within the consortium, we focus on building a digital infrastructure with which companies can securely and autonomously make physical resources digitally available and integrate them into multi-party processes. We believe that the true success of Industry 4.0 will be measured by how we can more easily and securely share resources and exchange data: human-to-human, machine-to-human, and machine-to-machine. “</p>
<p>One example of an ID-Ideal Consortium innovation that partners Jungheinrich AG and evan are working on is the digitalization of the rental process for industry trucks and forklifts using blockchain-based digital identities. With a digital identity, the prospective renter can be attested and verified by the rental company that they have a valid driver’s license to rent and operate the machine. The prospective renter can also view important data about the rental machine in advance, such as operating hours or the last maintenance date. All of this can be done in a blockchain-based digital world, including processing the payment – further minimizing administrative work and eliminating the need for physical paper documents.</p>
<p>Evan is also helping the ID-Ideal Consortium to enable companies to prove compliance with regulatory requirements in multi-stage supply chains. Digital identities built on blockchain technology can be used to trace product lifecycles from manufacturing to usage to recycling. In addition to optimizing processes, this data can also be used to reduce carbon emissions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ID-Ideal Consortium has a broad and diverse membership to better understand and be able to meet the variety of requirements of today’s businesses that want to enable digital identity-based exchanges. The consortium is led by the University of Applied Sciences Dresden. In addition to evan GmbH and Jungheinrich AG, members of the project team include HTW Dresden, the state capital of Dresden, the Leipzig city administration or Fraunhofer FIT.</p>

  <p>Sessions can be a challenging topic for developers of all skill levels.  Many React developers never consider the internals of session management because so much of the work is abstracted away.  But, it is important to understand  what sessions are, how they work, and how best to manage and manipulate them.</p>

<p>There are several different strategies for session management in React.  In this article, you will learn the basics about sessions, how to manage them in React, and see some examples using common packages.</p>

 Session Management Overview 

<p>The first thing you should know is what exactly a “session” is.  In its simplest terms, a session is some data that is stored on the server.  The server then provides an ID to the client, which the client can use to make requests back to the server.  For example, if you needed access to a user’s email address, you could store it against the session, then return an <code>ID</code> to the client.  The client could then request an email be sent using the <code>ID</code>, rather than passing his/her  email back to the server.  The  <code>ID</code> field is opaque, meaning that the client knows nothing about what is saved against the ‘ID’ field.  The <code>ID</code> can also contain validation and encryption.  And, the server can return client data, which would typically be encrypted, to the client that  he/she would frequently need.</p>

<p>In this article, I consider a range of server scenarios, as many times when working in React, developers don’t have control over what the server does.  For example, when passing session data, the server will include the data in a cookie.  The server may also expect a cookie to be present when making a request.  Therefore, as a react developer, you will be required to include this cookie in your requests.  You may also choose to store the data in <code>localStorage</code>, however  then the server doesn’t have access to it.  Local storage allows for more storage and can persist over browsing sessions, making it ideal for situations where you want to remember user actions across multiple browsing sessions.</p>

<p>Another situation where you may receive a cookie from the server,  is when it is marked <code>HttpOnly</code>.  When a cookie is marked <code>HttpOnly</code>, it cannot be read by the client in javascript.  This helps minimize the risk of attack against the cookie.  For example, if your site has a cross-site scripting vulnerability, marking the cookie <code>HttpOnly</code> will protect the cookie’s contents.  Of course, you still need the data that the cookie represents, so you should make a request to the server for the resource you need and present the cookie to the server.</p>

<p>Along these same lines, you should also understand cookie validation.  The server you are attempting to access should validate the cookie before processing any request on it.  There are many validation tools to help server-side developers, such as signing and expiring cookies.  Many times, the server will provide a way for you to check the state of a cookie without requesting a resource.</p>

 Manage Sessions in React 

<p>There are many packages for helping manage sessions in React.  If you are using Redux, <code>redux-react-session</code> is a popular choice.  If you are not, <code>react-session-api</code> is another helpful package found on npm.</p>

<p>Focusing on <code>redux-react-session</code>, the first thing you need to do is add your session reducer.</p>

   <code>import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
import { sessionReducer } from 'redux-react-session';
 
const reducers = {
  // ... your other reducers here ...
  session: sessionReducer
};

const reducer = combineReducers(reducers);
</code>   

<p>Next, you need to initialize your session service.</p>

   <code>import { createStore } from 'redux';
import { sessionService } from 'redux-react-session';
const store = createStore(reducer)

sessionService.initSessionService(store);
</code>   

<p>Once you are set up, you have access to the full API by the session service. There are several key benefits to this.</p>

<p>First, you have <code>initSessionService</code>.  As the name implies, this call will initiate  the session service. Below you can see an example of a call:</p>

   <code>import { createStore } from 'redux';
import { sessionService } from 'redux-react-session';
 
const store = createStore(reducer)

const validateSession = (session) =&gt; {
  // check if your session is still valid
  return true;
}

const options = { refreshOnCheckAuth: true, redirectPath: '/home', driver: 'COOKIES', validateSession };
 
sessionService.initSessionService(store, options)
  .then(() =&gt; console.log('Redux React Session is ready and a session was refreshed from your storage'))
  .catch(() =&gt; console.log('Redux React Session is ready and there is no session in your storage'));
</code>   

<p>To understand this call, you should understand the options that are passed in.  First is <code>refreshOnCheckAuth</code>.  This option defaults to <code>false</code>, but if set to <code>true</code>, will refresh the Redux store in the <code>checkAuth()</code> function.  The <code>checkAuth()</code> function is provided by the <code>sessionService</code> object from the <code>redux-react-session</code>.</p>

<p><code>redirectPath</code> defaults to <code>/login</code>.  This is the path used when the session is rejected or doesn’t exist.  Suppose a new user attempts to access a secured page by browsing to the URL directly.  Because there is no session, the user will be re-routed to <code>/login</code> by default, or <code>/home</code> in the example above.</p>

<p>Next is the <code>driver</code> option.  The two you have already learned about are <code>COOKIES</code> and <code>LOCALSTORAGE</code>, however <code>redux-react-session</code> also accepts <code>INDEXEDDB</code> or <code>WEBSQL</code>.  <code>IndexedDB</code> is a database that is built into the browser.  Applications that require a lot of client-side data storage should consider this option.  <code>Web SQL</code> is also a browser based database, however it is not supported in HTML5 and is deprecated.  <code>IndexedDB</code> is considered the default alternative to <code>Web SQL</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the <code>validateSession()</code> function.  This will pass the logic for session validation to the <code>sessionService</code>.  As discussed before, this is largely dependent on your server functionality.  If you can validate the session from the client-side, you can implement the logic here.  Otherwise, you can use <code>axios</code> or <code>fetch</code> to make a call to the server to request session validation.</p>

<p>Two other useful functions are <code>saveSession()</code> and <code>deleteSession()</code>.  It is a best practice to enforce some rules for deleting the session, though these rules will vary based on your use cases.  These functions return promises, as does the entire API.  To save the session, you need to pass your custom session object.  Setting the session also changes the <code>authenticated</code> flag to <code>true</code> in the Redux store.</p>

 Learn More About Sessions and React 

<p>Managing sessions in React is an immense topic. In this article, you learned the basics of session management and how to apply them to React.  You also learned how to use one of the most common react session management packages available.  But this is just a start.  I encourage you to look into more react session packages and continue to learn and understand how to properly manage the session.  Doing so will make your applications more secure and performant.</p>
