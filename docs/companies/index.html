 Understanding Face Liveness Detection and Its Role in Fraud Prevention 
<p>“Welcome to our comprehensive blog post in which we will describe, what is&nbsp; facial liveness detection and how it prevents fraud”</p>
<p>We are living in an era of 2025, where security has become more crucial than ever. With the astonishing rise of digital transactions, online authentications, and verifications, it is very important to ensure that the sensitive information of users is safe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are multiple ways to protect such sensitive data such as using encryption, multi-factor authentication, and biometric systems. Among them, facial liveness detection has also emerged as an innovative solution to enhance security.</p>
<p>If you are hearing this term for security for the first time, this blog post is b specially for you. In this guide, we shall tell you what is this facial liveness detection and how it works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us explore this blog post further in detail…..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is Face Liveness Detection? 
<p><a href="https://recognito.vision/face-liveness-detection-sdk/">Face liveness detection</a> is a cutting-edge security technology that is used to verify that a person’s facial features are real and live during authentication. This technology prevents agencies and companies from fraudulent activities like spoofing with fake images.</p>
<p>In short, we can say that this technology enhances security during digital transactions by ensuring that the users are physically present during authentication and biometrics. Once you understand this technology, now it’s time to know how it works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read the upcoming sections carefully…….</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Does Face Liveness Detection Technology Prevent Frauds? 
<p>You should understand this section carefully as it is the cornerstone of our blog. This is because, in this section, we will tell this technology’s working process by telling its types. It means that this section will cover two topics. Isn’t it great?</p>
 1. Active Liveness Facial Detection 
<p>Active <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-recognition-sdk/">face recognition</a> liveness detection refers to a process of authentication in which users have to perform some specific actions. It is an advanced method that is used to distinguish between a real person and a fake one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you will be thinking, how does this active liveness detection work? Right? Don’t worry, we have answered you in detail in the below section.</p>
 How does this liveness detection work? 
<p>As discussed previously, in this method of authentication, users are said to perform specific actions. But do you know, which actions are these? If no, read the described bulleted lines.</p>
 
 Blinking: The system asks users to blink their eyes during scanning. Now you can easily understand that such a blinking can never be achieved using a fake image or video. 
 Head movement: Most users are said to move their heads slightly in multiple directions to identify that a real person is present. Such movements can be little bit achieved by fake videos but not images. 
 Facial expressions: People during verification have to show some facial expressions such as smiling to ensure that the system has captured the more nuanced data. 
 
<p></p>
 Which types of fraud this liveness detection prevents? 
<p>There are several types of fraud that this facial liveness detection prevents. Let us discuss them also in bulleted lines.</p>
 
 Spoofing with images: Fraudsters attempt to use high-quality images of a person’s face to manipulate the facial recognition system. However, such fraud is easily tackled by this facial detection process. 
 Spoofing with videos: Unlike fake images, they can try to trick the system with fake videos of any person. This trick also fails in front of this system. 
 3D mask fraud: Fake people may use 3D masks of a person’s face to gain unauthorized access. But, in front of this detection system, this trick has no value. 
 
<p></p>
 2. Passive Liveness Facial Detection 
<p>Passive liveness facial detection is another way of verification and preventing fraud. However, this method is a little bit different from active liveness detection. This is because, in this method, users don’t have to perform specific functions as they have to do in active ones.</p>
<p>Here definitely, you will ask, how does this detection work? Right? Don’t worry, unlike the previous section, we will describe this one also in detail.</p>
 How does passive-liveness facial detection work? 
<p>Passive face recognition liveness detection analyzes and leverages the unique features of the human face to identify whether the person is fake or real. Here is how it does;</p>
 
 Light reflection: This sub-method of light reflection is all about analyzing how light reflects with the face. A real face can reflect the light in more complex and dynamic ways. On the contrary, images and videos can never reflect light, making the system enable to identify and prevent fraud. 
 Texture analysis: The system analyzes the skin texture and surface patterns on the face. Human skins have a distinctive texture that artificial or fake surfaces don’t have. This method is most valuable for differentiating between real faces and 2D images. 
 Micro movements: Unlike active detection, passive detection can also analyze facial movements such as blinking and other micro movements but only on low-level. 
 
<p></p>
 Which types of fraud does passive detection prevent? 



Here is a point to be noted;&nbsp;<p></p>
<p>we don’t need to describe this in detail. This is because this type of detection prevents the same frauds that are prevented by active-liveness facial recognition. For example, frauds done by image spoofing, video spoofings, and one of the most important 3D mask frauds.</p>



 
 Applications Of Facial Liveness Face Detection 
<p>In this section, we will describe the main 4 institutes where facial liveness detection is implemented to prevent fraud. Read the below section carefully.</p>
 
  Banking and finance: Fraudsters mainly target banking systems by using fake images and videos. Here facial liveness detection prevents them, enhancing banking security. 
  Healthcare: This technology makes sure that the person using healthcare services is the actual patient, keeping private medical details safe from being stolen. 
  E-commerce: Online shopping platforms use this cutting-edge technology to identify whether the customers are real and present or using someone’s fake photos or videos.

 Free Compute-to-Data with Ocean Nodes VS Code Extension <p>Today, we’re excited to announce the release of the Free Compute-to-Data (C2D) and <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OceanProtocol.ocean-protocol-vscode-extension">Ocean Nodes VS Code Extension</a> — a tool that brings the power of decentralized compute-to-data directly into your development environment.</p><p>Access to quality datasets is often the biggest hurdle in today’s world of data science and AI. Previously, Ocean Protocol provided compute-to-data through <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">OceanMarket</a>; now, we’re taking this solution one step further by integrating it directly into <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Virtual Studio Code</a>, the IDE of choice for millions of developers worldwide.</p><p>What’s more, you can now use compute-to-data for free! Yes, that’s right — while you’re still writing and iterating on your algorithm, you can do unlimited test runs on an Ocean Node for&nbsp;free.</p><p>Why Free?</p><p>Our goal has always been to help developers and data scientists build stronger AI and data-driven solutions. We know that testing new tools and workflows comes with uncertainty, and upfront costs can be a barrier. That’s why compute-to-data (C2D) is free for development and testing, so you can explore its potential without any friction.</p><p>This isn’t just about free access. It’s also about building a better product together. We want real users to try C2D, push its limits, and give us feedback. To help us refine the experience, improve performance, and ensure it delivers real&nbsp;value.</p><p>Even more so, with free compute-to-data, and the Ocean Nodes VS Code extension, you can experiment, refine, and optimize your models with confidence, without the frustration of burning through resources just to troubleshoot errors.</p><p>Why We Built The VS Code Extension?</p><p>Until now, using Ocean Protocol’s compute-to-data features required jumping between different tools and interfaces. Developers had&nbsp;to:</p>  Write algorithms in their&nbsp;IDE  Use Ocean Market or the command line interface to execute compute&nbsp;jobs  Wait for results without real-time feedback  Download and open&nbsp;results  <p>This context-switching created friction that slowed down the development cycle. Our VS Code extension eliminates these pain points by bringing the entire workflow into your editor. As soon as you write the algorithm, you can run it with Ocean’s free compute-to-data — just hit the “run algorithm” button in the VS Code extension.</p><p>What You Can Do With&nbsp;It</p><p>The extension enables you&nbsp;to:</p>  Run free compute jobs with one click: Select your algorithm file (Python or JavaScript), optionally choose a dataset, and start a compute job — all without leaving VS&nbsp;Code.  Monitor Progress in Real-Time: Watch as your algorithm runs on remote data, with logs streaming directly into the output in your&nbsp;editor.  Results are downloaded and saved instantly when your compute job completes.  Customize your environment. You can use your own custom Docker images and tags to set up the environment that your algorithm needs.  <p>How It&nbsp;Works</p><p>Behind the scenes, the extension connects to Ocean Protocol’s nodes, which orchestrate secure compute-to-data jobs. Your algorithm runs in an isolated environment with access to the dataset, but the raw data never leaves its secure location. Only the results are returned to&nbsp;you.</p><p>This approach preserves data privacy while allowing valuable insights to be extracted — a win-win for both data providers and consumers.</p><p>Getting Started in&nbsp;Minutes</p>  Install the extension from the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OceanProtocol.ocean-protocol-vscode-extension">VS Code Marketplace</a>  Open a Python or JavaScript algorithm file  Click the Ocean Protocol icon in the activity&nbsp;bar  Hit “Start Compute&nbsp;Job”  <p>That’s it! No complex setup, no account creation, just immediate access to Ocean Protocol’s compute&nbsp;network.</p><p>If you want to get further into the details, you can open the settings and optionally choose:</p>  The folder where you would like the results to be&nbsp;saved.  A specific node to the node the compute job&nbsp;on.  Your own docker&nbsp;image.  Your own private key, to keep the results&nbsp;secure.  <p>Real-World Applications</p><p>Imagine you’re developing a machine learning model to predict medical outcomes, but the healthcare data is too sensitive to be shared directly. With the Ocean Protocol VS Code Extension, you&nbsp;can:</p>  Write your algorithm locally in VS&nbsp;Code  Test it on sample&nbsp;data  Send it to run on the real dataset through compute-to-data  Get your model predictions back without ever seeing the raw patient&nbsp;data  <p>This same pattern works for financial analytics, consumer behaviour prediction, and countless other fields where data privacy is paramount.</p><p>Try It&nbsp;Today</p><p>The Ocean Nodes VS Code Extension is now available in the VS Code Marketplace. Whether you’re a data scientist, AI researcher, or a developer working with sensitive data, this tool will streamline your workflow while preserving data&nbsp;privacy.</p><p><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=OceanProtocol.ocean-protocol-vscode-extension">Download the extension</a> and start your first compute job&nbsp;today!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/free-compute-to-data-with-ocean-nodes-vscode-extension-1f8385cb077c">Free Compute-to-Data with Ocean Nodes VSCode Extension</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Citron Research is back with new stock reports for 2025. Their calls have always sparked debates. Some stocks soared, others collapsed. This year, they are eyeing undervalued stocks, market trends, and risky investments. Investors want to know: Should you follow their insights or stay cautious?&nbsp;</p>

 What is Citron Research? 



<p>Citron Research is not like traditional financial firms. They don’t just analyze stocks—they challenge the market’s beliefs. Their reports often expose overhyped companies while revealing hidden investment opportunities.</p>



<p>Andrew Left, Citron’s founder, has built a reputation for bold stock predictions. He famously shorted Tesla when it was still rising. He exposed fraud in Luckin Coffee before it collapsed. Some of his calls changed the way investors looked at entire industries.</p>



<p>But Citron has also made mistakes. They bet against Nvidia early and lost. They underestimated Shopify’s growth. Their stock market analysis is controversial, but one thing is certain—people listen to them.</p>

 2025 Stock Trends: What Citron Sees Coming 



<p>​In 2025, Citron Research has identified significant shifts across major industries, forecasting a transformative year for investors.​</p>



 AI Stocks: Navigating Hype and Reality 



<p>Citron cautions that while artificial intelligence (AI) remains a burgeoning field, certain companies may be overvalued due to speculative investments rather than solid financial performance. A notable example is Rigetti Computing, a quantum-computing firm that experienced a dramatic stock surge, only to face sharp declines after Citron labeled the rise as “ridiculous,” highlighting the risks of hype-driven valuations. ​</p>



<p>Conversely, Citron has spotlighted Nebius Group NV as an under-the-radar AI opportunity. Backed by industry giants like Nvidia, Nebius has been recognized for its potential to become a significant player in the AI infrastructure sector, with Citron suggesting a valuation that could position its stock price around $60.&nbsp;</p>



 Healthcare Stocks: Poised for Growth 



<p>The healthcare sector is undergoing rapid transformation, driven by technological advancements and an aging global population. Citron has identified Teladoc Health as a company leveraging AI to enhance its telemedicine services. Despite past perceptions as a “pandemic relic,” Teladoc’s strategic use of technology has improved profitability, making it an attractive acquisition target for major corporations like Amazon or CVS.</p>



<p>Additionally, industry experts predict that AI-powered diagnostics and personalized medicine will become more prevalent, offering investment opportunities in companies at the forefront of these innovations.</p>



 Energy Stocks: Traditional Players Reemerging 



<p>While renewable energy continues its ascent, Citron’s analysis suggests a potential resurgence in traditional oil and gas companies. Factors such as geopolitical developments and economic policies could drive demand for conventional energy sources. For instance, Talen Energy has been identified as a company to watch, with a market capitalization of $10 billion and potential for growth in the AI-energy nexus.</p>



<p>In summary, Citron Research’s 2025 outlook emphasizes the importance of discerning genuine innovation from market hype, particularly in the AI sector, recognizing growth potential in healthcare through technological integration, and acknowledging the possible resurgence of traditional energy companies amidst evolving market dynamics.​</p>


 
 


 Best Stock Picks for 2025 According to Citron 



<p>Citron has identified several stocks that they believe are undervalued gems. These companies have strong fundamentals, rising profits, and untapped potential.</p>



 
 A hidden AI stock: While big names like Nvidia and OpenAI dominate headlines, Citron has spotted a smaller AI company flying under the radar. They believe this stock could deliver massive returns. 



 A biotech company with breakthrough technology: Citron’s analysts argue that one specific healthcare stock has potential for a major breakout in 2025. 



 An oil and gas stock with untapped reserves: While many investors are chasing renewables, Citron believes one traditional energy company is positioned for a comeback. 
 



<p>They claim these stocks have high-profit potential, but as always, investors should do their own research.</p>


 
 


 Citron’s Most Controversial Calls This Year 



<p>Citron Research continues to stir controversy with their bold predictions. In 2025, some of their most contentious calls could significantly affect the stock market if proven accurate.</p>



 
 An AI Company Doomed to Fail: Citron has singled out a major AI stock, claiming that it is overhyped and purely speculative. With the recent surge in AI investments, Citron argues that the stock lacks a solid financial foundation and will face a sharp decline. Investors holding this stock might be exposed to huge losses if the company fails to deliver on its promises. The stock in question has seen speculative growth, driven by the AI boom, but with no profitable business model to support the hype.<br> 



 A Tech Stock Running on Borrowed Time: Citron has identified a leading tech company that they believe is nearing its end. Their research suggests that this stock is at risk of a major collapse within the next year, due to declining innovation and market competition. Citron’s track record with tech predictions has been mixed, but if correct, this prediction could shock the tech market.<br> 



 A Financial Stock Hiding Major Risks: Citron also warns that a prominent financial services company is covering up serious risks. According to their report, this company has hidden financial vulnerabilities that could collapse under market pressure. This could lead to massive losses for investors if the company’s true financial health comes to light. 
 



<p>Despite the backlash and skepticism from critics who view Citron’s calls as too aggressive, history shows that their controversial predictions have been right before—like when they warned about Luckin Coffee’s fraud, causing investors to avoid significant losses.</p>



 The Risks and Rewards of Following Citron Research 



<p>Citron Research has had a notable impact on investors, both positively and negatively. Their bold calls have created huge rewards but also significant risks.</p>



 
 The Rewards: Citron has made a name by spotting hidden gems before the broader market catches on. For example, they were early to identify Nvidia’s AI potential, a stock that has seen massive gains. Citron also warns about overvalued stocks. Their call on Luckin Coffee, when it was accused of fraud, saved investors from major losses. Their deep financial analysis often uncovers opportunities overlooked by mainstream analysts. In 2025, Citron’s focus on undervalued healthcare and energy stocks presents fresh opportunities, such as Teladoc Health and Talen Energy. 



 



 The Risks: However, Citron has made some wrong calls as well. They famously bet against Tesla before its massive rise. Also, shorting stocks – betting on their decline—can be dangerous, especially when stocks defy predictions, as seen with their failed bets on Shopify. 
 


 
 


 Conclusion 



<p>Citron Research has once again delivered bold, controversial insights into the stock market. Some investors trust them completely, while others see them as too aggressive. If Citron is right, some stocks will skyrocket, while others will crash. If they are wrong, their predictions could lead to bad investment decisions. The real question is: Will you take their advice or bet against them?</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency market is more dynamic than ever, with prices constantly shifting and new coins emerging regularly. Whether you’re a long-term investor or an active trader, tracking Bitcoin prices and other digital assets has become essential. In this fast-paced environment, having the right tools can make all the difference. That’s where CryptoCompare steps in. But is it the right tracker for you in 2025? Let’s dive in.</p>

 What Are Crypto Price Trackers? 



<p>If you’re investing in crypto, a crypto price tracker is your best friend. These platforms give you real-time access to crypto rates, making it easier to track the value of your Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoin prices across various exchanges. Without these tools, you’d be left refreshing price pages manually or hopping from one exchange to another just to find out the latest rate.</p>



<p>A good tracker doesn’t just show you prices, though. It also lets you keep tabs on market trends, compare prices across exchanges, and even manage your crypto portfolio. With so many crypto assets and exchanges out there, you’ll want a comprehensive tool to give you a complete view of the market.</p>

 Key Functions of Crypto Price Trackers 



<p>When looking for the best crypto price tracker, these are the key features you should consider:</p>



 Real-Time Price Tracking 



<p>The most important feature of any crypto price tracker is its ability to show real-time data. Whether it’s Bitcoin or Ethereum prices, having up-to-date information at your fingertips is crucial for making timely decisions. Markets can change in a matter of minutes, and real-time tracking ensures you’re always in the loop.</p>



 Market Insights and Analysis 



<p>A good tracker goes beyond just showing prices—it provides insights into crypto market trends. With tools that show you the price movements, trading volume, and even sentiment, you can better understand market dynamics. CryptoCompare, for example, offers these in-depth market insights, helping you spot trends before they become obvious to everyone else.</p>



 Price Comparison Across Exchanges 



<p>Not all exchanges offer the same prices, even for the same cryptocurrency. A Bitcoin price comparison tool helps you find the best rate by comparing Bitcoin prices across different platforms. This way, you can make sure you’re not overpaying or missing out on a better price elsewhere.</p>



 Portfolio Management 



<p>Whether you’re holding a few coins or tracking a diverse portfolio, having a tool that helps you manage your assets is essential. Many crypto price trackers also double as portfolio managers, letting you keep track of your holdings, profits, and losses. CryptoCompare makes it easy to monitor your entire crypto portfolio in one place, so you can see how your investments are performing.</p>



 Price Alerts 



<p>Sometimes, the market moves fast, and you can’t afford to keep checking prices every minute. That’s where price alerts come in. Set alerts for when a coin hits a certain price, and let the tracker notify you when it’s time to buy or sell.</p>



 Why CryptoCompare Stands Out Among Other Crypto Rate Trackers 



<p>There are plenty of crypto price trackers out there, but CryptoCompare offers a unique combination of features that set it apart:</p>



 Comprehensive Coverage 



<p>If you’re into altcoins, CryptoCompare is one of the best platforms for you. It tracks Bitcoin, Ethereum, and over 5,000 altcoins, so no matter what you’re investing in, you can keep tabs on it all in one place. The platform offers real-time tracking and market insights for all these coins, making it a go-to tool for anyone in the crypto space.</p>



 In-Depth Market Insights 



<p>With CryptoCompare, you’re not just tracking prices—you’re also getting a deep dive into market analysis. The platform provides charts, price trends, and detailed information on exchanges and cryptocurrencies, helping you understand market movements. This level of insight is perfect for investors who want to make informed decisions, whether you’re following Bitcoin market analysis or diving into emerging altcoins.</p>



 Easy-to-Use Interface 



<p>No matter your level of experience, CryptoCompare offers a clean, easy-to-navigate interface. Whether you’re using the web-based dashboard or the mobile app, it’s simple to find the information you need. This makes it accessible for beginners while still offering the features advanced users need to stay ahead.</p>



 Free Usage and Flexibility 



<p>Unlike some platforms that lock key features behind paywalls, CryptoCompare offers a free plan that allows up to 100,000 calls per month. This is more than enough for most casual traders. If you need more advanced features, there are also premium plans available. This gives you the flexibility to use the platform at your own pace, without worrying about running into a paywall.</p>



 Price Alerts and Notifications 



<p>Whether you’re day trading or holding long-term, being able to set price alerts is a huge benefit. CryptoCompare lets you set customized alerts for any cryptocurrency. When prices reach your desired level, you’ll get notified, ensuring that you never miss an opportunity. This is particularly useful for traders who need to react quickly to market changes.</p>

 Delta – Best for Trade Insights and Portfolio Tracking Across Multiple Devices 



<p>Delta is perfect for active traders, offering detailed trade insights and portfolio tracking on multiple devices. It supports several exchanges and wallets, making it easy to manage your investments on the go.</p>



 CoinMarketCap – A Reliable Tool for Those Who Prefer Manually Entering Transactions 



<p>CoinMarketCap is a trusted platform for manual tracking of crypto assets. While it doesn’t support automatic syncing, it offers accurate price data and is ideal for those who prefer to enter transactions manually.</p>



<p>Each tracker offers unique features, but all are valuable tools for navigating the crypto market in 2025.</p>

<p>The China-made generative artificial intelligence (AI) app <a href="https://www.deepseek.com/">DeepSeek</a> is making waves for all sorts of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/598846/deepseek-big-tech-ai-industry-nvidia-impac">reasons</a>, not least of which is its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dimitarmixmihov/2025/02/10/deepseek-took-the-ai-space-by-storm-then-came-the-red-flags/">significant data privacy and security issues</a>.</p>



<p>Five countries and some US states and government agencies have already <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/these-nations-are-banning-deepseek-ai-heres-why/">banned</a> the AI chatbot that shook the US tech industry and stock market on its release in late January 2025.</p>



<p>Countries cite DeepSeek’s data collection and offshore storage, poor encryption practices, national security risks, and non-compliance with privacy laws as reasons for banning the app, mostly on government devices and in some cases from broader use.</p>



<p>Indeed, on its US release day January 20, 2025, the DeepSeek-R1 chatbot was the most-downloaded free app on Apple’s App Store and had a massive data leak that exposed <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larsdaniel/2025/02/01/deepseek-data-leak-exposes--1000000-sensitive-records/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">one million sensitive records</a>, compounding privacy and security fears. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/27/deepseek-cyberattack-ai">Malicious attacks</a> on the app only a week later didn’t instil confidence.</p>



<p>The fears stem from DeepSeek storing its user data in China, where it cannot legally deny the Chinese government access to it, and the model’s inherent security vulnerabilities, particularly for <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/insights/ai-jailbreak">AI jailbreak attacks</a> where hackers bypass the model’s safety guardrails to produce malicious content such as malware instructions. <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/evaluating-security-risk-in-deepseek-and-other-frontier-reasoning-models">Cisco</a>, one of <a href="https://www.eweek.com/news/deepseek-security-issues/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">many agencies</a> to have studied DeepSeek’s security posture, revealed the model is <a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6690a78074d86ca0ad978007/679bc2e71b48e423c0ff7e60_1%20RedTeaming_DeepSeek_Jan29_2025%20(1).pdf">11 times</a>&nbsp;more likely to be exploited by cybercriminals than other AI models and in testing had failed to block all harmful prompts, including prompts related to cybercrime and misinformation. Its competitors, including OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Google’s Gemini, did much better.</p>



<p>Cybersecurity researchers has also found that the DeepSeek mobile and web apps contain hidden code that is <a href="https://www.feroot.com/blog/the-independent-feroot-security-uncovers-deepseeks-hidden-code-sending-user-data-to-china/">transmitting user data to state-controlled telecom company</a>&nbsp;China Mobile, and possibly other Chinese state-owned entities. China Mobile was <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-357087A1.pdf">banned from operating in the U.S.</a>&nbsp;in 2019 due to national security and law enforcement risks.</p>



<p>So, within that hotbed of issues, everyday users – and entire countries – need to determine whether the benefits of using the new kid on the AI block outweigh the risks to privacy and safety.</p>



<p>If you’re determined to try it, here’s the latest advice for staying private and safe on DeepSeek:</p>



<p>1. Don’t use your Gmail or Apple accounts to sign up to DeepSeek. That way, the data on those accounts is kept away from DeepSeek.</p>



<p>2. Don’t ask the app questions that reveal any identifying or highly personal information, since all inputs are used to train the model.</p>



<p>3. Avoid using the app altogether if you work for a government agency or other sensitive organization.</p>



<p>4. Use a virtual private network, like <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-vpn/">MySudo VPN</a>, to hide your IP address and location when using the app.</p>



<p>5. Don’t access DeepSeek’s AI models through DeepSeek’s web site, apps or API. Instead, consider using the DeepSeek AI model hosted by a service provider you trust. The app (iOS, Android, and web) sends data back to China, while US-based third-party platforms on which you can run DeepSeek don’t. Many US-based providers are running DeepSeek through their own data centres, such as <a href="http://perplexity.ai/">Perplexity</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/deepseek-r1-models-now-available-on-aws/">Amazon Web Services</a> for non-developers and <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai">GitHub</a> for developers. This short news clip is a good explainer:</p>



 

 



<p>6. Finally, get an alternative email and phone number from <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo app</a> to open and log into your DeepSeek account. MySudo has digital identities called <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/#:~:text=A%20core%20capability%20of%20our,and%20protects%20your%20personal%20data.">Sudos</a> that offer different identity credentials from you own and therefore protect your personal information and make it impossible for data aggregators to correlate your data. Signing on to DeepSeek (or any app) with your Sudo details is like adding a privacy and security buffer between you and DeepSeek. <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">Download MySudo</a>. <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/4-steps-to-setting-up-mysudo-to-meet-your-real-life-privacy-needs/">Set up your Sudos</a>.</p>



<p>We don’t know how DeepSeek’s technology and security issues will unfold from here, or where the world will go next with generative AI. Our best advice is to stay vigilant and proactive about protecting your own data privacy and security when using AI chatbots and other tools.</p>

 The new Thales MRO (Maintenance, Repair &amp; Overhaul) facility in Gurugram is strategically located near the Delhi airport in India. 
 This facility will offer comprehensive avionics maintenance and repair services to leading Indian airlines, such as Air India and IndiGo, directly supporting the growth of the local aviation industry.  
 In December 2024, the new Thales MRO in India was certified by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (<a href="https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/___https:/www.dgca.gov.in/digigov-portal/___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOjZhODBiZjhkYmNiMjk0MjQ3M2FhNDAwNTFjZjMwNWY4OjY6ZjcwNToxMDgwMjhmMzAzZjk5ZjEyMGI5MTEzYzY4OWE0NWNmNTY2MjgxZTMzNmMwNzViODQ0ZTYwYjA3OTE3MDc3Zjc0OnA6RjpG">DGCA</a>).

Honourable Civil Aviation Minister Shri Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu, inaugurating Thales’s MRO centre in Gurugram in the presence of Yannick Assouad, Executive Vice-President, Avionics, Thales; Thomas Got, Vice President, Aviation Global Services; Damien Syed, Deputy Chief of Mission, French Embassy; and Gilles Bono, Vice-President, Thales in India

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, Thales celebrated the opening of its new avionics MRO facility in Gurugram, near the New Delhi airport. Aligned with the vision of “Aatmanirbhar Bharat” (‘self-reliant India’), this centre will provide a wide range of services, including the maintenance &amp; repair of avionics components, to prominent Indian airlines such as Air India and IndiGo. This new repair hub draws on Thales’s expertise as a global leader in the aerospace industry, providing premium support and services to airline customers in India. </p>
<p>The inauguration was held in the presence of the Honourable Minister of Civil Aviation Shri Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu. The event was graced by Mr. Damien Syed, Deputy Head of Mission, Embassy of France in India, along with senior Government officials and eminent dignitaries from the French Embassy and the industry. The Thales team was led by Yannick Assouad, Executive Vice President, Avionics, Thomas Got, Vice President, Aviation Global Services and Gilles Bono, Vice President, India. This occasion marks a milestone in Thales’s continued investment strategy in India’s rapidly expanding aviation market.</p>
<blockquote><p>Shri Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu, Honourable Minister of Civil Aviation, Government of India said, “My heartfelt appreciation goes to Thales for setting up this dedicated facility in India to provide onshore MRO services to our airlines. Taking a tour of the facility and seeing it firsthand, I must say that I am deeply impressed by the meticulous planning and innovation that have gone into creating this centre. I believe the inauguration of this advanced avionics MRO centre marks a significant milestone for Indian aviation and a proud moment for Thales in India. This facility exemplifies our collective commitment to building a self-reliant India and a self-reliant aviation ecosystem under the visionary leadership of Hon’ble Prime Minister Sh. Narendra Modi Ji. Thales stands out as a shining example of Indo-French collaboration, we must together leverage India’s vast talent pool and facilitate India’s rapidly growing aviation market.”</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Thomas Got, Vice President Aviation Global Services, Thales, said, “India’s MRO industry is set for significant growth, becoming a key region for airlines. We are proud to inaugurate our Thales Maintenance and Repair Centre in India. This highlights our localisation efforts to bring our technological and avionics repair expertise closer to airline customers. The Gurugram centre is backed by the power of a global support and services organisation, and aligns with Thales’s strategy to expand its presence in India.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Today, we were disappointed to learn that Binance has decided to delist Aergo on March 28th. Like everyone else, our team found out through a post on their official blog — there was no advance notice, no heads-up, and certainly no transparency. It came as a complete surprise.</p><p>Even the Binance contacts we’ve been working with since the “monitoring tag” was applied told us they were blindsided by the decision. They could only confirm that the call came from much higher&nbsp;up.</p><p>No explanation or rationale was given. None. For an industry that claims to be built on openness and decentralization, this kind of decision-making is deeply frustrating.</p><p>Still, here’s the reality: the majority of Binance trading volume comes from users who already use other exchanges where Aergo remains listed and actively traded. Yes, every project wants to be on Binance — but we’re not going anywhere. We’ll keep pushing forward and we fully intend to earn our spot&nbsp;back.</p><p>You can continue trading $Aergo on Coinbase, Bithumb, Upbit, OKX, KuCoin, Gate, and 10+ other global exchanges.</p><p>Looking ahead: on March 26, the community will vote on the future of Aergo and the direction we’ve been building toward since July 2024. This decision from Binance does not derail our plans — it reinforces them. It gives us even more drive to make sure Aergo continues to grow and&nbsp;evolve.</p><p>We’ve been building for over a decade. We’re not stopping now — and we’re certainly not going anywhere.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/a-statement-regarding-binance-delisting-787459c24423">A Statement Regarding Binance Delisting</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Predicting The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Interest Rate Decision of March 19,&nbsp;2025.</p> Introduction <p>This article represents a collaborative effort between <a href="https://www.ocean-foam.ai">Ocean Foam</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yunus-g%C3%BCm%C3%BC%C5%9Fsoy/">Yunus Gümüşsoy</a>, the recent <a href="https://app.lunor.quest/challenge/33">FOMC Prediction Data Challenge</a> winner. The analysis aims to develop a sophisticated predictive framework that combines economic indicators, sentiment analysis, and advanced machine learning techniques to accurately anticipate Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate decisions. Our model enhances the understanding of how macroeconomic variables and the nuances in central bank communications impact monetary policy decisions, providing valuable insights for financial markets, policymakers, and economic forecasters.</p> Prediction <p>Our integrated predictive model successfully forecasted the most recent FOMC decision from March 19, 2025, accurately predicting a decision to maintain the current interest rate (no change, +0.00%) with a probability of 56.5%. The model further assigned probabilities of 27% for a +0.25% rate increase and 9% for a -0.25% rate cut. Notably, this prediction marks the third consecutive successful forecast dating back to the previous year, underscoring the reliability and robustness of our approach.</p> Datasets and Methodology <p>Economic Data: The dataset incorporates 36 key macroeconomic indicators, including Inflation Metrics such as Consumer Price Index (CPI), Core CPI, Producer Price Index (PPI), Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), and Inflation Expectations; Employment Metrics such as Non-Farm Payrolls and Unemployment Rate; and various Interest Rate and Yield Metrics including the Federal Funds Rate, Treasury Yields (2-Year and 10-Year), Mortgage Rates, and Bank Loan Rates. All economic data were systematically collected through the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) API, ensuring high-quality and real-time relevance.</p><p>FOMC Meeting Data: This dataset includes comprehensive historical records of previous FOMC meetings and decisions, sourced from <a href="http://www.investing.com">Investing.com</a>. These historical records provide essential context and capture decision-making patterns critical for enhancing predictive accuracy.</p><p>FOMC Communications: Utilizing advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, we analyzed official statements and meeting minutes directly scraped from the Federal Reserve’s website. NLP features employed include FinBERT sentiment analysis, Hawkish/Dovish keyword frequencies, topic modeling, and sentiment ratio scoring. This text-based analysis captures subtle signals within the Federal Reserve’s communications, significantly enhancing the model’s predictive power.</p><p>To further understand our model’s decision-making, we assessed feature importance within our predictive framework, which reveals the economic and textual factors most influential in determining FOMC decisions.</p><p>The predictions generated by our model align closely with the current U.S. economic environment, particularly given the shift toward lower interest rates under a new presidential administration. Interestingly, the model indicated a small but notable 6% probability for a more aggressive -0.50% rate cut, an outcome that appears unlikely under typical conditions. This probability likely captures the heightened uncertainty related to recent U.S. tariff policy shifts and evolving geopolitical narratives concerning European political dynamics.</p> Looking Ahead <p>We’re focused on improving our predictive methods by adding sentiment analysis of public speeches from Federal Reserve officials. We also plan to create lagged indicators to better capture economic trends, and use dimensionality reduction techniques to spot key macroeconomic patterns more effectively. Our goal is to keep refining our approach so we can provide accurate, actionable forecasts and help everyone understand monetary policy&nbsp;better.</p><p>We are actively working toward making our predictive insights publicly available via a Web3 decentralized application (dApp).

  Thales-led consortium EISNET to boost European air defence
prezly

Thu, 03/20/2025 - 08:00


             
 Under the European Defence Fund (EDF), Thales is to coordinate the EISNET (European Interactive Sensor-Based Dynamic Defence Network) consortium, involving 23 partners from industry, research centres and universities from twelve Member States.  
 The project seeks to decisively enhance the responsiveness, resilience and performance of Integrated Air Missile Defence (IAMD) systems to protect the European Union from threats ranging from hyper-saturating drone swarms to hypersonic missiles. 
 Co-funded by the European Defence Fund, member states and industry investments, this strategic initiative will create a European collaborative architecture to harmonise and aggregate existing as well as future IAMD systems. 
 

             <br>
 
 
 


<p>Officially launched on the 1st December 2024, the EISNET consortium met at the end of January 2025 in the presence of 65 high-level representatives from European industry, research centres, universities, the European Commission and Member States. The project will establish a set of common standards, as well as create prototypes and develop demonstration scenarios.</p>
<p>EISNET will define, develop and demonstrate next-generation real-time networks protocols – called the EISNET Architecture Framework Tool (EAFT) – that will allow European radars, passive sensors, and command &amp; control systems from different suppliers and countries to communicate in real-time and exchange data and services between systems dynamically. EISNET’s smart dynamic management will enhance the performance, scalability, responsiveness and resilience of new and legacy IAMD systems for the most challenging air and missile threat scenarios.</p>
<p>By integrating these various capabilities in a coordinated manner and enhancing communication speed, the project aims to reduce the command chain latency in the face of new-generation threats, high velocity attacks, massive fire saturation, and the stealth of these threats. EISNET’s ambition is to move towards an open standard to enable full interoperability with all IAMD suppliers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Raphaël Desi, Vice-President Integrated Airspace-protection Systems, Thales said: “Air superiority is decisive in today’s warfare in order to protect our countries and citizens. EISNET paves the way for a new generation of Integrated Air Missile Defence. Together, in this Thales-led consortium, we will boost European air defence”. </p></blockquote>
<p>About EISNET</p>
<p>The EISNET Architecture Framework Tool (EAFT) that will consist in a set of common concepts, rules and </p>
<p>functions which will permit the scalability of heterogeneous weapon systems, sensors and Fire Control Centres (FCC) with different architectures or configurations cooperating in a network centric solution.</p>

<p>Every individual has the right to belong to a nation that ensures security, freedom, and economic opportunity. A nation should serve as a protector, ensuring stability and empowering its people to build and sustain wealth. However, the current global financial system prioritizes financial institutions over individuals, allowing wealth accumulation for the privileged few while restricting economic independence for the majority.</p><p>At Sovereign Wallet, we advocate for an alternative financial model — one that is investment-based rather than debt-driven. We envision a system that eliminates reliance on credit and interest-based transactions, enables direct, secure, and transparent financial exchanges, and empowers individuals and nations with self-sovereign finance. This model fosters long-term economic sustainability by freeing people from dependency on banks and intermediaries.</p><p>By digitizing national infrastructures and enabling peer-to-peer financial participation, we offer an independent, self-sustaining alternative to traditional banking.</p><p>A sovereign future starts with reclaiming ownership over identity and financial participation. No individual should have to depend on centralized authorities to verify their identity, access services, or participate in economic activities. We aim to build a financial system that prevents economic servitude, guarantees unrestricted financial participation independent of inflation-driven and debt-based models, and ensures governance structures are transparent and directly participatory, reflecting the will of the people rather than the interests of a privileged elite.</p><p>This vision does not seek to replace one centralized authority with another. Instead, it aims to create a decentralized, equitable, and resilient system where power is distributed and individuals are genuinely empowered.</p> Building Indigenous Sovereignty: The Promise of Digital Infrastructure <p>Across the globe, Indigenous communities continue to seek meaningful sovereignty — not just politically, but economically and digitally. Recognizing the need for robust infrastructure that aligns with these ambitions, Sovereign Wallet is developing the Indigenous Digital Infrastructure (IDI), a comprehensive framework designed to reinforce Indigenous sovereignty, economic independence, and social inclusivity. The IDI is structured around three core pillars: Self-Sovereign Identity, Tokenized Payments, and AI Agents, each integral to strengthen Indigenous sovereignty and economic competitiveness.</p> Self-Sovereign Identity: Security and&nbsp;Autonomy <p>At the heart of the IDI is Self-Sovereign Identity, empowering individuals to securely own, control, and manage their digital identities without reliance on centralized authorities. Through tokenized identities and digital identifiers, personal data is protected via encrypted messaging networks and unified&nbsp;ledgers.</p><p>This approach allows individuals to issue and present verifiable credentials independently, granting them full autonomy over their identities. The benefits extend beyond individual privacy to broader community trust and transparency, as digital signatures enable secure contracts, notarization processes, and authenticated, on-chain voting systems, thereby fortifying governance mechanisms.</p> Tokenized Payment: Economic Empowerment and Inclusivity <p>Economic autonomy is further strengthened by a Tokenized Payment system, which simplifies transactions and reduces reliance on costly intermediaries. Facilitated through peer-to-peer transactions — such as Payment versus Payment (PvP) currency exchanges and Delivery versus Payment (DvP) asset exchanges — the IDI significantly lowers social transaction costs, enhancing local economic efficiency.</p><p>This innovative payment ecosystem promotes sustainability through tokenized crowd investments, digitized currency circulation, and secure digital asset trading. Crucially, the system fosters inclusivity, equipping users with self-managed digital wallets and banking capabilities directly linked to their digital identities, ensuring everyone within Indigenous communities can actively participate in economic&nbsp;life.</p> AI Agents: Automation and Economic Scalability <p>Complementing identity and payment systems, AI Agents introduce a transformative dimension to the IDI. By shifting extensive manual processes to AI-driven algorithmic operations, Indigenous communities can dramatically enhance productivity, efficiency, and economic scalability.</p><p>Leveraging digital currencies and peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, AI-powered infrastructures enable machine-to-machine commerce, creating scalable, sustainable economic ecosystems that free human labor for creative and strategic tasks. Furthermore, AI agents facilitate the growth of inclusive, open-source economic networks, enabling broad societal participation in collective economic prosperity.</p><p>Integrating Self-Sovereign Identity, Tokenized Payments, and AI Agents into a coherent digital infrastructure establishes a powerful, decentralized, and inclusive economy for Indigenous communities. Sovereign Wallet’s vision of the IDI represents the technological advancement and a fundamental shift toward genuine economic sovereignty. In embracing the IDI, Indigenous nations reaffirm their independence, redefine their economic potential, and establish a resilient foundation for generations to&nbsp;come.</p><p>We believe that financial power should be in the hands of individuals — not intermediaries, banks, or centralized authorities. By eliminating unnecessary transaction costs, introducing fractional investments, and creating an inclusive financial ecosystem, we make economic opportunities available to all, regardless of financial status or geographic location. This is the foundation for a new, decentralized financial era — one where individuals and nations have the freedom to shape their own economic destinies, ensuring long-term prosperity and sustainability.</p>

  Thales to provide high-performance sonar suite for <br>
future Orka-class submarines in the Netherlands
prezly

Wed, 03/19/2025 - 08:00


             
 Under an agreement signed by Thales and Naval Group, Thales will supply the sonar suite for the Orka-class submarines to be deployed by the Royal Netherlands Navy under the RNSC (Replacement Netherlands Submarine Capability) programme. 
 The sonar suite will provide a comprehensive picture of the underwater acoustic environment to support the future submarines' capacity to thwart increasingly silent threats. 
 Thales is a world leader in the underwater systems market, equipping more than 50 submarines of various types — SSBNs1, SSNs2 and conventionally powered attack submarines — in service today. 
 
<p>Thales, a long-standing partner of both Naval Group and the Royal Netherlands Navy, will provide a comprehensive suite of high-performance sonar systems for the future class of submarines that will replace the Walrus-class vessels in service today. The contract will provide the submarines with a comprehensive picture of the underwater acoustic environment, helping the Netherlands to guarantee operational superiority.</p>
<p>The sonar suite features high-performance acoustic sensors, including bow, flank and obstacle-avoidance sonars, an intercept array, a passive towed-array sonar, an underwater voice communication system, an echo-sounder and signal processing racks. This cohesive suite of equipment will provide an unprecedented panoramic view of the underwater environment, making it possible to detect, locate and classify all types of threats at short, medium and long range across a wide range of frequencies.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sylvain Perrier, RNSC Programme Director for Naval Group, said: "The highly capable Thales sonar suite was a key component of Naval Group's bid for this programme, and will make a significant contribution to the acoustic superiority of the Orka-class submarines. We know we can count on Thales to meet the demanding requirements of the COMMIT3 and to work hand in hand with Dutch industry on the RNSC programme."</p></blockquote>
<p>This programme is an opportunity for Thales to align with the Dutch government's policy of support and empowerment of strategic national industries. It will consolidate the company's engagement with the naval defence ecosystem in the Netherlands, within the framework of the RNSC programme, as illustrated by a recent contract with the Dutch company Optics11, to use its OptiArray technology in the passive towed-array sonar.</p>
<blockquote><p>"We are proud that Thales's advanced sonar suite has been selected to equip the Royal Netherlands Navy's Orka-class submarines. This partnership will enhance the technological superiority of the Dutch armed forces, and reflects our ongoing commitment to providing innovative, dependable solutions in support of the defence capabilities of allied nations," said Sébastien Guérémy, Vice President, Underwater Systems, Thales.</p></blockquote>
<p>1 Ballistic missile submarines</p>
<p>2 Nuclear-powered attack submarines</p>
<p>3 COMMIT (Commando Materieel en IT / Materiel and IT Command) is part of the Dutch Ministry of Defence and responsible for the Orka-class submarines tendering process and project management.</p>

<p>Meet Sarah—a busy professional trying to open an investment account, finalize her legal agreement, and file her taxes. Her to-do list is long, but verifying her identity for each service shouldn’t be the hardest part of her day.</p>



<p>Her first stop is her credit union. They require a face-to-face meeting, but the next available appointment is five days away. Sarah’s lawyer calls next—“We’ll need you to bring your ID in for verification.” Great. Another trip. Finally, her accountant sends a casual request: “Just email me a picture of your driver’s license.” Alarm bells go off in Sarah’s mind. Isn’t email unsecured?</p>



<p>By the end of the day, Sarah is frustrated and overwhelmed. Verifying her identity feels outdated, unsafe, and time-consuming.</p>



<p>Now imagine a different experience—one where Sarah completes everything from her phone, securely and in minutes, thanks to a platform powered by iComply.</p>



 



 A Seamless Verification Journey 



<p>Sarah opens her credit union’s branded verification portal—powered by iComply—on her phone. Instead of scheduling a meeting, she’s prompted to take a quick selfie and scan her driver’s license.</p>



<p>Within seconds, the system:</p>



 
 Confirms her ID’s authenticity by checking security features like watermarks and MRZ codes. 



 Runs a biometric facial recognition check to ensure the selfie matches her ID. 



 Cross-references her information against real-time government databases, ensuring compliance with KYC and AML regulations. 
 



<p>No back-and-forth emails. No trips to an office. No guesswork about data security. The same smooth process happens when Sarah logs into her law firm’s and accountant’s portals. iComply’s flexible platform allows each business to use the same seamless verification process—no siloed tools or manual checks.</p>



 



 Why This Future Matters 



<p>iComply eliminates friction for clients like Sarah and strengthens trust in every transaction. For businesses, it’s a win-win: secure onboarding that meets global regulatory standards while enhancing customer experience. Instead of patchwork solutions that create inefficiencies, iComply’s unified platform integrates everything—document verification, biometric checks, and continuous monitoring—into one turnkey system.</p>



<p>This isn’t just identity verification—it’s a future where customers like Sarah feel valued and safe, not inconvenienced or exposed. When compliance is this seamless, it stops being a hurdle and becomes a competitive advantage.</p>



<p>It’s time to leave in-person waits and unsecured emails behind. Ready to show your customers the future? Discover how iComply can empower your business today.</p>

<p>Cloud computing was a breakthrough in convenience and cost compared to housing and maintaining on-site servers for companies’ data and applications. But the landscape has shifted, thanks to greatly heightened security risks, higher data transport demands from applications like AI, and a growing need for both control and flexibility that the cloud can’t offer.&nbsp;</p><p>This has led to more interest in a “best of both worlds” approach increasingly known as <a href="https://www.cleo.com/blog/knowledge-base-on-premise-vs-cloud?ref=blog.spruceid.com">“cloud-premises computing,”</a> or just “cloud-prem.” Also sometimes known as Hybrid Cloud, this approach involves separating user data storage from application and execution, with the “data plane” generally hosted and managed on-site and the “control plane” managed in the cloud, often by a vendor.</p><p>Cloud-prem reduces vendor lock-in, reduces data latency, can improve security, and makes compliance easier. </p> You Control the Data – Not Your Vendor <p>A hybrid approach to hosted services generally means an on-site server that handles user data, and a cloud instance that runs the application layer, sometimes with help from a software vendor. For instance, a health service might store patient data locally, while a software provider integrates <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/private-cloud-examples?ref=blog.spruceid.com">edge computing for patient monitoring</a> in the cloud.</p><p>This approach lets an in-house IT administrator deploy all applications with uniform, pre-set data controls. Direct, physical control of data also means long-term flexibility: In the event of a vendor switch or new integration, having data on your own servers keeps handovers worry-free. Using standard data approaches such as Kubernetes and PostgresDB makes shifting or expanding to a new front-end app practically plug-and-play.</p><p>The practical benefits can be massive if you deal with a lot of vendors. In a pure cloud-SaaS model, 12 services can mean 12 different databases, <a href="https://tomtunguz.com/cloud-prem-architecture/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">each controlled by a vendor</a>. By putting you back in control of your data, cloud-prem can make interaction among the data for all these applications much simpler. Overall, a customer who controls their own data also has more control over their own applications.</p> Security In Your Hands <p>For even slightly sensitive applications, the cloud has always been a dicey proposition. Cloud SaaS struggles to provide the necessary safeguards for handling a lot of PII or health information, and newer AI and data-monitoring applications need <a href="https://www.datagravity.dev/p/the-rise-of-cloudprem-newprem-and?ref=blog.spruceid.com">extensive access permissions</a>, meaning higher risk in a cloud environment. As one commenter put it, “Securing cloud assets that may be open to the public or accessible via API means <a href="https://medium.com/@cam.wasi/moving-from-on-prem-to-cloud-to-cloud-prem-f75b2052e422?ref=blog.spruceid.com">battling a Medusa.</a>”</p><p>The changing threat environment makes this challenge even bigger: major data breaches and ransomware attacks<a href="https://nordlayer.com/blog/data-breaches-in-2024/?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> rose sharply in 2024</a>. More and more attackers are backed by hostile governments, and the average cost of a data breach reached $4.88 million, according to Nordlayer. Cloud breaches were even more damaging, averaging $5.17 million.</p><p>It requires in-house expertise that’s not always cheap, but local data control offers greater control over security measures, from individual and application privileges to the ability to simply take data offline entirely in a catastrophic situation. That could be particularly important in a ransomware scenario, and those attacks have become increasingly frequent and costly.</p> Location, Location, Location <p>Where your data “lives” geographically is important for reasons other than security. For a long time, high-grade broadband meant there was plenty of bandwidth, even for tasks like streaming video. But the advent of AI has begun to push up against those boundaries, making “data gravity” an issue.</p><p>One example is in finance, where algorithmic fraud detection is now nearly ubiquitous. This and similar applications require <a href="https://www.datagravity.dev/p/the-rise-of-cloudprem-newprem-and?ref=blog.spruceid.com">significant privileges</a> over sensitive data. Keeping data and processing near each other can be a security advantage while reducing bandwidth costs and even shaving down service latency.</p><p>The cloud-prem hybrid model also addresses regulatory controls on data’s physical location. While the U.S. has no Federal data localization law, specific regulations or rules cover data handling by health care providers (HIPAA), the financial industry (PCI DSS), and government contractors. Specific state regulations, such as<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> California’s CCPA</a>, may also have implications for your data localization and control duties. While cloud providers can offer specific data locations, the assurances may not be sufficient for higher-risk or regulated sectors.&nbsp;</p><p>So, if you’re facing localization requirements, need to go the extra mile for more agility and security, or want to get the most out of innovations in artificial intelligence, cloud-prem could be a strong fit for your secure computing strategy.&nbsp;</p> Learn More about Cloud-Prem <p>At SpruceID, we leverage cloud-prem computing to ensure secure, flexible, and compliant data management for our clients, providing the best of both worlds in an increasingly complex digital landscape.

<p>tl;dr: Traditional identity federation has enabled digital identity with centralized, third-party logins, for decades. Its limitations in security and user control, however, are becoming a problem, especially when there are alternatives being developed. Digital credentials offer a decentralized, user-empowering alternative that enhances privacy and enables offline authentication. We’re looking at a brave new world with the future of identity federation.</p>



 Let’s Get Started 



<p>If you’re reading this post, you, along with around <a href="https://prioridata.com/data/smartphone-stats/">4.88 billion</a> of your fellow humans (that’s just over 60% of the global population), have a smartphone. You’ve probably used that phone to purchase goods or services, log in to social media, check your bank balance, or access your work or school account to get something done. In the early days of digital identity, you’d have used a username and password and not thought too much about it. But as hackers began finding ways to copy those usernames and passwords, banks and businesses recognized the need for more secure methods for verifying identity.</p>



<p>Organizations started to externalize identity verification, relying on third parties to manage accounts and authenticate users. Although this change made the experience more efficient and secure for most users, once you initiated the action, you lost control over how the system shared your identity information. And as our dependence on digital transactions grew, so did the demand for offline experiences to match the convenience and security of online interactions.</p>



<p>This post explores two different paradigms in digital identity management: traditional federation and digital (or verifiable) credentials. I’ll talk a bit about how traditional federated authentication works, why the industry is shifting towards verifiable credentials, and how offline authentication is emerging as a vital component of the future identity framework.</p>



 Understanding Traditional Federation 



<p>First, let me just say that calling this “traditional” federation feels weird. Since it developed in my lifetime, it doesn’t feel that old. And yet, some of you may never have seen the Internet function without it. So I’ll use “traditional” because “old-fashioned” is worse. Also, get off my lawn.</p>



 Traditional Identity Federation: More Than Just a Third-Party Login 



<p>Traditional identity federation isn’t simply about “logging in with Google” or other familiar third parties. It’s built on a robust trust fabric that ties together Identity Providers (IdPs) and Relying Parties (RPs) through formal, negotiated agreements.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://refeds.org">REFEDS</a>, the Research and Education Federations organization, this ecosystem is maintained through a set of shared policies, legal contracts, and technical standards. These elements ensure that every party involved adheres to common guidelines for security, privacy, and operational best practices. In essence, when you log in through a federated service, you’re participating in an intricate web of trust where the IdP and RP have already agreed on the rules of engagement. It’s a combination of technical trust (i.e., computationally enforceable) and contractual trust (i.e., yay, lawyers). This trust fabric guarantees that the identity assertions provided by the IdP are reliable and acceptable to the RP. The result is secure and efficient digital transactions without the need for every party to reinvent the wheel each time.</p>



<p>This model simplifies the user experience by reducing the need for multiple credentials. It also reinforces the overall security posture by holding each participant accountable to a standardized set of expectations and responsibilities. This framework of collective trust makes traditional identity federation a viable and widely adopted approach in various sectors.</p>



 How Does It Work? 



<p>In a typical federated model, a third-party IdP redirects you when you attempt to access a service. This provider confirms your identity (often using a username and password, hopefully augmented with additional factors) and then sends a secure assertion back to the service. This process not only simplifies user experience by reducing the number of credentials you need to manage but also centralizes the security controls. Basically, the service provider doesn’t have to manage your account or your affiliation, nor do they need to go through any kind of elaborate identity verification process. They effectively outsource all that to the identity provider.&nbsp;</p>



 Benefits and Limitations 



<p>While traditional federation offers efficiency and ease of use, it comes with trade-offs:</p>



 
 Centralized Trust: You rely heavily on the IdP’s security measures. A breach or failure on their side can expose your personal data. 



 Limited User Control: Once the authentication process begins, the user has little say over how their identity data is managed or shared. 



 Single Point of Failure: If the IdP is compromised or goes offline, access to multiple services can be affected. 
 



<p>For many sectors, especially in research, education, and enterprise, these limitations are increasingly prompting the search for more resilient and user-empowering alternatives.</p>



 Introducing Digital Credentials 



<p>Hello, digital credentials that can be cryptographically verified, my new friends.</p>



 Defining Digital (Verifiable) Credentials 



<p>Digital credentials, also called verifiable credentials (I have a <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/01/20/digital-credentials-that-can-be-verified-a-lesson-in-terminology/">blog post</a> about the terminology problems), represent a shift in how we think about identity. Rather than relying solely on centralized third parties, these credentials offer cryptographically secure, tamper-evident proofs of identity or specific claims. By storing credentials on personal devices like smartphones, users gain greater control over their information and can present verified data directly to service providers without always involving an intermediary. In other words, they can prevent your IdP from tracking you.</p>



 Underlying Technologies 



<p>At the heart of digital credentials lies a suite of modern technologies:</p>



 
 Cryptography: Ensures that credentials are secure and tamper-proof. 



 Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs): Provide a way to assert identity without a central registry. 



 Digital Wallets: Serve as the interface for managing and presenting these credentials, similar to how a physical wallet stores your driver’s license, credit cards, and other proofs. 
 



<p>If you’re curious about specific standards, you have several options. I went into a comparison study a while back about <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/01/03/verifiable-credentials-and-mdocs-a-tale-of-two-protocols/">W3C Verifiable Credentials versus ISO/IEC mdoc</a>. I also expanded it a bit to talk about IETF SD-JWT VCs. Suffice to say, there’s a lot going on and various reasons to choose a protocol.</p>



 Advantages Over Traditional Federation 



<p>Digital credentials offer several improvements:</p>



 
 Enhanced Security: By reducing reliance on centralized password databases, digital credentials mitigate the risk of mass breaches. 



 Greater Privacy: Users can engage in selective disclosure, sharing only the specific information required by a service rather than an entire identity profile. 



 User Empowerment: The control over credentials shifts back into the hands of the user, ensuring that they decide how and when to share their identity information. 
 



 The Shift: From Sign-Ins to Digital Credentials 



 Why the Transition? 



<p>There isn’t any single reason, but we can start with:</p>



 
 Security Needs: As cyberattacks become more sophisticated, the industry is moving away from centralized password stores to more secure, decentralized systems. 



 Privacy Concerns: Users increasingly demand solutions that allow them to share only what’s necessary, preserving their personal data from unnecessary exposure. 



 Efficiency Gains: Digital credentials streamline the process of identity verification, making transactions both faster and more reliable. 
 



 Use-Case Scenarios 



<p>Consider a few real-world examples where this shift is already underway:</p>



 
 Financial Services: Banks are exploring ways to onboard customers using digital credentials that confirm identity without storing sensitive data in one centralized location. 



 Travel &amp; Hospitality: Mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) and digital passports can enable secure, offline verification when connectivity is poor or non-existent. 



 Healthcare: Institutions are piloting systems where patients’ vaccination records or other health records are stored digitally, ensuring privacy and easing cross-system verification. This had a surge of popularity with COVID-19 vaccination records. 
 



<p>Digital wallets play a crucial role in these scenarios, acting as secure repositories for your credentials. In posts like “<a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2024/09/20/the-wallets-are-coming-but-are-we-ready-for-whats-next/">The Wallets Are Coming—but Are We Ready for What’s Next?</a>”, the conversation focuses on how these tools will soon become mainstream, everyday interactions.</p>



 Offline Authentication in the Digital Age 



<p>There’s a lot to be said here. For one thing, believe it or not, Internet access is not ubiquitous. For that matter, while 60% of humans today have smartphones, that means 40% do not. Unless something changes drastically, there will ALWAYS be a need to support offline services and physical credentials.</p>



 What Is Offline Authentication? 



<p>While online systems dominate much of our current authentication landscape, offline authentication is becoming a Really Big Deal. It allows for secure identity verification without a constant Internet connection, relying on local cryptographic verification methods.</p>



 Why Offline Matters 



<p>Offline authentication addresses several critical challenges:</p>



 
 Resilience: In areas with unreliable connectivity or in emergency situations, being able to verify identity without an online connection is invaluable. 



 Privacy: By minimizing data transmission over networks, offline methods reduce exposure to interception or misuse. 



 Complementarity: Offline authentication doesn’t replace online systems; it supplements them, ensuring that users have a seamless experience regardless of connectivity. 
 



<p>Real-world applications are already in motion. For instance, mDLs in many states in the U.S. can be verified locally on your device, and some health records are designed to be accessible even when you’re off the grid. This dual approach, online for day-to-day transactions and offline for specific scenarios, creates a robust, flexible identity framework.</p>



 Comparative Analysis: Digital Credentials vs. Traditional Federation 



<p>People seem to love comparison tables, so let’s start with one of those:</p>



AspectTraditional Identity FederationDigital Credential ModelAuthenticationUses established protocols (OIDC and OAuth, SAML) to handle authentication and (sometimes) authorization.Relies on cryptographically secure, user-held credentials that you control on your device.SecurityCentralized systems create a single point of failure; a breach at the provider can impact many services.Decentralized, with security anchored in cryptography, reducing the risk of mass breaches.PrivacyThird parties manage and often store your data, which can lead to oversharing or tracking across services.Starting to enable selective disclosure, allowing you to share only the necessary information without overexposing your data. (There’s still work going on in the standards and implementation spaces to make this happen.)User ControlOnce you log in, you have little control over how the provider manages or shares your data.It puts you in the driver’s seat (driver’s seat, mDL, ha!), letting you decide what to share and when. That’s the goal; some technical challenges are still being worked on.Offline CapabilityPrimarily requires an online connection; offline verification is generally not supported.Supports offline verification (as long as you have a phone and the local business has the tools to consume what you display), ensuring secure authentication even without connectivity.Trust ModelTrust is placed in centralized authorities to safeguard your identity data.Trust is distributed through verifiable proofs and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). That said, some trust is centralized when it comes to trusting the issuer of the credential. AdoptionWidely implemented across sectors like education, research, and enterprise.Gaining traction in areas like finance, travel, healthcare, and beyond as the technology matures.



 Future Trends and the Road Ahead 



<p>This is an incredibly active space. That said, people will have to figure out how to deal with the technical debt of the previous generation tech stack. Interesting times.</p>



<p>Digital credentials are gaining ground, but does that mean traditional federation is on its way out? If your organization is trying to make sense of the shifting standards landscape, I can help you track the changes and find the right approach. <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/services/">Explore my digital identity standards consulting services</a>.</p>



 Evolving Standards and Innovations For Digital Credentials 



<p>Several new initiatives and standards are setting the stage for a more decentralized and resilient identity ecosystem. The W3C <a href="https://github.com/WICG/digital-credentials">Digital Credentials API</a>, for example, is pushing for interoperability and security in digital credential frameworks by offering a secure connection between a browser and an operating system for digital wallets and their credentials. (As an aside, there’s some very late-breaking news as of February 2025 regarding the DC API – the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2025/02/council-report-fedid-dig-cred.html">roadblock</a> has been cleared for this API, referenced by the <a href="https://eu-digital-identity-wallet.github.io/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/latest/architecture-and-reference-framework-main/">EU Digital Identity Wallet Architecture and Reference Framework</a> (EUDI ARF), to move into the next step of the standardization process within the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/fedid/">Federated Identity Working Group</a>.) Similarly, a new <a href="https://idtechwire.com/newly-published-iso-iec-standard-enables-remote-idv-via-mobile-drivers-license/">ISO/IEC standard</a> is enabling remote identity verification through mobile devices; the tech stack is building for using digital credentials in all aspects of life.</p>



 Predictions for the Future 



<p>Looking ahead, I think we can expect:</p>



 
 Increased Adoption: More industries will experiment with and adopt verifiable credentials as a secure alternative to traditional sign-ins. 



 Convergence of Online and Offline Systems: Hybrid models will become the norm, ensuring that identity verification remains robust regardless of connectivity. 



 User Empowerment: As control shifts back to the user, there will be greater emphasis on privacy, selective disclosure, and decentralized trust networks. 
 



 Implications for Businesses and Users 



<p>Organizations will need to weigh the benefits of maintaining legacy federated systems against the potential advantages of transitioning to digital credentials. For users, the promise of enhanced security and control over personal data is a compelling incentive to support these changes. However, the transition requires careful planning, standardization, and a willingness to experiment with new technologies. I’m putting together a talk for the upcoming EIC in May 2025 to talk about this very thing: “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5882/2">The Challenges and ROI of Verifiable Credentials in Enterprise Use Cases</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>So, traditional federation, while providing initial efficiency and security through centralized third-party authentication and with an extensive deployment base, comes with inherent limitations such as offline-use issues and potential single points of failure. Digital credentials offer a promising alternative by decentralizing control and empowering users with cryptographically secure proofs of identity, though the tech stack for using them securely is still building.</p>



<p>As digital credentials become more prevalent and standards for offline authentication mature, we are going to see a hybrid identity landscape where both online and offline mechanisms coexist and complement one another. This shift not only enhances security and privacy but also paves the way for a more resilient, user-centric digital ecosystem.</p>



<p>I wish there was a perfect solution for everything, but so much depends on the problems you’re trying to solve. You’ll notice that I didn’t even try to bring in passkeys to this conversation; if you’d like to read more on that, I suggest you start <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2023/08/26/comparing-federated-logins-and-passkeys-which-one-fits-your-needs/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

				 <p>By Helen Garneau</p>
<p>Sure, there are plenty of passwordless authentication solutions out there, each promising to simplify identity management. But in reality, most of them just add another cog to the already overcomplicated Rube Goldberg machine that is most enterprise identity. The question you should be asking isn’t “how can I go passwordless” but —, “what else can I do to make identity management work better for my business?”</p>
<p>The answer is <a href="https://indicio.tech/proven-auth/">Proven Auth</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proven Auth is more than just another login solution, it’s about using the power of Verifiable Credentials for orchestrating the entire life-cycle of access so that the right person has the right access at the right time.&nbsp;</p>
 Simplifying the messy world of access control 
<p>You know the struggle. Managing access to your company’s growing stack of products, systems, and applications is an ongoing headache. And that’s just the beginning. Too often, IT teams are stuck dealing with overly rigid access models that aren’t flexible enough to account for the realities of real work environments, or manual access control that needs to be managed on a per-individual and per-product basis.</p>
<p>Instead, Proven Auth enables smart, policy-driven authorization that adapts to your business needs. It allows you to easily implement policies that define access rules dynamically. No more one-size-fits-all permissions. No more access silos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether you’re managing employees, contractors, or partners, our policy-driven access control makes security seamless and scalable.</p>
 How Verifiable Credentials manage policy-driven access 
<p>With Proven Auth, you can use dynamic access rules that respond instantly when a Verifiable Credential is presented. Instead of granting broad permissions, you can enforce fine-grained policies that determine exactly what each person should access based on their role, credentials, and other verified attributes.</p>
<p>This means you can write access policies once and apply them across multiple systems, ensuring consistency and reducing administrative overhead.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
 
 Issue Verifiable Credentials using Indico Proven to employees, customers, partners, or have your contractors issue them to their employees that contains information that would affect their access. This could include things like their role, location, years of experience, certifications or other relevant information. 
 Integrate Proven Auth with policy engines like Amazon Verified Permissions or Abacus and write policies based on your business’ needs. 
 Grant access based on their verified attributes so instead of using static, pre-configured access roles, the world of tools and systems people can access is set up for them in minutes, without needing to log into anything. 
 
 The value of Proven Auth in action 
<p>Let’s take a look at what this system can do across industries and use cases:</p>
<p>1. Fine-tuned access control</p>
<p>Now you can tailor access at a granular level and carve out access for specific employees, contractors, and partners so they only get what they need and nothing more.</p>
 
 
 
 A Human Resources employee can access Microsoft 365, Adobe, and Workday, but not Salesforce. 
 A sales team member can access Salesforce, HubSpot, and ZoomInfo, but not HR or financial systems. 
 A contractor can gain temporary access to specific buildings, servers, or relevant tools without being onboarded into your entire system. 
 
 
 
<p>2. No more enrollment hassles</p>
<p>Traditional identity management requires time-consuming enrollment processes, especially for subcontractors and for remote or temporary workers. With Proven Auth, that’s a thing of the past.</p>
 
 
 
 A global enterprise company hiring hundreds of subcontractors doesn’t need to formally onboard each individual. Instead, subcontractors can present their verifiable credentials that their employer issued them based on their role and other pertinent information to identify themselves and are granted instant, policy-driven access — saving your HR and IT teams countless hours. 
 
 
 
<p>3. Compliance and security made simple</p>
<p>Regulatory compliance is easier with Proven Auth because access is governed by real-time policy enforcement.</p>
 
 
 
 A financial services firm can enforce policies that ensure brokers can only sell financial products they are certified for— helping maintain compliance with licensing regulations. 
 A global financial trading firm can set access rules based on jurisdiction, ensuring employees in different countries only access region-appropriate resources. 
 
 
 
<p>4. A more coherent user experience</p>
<p>Employees no longer have to juggle multiple logins and inconsistent access experiences.</p>
 
 
 
 A bank that has 13 different tools available to employees requires a separate login for each. Using Proven Auth with unified credential-based policies, employees can access only the systems relevant to them—with one seamless login experience. 
 
 
 
<p>5. Add biometrics to authentication to defend against deepfakes</p>
<p>For even greater security control, Indicio Proven allows you to combine a biometric template in a Verifiable Credential so you can authenticate biometrics for access without having to worry about storing biometric data. This removes the high risk and complex compliance around storing biometric data and provides a simple way around the risk of deepfakes. The real employee has to present a unique proof, issued only to them, to corroborate that they are who they claim to be.</p>
 
 
 
 An airline creates a biometric template and issues it in a tamper-resistant credential to their pilots to hold securely on their phone. When accessing a restricted area or internal flight system, the pilot simply presents their biometric credential at the same time as a liveness check and the software compares to see if they match.&nbsp; 
 
 
 
<p>This is way cooler than just going passwordless. But, even more importantly, it reduces your security risk and compliance burden, and it also gives you peace of mind against generative AI identity fraud.</p>
 Why Indicio? 
<p>With Proven Auth, you’re not just eliminating passwords—you’re unlocking real business value. Whether you’re managing employees, contractors, or partners, our policy-driven access control makes security seamless and scalable.</p>
<p>Are you ready to move beyond passwordless and start solving real business problems? <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">Let’s talk.</a></p>

<p>What if we told you that “digital trust” would make or break your business in the next five years? That every interaction, from signing on and making a purchase to collaborating with business partners, included a level of digital trust? If that trust is compromised, so are your users, your revenue, and your reputation. At a time when trust is critical to the success of business, trust itself is under attack by deepfakes, AI, and ever-evolving fraud tactics. To answer the challenge, trust itself also needs to evolve. Because trust isn’t simply given—it starts with Zero Trust and must be earned. If you don’t adapt to this digital dynamic, you’ll get left behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Ping Identity, the future we’re helping you build is transformative, yet powerfully simple: Trust Every Digital Moment.</p>

 Korea’s National Health Insurance Service Adopts Blockchain-Based TSA… Leading Public Service Innovation <p>The National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) is leveraging Aergo Enterprise to transform the public service paradigm. The blockchain-based Time Stamping Authority (TSA) service adopted by NHIS processes 400,000 transactions daily, with a peak capacity of up to 700,000 transactions. When the new long-term care application is launched, the system is expected to handle over 1.8 million transactions per day, making it one of the most extensive enterprise blockchain services in actual operation.</p><p>NHIS is leveraging blockchain technology to advance its TSA project, which authenticates and issues insurance contracts and essential documents. This initiative seeks to combat document forgery, boost reliability, enhance public service transparency, and optimize the use of electronic records.</p><p>The project was developed in collaboration with Blocko, utilizing the Aergo TSA framework. The system integrates seamlessly with existing IT infrastructure without downtime, ensuring continuous and efficient blockchain adoption. This successful implementation sets a precedent for public institutions adopting blockchain technology, potentially serving as a benchmark for other organizations and enterprises.</p> How Aergo TSA&nbsp;Works <p>Aergo TSA is a time-stamping service based on the Aergo enterprise platform. When an electronic document is issued, NHIS requests a timestamp for the original document and registers it on an integrated server. The system then generates a timestamp token, transaction details, and a response message and stores both copies and original records in an electronic archive. Users can view the original document, check the timestamp issuance history, and verify its authenticity.</p> Key Success&nbsp;Factors <p>The adoption of the NHIS Aergo-based TSA is regarded as one of the most successful applications of blockchain technology in the public sector. Beyond its technological advancements, the project contributes to environmental sustainability, improved user convenience, and cost savings, significantly enhancing document management efficiency and reliability.</p><p>The key factors driving this success&nbsp;include:</p>  Integration with Legacy Systems: The blockchain solution was seamlessly integrated with existing IT infrastructure, minimizing implementation time and costs. A zero-downtime approach ensured that existing services continued without disruption.  Real-World Transaction Processing: The system demonstrated stable operation in a real-world enterprise environment, handling large-scale data transactions efficiently.  Maintenance &amp; Scalability: The blockchain system was designed for long-term maintenance and security updates, ensuring continued reliability and security.  <p>The NHIS blockchain project successfully meets these criteria, establishing itself as a model case for blockchain adoption in public institutions.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/koreas-national-health-insurance-service-adopts-blockchain-based-tsa-leading-public-service-b5cb9b057b88">Korea’s National Health Insurance Service Adopts Blockchain-Based TSA… Leading Public Service…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Absolutely, absolutely. Thank you so much. I have a copy of it right here, and you spoke about the origins, SO I would say, when you have some time, Mike, go through the second page, the preface. It talks about me and my kids and what kind of motivated me as far as my family goes to get the book done. But in all reality, putting family aside and the emotions aside, one reason why I wanted to write the book is because the entire industry has been focused on identity management, and the key word out there is just “identity management”, IAM, identity and access management, identity governance, identity proliferation, and that’s what the focus was. And over a period of time over the years, everybody built fantastic identity management platforms, but all of them were centralized, and centralized systems come with its own set of issues, pros and cons, of course. And then came by a new technology, a new framework that was, of course, initiated by the entire boom and the hype in the industry started off with crypto assets coming into the picture, like Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
<p>But what fascinated me was the technology. The technology used to launch all these cryptocurrencies or tokens or whatever they want to call it. And the technology was so fascinating, and I said, “Wait a second, this architecture can actually be used for managing identities in a very privacy-preserving manner, following the laws of zero trust and privacy by design, and also enhance the security posture of any organization that needs to deal with identity management and governance within their organization.” So that’s when we came up with the whole idea of building something on the decentralized identity platform or the framework.</p>
<p>However, even after building it and launching it in the market and a bunch of organizations using it day-in and day-out, there’s a huge facet of the industry that didn’t really understand the core concepts of decentralized identities. And I said, “When it comes up to new tech, the number one or the primary go-to-market or the primary task that any organization has to undertake is user education.” If your users don’t understand the tech that they’re working with, that they’re dealing with that applies to them, there would be reluctance both from an adoption standpoint and also from the standpoint of, “Oh my God, where is my data going? Is it going to go on the blockchain? Is it going to go on somebody else’s network? Who’s going to own this data?” There are a million questions that pop into a person’s mind, both from a user standpoint, from the organization standpoint, from the CISO’s perspective, from the CTO’s perspective. So I said the best way to move forward in enabling this industry to embrace decentralized identities is to write a book about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Fascinating. That’s great. Well, you’ve kind of walked up to the second question I had in mind, which was, why now? And you’ve kind of touched on it, but maybe you can expand on that. It seems like there’s this duality where businesses, organizations, individuals need to know with certainty who they’re dealing with online, but then there’s the privacy concerns. Talk a little bit about this balance, if you will, of getting past this built-in anonymity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>Anonymization of user data, et cetera. But before I jump into that and talk about the difference between the two, if you look at the book, and even without going through the entire book, if you just go through the table of contents in the book, you would notice that I start with the history of digital identity and then I jump into identity and access management and then I dive into best practices for identity and access management. And then it’s only after that that I jump into topics like trust anchors and sources of truth and the relationship between trust. And finally, towards the end is when I jump into the near future, which talks about the digital identity era.</p>
<p>So it’s not that I’ve written the book with the ideology or with the mindset saying, “Let me just write about decentralized identities.” It is important for someone to understand how identities are managed and governed, what’s the industry used to, and what are the pros and cons of the current approach or methodology before they can learn to appreciate the value that decentralized identities bring into the picture. So I tried to write the book in such a format that it can be read by any non-technical person to understand what the concepts are all about.</p>
<p>There are a few technical chapters as well, because it’s not just for the common man, it’s also for your IT managers and your CISOs and your CTOs too, but it does touch upon both aspects of it. As in, what is identity in the traditional sense of the word? And what does decentralized identity bring to the table and how does one go about implementing it? Which is why the book is split into various parts that talks about centralized identity and then talks about decentralized identity. Because I don’t want to nail a thought in your head out of force. I want users to be able to read, understand, gauge, and determine for themselves if it is something that their organization wants to implement or if it is something of value to the organization, rather than me just writing about decentralized identities without any context and tell people that, “This is important for you,” because nobody’s going to buy into the concept of me telling you that it is important, whereas me giving you proof and information about the difference between the current approach and the new and why this is better would yield better results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Well, that’s great. I mean, I’ve always thought if you really know something, you can explain it so just about anybody can understand it. It sounds like that’s the approach you took with the book. Let’s just cut right to the heart of it. What are the top three things or the top three takeaways that anybody should know about decentralized identity?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>Okay, I was not expecting that question, but I’m going to try. I’m going to try. I don’t know if I’m going to be able to tell you the top three or the top four or five, but I’ll tell you a few of the top key elements that I want people to take away from this. One is that identity, what is identity? Whether it is a user ID and password that you use to access systems, whether it is my driver’s license or my passport or my birth certificate, what is it that actually comprises my identity?</p>
<p>So I’ve gone into describing what identity means from a user’s perspective. And the reason I went in from the user’s perspective is because if you talk about corporates or organizations, all organizations, I think I mentioned this before in another podcast, that they tend to have this, it’s called the God concept. So if I’m an organization and if I have an active directory or an Oracle database or an LDAP server that contains the credentials for all the employees in my organization, I own it. So I believe that I own facets of your identity, be it your passport data, your email address, phone number, name, date of birth, et cetera.</p>
<p>But the reality is that the only person who needs to own that data in terms of ownership is the user himself. So it is important to draw that differentiation between why decentralized identity puts rights of user data back in the hands of the user with very low friction. So as long as a user owns his data, manages his own data, has the ability to selectively present the data that he wants to present to various institutes or organizations in a privacy-preserving manner, a centralized identity system won’t be able to do it. So that’s where decentralized identity comes in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay, great. Now, what is the difference between decentralized identity and self-sovereign identity? Also a term I’ve heard floated around lately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, there’s a lot of back and forth in the industry with those two terms. People typically assume that decentralized identity means it’s a self-sovereign identity and vice versa, but it is not.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity is the framework or the platform that allows you to store information in several locations without having a central authority controlling it. The whole concept is like a ledger, where you’ve got a trail of when that data was created, when it changed, who changed it, how it changed, what was presented.</p>
<p>Self-sovereign identity sits atop of decentralized identity or sits beside decentralized identity. In the self-sovereign identity world, the user asserts his own identity. So I can tell you that I’m Michael Cichon, I can probably use a deep fake video and hold my phone up to your camera and say, “This is me,” where the user self-asserts his identity attributes or information.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity doesn’t state that decentralized identity only talks about the technology stack on how identities can be managed in a decentralized manner. That does not necessarily mean that the user has got the right to claim to be whoever he or she wants to be. So the decentralized identity framework, I need to prove who I am first before my identity can be asserted and validated. And a good example of that is in our 1Kosmos app, the product that we have at 1Kosmos, you scan your driver’s license and you scan your passport.</p>
<p>Now, I can talk for two hours of what happens behind the scenes when you hold the driver’s license in front of the phone or you scan your passport. It takes only two seconds, but the amount of tech behind it that scans the driver’s license, goes and validates the authenticity of that driver’s license, looks at whether the document itself is real or fake, goes and validates that against sources of truth, which is why my book also talks about trust anchors and sources of truth, goes and validates that against sources of truth like the Department of Motor Vehicles to ensure that the driver’s license is actually valid and it was actually issued to you, correlate that data to the data that’s extracted from the passport, verifying the signatures on the biometric chip on the passport, and that becomes my identity. So I can state that I am Michael Cichon, but the documents that I’m presenting to prove who I am, state that I am Rohan Pinto. So the identity that’s created for me is for the identity extracted from those documents that were presented. So I can never be Michael Cichon.</p>
<p>In the self-sovereign identity world. I can claim to be whoever I want to be. Now, the self-sovereign identity world has also embraced a lot of concepts from the decentralized identity framework itself. So you can claim who you want to be, but once you claim to be someone, you then need to substantiate that claim with proof of identity documents later to make that identity valid. But in our world, you prove who you are first, and that is who you are, rather than me saying I’m somebody else and then using other documents and things like that. So there’s a huge differentiation there.</p>
<p>So one way to look at it is self-sovereign identity, I say I’m Rohan Pinto. Decentralized identity, the province of Ontario says that I’m Rohan Pinto because that’s what’s on my driver’s license, the government of Canada states and asserts that I am Rohan Pinto because that’s the information on my passport. So that’s my identity as opposed to the other one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Okay. All right. So in a practical application, decentralized identity allows you to very quickly access a digital service without an artifact, like a password or something and it allows you to preserve that privacy. Like, I control my own data, I determine what I share with any given service at the point that I’m using that service. That’s all well and fine, but this is one organization at a time, right? How far off are we? Where, if you will, I have a QR code and I’m the QR code, and wherever I go, it just recognizes me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>Yeah, very interesting question. Very valid question. And you touched upon a very important topic out here. When we first built this product or the platform, the focus was all on the term decentralized identity and blockchain, I’m talking about the product and the platform at 1Kosmos, and almost everybody said, “Oh my God, this is absolutely awesome.”</p>
<p>Now, once you build some awesome tech and you want to go to market with it, the first question that pops into mind is, “Where do I use it?” So I have a decentralized identity with me right now, but where do I use it? “Can I go and shop on Amazon with it?” And the answer is no, because Amazon doesn’t consume it yet. “Can I go to eBay and buy something?” Oh, no, you can’t do that yet. All those examples that you gave and those use cases and the demos that you gave last month where you were explaining consent and you were talking about things like selective disclosure where you can go to a liquor store and present your decentralized identity to prove that you’re over 19 without divulging information like my date of birth or my home address, brilliant use case, but can I do it in reality? And you say, “Oh, no, you can’t do it yet.” So the big problem is adoption.</p>
<p>So you can distribute a decentralized identity, whether it’s on a mobile phone or on a laptop or any which way you want to all the 8 billion people on this planet, but if there’s no place that they can actually put it to good use, the value in that is zero. Because as great as the technology stack is, if you can’t put it to use, there’s no value in it. So we took another approach. Instead of trying to convince 8 billion people on this planet on how awesome this tech is, we said, “Let’s go the top-down approach. Let’s go to organizations and look at their current security posture, tell them the pros and cons in their current approach, talk to them about where the industry is headed, talk to them about the technologies that are going to come into play very soon, and show them how they can proactively circumvent all the security issues, the hacks, the breaches, the phishing attempts that they would have to deal with over a period of time before it happens rather than after it happens.”</p>
<p>The number one mistake that I have noticed in this industry is that everybody is reactive rather than being proactive, so one of the primary focuses that 1Kosmos had when they went out to market is putting a solution out there that enables organizations to be proactive rather than reactive. So when organizations start embracing this technology and enabling their employees, their customers, their partners to access their digital assets or systems using a decentralized identity, the employees or the customers and the partners and every user says, “Wow, it was that simple. I did not have to provide a user ID anywhere. I don’t have to remember passwords anymore. I don’t get OTP codes via SMS anymore.” And we know OTP via SMS is really weak, but this podcast is not about talking how bad the current systems are, but rather talk about the value that decentralized identity brings to the table. So when you take the top-down approach where organizations release this as a feature to all their employees, they say, “Wow, this is great.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>And then they look at another service that has also embraced and implemented decentralized identity platforms and they say, “Fantastic. Now I do not have to go from Service A to Service B and create another user ID and password and then go to Service C and create another user account out there. I can literally take my digital identity and go from A to B to C whenever I want.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>It’s fascinating, because what you’re describing sounds like, number one, a tectonic shift in using artifacts to prove who you are, artifacts like a password, versus using yourself as an authenticator. And at the same time, there’s some tipping point, whether it’s, as we look at the Fortune Global 500, make a move toward this technology, the Global 1000, you start to see federal agencies, state local agencies doing it. At some point, there is this tipping point, and I personally look forward to that at a time where I’m recognized it’s very difficult for anybody to fake my identity, cause me fraud, cause the organizations that I transact with fraud.</p>
<p>It’s fascinating and equally fascinating, Rohan, is this, for many, is a new topic, but we did more than stumble on it back in 2016 when the rates of the company were placed. 1Kosmos was incorporated in 2018. I know you’re a couple of years ahead of that. So literally nine years ahead of the trend, you dove into this. So that’s a remarkable accomplishment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>Thank you. Thank you, Mike. But I wouldn’t say we stumbled on it or I didn’t stumble on it either, because I’ve been playing in the identity management space or been working in the identity management space for decades. I have been working in the cryptographic and the PKI space for decades. And way back in early 2000, I would say around the 2009, 2010, 2011, when there were small discussions in pockets about, “Oh my God, Bitcoin. Have you heard about Bitcoin?” That’s when my interest in the technology stack started increasing, and it started increasing exponentially because the minute I saw the tech stack that Bitcoin ran over and how other platforms like Ethereum or Solana or Tron started adopting the same technology, not the same for end-to-end, that’s when I said, “Well, this is a very, very efficient way to manage a system.”</p>
<p>The initial thought process was very basic, Michael, very, very basic. And the thought process was, what’s the cost of managing 1000 users in an organization? I am not talking about the investment an organization has in active directory or LDAP or Oracle. The cost of managing those users is that you need to store their credentials somewhere. You need to have access governance rules that govern who has got access to that. And the industry does not know what to do with it, so they come up with six alphanumeric, then they make it eight alphanumeric with numbers, then they made it 12. I’ve seen instances where the passwords is almost 24 alphanumeric characters with special characters, cannot be used three times. I mean, the industry is coming up with all kinds of permutations and combinations to make it harder for the user to remember who he is or she is. It should not be so hard.</p>
<p>Also, the cost of the organization managing that identity is quite huge because it’s not just about storing a user ID and password somewhere, it’s also about the cost of all these other systems that you need to build over it to ensure things like data breaches, password changes, password resets, it’s not hacked, it’s not phished. And you can literally eliminate all that by putting a user’s identity on this little device that you carry.</p>
<p>Let’s look at scale right now. So instead of having a million users sitting in a database and you incurring costs to manage those million users, you now distribute those million identities or identity data to a million users on a million devices. So let’s go down to the grassroots. If you hack a centralized system that has a million user IDs and passwords, regardless if the passwords are clear text assaulted, you have access to a million user IDs and passwords. And that’s the number one breach that goes on today. We hear it all the time. “TechCrunch was hacked, 1000 user IDs compromised. This one was hacked, a million users compromised. 10 million user IDs compromised out here.” It happens day-in and day-out almost every single day. Now, imagine you want to hack an organization where a million identities are stored on a million users own devices. You’ll need to hack a million devices.</p>
<p>And then the added layer of security on top of it is biometrics. So when you add biometrics on top of decentralized identity, stealing my phone is not going to give you access to my identity data. You need me because I need to unlock my device with my biometrics. And it is not a static biometric like scan a photograph. You’re talking about live ID where you ensure that the person is a real person by expecting the user to express human emotions like smile or blink or move your head. We also do depth calculations on the user’s biometrics, for example, the depth between the ears and the nose and the chin, et cetera. So the entire stack is so technically advanced from a technology standpoint, but from a usability standpoint, it’s as simple as pick up the phone, look at it, and you’re done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Right, Well, the time for this is now, in fact, it’s probably a few years past already as all these data breaches, we have now nation states attacking individuals and organizations at will equipped with all this data breach information. And you see it every day in the phone calls, the text messages, the emails that you get that are phony, trying to get you to click on a link and compromise yourself. I could talk to you at length on this. It’s a fascinating topic. I’ve got a dozen questions in my mind I’d like to talk to you about now, but we’re kind of running out of time. Very much appreciate you spending 20, 30 minutes with me this morning. Your book’s fascinating. I’m going to be digging into it more deeply. Just really appreciate it. Any parting thoughts? Again, I’ve got a dozen, but I don’t want to get into them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>Okay. So parting thought is not simple. A lot of people say that the time is now. I think the time was yesterday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>If you are trying to build a better security posture for your organization, if you have not done it already, then the time is now. Do you want to consider yourself to be a proactive organization or a reactive organization? Do you want to deal with the fines and the levies by the governing bodies for leaking user information or privacy data? The impact it’s going to have when you have a weak security posture is very, very expensive.</p>
<p>So for those organizations and people who have not yet embraced decentralized identity within the organization, the time is now. But a lot of organizations have already embraced it. Even organizations and entities like MasterCard, Visa Card, Microsoft are all there already. But we still proudly say that we were the first, because we were the first. There are a lot of players in the market out here, but we also had the first mover advantage, because any organization building something on the decentralized identity platform or framework, they don’t build it once and it’s done. They evolve. They evolve all the time.</p>
<p>You’ve got to look at current market trends, you’ve got to look at current threats, you’ve got to ensure that all threats from an operating system standpoint, from a usability standpoint are all addressed. So you’re constantly building on top of it. So being the first to market gives us that ability to be on top of all the security threats and start addressing those as well, rather than being a new entrant in the market and starting off with decentralized identity now as opposed to an organization that has been doing it for the last five, six years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Yeah. Well, I think that’s fair and I think we’ve seen it in the customer growth here at 1Kosmos where we’re seeing organizations with literally hundreds of thousands of employees, and I don’t know the exact count, but tens of thousands of authentications daily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>Millions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>The scalability is proven there. And I think whether it’s a law of nature or not, the most simple, straightforward solution is probably the best solution. And the built-in complexity we’ve seen in identity systems has come from the fact that we didn’t have this technology before. We’ve had passwords that had to be protected, and then anti-phishing and all these defenses that had to be built up over time because we didn’t have a decentralized identity. Now that we have it, we can take a more simplified cost-effective approach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>Absolutely. And one more thing I would like to add, Michael. Every time I say decentralized identity, I have a tendency to pick up my phone and say, “Okay, this is where your identity is stored.” It’s just a habit because our initial launch was actually building it and ensuring that it’s on a device that the user owns. But as of today, your decentralized identity does not necessarily need to be on your phone. It can be on your device, it can be on your laptop, it can be on your desktop as well. So for organizations that mandate no phones in a particular area, like white room use cases, you can actually still enable decentralized identity and biometrics based authentication into your password-less systems without using your phone as well, because you can do it directly from your desktops now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Right. Well, keep adding last points here. One thing you mentioned in the past we touch on now, though, is that the standards bodies have caught up in terms of the frameworks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Just a little fragment on those if you would, please.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
 
<p>Oh, very simple. One of the most important standards body is NIST. The most important. And NIST has got a spec called the 800-63-3A, which everybody follows, that talked about the levels of assurance that need to be associated with that identity from an anonymous identity, which is a level one, to a proved identity, which is a level two, and then a higher level.</p>
<p>NIST, in fact, just published their 800-63-4 very recently. And if you look at the specification, if you have the time and the effort and the patience to read through the entire spec document that NIST has published, you will realize that this is something that we already did six years ago. Therefore, that itself is quite a good indicator that all the governing bodies, the regulations, are also catching up because they know that this technology is going to be adopted by anybody and everybody. All organizations are moving forward and they are publishing governance rules and regulations to make sure that organizations implement it with the right mindset, with the right thought process, which is, it’s not about “Let’s build something and make money,” but it’s all about, “Let’s build something that to ensure that user’s privacy and the user’s own consent is mandated and required and safeguarded.” So the focus out here is still the privacy of the user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Michael Cichon:</p>
 
<p>Got it. Well, I think, in addition to that, it’s a great way to create efficiencies and in particular government efficiencies, and we’re going to leave it at that roll on. Rohan, thank you so much for your time. Everybody else, the book Decentralized Identity Explained, we’re going to put a link to this on our corporate website. You could order it there. Interestingly enough, there’s a QR code to let you download a free PDF of it. But a fascinating read, a very well-written book by a very renowned expert. Rohan, thank you so much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Rohan Pinto:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
<p>Thank you so much, Michael. Thank you so much for your time.</p>

 Identity proofing, or identity verification, is the process of verifying that someone is who they say they are. It ensures that the claimed digital identity exists in the real world and that the person claiming it is an authorized representative for that identity.

<p>Identity proofing, or identity verification, is the process of verifying that someone is who they say they are. It ensures that the claimed digital identity exists in the real world and that the person claiming it is an authorized representative for that identity.</p>  
<p>Historically, Identity proofing is commonly performed by organizations as part of an onboarding process before or alongside the issuing of authentication credentials to access digital systems. Often, this is done with in-office visits or a series of manually performed steps.&nbsp;</p> 
 Why is Identity Proofing Needed?  
<p>Identity proofing is necessary to help mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, identity fraud, data breaches, and other malicious activities to your services and sensitive data. Compared to authentication, which focuses on the ownership of the user credentials, identity proofing ensures that the individual holding the credentials is truly who they claims to be.&nbsp;</p> 
 Address Identity Risks When It Matters The Most  
<p>Identity risks occur throughout the customer or employee identity lifecycle. Many companies apply identity proofing at the time of new account opening or employee hire and neglect other key moments of increased risk. Adversaries targeting credentials do not merely stop at trying to impersonate or intercept at the time of onboarding.</p> 
<p>Threat actors frequently target weak links in the authentication chain, including account recovery and day-to-day activities. Modern identity proofing should be user journey-oriented and adaptable beyond initial onboarding to ensure the highest continuous protection against identity fraud.</p> 
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/cs/ci/?pg=144955ed-0aee-4519-80f5-8538b0cfd4c0&amp;pid=2670073&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic="></a></p> 
 Candidate Fraud&nbsp;  
<p>Potential candidates may misrepresent their qualifications and experience by using fake documents or references during the interview process to increase their chances of being hired by a company.</p> 
<p>The growing trend of remote work combined with AI technology has also made it easier for imposters to create deepfake videos of the candidate, AI-generated voices, resumes, and use interview proxies to game the interview system. This is why <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/candidate-verification-onboarding">candidate verification</a> is becoming increasingly important for HR teams.</p> 
 Employee Onboarding  
<p>Before giving any new hire access to corporate systems and data, HR teams need to ensure that the person they are onboarding has a credible identity and is the legitimate owner of the identity they are claiming. They also need to verify that the new employee is, in fact, the person that was interviewed for the role.</p> 
 Credential Resets / Account Recovery  
<p>Credential reset processes occur for a variety of reasons, such as when a user loses their mobile device or forgets their access information. Organizations typically expect professionals to call into their company helpdesk and generally verify the individual through familiarity with one another, secret questions, and loose identifiers such as their employee ID.</p> 
<p>Attackers can increasingly exploit these flaws with social engineering, deepfake attacks, and advanced voice AI to trick IT teams into providing new credentials. Modern identity proofing techniques seek to address the challenges of a global workforce and equip support teams with the ability to correctly identify that the person seeking access is who they say they are.&nbsp;</p> 
 Changing Roles  
<p>Employees may need elevated privileges as they gain responsibility in an organization. Organizations must first ensure both the employee’s change in role and identity before granting access to systems and data previously out of reach. These best practices help defend against unauthorized access and data breaches targeted at these important career moments.</p> 
 Elevated Detected Risk  
<p>Other situations may arise where an employee triggers a behavior that seems suspicious or there are indications of elevated risk to an organization. For example, an organization may require identity proofing after an employee attempts to access the network from an unexpected location, at an unusual time, or if threats have been flagged by security tools.&nbsp;</p> 
 How Does Identity Proofing Work?  
<p>NIST defines identity proofing primarily in <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63a.html">Special Publication 800-63A</a>, detailing the process of verifying an individual’s identity with evidence provided by the applicant. Historically, the methods primarily used include in-person verification against a government-issued document, the user’s ability to convey knowledge-based answers about themselves, or to answer secret questions created at an earlier time with the company.</p> 
<p>Depending on the level of access and privileges of the user, companies may combine multiple steps to further challenge an end user. This is often not user-centric and can lead to significant friction or challenges to reach successful verification.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>NIST defines different Identity Assurance Levels (IALs) such as IAL1 for minimal verification and IAL2 and IAL3 for more stringent procedures to be used for more risk-based and privileged access needs.</p> 
<p>Modern identity proofing seeks to consider the user’s privileges and access requirements and provides the seamless ability to challenge the user into providing expected data.</p> 
<p>Orchestrating a user journey through identity proofing should take the user on a path that requires an appropriate and efficient amount of context switching, few or no requirements to download various software or tools to proceed, and should seek to cause minimal disruption to the action which they are then seeking to perform.&nbsp;</p> 
<p></p> 
 Different Types of Modern Identity Proofing Explained  
<p>Organizations typically combine different types of identity proofing since each type offers different levels of trust and security.&nbsp;</p> 
 Document Verification  
<p>Identity documents can be stolen, altered, or forged by malicious actors. To mitigate these risks, organizations employ various technologies to digitally verify the validity of a document, such as a government-issued ID passport, driver’s license, or military ID card.&nbsp;</p> 
 Biometric Identity Verification  
<p>Another method of identity proofing is through identifying distinct physical or behavioral characteristics. These can include fingerprints, voice patterns, or facial features, keystroke patterns, or mouse movements.</p> 
<p>Since biometrics are typically more difficult to fake or forge than document verification, their verification delivers a higher level of trust – and are often combined with other <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/identity-verification-vs-authentication">identity verification methods</a> such as document verification.&nbsp;</p> 
 Video Verification  
<p>Video verification is executed through a live video conference and involves prompts and actions aimed at verifying a user's liveness while identifying any signs of spoofing or coercion. It may also include document verification to confirm that the person in the government-issued ID is the same as the one in the video.&nbsp;</p> 
 Knowledge-Based Verification (KBV)  
<p>Knowledge-based verification involves asking an individual personal information that only they can potentially answer, such as where they went to high school, the name of a pet, or a 2FA code.&nbsp;</p> 
 Familiarity-Based Verification (FBV)  
<p>Familiarity-based verification is the act in which a user is further verified by their administrators through familiarity in interaction. In the case of in-person visitation, seeing an individual they have previously seen before or hearing from a new individual with detailed insight about their common connections and working environment helps to strengthen an administrator's level of trust about an individual seeking verification.</p> 
<p>In a remote environment, the individual, being an existing colleague, may provide helpful clues to FBV. At the same time, in a remote environment, these clues can potentially be false positives that threat actors heavily focus on to build trust.&nbsp;</p> 
 Identity Proofing for Customers and the Workforce  
<p>While identity proofing for customers and the workforce share many similarities and methods, there are a few key differences:</p> 
  
  Goal: <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/best-practices-for-identity-proofing-in-the-workplace">Workforce identity proofing</a> ensures that access to sensitive data is only granted to authorized individuals. Customer identity proofing typically focuses on the verification of identity to meet compliance and prevent fraud.&nbsp;  
  Compliance: Workforce and customer identity proofing are governed by different regulations. For example, KYE and NIST guidelines pertain primarily to employee verification. On the other hand, KYC and AML rules apply to customer identity proofing.  
  Frequency: Workforce identity proofing should be continuous to ensure it defends against risk throughout the identity lifecycle. Customer identity proofing is typically executed at a particular point in time, such as account creation.&nbsp;  
  
 Lessons from Real-World Applications  
<p>The risks from insufficient identity proofing are widespread and growing, yet underscore its importance and need at all stages of the employee lifecycle. &nbsp;<br><br>Recent examples include:&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The MGM Attack</p> 
<p>The <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/lessons-from-the-mgm-attack">recent MGM attack</a> is a prime example of how attackers impersonated an employee, convinced help desk personnel to reset account credentials, and eventually gained full access to IT systems, exfiltrating highly sensitive data. The attack cost the resort group over $100 million and disrupted operations for days.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Fake IT hires from North Korea.</p> 
<p>The FBI has issued multiple warnings about <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-weapons-program-it-workers-f3df7c120522b0581db5c0b9682ebc9b">fake IT workers from North Korea</a> posing as U.S.-based contract workers. Thousands have been hired by U.S. companies, sending their paychecks to North Korea to fund its ballistic missile programs.</p> 
<p>They were able to fake their identities using a combination of forged documents, social media profiles, third parties, and proxy servers. Most recently, the <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250123">FBI warned</a> that such imposters are exfiltrating data and proprietary code and extorting victim companies to pay a ransom.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Remote workers that fail identity verification.</p> 
<p><a href="https://blog.hypr.com/hypr-unmasks-fake-it-worker">HYPR uncovered its own version of a fake IT worke</a>r when a contractor hired through an IT service firm failed identity verification during his onboarding. First, a location check did not match the information he had provided.</p> 
<p>Second, discrepancies were found between the passport photo and the face scan during the biometric verification. Finally, the new hire refused to turn on his camera for the video verification, claiming technical issues. The candidate then abruptly ceased contact and informed the contracting firm that he had found another position.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The last example illustrates the importance of a multi-layered approach to identity proofing during both the hiring and onboarding processes. This comprehensive approach may help mitigate North Korean IT worker scams as well. A trigger requiring additional identity verification for escalated privileges may have mitigated the MGM attack.&nbsp;</p> 
 
   
    
    
    
  
  
 How Identity Proofing Delivers Tangible ROI for Your Organization  
<p>The rise of hybrid and remote work, cloud and AI technology demands that organizations turn to identity proofing to secure their data and IT infrastructure.</p> 
<p>Other benefits of identity proofing include:</p> 
  
  Reduce financial losses from fraud and breaches that often lead to reputational damage and a loss in customer trust.  
  Lower compliance costs by meeting regulatory requirements.  
  Enhance operational efficiency with automated identity proofing  
  Improve customer trust and retention with secure onboarding and remote ID proofing.&nbsp;  
  Accelerate employee productivity with user-friendly verification and an easy user experience. &nbsp;  
  
 Compliance Considerations for Secure Identity Verification  
<p>Identity proofing helps organizations meet a wide range of standards and regulations, including:</p> 
  
  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Digital Identity Guidelines. NIST SP 800-63 establishes a framework for the process of digital identity that includes digital proofing and authentication. It defines three different Identity Assurance Levels (IAL) based on the identity proofing process and level of risk.&nbsp;  
  Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML). KYC offers a comprehensive framework for verifying customers’ identities and is required by financial institutions. The goal of these regulations is to ensure that the source of funding is legitimate and does not originate from illegal means.  
  Know Your Employee (KYE). <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/tips-to-strengthen-know-your-employee-kye">KYE is a process</a> that includes identity verification, background checks, and employment authorization verification. It helps ensure employee identity not only during the hiring and onboarding process but throughout the employee’s tenure.  
  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). HIPAA identity verification ensures an individual has legal access to personal health information (PHI) through in-person, telephone, or electronic methods. It does not, however, prescribe a specific method for identity verification.&nbsp;  
  Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). The FFIEC requires financial institutions to establish a specific process for identity verification. This approach includes risk-based authentication methods, multi-factor authentication (MFA), customer authentication and identity proofing, and compliance with other regulations related to fraud prevention and identity management such as the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), and the Customer Identification Program (CIP).  
  Financial Action Task Force (FATF). The FATF sets global standards for identity proofing in the context of anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF), using NIST’s risk-based approach to define assurance levels for identity proofing. It also requires financial institutions to implement comprehensive customer due diligence (CDD) and includes guidance on digital identity systems for this purpose.&nbsp;  
  Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). <a href="https://sarbanes-oxley-act.com/">SOX is a federal law</a> that regulates financial reporting and auditing for public companies in the United States. Elements of Sarbanes-Oxley also cover authentication and identity proofing with respect to the need for companies to have robust security measures in place to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive financial data.&nbsp;  
  
<p><a href="https://www.hypr.com/cs/ci/?pg=dae06fbd-00af-4edd-bff8-a4548b253843&amp;pid=2670073&amp;ecid=&amp;hseid=&amp;hsic="></a></p> 
 Implementing Identity Proofing: Mapping Out Your Use Cases&nbsp;  
<p>A multi-layered approach to identity proofing allows organizations to implement different user identification methods based on the use case and level of risk. Different use cases may also require adhering to different regulations or standards, depending on the industry.&nbsp;</p> 
 Balancing UX with Risk&nbsp;  
<p>Avoid an overly strict approach that rejects legitimate candidates or employees who gained more responsibility and access to sensitive data. At the same time, an approach that is too loose allows fraudulent users to slip through and pose a risk to your organization.</p> 
<p>For example, a multi-layered approach allows you to combine documentation verification with biometric verification to reduce friction as much as possible while at the same time allowing stronger verification for use cases that present higher risk situations.&nbsp;</p> 
 Integrate and Test with Existing Systems and Processes  
<p>After mapping your existing systems, identify any security gaps or weaknesses. Run through different user scenarios to understand where you need identity proofing in the user journey (e.g., at login for a bank account, before continuing the interview process for an employee).</p> 
<p>Run extensive pilot tests to evaluate the integration’s ability to deliver a seamless and frictionless experience while ensuring security. Mapping existing systems and testing integrations helps to ensure that the identity proofing implementation strategy you choose is the one that aligns with your organization’s operational needs.</p> 
 Educate Your Stakeholders  
<p>Offer adequate support and training to employees to ensure that the identity proofing process is used effectively and how it specifically ensures the organization adheres to different legal and industrial regulations.</p> 
<p>Make sure stakeholders clearly understand the benefit that identity proofing can bring to the organization, such as a reduced risk of cybersecurity attacks and subsequent monetary fines, increased operational efficiency, and a faster, more secure employee interview or onboarding process.&nbsp;</p> 
 Monitor and Adapt Over Time  
<p>As threats evolve, the identity proofing process will change to meet the increasing security demands. Organizations must continuously adapt to changing technology, emerging threats, and updated compliance requirements on how identity proofing can help them defend against these threats and help them adhere to the latest regulations.&nbsp;</p> 
 How to Choose an Identity Proofing Solution  
<p>When considering implementing an identity proofing solution, your organization should ensure that it:</p> 
  
  Offers automated, continuous identity verification in real-time.  
  Validates the identity of the person, not just the user, by integrating multiple verification factors dynamically and contextually throughout the user session.  
  Focuses on a <a href="https://www.hypr.com/solutions/user-experience">frictionless user experience </a>without compromising security.  
  Helps you adhere to the latest compliance requirements such as KYC, AML, and KYE and avoid monetary penalties.  
  Can be used for remote employees.  
  Monitors and updates its processes and security regularly to meet evolving threats, changing technology, and the dynamic regulatory landscape.&nbsp;

<p>Thales and Malaysia Airlines have signed a long-term services agreement for Thales avionics products onboard the Airline’s A330neo fleet. </p>
<p>Through this service agreement, Thales will manage all repairs for its avionics products, as well as provide spares availability and replenishment with stock located in Malaysia Airlines’ main hub and Thales’ Asia-Pacific repair hub in Singapore. This enables the airline to maintain their aircraft at the highest level of performance, while optimizing fleet reliability. This maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) contract, with Thales as the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/worldwide/aerospace/press_release/malaysia-airlines-partners-thales-optimize-flight-management-and">having supplied its Flight Management and Surveillance systems in 2024</a>, ensures that Malaysia Airlines has high-quality premium repair services to support fleet operational efficiency and drive maintenance cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>Thales’s Aviation Global Services (AGS) is a one-stop shop for all airline customers and partners, delivering 24/7 Aircraft on Ground (AOG) support with locations around the world. From maintenance and repairs to technical support, training, parts trading and line maintenance, AGS supports airlines with comprehensive solutions. Thales has developed a complete range of maintenance services and spares management, such as Repair by the Hour (RBTH) and asset availability programs aimed at providing customers with cost-efficient service. </p>
<p>Thales continues to build on the enduring relationship with Malaysia Airlines to support the airline’s focus on hospitality and quality. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/worldwide/aerospace/press_release/malaysia-airlines-partners-thales-optimize-flight-management-and">Malaysia Airlines chose Thales’s Flight Management and surveillance systems</a> for these same A330neo aircraft.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Thales is proud to announce this new agreement with Malaysia Airlines that demonstrates our strong partnership and underscores our shared commitment to operational excellence,” said Thomas Got, Vice President of Aviation Global Services, Thales Avionics. “We thank Malaysia Airlines for their trust. Our deep expertise in avionics repair and support makes Thales a leading MRO in Asia with innovative and premium support services.” </p></blockquote>

 Discover how choosing the right character maker can transform your digital presence in 2025. Create custom digital characters that work everywhere, from gaming to virtual worlds. 



 Why Character Makers Matter Now&nbsp; 



<p>The digital world is changing fast, bringing us closer to a reality where virtual presence matters as much as physical appearance. In this new landscape, digital characters have become essential tools for creators, gamers, and professionals.</p>



<p>In this new creator economy, having a versatile character maker is key. Digital characters aren’t just static images anymore – they’re dynamic representations that can <a href="https://unionavatars.com/a-beginners-guide-to-making-a-3d-vtuber-avatar/">stream, interact, and engage across multiple platforms</a>.</p>



 The Rise of Digital Characters 



<p>Look at the success stories emerging from the digital space. Virtual influencers are earning substantial incomes, with some <a href="https://unionavatars.com/free-avatar-generator-every-creator-needs/">generating over €600,000 in annual revenue</a>. Gaming content creators using digital characters earn just over $4,000 monthly.</p>



<p>The numbers speak for themselves – <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/gen-z-teens-gaming.html">Over 80% of Gen Z engages with digital character content </a>regularly. The market for digital characters and virtual interactions continues to grow, with an estimated annual growth rate of 35.6% from 2024 to 2034</p>



 Why Traditional Character Makers Fall Short 



<p>Many character makers limit what creators can achieve. They often lack:</p>



 
 Cross-platform compatibility 



 Professional-grade features 



 Easy integration options 



 Secure asset management

<p>You can manage multiple characters in one place and use them across various platforms, from your favourite streaming services to virtual worlds.</p>



 The Future of Digital Characters 



<p>The gaming and streaming market is growing at a massive rate, estimated at USD 9.8 billion in 2023 with an 11.8% annual growth rate predicted until 2030. This growth creates endless opportunities for creators using the right character maker tools.</p>

<p>Written by Charlene Migwe — Director of the Mastercard Foundation Partnership at Caribou, Emmanuel Khisa — Africa Director at CDPI, Diana Sang — Regional Director for Africa at DIAL, Linet Kwamboka — Senior Program Manager at&nbsp;GPSDD</p><p>Digital public infrastructure (DPI) is transforming service delivery, economic participation, and governance across&nbsp;Africa.</p><p>But without well-designed governance frameworks, these systems risk reinforcing exclusion, limiting public trust, and failing to deliver true public&nbsp;value.</p><p>As part of the <a href="https://conference.openinstitute.africa/">East Africa Data Governance conference</a>, Caribou — in collaboration with <a href="https://dial.global/">Digital Impact Alliance (DIAL)</a>, <a href="https://cdpi.dev/">Centre for Digital Public Infrastructure (CDPI)</a> and the <a href="https://www.data4sdgs.org/">Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data (GPSDD)</a> — hosted the panel “Governance by design for impact: Putting society at the center of digital public infrastructure and data exchange.” The panel explored strategies to prevent DPI and data exchange from causing widespread structural exclusion, emphasizing the need for effective governance to maximize public benefit. Discussions also covered practical approaches for developing metrics to assess and ensure the positive impact of DPI on people’s&nbsp;lives.</p><blockquote>“The emphasis should be on technology for the good of society, rather than technology for the benefit of the government or revenue generation. Benefit to government such as improved revenue should be dividends of a citizen centred technology”<br>Emmanuel&nbsp;Khisa</blockquote> Key takeaways  Practical ways to prevent structural exclusion <p>To prevent structural exclusion in digital systems, it is crucial to include all stakeholders, not just those at the implementation level. A key example is the open data platform in Kenya, which initially focused on data supply from the government but missed involving those who would use the data, such as developers, technologists, and researchers. A conscious decision to involve civil society organizations led to steady growth and community involvement. This highlights the importance of understanding stakeholder roles and ensuring stakeholders’ active participation.</p>  Design should be with the citizen in mind, focusing on value from and to citizens. It’s crucial to balance governmental institutional value, such as efficiency and improved revenue, with public value and citizen engagement. The emphasis should be on technology for the good of society rather than society for the benefit of the government or revenue generation. This ensures that DPI initiatives genuinely serve the public interest and contribute to societal well-being.  Keep digital public interest top of mind. Digital infrastructure should be viewed from a digital public interest lens, rather than from the perspective of an individual organization or government. Standardizing processes and policies ensures efficiency, interoperability, and equal access. Shared infrastructure is essential, with a whole-of-government approach. By adopting this perspective, resources can be used more efficiently and redundancy can be minimized.  Engagement should occur at every level, working through civil society and community-based organizations. While public policymaking processes ideally involve people at all levels, being truly people-centric is challenging. It involves cost, time, workforce communication, and reach implications. Special attention should be given to marginalized groups, including those without written languages. Explaining concepts like consent requires addressing varying levels of digital and data literacy.  Trust is the currency for data exchange and flow. From the outset, DPI design, implementation, and governance, especially in data exchange platforms, must prioritize trust. Governance should be integrated from the beginning to ensure proper mechanisms are in place and systemic risks are prevented. This proactive approach is essential for building and maintaining public confidence in digital&nbsp;systems.   AI and&nbsp;DPI <p>As AI continues to advance, DPI must be at the center of its growth to support its development while ensuring responsible data governance and user-centric design and architecture. Lessons from the <a href="https://ict.go.ke/sites/default/files/2025-01/Kenya%20National%20AI%20Strategy%20(Draft)%20for%20Public%20Validation%20%20%5B14-01-2025%5D.pdf">Kenya National AI Strategy 2025–2030</a> drafting process highlight the importance of inclusive policymaking, where key stakeholders — including telecommunications companies, multinationals, civil society, and academia — collaborate to shape AI strategies. For AI to serve diverse communities effectively, DPI must provide a robust foundation, enabling secure data access, interoperability, and shared infrastructure. Standardized governance processes are essential to guide AI innovation while safeguarding privacy, promoting ethical AI use, and ensuring that technological advancements deliver real public value without reinforcing structural exclusions.</p> Measuring impact <p>When evaluating the impact of DPI, the key question should be: Is it extractive, or does it genuinely benefit citizens? Measuring the impact of DPI should be viewed through the lens of the people it is intended to serve. Instead of measuring success based on outputs such as the number of IDs issued or accounts opened, the focus should shift to how DPI is transforming lives, expanding rights, and enabling citizens to achieve their aspirations and driving economic and social progress. To effectively measure DPI’s impact, several critical areas should be considered:</p><p>✅ Trust and governance — Strong data protection policies, public awareness, and transparent data control are key indicators of a DPI system that prioritizes citizen&nbsp;rights.</p><p>✅ Inclusion and accessibility — Are citizens able to connect and meaningfully engage with services? Metrics like broadband access and mobile penetration help assess whether DPI is reaching the people it intends to&nbsp;serve.</p><p>✅ Economic and social impact — DPI should fuel entrepreneurship and innovation. Measuring how many businesses have launched or scaled, who the businesses serve, and how these impact citizens due to integrated government data platforms can reveal DPI’s broader economic&nbsp;value.</p><p>For DPI measurement to be meaningful, stakeholders must develop a common terminology and shared understanding of impact metrics, much like how the mobile industry universally uses, for example, “average revenue per user.” The African context must guide the creation of relevant and people-centered metrics that truly reflect DPI’s success in empowering communities — for example, evaluating digital identity with metrics that are recognized across different regions and countries. It is important to define metrics that are impactful and relevant to the African context, ensuring that the metrics used reflect what impact really means to the&nbsp;people.</p> Conclusion <p>Building inclusive and effective DPI requires a multi-stakeholder approach that prioritizes public value, trust, and accessibility. Structural exclusion can be prevented by actively engaging civil society, the private sector, and marginalized communities, ensuring that digital systems serve diverse needs rather than reinforce inequalities. This goes hand in hand with measuring DPI’s success to determine impact, which should go beyond numbers to reflect real-life impact, from economic empowerment to expanded rights and opportunities. By fostering collaboration, transparency, and shared understanding of impact, DPI can drive meaningful digital transformation that benefits all citizens.</p><p>Authors:</p>  Emmanuel Khisa — Africa Director, Centre for Digital Public Infrastructure  Linet Kwamboka — Senior Manager–Data4Now, Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data  Diana Sang — Africa Director, Digital Impact&nbsp;Alliance  Charlene Migwe, Director of the Mastercard Foundation Learning Partnership, Caribou   <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/governing-digital-infrastructure-for-impact-key-lessons-and-future-directions-e9b32d87e2de">Governing Digital Public Infrastructure for Impact: Key Lessons and Future directions</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				 <p>By Helen Garneau</p>
<p>Does this sound familiar: You’re finally taking that long-awaited Caribbean holiday. Got your passport? Check. Better keep it handy, because you’ll need to show it eleven times before you hit the beach. Oh, and don’t forget your username and password to your work computer while you’re away on vacation—nothing like spending your first day back sitting on hold with IT trying to resent your password and trying to log back in.</p>
<p>Or this: You’re out to dinner with an old friend when an urgent text pops up — a high-value customer has locked themselves out and needs your help getting back in. Again. Then an email from legal pops up: data regulations changed (again), and there’s been yet another authentication factor added to your systems. Seriously, how is MFA still not enough?</p>
<p>Managing digital identity is a time-sucking, money-burning nightmare. Businesses pour billions into KYC and IDV, only to end up with more friction, more delays, and more CAPTCHA clicks.</p>
<p>There’s a better way. Stop wasting money—start making it.</p>
<p>Here are three ways your digital identity decisions are costing you big — and how Indicio Proven helps you flip the script.</p>
 1. You’re spending too much on identity verification (and it’s still a mess) 
<p>Let’s be real — making a purchase or opening a new account online can be a nightmare. Businesses spend millions every year on KYC checks, manually verifying documents, and waiting on IDV providers to confirm someone is who they say they are. Meanwhile, you are stuck jumping through hoops, uploading selfies, scanning IDs, and refreshing inboxes, hoping for that magical “You’re Verified” email.</p>
<p>Every minute a business waits is money lost. Cart abandonments, incomplete sign-ups, and frustrated users means money is wasted on a process that actively drives customers away.</p>
<p>How Indicio Proven fixes this:</p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven</a> transforms identity verification into a revenue-generating asset with <a href="https://indicio.tech/verifiable-credentials-2/">verifiable credentials</a> and <a href="https://indicio.tech/what-is-decentralized-identity/">decentralized identity</a>. With Verifiable Credentials, you can verify your identity once and reuse that verification anywhere. Instead of waiting days for KYC approval, just present a digital credential that proves your identity information — instantly. No need to fill out more paperwork, do repeated checks, or pay extra fees to IDV providers. More importantly, no more lost customers due to frustration.</p>
<p>It’s like getting an express pass at an amusement park — straight to the fun (or in your case, straight to becoming a paying customer).</p>
 2. You’re paying for compliance over and over again 
<p>Compliance isn’t optional. <a href="https://indicio.tech/get-ready-for-eidas-2-0-with-openid/">Regulations like eIDAS</a> 2.0, GDPR, CCPA, and various financial compliance laws mean businesses have to verify identities, minimize personal data storage and purpose and maximize security, and try to meet some level of industry standards. And that costs money — a lot of money.</p>
<p>The problem? Every time you need to verify identity at a different touchpoint, the business essentially pays for compliance all over again. Whether it’s opening an account, making a large transaction, or accessing a new service, the same process is repeated over and over.</p>
<p>How Indicio Proven fixes this:</p>
<p>With decentralized identity and verifiable credentials, compliance becomes portable. Instead of verifying your identity from scratch every time, you rely on credentials derived from information that has already been issued and verified.</p>
<p>You control your data, meaning you don’t have to hand over your personal data anymore for another business to store and secure in order to authenticate who you are the next time you visit. This reduces your risk (of a data breach) and the cost of data compliance and security to the business.</p>
<p>Think of it like a digital passport: Once issued, it works everywhere; but unlike a paper booklet, you can send a verifiable digital passport electronically, anywhere.</p>
 3. You’re missing out on the opportunity to make money from identity 
<p>Here’s the kicker for businesses: Identity verification isn’t just a cost—it can be a revenue stream.</p>
<p>Right now, companies spend billions verifying identities but don’t make a dime off that effort. Once you verify a customer, the process ends, and you’re left with nothing but an invoice at the end of the month from the IDV you happen to be using at the moment.</p>
<p>But what if you could turn identity verification into a business model and free yourself from expensive IDV bills? What if, after you go through the effort of verifying someone, you could issue a credential that they can use elsewhere—and YOU get paid for it?</p>
<p>How Indicio Proven fixes this:</p>
<p>With Indicio Proven, you don’t just verify users—you issue Verifiable Credentials that other businesses can trust. That means you can build trust networks, where other companies rely on your verified credentials instead of doing their own KYC from scratch. And guess what? They’ll pay you for it.</p>
<p>Think of it as TSA PreCheck. You’ve already proven you’re a trusted traveler, so you don’t have to go through security every time. Now imagine if TSA got paid every time another airline used that verification. That’s the model businesses can tap into with Verifiable Credentials.</p>
 The bottom line: Stop losing money and start making it 
<p>Picture this: instead of spending time proving you’re a human and jumping through endless verification hoops, you get your information verified once and can use that credential everywhere.</p>
<p>Instead of pouring your budget into more layers of software in hopes you’ll meet some magic threshold of compliance for managing customer data, you have a secure, privacy-preserving system that does the heavy lifting for you.</p>
<p>Instead of identity being a burden, it becomes a business advantage.</p>
<p>This isn’t some distant future — it’s possible right now. The companies that are embracing verifiable credentials today are the ones that will be leading the industry tomorrow.</p>
<p>So, are you ready to stop wasting money and start making identity work for you? The future of digital identity isn’t just about compliance—it’s about opportunity.</p>
<p>And with Indicio Proven, you can finally seize it!</p>

            <p>In 2025, Thales ranks among the top 0.01% of the most innovative companies and institutions worldwide, out of more than one million organisations, according to the Clarivate Top 100 Global Innovators™. This year, 22 European companies and institutions, including 7 in France, feature in this globally recognised innovation ranking. Clarivate assesses not only the quantity but also the quality of patents filed. Thales is the French company with the longest consecutive presence in this Top 100.</p>
<p>Thales holds over 21,000 patents and patent applications, protecting around 400 new inventions each year, half of which relate to key technological fields such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, cloud technologies, and quantum technology. In AI, Thales is the leading European patent applicant for critical systems, with over 40 new inventions each year protected by a patent or patent application, and a portfolio of 300 inventions. In quantum technology, Thales is also the leading European patent applicant in its ecosystem, both in the fields of quantum sensing and quantum communication*, with a portfolio of over 70 protected inventions.</p>
<blockquote><p>"This 12th recognition primarily rewards our 4,000 inventors, each of whom has at least one patent to their name. It is also a testament to Thales’s ambitious innovation strategy, built on collaboration and anticipation of technological breakthroughs. In a world where the pace of change is accelerating, the company continues to invest in strengthening its unique technological leadership,” said Patrice Caine, Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thales’s strong commitment to innovation provides a key differentiator for its products and solutions. It is also a major driver of attractiveness for the company, which is accelerating its transformation into a full learning company. A total of 3,000 researchers and 30,000 engineers are involved in Research &amp; Development, with €4.2 billion invested annually in R&amp;D, including over €1 billion in self-funded research. By 2028, Thales plans to invest €5 billion annually in its R&amp;D activities.</p>

			<p>The collaboration brings seamless, scalable tokenization infrastructure to private markets, eliminating technical barriers and accelerating adoption.</p>
<p>Luxembourg, 12 March 2025 – <a href="https://www.yooro.io/">Yooro</a>, the pioneering securitization-as-a-service platform, has partnered with <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, the leading onchain finance operating system, to transform the accessibility and efficiency of private market investments. By integrating Tokeny’s enterprise-grade tokenization technology, Yooro can seamlessly issue, manage, and distribute tokenized securities, unlocking new levels of liquidity and accessibility in private markets.</p>
<p>Through this partnership, Yooro leverages Tokeny’s white-label platform to enable frictionless tokenization, much like Shopify allows businesses to launch online stores without technical complexity. The collaboration eliminates the technical barriers historically associated with digital assets, allowing professional investors across the EU, UK, Switzerland, and the UAE to access private market opportunities with unprecedented ease.</p>
<p>Simplifying Private Markets Through Tokenization</p>
<p>Traditional private markets remain complex, slow, and highly fragmented, relying on intermediaries to facilitate transactions between investors. Tokenization fundamentally changes this paradigm by allowing assets to move freely while maintaining compliance through programmable rules. By building compliance directly into the digital assets via the ERC-3643 standard, Yooro ensures security and regulatory adherence, while giving investors full control over their holdings.</p>

		 
	 
    At Yooro, our mission is to simplify private market securitization and make high-value opportunities accessible. Partnering with Tokeny allows us to remove technical barriers and provide our investors with a seamless, compliant, and scalable tokenization solution. This is a crucial step towards building a truly borderless and efficient private market ecosystem.  Milo GuastamacchiaCEO &amp; Founder of Yooro       Mass adoption happens when technology complexity disappears. With this partnership, we’re making tokenization as simple as possible for Yooro and its investors. By leveraging the ERC-3643 standard through our tools, Yooro’s tokenized assets will be natively interoperable across the RWA and DeFi ecosystems, ensuring a future-proof and seamlessly connected financial infrastructure.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny    
	 
		 
			<p>A Scalable and Compliant Infrastructure</p>
<p>With Tokeny’s technology, Yooro gains access to an institutional-grade tokenization platform that integrates essential services across issuance, servicing, and distribution. The platform is designed to eliminate silos, ensuring assets are natively interoperable with the broader financial ecosystem. Key benefits of the partnership include:</p>
 
 Frictionless Tokenization: A no-code, white-label solution enabling Yooro to issue and manage digital securities effortlessly. 
 Embedded Compliance: Digital assets remain fully compliant with regulations, ensuring only approved investors can hold them. 
 Greater Liquidity and Accessibility: Tokenized assets can be traded peer-to-peer among qualified investors, unlocking liquidity in previously illiquid markets. 
 Composability: Yooro’s tokenization infrastructure can easily interact with other ERC-3643-compatible applications to add new features. 
 
<p>Transforming the Future of Private Market Investments</p>
<p>Private markets have historically lagged behind in modernization, but the Yooro-Tokeny partnership marks a significant step forward in democratizing access to these investments. By leveraging Tokeny’s battle-tested technology—which has facilitated over 3 billion onchain operations over 7 years—Yooro is poised to scale private market securitization like never before.</p>
<p>This collaboration underscores a shared vision to reshape private market investments, removing inefficiencies and bringing them into a fully digital, interoperable, and compliant future.</p>

<p>When customers apply for insurance, they’re trusting your company with sensitive information. A seamless KYC process strengthens that trust, while a slow, clunky process can drive them away. Insurance companies must balance robust fraud prevention with efficient onboarding to comply with regulations and keep customers satisfied. iComply’s all-in-one solution streamlines every step of the KYC process, eliminating manual work and reducing compliance risks.</p>



 The Importance of KYC in Insurance 



<p>KYC processes are critical to verifying identities, assessing risk, and detecting fraud. However, many insurers still rely on disjointed systems that create delays, increase costs, and leave room for error. A modern approach makes KYC faster, more secure, and customer-friendly.</p>



 How iComply Enhances the KYC Process for Insurers 



 1. Streamlined Identity Verification 



<p>iComply automates ID checks with secure document uploads and biometric verification, confirming authenticity in seconds. No more back-and-forth emails or manual approvals.</p>

<p>Governments often face challenges in fully delivering on their commitments to enhancing both freedom and safety for their residents, as balancing the two can be very complex. <a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2025/bills/static/SB0260.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Utah’s new State Bill 260</a> introduces principles for a state-endorsed digital identity that puts Utahns in control of their identities and includes a suite of guaranteed freedoms and protections to increase user choice, prevent surveillance, and respect privacy.</p><p>The Lehi, Utah-based civil libertarian Libertas Institute<a href="https://libertas.institute/bill/sb-260-updating-ids-in-the-digital-age?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> describes the bill</a> as “an ambitious policy prescription of privacy protection, individual autonomy protection, and anonymity.” This bill comes at an important time to combat the rise of <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/ai-is-the-final-blow-for-an-id-system-whose-time-has-passed/">AI-enabled fraud</a>, address violations of <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-ken-paxton-secures-14-billion-settlement-meta-over-its-unauthorized-capture?ref=blog.spruceid.com">privacy practices</a>, and growth in the <a href="https://www.mdlconnection.com/implementation-tracker-map/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">adoption of digital IDs</a> in the US. New technologies such as <a href="https://spruceid.com/reports-and-whitepapers/an-introduction-to-verifiable-digital-credentials?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Verifiable Digital Credentials</a> (VDCs) would now make the bill implementable. Most importantly, it offers an opportunity for major advances in autonomy, privacy, and security of individuals in the digital world, creating a bulwark for the next era of <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/why-advancing-digital-identity-is-critical-to-u-s-national-security/">U.S. cybersecurity</a> and cyberfreedoms.</p><p>Technology's privacy strengths can only reach their full potential if legislation supports and protects them. Utah SB260 strongly supports this goal by banning surveillance, enforcing selective disclosure, keeping digital identity fully optional, and notably preventing government officials from demanding “device handover.” These elements of SB260 can create a strong baseline for digital ID within Utah and even for other states.</p> The State Does Not Establish an Individual's Identity <p>Clearly stated in § 63A-16-1202(1)(b)/(c), “the state does not establish an individual’s identity” and “the state may, in certain circumstances, recognize and endorse an individual's identity.”</p><p>This is fundamentally different from programs where a government authority defines someone’s ability to be recognized and exist. Instead, it recognizes that human beings already exist in their own right and that the state’s role is to provide assistance to humans, so they can be recognized and have the ability to manage the state endorsement in the ways prescribed by the code.</p> Prohibiting Digital Surveillance and Data-sharing <p>The code further requires that when a state-endorsed digital identity is presented, any data from the interaction is only used for the reason intended by the document’s owner. The validator accepting the document, whether a bartender, law enforcement officer or TSA agent, can’t share data about the contents of an ID or the time or context in which it was presented for validation. That includes prohibiting data-sharing with private companies that might want to use it for marketing or other purposes.</p><p>The provision also prohibits “surveillance, visibility, tracking, or monitoring” by any government agency or other person who accepts a digital ID. This is important because, while the digital signatures that validate digital credentials can be confirmed “locally” by some validators–that is, without sending a message to a central server–some validators will need to query a server or database, which if not implemented with the proper safeguards can create <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/the-importance-of-protecting-digital-id-users-from-phone-home-surveillance/">“phone home”</a> surveillance. The anti-surveillance provision of SB260 bans using those queries as a source of surveillance data.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, the bill’s broader privacy demands incentivize the building of ID systems with anti-surveillance mechanisms, such as<a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/the-importance-of-protecting-digital-id-users-from-phone-home-surveillance/"> private information retrieval</a>.</p> Selective Disclosure Protects Sensitive Personal Information <p>SB260 enshrines selective disclosure as a principle of privacy protection. Selective disclosure is a unique advantage of digital identity documents. A physical ID means handing over every bit of information to a validator, even irrelevant and risky data like your address. However, when a digital ID is presented, the user can select exactly what information they wish to share.</p><p>For example, SB260 specifies that a digital ID user must be able to “verify that the individual's age satisfies an age requirement without revealing the individual's age or date of birth.” This is particularly important because a birth date is so-called “personal identifying information,” or PII, that can be leveraged for cyberattacks. Keeping it and other sensitive information private when it’s not truly necessary to share helps keep users safe and in control.</p> No Forced Device Handover <p>Utah’s proposed bill also ensures that “a governmental entity or a person may not require an individual to surrender the individual's mobile communication device to verify the individual's identity.” That is, a user has the right to keep their phone when they are presenting a digital ID for scanning.</p><p>This is particularly important when it comes to law enforcement because privacy laws defining police access to phone data are still<a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/24/21133600/police-fbi-phone-search-protests-password-rights?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> an ambiguous patchwork</a>. Depending on many factors, it may be legal for a police officer in physical possession of a phone to access data the user didn’t intend to share, creating major privacy and security risks. This provision makes clear that Utahns have the right to refuse any such request from a police officer or any other government official.</p> Digital Identity is Optional <p>A final key provision of SB260 is that digital identity tools will remain entirely optional–no government entity can require a digital ID to provide benefits or provide any “material benefit” as an incentive for the use of a digital ID. This is important for accessibility and equity reasons since many residents may face challenges transitioning to new technologies, and others may simply choose not to use a smartphone.</p><p>However, overall public trust is also at stake here: nothing is more likely to make Americans suspicious of a digital tool than being forced to use it by the government. By keeping digital ID optional, while enforcing the core benefits that make it appealing to users, SB260 creates the best possible conditions for trust and adoption of a tool that will benefit users most of all.</p> A Defining Moment for User-Controlled Digital IDs <p>Digital IDs are here to stay. The rapid growth of digital ID programs in New York, California, and <a href="https://www.mdlconnection.com/implementation-tracker-map/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">11 other US states</a> is not slowing down, and as digital IDs can be used over the internet, it will unlock a myriad of new use cases and mass adoption. That’s why it’s so critical that legislation and technology work together to convey a user-first approach at this moment. We believe that SB260 has the right stock for this, and many of its elements could be adopted in other states and even countries.</p><p></p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

									  Summer Trenches Beat Winter Ones   <p>The crypto influencer event at the White House was a nothing burger, the strategic digital asset reserve is over-hyped, and markets are lingering at relative lows.&nbsp;In other words, it may be warming up outside, but it’s starting to feel a lot like crypto winter in here.</p>  <p><a href="https://goldbroker.com/news/united-states-huge-debt-refinancing-remains-2025-biggest-challenge-3483?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hodl-on-tight#:~:text=By%202025,%20the%20US%20Treasury,deficit,%20already%20at%20critical%20levels.">Sometime this year</a>, the U.S. Treasury will likely refinance the country’s debt. With trade wars raging and the equities market looking too hot to touch (not to mention overweighted by a handful of companies whose entire value is based off of things junior product managers can vibe-code into existence over a weekend and give away for free) the markets are wrecked.</p>  <p>According to some&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/roger_cerqua/status/1899329005360152704?s=46&amp;t=oUwPNRaxuquKUazpKDAqNw&amp;utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hodl-on-tight">fringe theorists</a>&nbsp;on X, that could be a good thing for taxpayers in the form of the interest that’s paid on the government’s debt. Illuminati master plan aside, it does stand to reason that a weakened equities market means a stronger bonds market, and also usually means that the Treasury can refinance at better rates. So there’s no reason for Trump to change up his strategy for the moment, especially while it’s playing lip service to the crypto supporters and fed haters.</p>  <p>What does it mean for the rest of us?&nbsp;</p>  <p>Well, I’m no financial expert, but I’d buckle up for a fair amount of volatility until the end of September and beginning of October. There’s may still be money in day-trading or swing-trading, but I’m a degen, not a gambler. Personally, I’ll just keep on diamond-handing, and scooping up Solana&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SOL.X?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hodl-on-tight">SOL.X ( ▼ 1.4% )</a>&nbsp;at discount bargains.&nbsp;</p>  <p>In my eyes, the ecosystem is still taking meaningful steps forward at a sustainable pace. Jump Crypto just released a new validator client for Solana,&nbsp;<a href="https://jumpcrypto.com/writing/firedancer/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hodl-on-tight">Firedancer</a>. And although adoption currently sits at less than 2%, the demonstrated increased throughput means a higher yield TPS on the network. In short, Solana is only getting faster. And this could reasonably increase to 10% by this summer; many validator clients are run by large projects that will likely make their own competitive upgrades.</p>  <p>Elsewhere, communities are applying tried and tested use cases to Bitcoin and other tokens as an alternative payment processing and collection system for their businesses. Some friends of ours stayed at a BitcoinBNB over their trip to SXSW this year. Mass adoption in action.</p>  <p>What I’m trying to say is, the house only wins if you sell. Don’t play with leverage, accumulate daily or weekly, and expect to keep going sideways for at least the next 6 months. Hodl on.</p>  <p>—El Prof</p>

									         The Missing $LINKS   <p>There’s a lot of pressure in today’s market. Oh, yeah. Lotta pressure. But you gotta rise above it. And what better way to relieve the pressure than by hitting a ball with a big stick?</p>  <p>In one of the most practical endorsements of the diamond hand strategy I’ve seen in my years covering crypto, LinksDAO — which we&nbsp;<a href="https://playhaus.tv/culture-h0r/pro-viral/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hodl-on-tight">first covered</a>&nbsp;more than two years ago in the spiritual predecessor to this newsletter — has emerged from the sand trap to provide holders some long-awaited utility.</p>  <p>The decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) first came together in 2021 to “democratize the country club membership experience”. In the years since, it has purchased just two clubs — one in Scotland, and now, one in our backyard.</p>  <p>LinksDAO just bought up the shuttered Hillcrest Country Club, situated in our heartland home base, Kansas City, MO. It won’t open for another year at least, but it admittedly marks a big step toward the DAO’s theoretical leisure ecosystem, a network of courses and clubs run on its token&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/LINKS.NFT?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hodl-on-tight">LINKS.NFT ( 0.0% )</a>.</p>  <p>Now, as with most DAOs, its vision isn’t exactly the most straightforward or accessible crypto use case. The organization blew up at the same time as other blue-chip relics of the NFT era. (Evinced by its partnerships with the likes of Bored Ape Yacht Club, Doodles, and Pudgy Penguins.) And while it still sells NFTs, they don’t quite function as the all-access pass once-promised. Its&nbsp;<a href="https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ETH.X?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=hodl-on-tight">ETH.X ( ▼ 0.88% )</a>&nbsp;based passes run somewhere from $200 to $700 and merely provide a discount to a full membership, which can still run upwards of $10,000.</p>  <p>So long-term hodlers may not have lucked into becoming full-blown trust fund bunnies, but hey. It’s cool to see a major DeFi player try to follow through on a promise. With golf’s growing popularity, particularly among younger, more tech-savvy generations, the time is ripe for a change in how the sport is experienced and enjoyed. Through the power of blockchain, LinksDAO offers its members more than just a place to play — it allows them to help shape and expand the future of the sport, and maybe, just maybe, make it a modicum more accessible.<br><br>Anyway, if you’re wondering if we bought a LinksDAO NFT, yes, of course we did. Who wouldn’t want to own a piece of the future, even if it’s a deeply silly one.</p>  <p>—Muhammed</p>

				 <p>SEATTLE: March 11, 2025: <a href="https://www.digital-knowledge.org/">Digital Knowledge,</a> a pioneer in e-learning over the past three decades, is partnering with Indicio to improve the use of verifiable digital credentials for educational achievements. The Japanese company will use <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven</a> to add a digital wallet to its Skill+ platform, allowing individuals and organizations to collect Open Badges from multiple platforms and simplify their use and verification.</p>
<p>By incorporating Indicio Proven, Digital Knowledge will be able to offer its customers <a href="https://indicio.tech/open-badges/">Open Badges 3.0,</a> the field-leading digital credential format for educational credentials, grades, certificates, diplomas, and attestations of skills.</p>
<p>Open Badges 3.0 allows people to directly store digital proofs of their achievements locally on their mobile devices and share them directly with employers and institutions&nbsp; in a way that can be independently verified. This significantly enhances their usability, as the holder of an Open Badge isn’t depending on a third party for hosting and verification, and an employer or school can instantly authenticate the information in the Open Badge.</p>
<p>With the Indicio Proven <a href="https://indicio.tech/mobile-software-development-kit/">digital wallet,</a> all of these credentials are easily managed in a secure, privacy preserving way, making it easier for people to share skills and achievements across various platforms.</p>
<p>“The expansion in e-learning, especially around micro-credentials, needs an expanded, efficient, and simple way for people to hold and share these qualifications, and this is what we are providing in partnership with Digital Knowledge,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “Open Badges 3.0 brings significant advantages in usability, security, and privacy. People now have a fast, convenient, and secure way to hold and share their achievements as they progress through their schooling and careers. No need to wait for a university to dig out a paper copy of a diploma or transcript. Issue an Open Badge once, share as often as you want from your phone, verify anywhere in seconds.”</p>

<p>From <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/01/13/understanding-nhis-key-differences-between-human-and-non-human-identities/">NHI</a> to AI to Shared Signals, even in CIAM it comes back to standards versus reality.</p>



<p>Identity standards paint a perfect future: passwordless logins, verifiable credentials, and seamless trust. I love that picture; I want to frame it. Alas, legacy IAM, tight budgets, and a business case that still boils down to ‘but will customers complain?’ prevent us from getting there from here. </p>



<p>Nowhere is this tension more visible than in Consumer Identity and Access Management (CIAM). The security vs. usability tradeoff has always been a knife fight, and now we’re throwing in regulatory compliance, the rising costs of fraud, and the ever-present specter of “but our customers will complain.” So, let’s talk about what standards assume, where reality kicks in, and how organizations can actually make progress.</p>



 The Issue: Standards Define a Destination, But Legacy Systems Control the Journey 



<p>Standards bodies like NIST, ISO, and ETSI (under eIDAS2) have done their job: They’ve painted a picture of where we should be. The problem is that standards assume a level of infrastructure readiness that simply doesn’t exist in many organizations.</p>



<p>From a security perspective: Passwords are an outdated, high-risk authentication method. We should be moving toward passwordless logins, strong authentication, and identity federation. But if you’re running a legacy IAM system that predates modern best practices, you’re not just flipping a switch to make that happen.</p>



<p>From a business perspective: The cost of migration is non-trivial. Budgets are tight, and while security teams may want to modernize, getting executive buy-in requires proving a return on investment. “It’s more secure” is not a compelling business case, especially when ripping out legacy authentication systems means overhauling customer login experiences.</p>



<p>From a user perspective: Legacy authentication methods, for all their flaws, are familiar. Customers know how to enter a password (even if it’s “password123”). Introducing new login methods, such as passkeys, decentralized identity wallets, and multi-factor authentication, can introduce friction, and friction equals drop-off.</p>



 



<p>Standards define where we want to go—but legacy systems decide how fast we can get there. If your team is working through what’s actually feasible—or trying to stay ahead of standards while managing existing infrastructure—I can help you make sense of the trade-offs.  <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/services/">See how I work</a> or <a>Let’s talk</a>.</p>



 



 The Challenge in CIAM: Modernization Without Losing Customers 



<p>CIAM isn’t just a backend challenge, it’s a user experience challenge. Security teams might dream of a world where everyone uses phishing-resistant authentication, but if that world means adding too much friction, users will revolt.</p>



<p>Consider some of the “solutions” proposed:</p>



 
 Passwordless authentication: Great in theory, but if customers aren’t ready for passkeys, you’re not solving a problem—you’re creating one. 



 Decentralized identity: It might be the future, but consumers don’t want to manage DID documents or cryptographic keys. 



 Verifiable credentials: Wonderful for privacy and security, but adoption is painfully slow outside of niche use cases. 
 



<p>Users hate complexity, and CIAM modernization efforts must balance security with the absolute necessity of seamless customer experience.</p>



 Standards vs. Reality: What Do They Assume? 



Standards BodyFocus AreaRegulatory BackingWhat It AssumesReality CheckNIST (SP 800-63, etc.)Digital identity guidelines, authentication assuranceU.S. federal agencies must follow; widely referenced globallyOrganizations can implement strong authentication (MFA, passkeys, federation)Many consumer apps still struggle with basic 2FA adoptionISO/IEC (24760, 29115, etc.)Identity management, authentication assurance frameworksTreaty-based; adopted by national governments and industryStandardized identity assurance will improve security across sectorsAdoption varies; private sector uptake is slow outside compliance-driven industriesETSI (EN 319 411, etc.)Trust services, digital identity regulations (especially in the EU)Required for EU digital identity initiatives like eIDASInteroperability between EU countries will streamline identity verificationEach country implements differently, causing fragmentation and complexityW3C (Verifiable Credentials, DID Core, etc.)Decentralized identity, privacy-enhancing authenticationNo regulatory backing; industry-drivenA privacy-first, user-controlled identity future is achievableAdoption is niche and fragmented; industry buy-in is inconsistentIETF (SD-JWT, OAuth, etc.)Selective disclosure, token-based authenticationNo regulatory requirement but widely adopted in industryPrivacy-preserving JWTs will improve data minimization without breaking compatibilityAdoption is early-stage; requires infrastructure most orgs don’t yet have



 How Do We Bridge the Gap? Migration Strategies for Legacy Systems 



<p>It’s easy to say “just modernize,” but for organizations dealing with decades of <a href="https://enterprisersproject.com/article/2020/6/technical-debt-explained-plain-english">technical debt</a>, it’s not so simple. Here’s what is more likely to work:</p>



 Instead of a risky rip-and-replace, introduce new authentication methods alongside legacy systems: 



 
 Enable passkeys as an optional login method first, rather than forcing a switch overnight. 



 Allow progressive adoption of MFA, requiring it only for high-risk activities before making it universal. 



 Deploy verifiable credentials in controlled, low-risk scenarios, such as employee logins, before scaling to customers. 
 



 Hybrid IAM: Layer Modern Authentication on Top of Legacy Systems 



<p>Most organizations can’t replace their IAM stack overnight, so extend it instead:</p>



 
 Use federation (OIDC, SAML) to bridge old and new identity providers, enabling secure single sign-on (SSO). 



 Introduce adaptive authentication that steps up security dynamically, rather than disrupting all users at once. 



 Leverage external identity providers (e.g., social login, IDPs) where appropriate to offload identity management. 
 



 Use Regulatory Compliance as a Modernization Lever 



<p>Regulations often force organizations to upgrade security; use them to drive investment:</p>



 
 Prioritize upgrades that align with eIDAS2, NIST, or ISO mandates to future-proof your IAM. 



 If budgets are tight, look for grants or incentives that support compliance-driven security improvements. 



 Advocate for clearer timelines on deprecating outdated authentication methods so you can plan ahead. 
 



 Design for Customers, Not Just Security 



<p>Users resist change—modernization efforts need to be seamless, not disruptive:</p>



 
 Reduce friction by keeping familiar login options (passwords) available while transitioning to stronger authentication. 



 Offer clear, user-friendly messaging explaining why new login options improve security without making things harder. 



 Give users control over delegation (e.g., letting caregivers access accounts securely rather than sharing passwords). 
 



 Final Thoughts: Standards Are Great for Tomorrow, But Reality Wins Today 



<p>Standards define the future. But businesses don’t live in the future—they live in budget cycles, tech debt, and customer expectations. Modernizing CIAM isn’t about ‘just implementing passwordless’—it’s about navigating the messy in-between. The real challenge? Making progress without breaking what still (sort of) works.</p>



<p>So, next time someone says, “just implement passwordless authentication,” remind them: standards define where we want to go, but legacy systems dictate how fast we can get there.</p>

<p>As the adoption of blockchain technology among financial services grows, so does the regulatory scrutiny around digital asset transactions. One of the most pressing regulatory frameworks that Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) must comply with is the FATF Travel Rule, a.k.a. the “Crypto Travel Rule”, which mandates the collection and exchange of originator and beneficiary information for transactions above a certain threshold. While compliance is already a challenge for Layer 1 blockchains, the rise of Layer 2 solutions, such as the Lightning Network, presents new complexities that demand innovative compliance solutions.</p>
<p>This article explores the challenges of Travel Rule compliance on Layer 2 solutions, the risks associated with non-compliance, and how iComply enables VASPs to meet regulatory requirements without compromising on efficiency or privacy.</p>
 Understanding the “Crypto Travel Rule” and Its Challenges on Layer 2 
<p>The FATF Travel Rule, first introduced in 2019, requires VASPs (such as exchanges, custodians, and payment providers) to share sender and recipient information when handling virtual asset transfers above a regulatory threshold (typically $1,000 USD or equivalent – or more recently $200 USD for businesses operating within certain ZIP codes along the southern border of the US).</p>
<p>For Layer 1 blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, this is already a challenge, as transactions are pseudonymous, requiring VASPs to implement KYC/KYB measures to track user activity. However, the problem becomes even more complex on Layer 2 networks, where transactions occur off-chain and are often structured to maximize privacy and efficiency.</p>
 Key Challenges of Travel Rule Compliance on Layer 2 Solutions 
 
 Onion-Routed Transactions – Networks like the Lightning Network use multi-hop, onion-routed payments, where transactions pass through multiple intermediary nodes, making it difficult to determine the true origin and destination. 
 Off-Chain Nature – Unlike Layer 1 transactions that are recorded on a public ledger, Layer 2 transactions are ephemeral and only settle on-chain periodically, making transaction tracing more complex. 
 No Centralized Counterparty – Many Lightning Network transactions occur directly between peers without an exchange or custodian involved, leading to a lack of intermediaries who would traditionally enforce Travel Rule compliance. 
 Regulatory Uncertainty – Governments and regulatory bodies are still grappling with how to apply AML laws to Layer 2 solutions, leaving VASPs uncertain about how to proceed. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Sunrise Problem: A Barrier to Travel Rule Compliance 
<p>One of the biggest compliance hurdles for VASPs is the “Sunrise Problem.” This occurs when some jurisdictions enforce the Travel Rule while others do not, creating gaps in regulatory coverage and making it difficult for VASPs to exchange compliance information across different regions.</p>
<p>For Layer 2 solutions, the Sunrise Problem is even more pronounced because:</p>
 
 VASPs may operate in jurisdictions where compliance obligations differ. 
 Layer 2 transactions can involve multiple jurisdictions in a single transaction, increasing complexity. 
 Lack of standardized compliance protocols across different VASPs and Layer 2 nodes leads to operational challenges. 
 
<p>Without a global, interoperable solution, VASPs risk falling into non-compliance or limiting their services to regions with clear Travel Rule mandates, reducing market opportunities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How iComply Helps VASPs Achieve Layer 2 Travel Rule Compliance 
<p>As a leader in holistic KYB, KYC, and AML compliance software, iComply provides the tools necessary for VASPs to comply with Travel Rule regulations—even on Layer 2 networks.</p>
 1. Identity Verification for Lightning Network Users 
 
 iComply enables pre-transaction verification, ensuring that users interacting with regulated Lightning nodes or VASPs offering Layer 2 services undergo proper KYC/KYB checks. 
 This solution is particularly useful for businesses and financial institutions integrating Lightning payments while needing regulatory approval. 
 
 2. Off-Chain Transaction Monitoring &amp; Risk-Based Analytics 
 
 Since Lightning transactions settle on-chain eventually, iComply’s patented and proprietary blockchain transaction monitoring solutions can be utilized to track:
 
 Channel funding transactions (when users open a payment channel). 
 Final settlement transactions (when channels are closed and funds return to the blockchain). 
 
 
 Pattern analysis and AI-driven risk scoring detect suspicious behaviour in Layer 2 payment activity. 
 
 3. Compliance-Enabled Lightning Nodes for VASPs 
 
 VASPs operating Lightning nodes can integrate iComply’s solutions to:
 
 Require KYC/KYB for users (originators) opening channels. 
 Enable the collection and verification of KYC/KYB for beneficiaries in real time with the transaction. 
 Implement Travel Rule-compliant information exchange between regulated entities (i.e. VASPs – Virtual Asset Service Providers).. 
 Use privacy-preserving edge computing to detect illicit activities without revealing sensitive customer data to bad actors or on-chain surveillance companies. 
 
 
 
 4. Edge Computing &amp; Privacy-Preserving Compliance 
 
 iComply’s edge computing technology ensures that all sensitive user data is capture, authenticate, validated, verified, and encrypted before it leaves the user’s device, preventing unauthorized access, on-chain surveillance,&nbsp;or third-party data exposure. 
 Decentralized compliance attestations and privacy centric digital identity solutions&nbsp;allow users to prove they are verified without revealing personal information. 
 
 5. Interoperability to Solve the Sunrise Problem 
 
 iComply supports multi-jurisdictional compliance frameworks, allowing VASPs to exchange Travel Rule data across different regulatory environments. 
 iComply’s patented technology allows multiple and diverse compliance frameworks to be applied to the same transaction, such as when the originator and beneficiary reside in or are subject to regulatory thresholds from different jurisdictions. 
 By integrating global AML compliance standards, iComply ensures that Layer 2 transactions meet regulatory expectations, regardless of where the parties are located. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Travel Rule Compliance for Layer 2 VASPs is Possible with iComply 
<p>Layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network offer incredible benefits for scalability, speed, and cost-effectiveness, but their design introduces serious compliance challenges for VASPs. The FATF Travel Rule, combined with the Sunrise Problem, creates barriers to global compliance—but iComply is uniquely positioned to help VASPs navigate these challenges.</p>
<p>With identity verification, AI-driven transaction monitoring, compliance-ready Lightning nodes, privacy-preserving solutions, and global interoperability, iComply enables VASPs to embrace Layer 2 networks while staying Travel Rule-compliant.</p>
<p>By adopting iComply’s holistic compliance framework, VASPs can confidently integrate Lightning Network payments and other Layer 2 solutions without regulatory roadblocks.</p>
 Next Steps 
<p>If you’re a VASP looking to integrate Layer 2 solutions while maintaining Travel Rule compliance, reach out to iComply today.</p>

<p>For years, proving your age online has long been a frustrating process. Users upload a government-issued ID, wait for approval, and hope the system—or a human reviewer—doesn’t flag it for further checks. Not only is this slow and intrusive, but it’s also easy to bypass with borrowed or fake documents.</p>



<p>AI is changing that. Instead of relying on easily manipulated paperwork, today’s online identity verification systems use biometric and behavioral data to confirm whether someone is old enough to access age-restricted content. AI makes verification faster, smarter, and more secure while reducing friction for legitimate users.</p>



<p>But AI isn’t a silver bullet. While it slows deepfakes, synthetic identities, and document fraud, businesses need to balance privacy concerns, algorithmic bias, and evolving regulations. The challenge isn’t just making age assurance more effective—it’s ensuring it remains fair, secure, and privacy-conscious.</p>



<p>So, how exactly is AI reshaping the landscape? And what should companies consider when adopting these technologies?</p>



 







 



 What Is Age Assurance? 



<p>At its core, <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/673341bb0c1051e76221fba8">age assurance</a> is about determining whether a user meets the minimum age for certain content, services, or products. It’s critical for protecting minors, preventing fraud, and staying compliant with laws like <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/childrens-online-privacy-protection-rule-coppa">COPPA (U.S.)</a>, <a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/childrens-information/childrens-code-guidance-and-resources/age-appropriate-design-a-code-of-practice-for-online-services/">AADC (EU)</a>, and the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50">Online Safety Act (UK)</a>.</p>



<p>There are two main approaches:</p>



 
 <a href="https://liminal.co/reports/ink-index-for-age-verification-2025/">Age verification</a> confirms a user’s exact age using government-issued IDs, credit card records, or mobile carrier data. 



 <a href="https://liminal.co/reports/link-index-for-age-estimation-2025/">Age estimation</a> uses AI-driven biometric and behavioral analysis to predict a user’s likely age without requiring official documentation. 
 



 



<a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/673341bb0c1051e76221fba8"></a><a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/673341bb0c1051e76221fba8">From Liminal’s Market &amp; Buyer’s Guide for Age Assurance, Page 16</a>



 



<p>AI-driven models are not just replacing traditional document checks; they are enabling real-time, adaptive verification, reducing friction while increasing security and fraud resistance.</p>



 



 Traditional Methods vs. AI-Powered Solutions 



<p>Manual ID checks were once the go-to method for age verification. Users uploaded a government-issued ID or other documents, which were then cross-checked against ID manuals and data sets. Over time, automation was introduced to streamline parts of this process, but fundamental issues remained:</p>



<p>This process came with serious flaws:</p>



 
 Slow &amp; Frustrating → Lengthy processing times frustrate users. 



 Privacy Risks → Storing IDs increases exposure to fraud. 



 Easy to Cheat → Minors can use borrowed or fake documents. 



 Not Scalable → Manual reviews can’t handle millions of users efficiently. 
 



<p>AI-powered solutions remove these pain points. Instead of relying on easily manipulated documents, AI uses facial recognition, behavioral signals, and liveness detection to verify users in real time—without storing excessive personal data.</p>



 



 The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Age Assurance 



<p>Instead of just checking a document, AI-powered age assurance takes a more dynamic approach by analyzing a person’s unique traits. <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/6548ff02f648f1f9e7a3ab3f">Facial recognition technology</a> can estimate whether a user is underage without storing personal details, making the process both efficient and privacy-conscious. At the same time,<a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/65ea250d296006bc61b9b431"> behavioral analytics</a> monitor how users interact with a platform, flagging patterns that suggest they may be younger than they claim.</p>



<p>Beyond these methods,<a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/65b929b26bb0a84854c0ecbd"> deepfake detection</a> plays a critical role in preventing fraud, ensuring that AI-generated videos or manipulated images can’t be used to bypass verification. Meanwhile, AI-driven document authentication is improving online identity verification by catching subtle forgeries that human reviewers might otherwise miss.</p>



<p>For businesses, this shift leads to fewer manual checks, faster processing, and a smoother experience for legitimate users—without creating new loopholes for fraudsters to exploit.</p>



 



 AI-Powered Fraud Prevention in Age Assurance 



<p>Fraudsters are always evolving, but AI is making it harder for them to cheat the system. Two of the most challenging fraud tactics today are synthetic identities and <a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/65b929b26bb0a84854c0ecbd">deepfake fraud</a>, both of which have become harder to detect and cheaper to execute.</p>



 



 Stopping Synthetic Identity Fraud 



<p>Synthetic identities are like digital chameleons—fraudsters blend real and fake details to create entirely new (but convincing) personas. These identities can slip past traditional verification methods because they look legitimate on the surface. But AI-powered defenses are catching up fast. Here’s how:</p>



 
 Behavioral Analysis → AI watches how users interact over time—how they type, move through a site, and even make payments. Fraudsters tend to behave differently than real users, and AI picks up on those subtle differences. 



 Cross-Checking Data → Instead of verifying just one piece of information, AI cross-references multiple sources—credit histories, public records, and known fraud databases—to spot mismatches that give away synthetic identities. 



 Machine Learning &amp; Pattern Recognition → AI learns from past fraud cases, continuously improving its ability to detect fake profiles by identifying patterns that human reviewers might miss. 



 AI-Powered Document Checks → Even when fraudsters submit “official-looking” IDs, AI scans for subtle signs of tampering—like mismatched fonts, odd lighting, or altered personal details. 
 



<p>These tools, combined with real-time risk assessments, make it significantly harder for fraudsters to create and use synthetic identities successfully.</p>



 



 Preventing Deepfake Fraud 



<p>Deepfake technology has made it scarily easy to create hyper-realistic fake images and videos, allowing fraudsters to impersonate real people. The good news is that AI can fight AI:</p>



 
 Liveness Detection → Ever noticed how people naturally blink, shift their expressions, or adjust their posture? Deepfakes struggle with these real-life nuances. AI-powered liveness detection can analyze micro-expressions, eye movement, and facial depth to confirm a person is actually present. 



 Advanced Facial Recognition → AI compares user-submitted selfies or videos with previously verified images to catch even the slightest inconsistencies that signal a deepfake. 



 Image &amp; Video Forensics → AI can break down visual elements—like unnatural lighting, weird pixel patterns, or facial distortions—to detect manipulated media before it fools the system. 



 Challenge-Response Tests → Asking users to complete real-time actions—like turning their head, smiling, or speaking a phrase—adds an extra layer of security that deepfakes struggle to replicate convincingly. 
 



<p>By combining these techniques, AI-powered verification systems can shut down deepfake attempts before they get past the first checkpoint.</p>

 Enhancing Secure Access Control Through AI 



<p>In industries where verifying a user’s age is critical—like alcohol and tobacco sales, online gambling, and adult content platforms—businesses need stronger, more adaptable verification methods. AI-powered access control allows companies to layer multiple verification techniques, ensuring that only legitimate users get through.</p>



<p>For higher-risk scenarios, businesses can combine selfie-based authentication with document scans for extra security. Instead of relying on one-time ID checks, AI continuously monitors risk in real time, flagging suspicious activity as it happens. This is especially useful in cases where users might try to borrow an ID, create a fake profile, or use manipulated images to bypass restrictions.</p>



<p>By making access control dynamic and responsive, AI helps businesses enforce age restrictions and regulatory compliance without frustrating legitimate users. Whether it’s a quick facial scan, behavioral analysis, or cross-referencing multiple data points, AI ensures the right people get access—while keeping fraudsters out.</p>



 



 Real-World Applications of AI in Age Assurance 



<p>New laws are forcing companies to rethink age verification systems, and AI is already playing a major role in compliance.</p>



 



 Age Verification Texas: Pornhub Compliance Challenges 



<p>The<a href="https://versustexas.com/blog/age-verification-law-texas/"> Pornhub age verification laws in Texas</a> require adult platforms to implement stricter age verification measures. Initially, these regulations relied on manual ID-based checks, but platforms quickly faced backlash over privacy concerns and user friction. To comply while maintaining user trust, many are turning to AI-driven facial recognition, which verifies age without storing personal documents. This approach helps businesses meet regulatory requirements while reducing fraud risks and improving user experience.</p>



<p>Google’s AI-Powered Age Assurance</p>



<p>Google has taken a proactive approach to age assurance across its platforms, leveraging AI to make verification more accurate and user-friendly. One major example is <a href="https://www.itp.net/edge/digital-culture/youtubes-new-ai-tools-are-protecting-creators-from-unauthorised-use-heres-how">YouTube’s AI Verification System</a>, which was introduced after self-reported birthdates proved unreliable for restricting access to age-sensitive content. Instead of relying on document uploads, YouTube’s system uses Google’s broader AI-driven verification methods to dynamically assess whether a user meets the required age criteria.</p>



<p>Beyond YouTube, Google applies these AI-powered techniques across its ecosystem, ensuring that minors are restricted from accessing age-sensitive services while keeping verification seamless for legitimate users. Similarly, other tech giants like <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202411/meta-announces-new-age-checking-measures-for-young-instagram-users">Meta</a> are implementing AI-driven age assurance to balance compliance, fraud prevention, and user convenience, reflecting a broader industry move toward smarter, more adaptable verification methods that protect minors without creating unnecessary barriers for real users.</p>

 Industries Leveraging AI for Age Estimation and Verification 



 Gaming &amp; Dating Sites 



<p>Online gaming and dating sites are increasingly adopting AI to ensure user authenticity and safety. For instance, gaming platforms utilize age estimation and behavioral tracking to prevent minors from accessing mature content. Similarly, dating apps employ facial recognition to verify that new users meet age requirements, fostering a safer environment for all participants.</p>



 Fintech, Banking, and Gambling&nbsp; 



<p>In regulated sectors like fintech, banking, and gambling, accurate and scalable age verification is crucial to prevent fraud and comply with legal standards. AI-driven solutions detect fake IDs, synthetic identities, and document tampering, thereby reducing onboarding delays while maintaining high-security levels. This approach ensures that services are accessible only to eligible individuals, safeguarding both the institutions and their clients.</p>



 Alcohol and Tobacco Sales 



<p>Retailers and e-commerce platforms selling alcohol and tobacco <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202502/age-check-legislation-to-prevent-youth-alcohol-tobacco-sales-expanding-globally">face strict age restrictions</a> and growing pressure to prevent underage purchases. AI-powered age assurance solutions help these businesses verify customer age in real-time by using document authentication, facial recognition, and behavioral analysis. Whether self-checkout kiosks scan IDs or online stores verify buyer credentials, AI ensures compliance while streamlining the purchasing process for legal customers.</p>

<p><a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/6744feebc0a25d54cc2e59c9">(From Liminal’s White Paper: The Age-Verified Internet – Strategies for Safer Online Experiences, Page 5)</a></p>



 



 Evaluating Age Assurance Systems 



<p>Implementing AI-driven verification is just one piece of the puzzle—businesses also need to ensure that these systems actually work as intended. The best solutions find the right balance between accuracy, speed, user experience, and fraud prevention while staying compliant with regulations.</p>



<p>To compare different approaches, companies turn to <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/05/nist-reports-first-results-age-estimation-software-evaluation">age-assured program reviews</a>, which assess how well these systems perform in real-world scenarios. These reviews help answer critical questions: How often does the system mistakenly approve underage users? How many legitimate users get unfairly blocked? How fast and smooth is the verification process?</p>



<p>By understanding these factors, businesses can choose a system that doesn’t just check a compliance box but actually makes verification secure, efficient, and frustration-free for real users.</p>



 



 Key Metrics for Effectiveness 



<p>According to our<a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/673341bb0c1051e76221fba8"> Market and Buyer’s Guide for Age Assurance</a>, decision-makers prioritize accuracy, completion speed, and user experience when selecting an age verification system. Key performance indicators include:</p>



 
 Accuracy rates → How well AI determines a user’s age. 



 False acceptance &amp; rejection rates → Are minors mistakenly approved or adults incorrectly denied? 



 Completion &amp; abandonment rates → If users drop off, verification may be too slow or intrusive. 



 Time to completion → How quickly can users verify their age? 
 



<p>The goal is high accuracy with minimal friction—a system that wrongly rejects legitimate users or lets fraudsters through ultimately fails at its job.</p>



 



 Future Trends and Innovations in Age Assurance 



<p>As regulations tighten and fraud tactics become more sophisticated, the future of age assurance will prioritize privacy-first verification, real-time risk assessment, and seamless identity tracking across devices. Businesses need solutions that not only verify age accurately but also protect user privacy and minimize friction.</p>



 



 Emerging Technologies in Age Verification 



<p>The push for<a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/674dfec1af1383e9afc9fc40"> privacy-first verification</a> is reshaping how companies handle age assurance. Users expect security without overexposing their personal data, and businesses must comply with stricter regulations. The next phase of age assurance will focus on privacy-first verification, real-time risk assessment, and seamless identity tracking across devices.</p>



 
 On-Device Processing reduces reliance on external servers, lowering the risk of data breaches while improving speed. 



 Zero-Knowledge Proofs allow platforms to confirm a user meets age requirements without storing or sharing unnecessary details. 



 Decentralized ID Systems let users verify their age once and carry a reusable digital credential across platforms instead of repeatedly submitting documents. 
 



<p>These advancements strengthen security while putting users in control of their own data.</p>

<p><a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/6744feebc0a25d54cc2e59c9">(From Liminal’s White Paper: The Age-Verified Internet – Strategies for Safer Online Experiences, Page 6)</a></p>



 



 Real-Time Audience Segmentation 



<p>Most age verification happens once at sign-up, but<a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/6744feebc0a25d54cc2e59c9?"> AI is enabling continuous, real-time adjustments</a> based on user behavior and risk factors.</p>



 
 Platforms can dynamically modify access based on content type, location, or browsing behavior. 



 If an account shows patterns consistent with a minor trying to bypass restrictions, additional verification can be triggered. 
 



<p>This approach helps businesses enforce age-appropriate access without disrupting legitimate users.</p>



 



 Cross-Device Identity Graphing 



<p>Users frequently switch between devices, and traditional verification methods struggle to keep up.<a href="https://link.liminal.co/research/6793d5a61392f72de1cc2348"> AI-driven identity graphing</a> helps platforms connect identities across multiple devices to ensure consistent age restrictions.</p>



 
 Fraudsters attempting to bypass verification on a new device can be flagged. 



 Minors using multiple accounts to avoid restrictions can be identified. 



 Users can verify their age once and maintain access across all their devices without repeating the process. 
 



<p>By eliminating gaps in identity verification, businesses can maintain security without frustrating legitimate users.</p>



 



 Conclusion 



<p>AI has transformed age verification from a slow, manual process into an instant, automated system that improves security and privacy without increasing friction. Facial recognition, behavioral analysis, and fraud detection tools have made verification faster and more reliable, reducing reliance on outdated document-based checks.</p>



<p>For businesses, this shift isn’t just about convenience. AI-driven solutions help companies stay compliant with evolving regulations, prevent fraud, and protect minors from accessing restricted content. More importantly, they play a critical role in trust and safety, ensuring that platforms can verify users without compromising privacy or creating unnecessary barriers.</p>



<p>The future of digital identity will be privacy-first, with on-device verification, zero-knowledge proofs, and decentralized credentials allowing users to prove their age without oversharing personal data. The question isn’t if AI will power age assurance but how businesses will use it responsibly and ethically. For businesses that want to stay ahead, the message is clear: Adapt now, or struggle to keep up later.</p>

 We sat down with the Chief Risk and Compliance Officer at Holvi, a leading digital banking service for freelancers and small businesses, to discuss fraud, compliance, and the strategies needed to stay ahead in an evolving financial landscape.  



<p>As an avid sailor, René knows that navigating risks is all about reading the conditions, adjusting course and staying prepared for unpredictable challenges.</p>



<p>“There’s no business without risk – it’s just part of the game,” says René. And in the financial industry, it’s a high-stakes game with ever-changing rules, where the cost of losing is staggering. In fact, <a href="https://www.gasa.org/post/global-state-of-scams-report-2024-1-trillion-stolen-in-12-months-gasa-feedzai">$1.03 trillion was lost to scams globally in 2024</a> and <a href="https://www.invespcro.com/blog/customer-acquisition-retention/">between €715 billion and €1.87 trillion of global GDP</a> is tainted by money laundering each year – an amount so massive it rivals the economy of entire countries like Italy or Switzerland.</p>



<p>The risk is not just a challenge, but an existential threat that can erode customer trust, destroy businesses and fuel further crime. Every laundered euro is not just a loss on a balance sheet, but also in human lives, as it funds human trafficking, terrorism, drug trade and more, devastating real lives of entire communities.</p>



<p>Plus, the opponents are relentless – always innovative, mastering the art of exploiting vulnerable individuals through psychological manipulation and constantly finding new attack techniques – even as regulations tighten. “In this era, new fraud patterns arise and disappear faster than static processes and systems can evolve,” René explain. Traditional fraud prevention simply can’t keep up. Especially now with the rise of AI-driven fraud and synthetic identities, it’s like racing against a fleet of expert sailors in ever-changing winds. The right strategy isn’t just about reacting to sudden gusts, but about reading the conditions, adjusting sails early, and maintaining an edge to stay ahead of the competition. For René, the only way forward is to fight fire with fire, with “detection and analysis capabilities needing to make use for the same technology” in order to keep pace and eventually overtake malicious actors.</p>



<p>For René, the key to success isn’t eliminating risk – it’s managing it. “You need to see the full picture, not just individual threats. Some risks are worth taking, while others need to be mitigated.” </p>



<p>Just as in a regatta, where a sailor may take a longer route to catch the best wind or make tactical manoeuvres to gain an advantage, navigating risk in finance means knowing when to hold steady and when to change course. So, there’s always a trade-off: security versus customer experience, compliance versus agility; “Balancing security with a smooth customer experience is always a challenge, especially in a regulated industry,” René acknowledges. </p>



<blockquote><p>Some friction is unavoidable, but what matters is how we handle it – making sure it’s transparent and makes sense to the customer.</p>René Hofer, Chief Risk and Compliance Officer at Holvi.</blockquote>



<p>In fact, friction can sometimes be positive, as it can reassure customers that the process is thorough. And<a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/can-friction-improve-your-customers-experiences/"> research shows that when friction enables decisions</a>, customer satisfaction can improve. Ultimately, this approach ensures that the balance between efficiency and trust is maintained. “At the end of the day, safety comes first. There’s no way around that,” says René.</p>



<p>This challenge is further complicated by a fragmented regulatory landscape. Even within the European Union there are countries like Germany enforcing strict regulatory measures under the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/aml-compliance-2024-amld6/">GDPR and AML directives</a> while other countries such as Ireland offer more flexible interpretations of these rules. “Honestly, it’s frustrating,” René admits. “Identity verification should be standardized, but it’s not – so we work with flexible solutions that adapt to local requirements without adding unnecessary complexity for customers.”</p>



<p>Staying ahead of evolving regulations is like sailing in unpredictable waters – you don’t always know when the wind will shift, but you must be ready to adjust your sails. Only those who anticipate changes and prepare accordingly will keep moving forward instead of being caught adrift. “It’s about being informed and ready to adapt,” says René. “You can’t predict every regulatory change, but you can build a system that adapts. That means staying ahead of trends, designing flexible processes, and making compliance part of everyday decision-making.”</p>



<p>Businesses must leverage technology and the expertise behind it, with software providers acting as key teammates in staying connected with regulatory bodies for timely product updates. “We rely on tech, strong data sources, and – most importantly – people who know how to interpret and act on that information. Regulations will always change, so the best approach is to embed flexibility into how we operate rather than treating compliance as something we “catch up on” later.”</p>



<p>Despite these challenges, René remains optimistic. The financial industry, regulators and businesses all share the same mission: securing a trustworthy financial ecosystem. The key is collaboration. “If you demand adaptability, show that you’re willing to adapt, too,” he advises. “Engage early, share insights and build relationships based on transparency.”</p>



<p>The challenge of risk and compliance is never over, and the conditions will always shift. But as René puts it, the real question isn’t whether businesses can avoid rough seas – it’s whether they’re charting a course for success or just trying to stay afloat.</p>

 The State of Digital ID — DICE 2025&nbsp;(Zurich) <p>Digital wallets remain the cutting edge of innovation in the field of digital identity — and Europe is leading the way in terms of policy development, technical innovation, and ecosystem building. On Tuesday the European Commission released the latest draft of the <a href="https://eu-digital-identity-wallet.github.io/eudi-doc-architecture-and-reference-framework/latest/architecture-and-reference-framework-main/">Architecture Reference Framework (ARF)</a>, the technical guidance for the standards and protocols that European digital wallets (EUDI) are expected to follow. But the ARF is not legislation, which creates complications — and opportunities — for policymakers, developers, and issue advocates.</p><p>At the <a href="https://lu.ma/DICEecosystems?coupon=RWX2NO">Digital unConference Europe</a> (DICE), the conversations and sessions were dominated by the EU wallet and its implications. The conference’s focus on building “ecosystems” is an important reminder that <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-difference-between-digital-identity-identification-and-id-41580bbb7563">digital ID is not a thing or a consumable product</a>, but a tool people use to achieve transaction goals. The key to the value of a digital ID scheme is what you can do with it. And key to what you can do with a digital wallet is who will trust its credentials and rely on it as proof of the claim that you make (that you are who you say you are and can do what you say you can do). This tripartite structure of issuers, holders, and relying parties is the core of an identification ecosystem.</p><p>Privacy and security: The EU efforts to develop a digital wallet offer one of the most cutting-edge efforts to implement societal scale digital identity systems — and importantly, one that aims to put users in control of their data. Yet the EUDI is far from perfect, and the tension between political imperatives and technical design remains. The reliance on government-issued personal identification data as the EUDI’s foundational credential has raised concerns about the potential for surveillance through linking usage of the credentials, and thus revealing the identity and/or behaviors of the holder. For example, usage of the credential to prove age might reveal a taste for alcohol, or specific bar or alcohol preferences. As DICE participants noted, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/viky-manaila-%F0%9F%92%AF-0690aa1_arf-eidas-digitalwallet-activity-7302800180255350784-4egH?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAACNrMoBVJwvORPlthLv_lXtpRTGBvHXfK8">the ARF 1.6 has measures on privacy</a>, but has not yet resolved the issue if unlinkability and this traceability.</p><p>The exclusion of cryptographic technologies such as Zero Knowledge Proofs (excluded because they are not (yet) included in the list of approved electronic signature technologies) also means that the current specification for the wallet exclude the use of technologies that could mitigate these concerns — an exclusion that persists in the latest ARF. These specifications are critical in determining how user-centric and protective the EUDI wallet will be. They are also going to be significant in their wider adoption and interoperability — the Swiss specification requires the possibility for unlinkability, for example..</p><p>Governance vs. technology: One significant theme of the conference was the tension between relying on governance and regulation versus technological solutions, particularly in regard to privacy and protection. The current ARF limits the use of advanced cryptographic technologies, and so relies on regulation to prevent issuers encoding trackers into credentials. This is a weak form of protection. What happens if those rules are no longer followed? Also, what happens when the wallet is adopted in places where the rule of law is weak or authorities surveil&nbsp;users?</p><p>Cross-border ecosystems: The question of ecosystem and standards is also significant when thinking about the EUDI in the context of cross-border usage and as part of a global ecosystem of digital identification. The EUDI wallet is currently designed for European citizens and legal residents. While a core use case is intra-European travel, the wallet’s potential is far broader than that. There has already been discussion about its potential to <a href="https://ecdpm.org/work/tech-sovereignty-and-new-eu-foreign-economic-policy">complement European foreign policy</a> and for it to hold <a href="https://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/19/09/2024/digital-public-infrastructure-sovereignty-what-european-approach-dpi-might-look">an infrastructural “Brussels effect.” </a>This is not just idle speculation — <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202502/georgia-seeks-candidates-to-build-digital-id-wallet">Georgia is already developing its own digital identity wallet using the European framework</a>. But for the European wallet to really function as part of a global ecosystem will require thinking through how to answer cross-border and migration questions such&nbsp;as:</p>  How would a European hospital trust a digital credential claiming medical expertise when hiring a doctor from outside the&nbsp;EU?  How would a university trust digital educational credentials issued from a non-European academic institution?  <p>Currently, these verifications are often manual processes — a phone call is made to the issuing medical institution or university, or the individual has to pass national tests to requalify. Digitalizing this broader ecosystem could enable easier migration and access to employment and education.</p><p>Digital identity is an ecosystem, one in which issuers, holders, and verifiers are the core actors. Building out these trust frameworks is key to realizing the potential — and mitigating the risks — of innovation in digital identification. If the EUDI wallet is to be an enabler of cross-border movement, and supporter of the migration and expertise that Europe needs, these challenges must be addressed.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/the-state-of-digital-id-dice-2025-zurich-0f35491a2e5d">The State of Digital ID — DICE 2025 (Zurich)</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Getting job seekers into the right roles and incentivizing residents to develop skills both have huge implications for a region's economic productivity and residents' happiness. Online networking and application platforms have made hiring <a href="https://www.gallup.com/workplace/647831/recruitment-process-digital-ever.aspx?ref=blog.spruceid.com">far more effective</a> in the 21st century, but the use of artificial intelligence by job applicants threatens to undermine that progress.</p><p>Now, Verifiable Digital Credentials supporting Digital Learning and Employment Records, or LERs, are being used across the U.S. in hopes of rescuing the hiring process while making it easier than ever to reliably connect skilled workers with employers who need them. LERs are digital documents controlled by the holder and verifiable with an issuer’s cryptographic signature.&nbsp;</p><p>That means employers can trust that a diploma, certification, or past employment record is trustworthy without the shockingly laborious process of verifying it directly with the issuer — even when the credential is presented online. The possibilities for making hiring more efficient and effective are hard to overstate — but trustworthy credentials are bigger than that. Their adoption would make skills-based training courses more significant in the hiring process, incentivizing more lifelong learning and ultimately creating a more skilled workforce and vibrant economy.</p> A New Foundation for Digital Trust <p>Digital Education and Learning Credentials can now take the form of Verifiable Digital Credentials, or VDCs. VDCs are an innovation that uses cryptography to create trustworthy and non-duplicable digital documents whose source and authenticity are confirmed by cryptographic signatures that can be verified in person or online. VDC technology is already used to secure Mobile Driver's Licenses (mDL), which are being <a href="https://www.aamva.org/jurisdiction-data-maps?ref=blog.spruceid.com#anchorformdlmap">rapidly adopted</a> in the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>These trustworthy digital documents are beginning to be used to record and verify educational and employment credentials, from one-off training workshops to certifications to advanced degrees. Systems using LERs to connect job seekers to employers are in the very early stages, but they’re being piloted in collaboration with employers and educators, such as by <a href="https://workshift.org/alabama-bets-big-on-a-talent-marketplace/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Alabama’s Credential Registry</a> and the <a href="https://workshift.org/in-push-for-skills-based-hiring-colorado-invests-in-new-tech-and-a-new-language-of-learning/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Colorado Workforce Development Council</a>.&nbsp;</p> Fighting Credential Fraud <p>The first problem that LERs can help solve is one perhaps as old as civilization itself. As much as we would love to trust our fellow human beings, the fact is that job searchers, to put it politely, embellish credentials and experience at an alarming rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Depending on which study you read, anywhere <a href="https://www.pcma.org/hiring-resume-liar?ref=blog.spruceid.com">from 25%</a> to a shocking <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryanrobinson/2023/11/05/70-of-workers-lie-on-resumes-new-study-shows/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">70% of job applicants</a> admit to lying on a resume. Surprisingly, according to a survey by ResumeLab, candidates with more credentials, like a Masters degree or a PhD, are significantly more likely to lie.</p><p>Actively rooting out such deceptions is unsustainably time-consuming – one medical firm surveyed for our Colorado project reported using <a href="https://workshift.org/in-push-for-skills-based-hiring-colorado-invests-in-new-tech-and-a-new-language-of-learning/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">17 different systems to vet applicants</a>. Advice for recruiters trying to detect fraud reflects the hopelessness of the situation, leaning heavily on nostrums like <a href="https://www.pcma.org/hiring-resume-liar/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">“trust your gut.”</a></p><p>Quite obviously, that’s not good enough. Hiring the wrong person is <a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/9066-cost-of-bad-hire.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">very costly</a>, wasteful, and disruptive for any given firm - and it happens all the time, adding headwinds to entire economies.</p> The Recruiting AI-Pocalypse <p>The appearance of powerful “large language models” like ChatGPT in the past two years has added even more challenges to the job search and recruiting process. By making it easier to create materials like cover letters and resumes, LLMs have unleashed <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/30a032dd-bdaa-4aee-bc51-754867abbde0?ref=blog.spruceid.com">a flood of applications</a>. According to recruiters and firms, as many as half of all job applicants are using AI for cover letters or other elements of their job materials.</p><p>The disjointed or odd output of many LLMs makes these AI applications relatively easy to detect (and reject) when a human reviews them. However, application spam is severely disrupting the work of recruiters seeking top-quality candidates and even increasing the risk of deceptive job applications since LLMs have a tendency to “hallucinate” data, even if an applicant had no intention to deceive.</p><p>“We’re definitely seeing higher volume and lower quality, which means it is harder to sift through [applications],” recruiting firm CEO Khyati Sundaram recently <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/facac60f-dbe7-4889-b76a-7ec1dc1f2e2c?ref=blog.spruceid.com">told the Financial Times</a>. By making it even harder and slower to fill open roles, AI spam adds another drag on innovation, profits, and growth.</p><p>In some jurisdictions, AI can be used to screen and categorize applications (ironically helping to address the problem that it has created). In others, including the entire European Union, automating job application processing is <a href="https://knowledge.dlapiper.com/dlapiperknowledge/globalemploymentlatestdevelopments/2024/eu-ai-act-to-enter-into-force-implications-for-employers?ref=blog.spruceid.com">tightly restricted</a>.</p><p>However, under either circumstance, recruiters should aim to apply nuanced human judgment as often and carefully as possible. LERs help maximize human choice by making it much easier to confirm that the information an applicant submits is actually accurate.</p> How do Digital Credentials Work? <p>LERs and other Verifiable Digital Credentials are <a href="https://spruceid.com/reports-and-whitepapers/an-introduction-to-verifiable-digital-credentials?ref=blog.spruceid.com">digital records with cryptographic “seals”</a> that affirm their authenticity and prevent them from being copied or stolen. VDCs are stored and managed by digital wallet software similar to Apple Pay and can be presented over the internet, either sent as part of an application or integrated into a job marketplace.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, a chef or server could attach a trustworthy food handler’s license as part of an application to a restaurant without the restaurant having to verify its validity separately. Digital credentials can also contain detailed information, such as an applicant’s performance in a course, making selecting between applicants easier than relying on self-reported claims. This combination of speed, reach, and trustworthiness means recruiters can reliably find the best applications without worrying if they’re misleading.&nbsp;</p><p>But LERs also stand to increase the quality of the talent pool itself over time, by making training more transparent and actionable. “What gets measured, gets managed” is a truism often attributed to management guru Peter Drucker, and it applies to individuals as much as organizations: a certification is more appealing to learners if it leads to a permanent, detailed, shareable record likely to have a real impact on their future.</p><p>Like many systems, LER adoption for job credentials has something of a chicken-and-egg problem: both credential issuance and credential acceptance have to be in place for either one to be effective. That’s a major reason states are leading the way: they’re in a position to push forward both sides of the market.&nbsp;</p> Building Better Job Markets <p>The path to fully implementing verifiable digital work and education credentials for job searchers may be a long one—coordinating educators, employers, and systems will be challenging. But LERs are based on existing <a href="https://spruceid.com/learn/relevant-standards-and-implementation-guidelines?ref=blog.spruceid.com">open and interoperable technical standards</a>, meaning there are already agreed-on “rails” for building them, and first movers won’t risk being left behind by future progress.</p><p>The trust created by better credentialing systems will help recruiters fight AI spam, put workers in the right jobs, and maximize the benefit of education. Early movers, such as the most innovative states, universities, and employers, stand to pull ahead of competitors who follow - both in shaping the future of these systems and in reaping their benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re interested in exploring the possibilities, <a href="https://spruceid.com/contact-us?ref=blog.spruceid.com">please reach out: SpruceID is ready to help</a>.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/contact-us?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Contact Us</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

 Strict. Expensive. Complex. Is the German online gaming market even worth entering? IDnow’s VP of Global Gaming joins other industry experts to explore the state of play in what could be the European country with the most untapped potential. 



<p>When compared to other European countries, Germany’s online gambling market is in its infancy, still taking its first steps. In fact, it was just July 2021 when the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/gluecksspielstaatsvertrag-glustv/">Glücksspielstaatsvertrag</a>&nbsp; (German Interstate Treaty on Gambling) came into effect, which effectively legalized and regulated it across all 16 states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Four years later, the industry is worth about <a href="https://sigma.world/news/the-german-gaming-market-could-reach-e5-14-billion-in-2024/">€3 billion per annum</a>. Although certainly a decent amount, when compared to more mature markets like the UK, which generates around €<a href="https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/statistics-and-research/publication/industry-statistics-november-2024-official-statistics">8.3 billion of annual income</a>, it is rather underwhelming, especially considering there are 15 million more people in Germany than the UK.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/02/germanys-2024-gambling-tax-revenue-holds-steady-at-e2-49-billion">Reasons for Germany’s sluggish growth</a> in the online gaming market range from low deposit limits, heavy advertising restrictions, major compliance burdens, and, of course, the struggle to tempt players away from the black market, which still remains incredibly popular in the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Interested in how Germany is attempting to tackle unregulated gambling, read our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exploring-black-market-gambling-in-germany/">‘Exploring black market gambling in Germany’ blog</a>.</p>



<p>In February 2025, to explore the challenges facing operators, and share strategies on how to capitalize on the complex but lucrative market, Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, VP of Global Gaming at IDnow attended a webinar with Dimitry Voelkle, Managing Director at Zelda Consulting GmbH and Faruk Aydin, Chief Revenue Officer at the <a href="https://revpanda.com">Revpanda Group</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Missed it? Don’t worry – here are our top 3 takeaways:</p>



 1. Strict regulations can be both a blessing and a curse. 



<p>If you want to become a major player in Europe, it’s essential to have a presence in Germany. However, it’s safe to say that that won’t be easy. In fact, there are many German regulations and requirements that could put operators, especially international operators, off.</p>



<blockquote><p>I always say that regulation is good if the regulation is good. The fact remains that <a href="https://sbcnews.co.uk/featurednews/2023/11/14/german-atlas-cites-disorder/">in 2007, 55% of the German population</a> gambled but that figure dropped to 30% in 2021 following the introduction of regulations. The German regulator must ask itself why this happened.</p>Roger Redfearn-Tyrzyk, VP of Global Gaming at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>There is a long list of requirements that operators must follow to become a licensed gaming operator in Germany. For example, besides ensuring onboarding and registration processes comply with strict BaFin AML directives, operators must also obtain an annual ISO 27001 security audit certificate. Further requirements include needing to be headquartered in Germany and have German language proficiency to fill out license applications in the native language. Other potentially off-putting stipulations include:</p>



<p>Deposit limits: Players are only able to deposit a maximum of €1,000 per month across all licensed platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stake limits: Players can bet a maximum of €1 per spin on slots and must wait 5 seconds between spins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Game restrictions: German players that have migrated from unlicensed platforms – of which there are still millions – may find their favorite game unavailable as live casino games, progressive jackpots and live bets are all prohibited on regulated platforms. Not being able to offer players their favorite game is, of course, an additional challenge for operators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Advertising: Operators are subject to very narrow windows within which to advertise. No ads can be broadcast between 6am-9pm on TV, radio or any other medium. Influencer marketing is also prohibited, as are ads that target minors or other vulnerable groups.</p>

                     Discover how gaming operators can keep pace with the ever-growing multi-jurisdictional landscape in Europe and beyond. 
                    <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/online-gambling-regulations-eu-uk/">Read now</a>
           
           
         
          
         
       
	     
 


 2. Money’s too vast to [not] mention. 



<p>There is one thing that prospective operators need in abundance before they begin their German gaming journey (besides patience!): money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After paying a non-refundable application fee of €185,000 to the Gemeinsame Glücksspielbehörde der Länder (GGL), operators can gain a license, which is typically valid for 5 years, but can be renewed for 7. However, the financial outlay doesn’t stop there. German gaming operators are also required to pay a so-called ‘security deposit,’ which acts as a bank guarantee to protect player funds. Based on the operator’s projected monthly turnover, this can range from the minimum of €5 million to €50 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It doesn’t stop there. Alongside the <a href="https://www.affiversemedia.com/tripling-cost-of-player-acquisition-in-igaming-builds-stronger-focus-for-retention/">tripling cost of player acquisition</a>, there are annual supervisory fees, which operators must pay to cover GGL’s regulatory oversight and additional compliance costs like connecting to the ‘limit control database’ to enforce the €1,000 monthly deposit limit, among others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, operators are subject to quite high taxes, with a 5.3% stake tax applied to every single euro wagered. In a bid to offset these costs, many resort to lowering the ‘return-to-player’ percentage (the amount paid back to players).&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, with a population of over 84 million and vast numbers of the public still using black market platforms, there is clearly opportunity for those that a) have the patience and money to enter and b) can tempt black market players to the regulated environment. But how exactly can operators do that?</p>



 3. Always room for something new and novel. 



<p>There are still opportunities in the German online gaming market, especially for those that can offer something different to underserved demographics, such as the younger (20-30 years of age), multicultural generation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is because much of the current marketing – and available games – cater to an older audience. So, if operators can offer the games that people want to play (e.g. Book of Ra), and a simplified, compliant user experience then there are valuable opportunities to capture the attention of a new generation of Germans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At IDnow, we see compliance as an enabler not a burden. One of the major reasons we offer player feedback surveys after every verification is to discover what players value, which then informs the tweaks we make to the user experience and subsequent player education. Through player feedback, we learn whether more instructions are required and gather opinions and issues with the design and UX etc,” said Roger.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Germany is such a comparatively young market, creating an environment that is attractive to the players, operators and the regulator requires open and transparent dialogue about how to take the market forward.</p>

 Investment unlocks the next stage of growth and innovation for digital identity leader in Europe&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>MUNICH&nbsp;and&nbsp;LONDON&nbsp;– March 6, 2025 –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/">IDnow</a>&nbsp;(or “the Company”), a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, today announced a new strategic investment from&nbsp;<a href="https://corsair-capital.com/">Corsair Capital</a>&nbsp;(“Corsair”), a specialist investment firm targeting payments, software, and business services investments in the financial services market. With this transaction, Corsair will acquire a majority stake in the Company&nbsp;from existing shareholders, reinforcing its commitment to fueling IDnow’s continued growth and leadership position within the European identity market, and into other regions globally.</p>



<p>Founded in 2014, IDnow builds proprietary, AI-powered identity verification technologies that address the cybersecurity and digital verification needs of global enterprises and leading international brands across financial services, telecommunications, travel &amp; mobility, gaming and other industries.</p>



<p>Corsair&nbsp;<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/idnow-raises-40-million-in-growth-funding-from-corsair-capital-300946185.html">first invested</a>&nbsp;to support the growth of IDnow in October 2019 when it acquired a minority stake in the business. Since Corsair’s initial investment, IDnow has strengthened its technical leadership position, grown its portfolio of differentiated identification solutions, and completed two strategic acquisitions which expanded the company into new geographies including establishing a leadership position in France. Through this transaction, Corsair aims to further accelerate IDnow’s growth and the Company’s position as a European leader with a comprehensive suite of solutions, strong positions in multiple geographies, and with additional acquisitions bringing added scale and reach.</p>



<p>“Since our founding a decade ago, IDnow has become a market leader in identity verification in Germany and France. During this time, we have achieved significant success in delivering strong results and growing our customer base, and with today’s announcement we aim to solidify our commitment to positioning the Company for future success,” said IDnow CEO Andreas Bodczek. “Corsair’s increased investment underscores their confidence in our vision and speaks to the synergies we have achieved through our collaborative relationship. With this deeper partnership, we can continue to transform and ensure our platform continues to evolve.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are thrilled to expand our partnership with IDnow,” said Raja Hadji-Touma and Edward Wertheim, Partners at Corsair. “Since our initial investment, we’ve witnessed IDnow build significant momentum and achieve impressive scale. We are excited by the opportunity to deepen our partnership with IDnow’s talented management team, and we look forward to supporting their next chapter of innovation and growth.”</p>



<p>“Building IDnow has been an incredible journey over the past 10 years together&nbsp;with Armin Berghaus, Dennis von Ferenczy and Sebastian Baerhold, and&nbsp;we believe&nbsp;today’s announcement enables us to strengthen our capabilities and capitalize on the vast market opportunity available to us,”&nbsp;said Felix Haas, Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of IDnow. “Corsair’s&nbsp;resources and expertise will help accelerate growth and unlock new opportunities&nbsp;for the Company and&nbsp;I’m confident this partnership will drive progress and expansion in ways that will benefit IDnow, its customers and the industry as a whole.”</p>

				  Verifiable Credential technology has a critical role to play in making AI systems work for companies and consumers — simplify compliance with the EU Artificial Intelligence Act and provide the safety and security that everyone wants.  
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>Between hype and fear lies compliance, and the EU <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=OJ:L_202401689">Artificial Intelligence Act</a> of 2024 sends a clear signal that businesses will pay heavily for noncompliance with the bloc’s rules for safe and trustworthy AI systems: up to €15 million or 3% of global turnover. Fines for violating the rules are even higher: up to €35 million or 7% of global turnover.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similar to the EU’s data protection regulations (GDPR), the legal reach of the AI Act is long: if your AI — or a subcontractor’s AI — ends up processing the data of an EU citizen, you’re liable — and &nbsp;it doesn’t matter if you or your subcontractor are based outside the EU.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And while regulation typically lags behind technology, the EU appears to recognize the need for urgency in keeping pace with how AI is being deployed and continually updating its risk-based approach.</p>
<p>How will this shape the pace and scale of AI adoption and innovation for business and public sector use cases?&nbsp;</p>
 A risk-based approach to AI systems 
<p>The first thing to note is that the act is broken into four levels of risk, with the highest risks being unacceptable and, therefore, prohibited. For example, Article 5,&nbsp; prohibits malicious or exploitative uses of AI that violate human rights and exploit people’s vulnerabilities, engage in social or criminal profiling, or scrape people’s biometric data to create facial recognition biometric databases.</p>
<p>The second category of risk is for “for high-risk AI systems,” such as those used in autonomous vehicles, for diagnosing disease, for grading exams, or assessing eligibility for loans —or as a safety component in a system. These AI systems “must meet strict requirements and obligations to gain access to the EU market. These include rigorous testing, transparency and human supervision.”</p>
<p>The third category is for AI systems deemed to be of&nbsp; “limited risk.” This includes AIs that directly interact with people, such as chatbots and digital assistants, AIs that generate synthetic content or generate deceptive synthetic content for manipulative purposes, such as deepfakes, and AIs used for biometric categorization or emotional recognition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These systems are allowed if they are transparent, meaning that people know they are interacting with an AI or AI-generated content.</p>
<p>It’s also important to remember that the EU AI Act sits on top of GDPR, which means that any AI system that processes the data of an EU citizen (of which there are 450 million) is also subject to rules on data minimization, purpose limitation, and consent — legal considerations that need to be considered when it comes to AI solutions that require access to people’s personal data.</p>
<p>This is where decentralized identity’s ability to efficiently manage AI transparency, GDPR, permissioned access, consent, data minimization and purpose limitation enables AI systems to interact with people in a&nbsp; safe, secure, privacy-preserving way — and in a way that enhances their performance.</p>
 Permissioned access 
<p>A key element of decentralized identity is that — in the language of GDPR —&nbsp;data subjects are able to hold their data using Verifiable Credentials stored in a digital wallet on a mobile device. This means that data is fully portable. The data is also cryptographically verifiable without having to check in with the source or a third-party. And this means:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. A person can share it directly by consent.</p>
<p>2. That consent can be recorded by the relying party for audit.</p>
<p>3. The source of the data is immediately verifiable.</p>
<p>4. The data shared can be trusted and immediately acted on because it has been digitally signed by the original issuer.</p>
<p>This makes the permissioned access vastly simpler to manage in terms of basic usability. Think about an airline chatbot or digital assistant interacting with a passenger who has missed their flight. The passenger can simply swipe or use voice consent for the assistant to access their relevant flight data stored in a credential — as opposed to the passenger having to manually input all these data fields by going outside of the chat UI to find the data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suddenly, chat is much easier to use —&nbsp;and now there is permissioned access, we can develop personalized services through loyalty program credentials. We can combine search with small language models to solve sets of recurring problems or processes. We can integrate payments in a secure way.&nbsp;</p>
 Know your chatbot, assistant, agent&nbsp; 
<p>All these things can be achieved efficiently and effectively not just because we have AI systems but because we have decentralized digital identities for seamless authentication built on verifiable credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is only because the AI can verify a “government-grade” digital identity, such as a Digital Passport Credential, that the AI can be certain the data it is accessing really belongs to the person it should belong to. It can verify that the person paying for a service is the authentic account owner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this authentication works both ways. In terms of transparency, people are not just going to want to know that they are interacting with an AI, they are going to want to know that it’s a legitimate, trustable AI agent they are interacting with before they give it permission to access their data.</p>
<p>Get this right and you deliver superlative services and value. You get to build trust networks that create new, dense partnerships between businesses and with customers. You eliminate the kind of inefficiencies that frustrate people in basic digital interactions, and you remove the obstacles to interacting at scale. And with the integration of search, you remove the need for intermediaries as a cost.&nbsp;</p>
 Europe is on the right path with decentralized digital identity —&nbsp;but it needs to up its technical game to meet AI 
<p>We’re excited about the EU’s embrace of decentralized digital identity (in the form of the specifications eIDAS 2.0 and EUDI), but we also must point out that successfully navigating agentic AI (something barely mentioned in the EU AI Act because the tech is moving faster than the regulation) will require more sophisticated decentralized identity solutions than those specified.</p>
<p>Specifically, the <a href="https://indicio.tech/what-is-didcomm-with-pictures/">DIDComm communications protocol </a>is critical to making&nbsp; human-agentic AI interaction safe, secure, and workable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good news is the protocol specified by eIDAS 2.0, Open ID <a href="https://blog.identity.foundation/bridging-the-gap-openid-and-didcomm/">is interoperable with DIDComm.</a> Indicio has also <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-landmark-in-digital-travel-aruba-indicio-and-sita-combine-a-dtc-and-iata-oneid-for-international-flights/">successfully combined </a>both protocols in a single workflow for seamless international travel.</p>

It lets conversations continue, while helping to make pattern recognition and emotional intelligence possible for AI assistants.</p><p>However, designing an effective memory system is much harder than it might seem. It’s actually one of the biggest challenges facing the <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> industry right now.</p> <p>I’m Simon Westh Henriksen, Co-Founder of <a href="http://mykin.ai/">Kin</a>. As CTO, I’m dedicated to making Kin the most personal, private, and trustworthy AI assistant we can - all while showing why this technology is cutting-edge along the way.</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd61ef68-2503-4874-a8ad-7d02cbb6d1af_997x997.jpeg">   </a> <p><a href="https://dk.linkedin.com/in/simonhenriksen">Follow me on LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kinpersonalai">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://x.com/simonhenriksen">X</a> - or join Kin’s <a href="https://discord.gg/PYMyz6uRct">Discord</a></p> <p>That’s because, at the end of the day, AI chatbots are at their most intuitive when they can be spoken to like a human. But the natural adaptiveness, selectivity, and overall power of the human memory is easy to take for granted - especially when you’re building an AI’s memory from scratch to support it.</p><p>AI memory must be intentionally designed to balance a number of things humans naturally handle, like:</p>  <p>recall</p>  <p>forgetting (yes, really)</p>  <p>contextual awareness</p>  <p>ethical considerations</p>  <p>All so it can feel natural to talk to, while still serving as a reliable and private data store.</p><p>So, let’s talk about what makes that so difficult - that’ll let us home in on particular problems (and Kin’s solutions) in our next articles.</p> Your <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">personal AI</a> needs to be (slightly) forgetful <p>Human memory, as we all know, cannot perfectly recall everything. Instead, memories our brains deem ‘less significant’ often fade away unless they are refreshed - following a pattern mapped out by scientific models like the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve.<a>1</a></p><p>A personal AI needs to do something similar - remembering what matters, while allowing irrelevant or outdated information to fade away.</p><p>However, it’s not that simple. Given the AI’s role to support human memory, and its artificial nature as an AI chatbot, things can get complicated.</p> Some example challenges:   <p>Remembering too much information leads to cluttered storage and outdated facts, which can cause inefficient memory processing.</p>  <p>Forgetting too much risks losing essential context, leading to unnatural and frustrating interactions.</p>  <p>Should AI memory decay naturally over time? Or would it be more helpful remembering every important memory, and just filtering out trivial facts?</p>  <p>How can AI determine the importance of a memory? A user saying “I just had lunch” should not be treated the same as “I just got married” - but either one could be important in conversations.</p>   (Some) facts evolve, and your <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI companion</a> needs to know that <p>As humans, we constantly update our beliefs and opinions based on new experiences. And sometimes, they change for no reason at all.</p><p>When this information changes, it’s often easy for us to update our memories without a second thought. We know when new changes must replace old information (“I got a new job”), and when multiple things can be true at once (“I have a dog (but also a cat)”).</p><p>However, when building an AI’s memory, we have to decide how it does that.</p><p>Personal AI needs to manage this systematically, efficiently, and transparently - all while staying smooth and intuitive for users. That creates the following problems.</p> Some example challenges:   <p>If a user first says, "my favorite color is red," and later says, "my favorite color is blue," does the AI replace the old fact or track how preferences evolve?</p>  <p>If a user states, "I work at Company A," and later, "I work at Company B," should the AI assume a job change, or does the user have multiple jobs? Should it ask?</p>  <p>Some facts naturally expire and evolve (“I live in Paris” can change with a move). How should AI track and update evolving facts?</p>  <p>If a user mentions “Karen” multiple times, but refers to different people, how does AI differentiate between them without mistakes or constant questioning?</p>   How you understand context needs to be taught to <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> <p>Human memory doesn’t just store facts - it also stores context around them. We remember details differently based on emotional importance, sensory input, and relevance, to name a few.</p><p>You may recognise a pattern here: this is yet another thing we do subconsciously that an AI’s memory needs to be designed to do across different languages and cultures. These are some of the issues that come with that.</p> Some example challenges:   <p>How much detail should be stored? Should it capture every word of a conversation, or extract key themes? How are misinterpretations prevented?</p>  <p>How should AI determine relevance? Should it weigh emotionally significant moments more heavily? Or is it more situational than that?</p>  <p>Can AI dynamically adjust memory depth, summarizing older interactions while keeping recent ones detailed? Where is the cut-off point for ‘older’?</p>  <p>How should AI group memories into episodes? For instance, an event like “My wedding” consists of multiple related memories - how does AI cluster them into a coherent narrative?</p>   <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI assistants</a> work with many types of data <p>Memory for personal AI isn’t limited to conversational interactions.</p><p>Users may share <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/anxiety-journaling-complete-guide">Journal entries</a>, images, documents, health data, <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/the-kinside-scoop-2">calendar events</a>, and external articles, to name a few.</p><p>A truly personal AI must not only learn from anything that is shared with it, but also understand why the user shared it, then make and record the appropriate insights.</p><p>Here’s an idea of the unique challenges each data type comes with.</p> Some example challenges:   <p>Conversational Memory: Correctly interpreting and recording tone, intent, and context.</p>  <p>External Media: Determining the user’s interest, concern, or agreement with shared content, and its relevance to any current conversations.</p>  <p>Journals and Notes: Balancing privacy with deep learning insights.</p>  <p>Health Data: Processing trends and ensuring understanding while ensuring user privacy.</p>  <p>Calendar Data: Aligning memory with real-world commitments and priorities.</p>  <p>Events as entities: Recognizing events like “TechCrunch 2025”, and understanding them as time-sensitive memories.</p>   Time is even more confusing for <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI chatbots</a> than it is for you <p>Human memory naturally organizes events in a time-based sequence - but even we often struggle with ambiguous time frames like ‘soon’ or ‘next year.’</p><p>For natural conversation, an AI must interpret these vague and contextual words correctly most of the time - and do so across all the languages it supports. Otherwise, it’ll be much harder to discuss things like <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/mastering-time-management-a-guide">time management</a> with it.</p><p>Developing the robust temporal models to track these kinds of evolving user interactions comes with many difficulties, including the following.</p> Some example challenges:   <p>"I’m fixing my bike soon" vs. "I’m having a baby soon" - the meaning of "soon" changes drastically with context.</p>  <p>Should an AI prioritize recent memories over older ones when making decisions?</p>  <p>How should an AI handle evolving plans, such as tracking a trip from early planning to completion?</p>  <p>How should an AI handle memories with varying levels of time specificity (year, year+month, exact date)? Would a ‘time-tree’ structure help?</p>   Your personal AI doesn’t know how memories should be strengthened <p>Certain memories stick with us more than others due to <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-build-emotional-intelligence">emotional significance</a>, repetition, and personal importance.</p><p>An AI must mimic this selective reinforcement well enough for its memory to allow useful and natural conversations to take place, like <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-handle-difficult-conversations">preparing for a difficult conversation at work.</a></p><p>Predictably, that means we run into a few important questions as we figure out exactly what methods should be used to do this.</p> Some example challenges:   <p>Should an AI reinforce memories based on repetition, emotional markers, or explicit user signals? If it should be a mix, what percentage of each should be used?</p>  <p>Should an AI infer importance based on user engagement, such as frequent references to a topic?</p>  <p>How can an AI mimic human-like recall, where some memories are instantly accessible while others require effort to retrieve? Should it even try?</p>  <p>Can an AI store emotions related to memories, and recognize that emotionally-charged experiences often have stronger retention?</p>   AI assistants don’t have human brains (for memory storage) like you <p>The human brain is a sophisticated memory storage and retrieval system - one an AI can’t take advantage of directly.</p><p>Instead, an AI memory requires structured storage techniques to be designed and implemented into it by hand.</p><p>Creating the right data model for efficient retrieval is critical to ensuring relevant, accurate interactions - and of course, isn’t straightforward.</p> Some example challenges:   <p>Should an AI use a fixed data schema (structure), or an adaptive format that evolves over time?</p>  <p>How can an AI efficiently retrieve relevant parts of past interactions, without overwhelming users with unnecessary details?</p>  <p>Vector databases can allow for information like memories to be searched for through understanding a search’s meaning and intent, rather than just its keywords (semantic search). But how should an AI ensure it doesn’t under- or over-interpret the search, and skew the results?</p>  <p>Graph-based memory can help track relationships - but does it make recollection too complex?</p>  <p>Hybrid models combine structured and unstructured data, but balancing them effectively requires careful design. Is it worth the effort?</p>  <p>How can an AI dynamically prioritize the most relevant memories, outside of choosing the most recent or most-frequently discussed/recalled?</p>  <p>Should an AI generate memories based on data inferences (e.g. “User seems to enjoy hiking based on this discussion about it”)? How do we distinguish inferred knowledge from explicit facts?</p>   <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">Personal AI</a> only has the morality and <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-trust-is-and-why-ai-needs-it">trust</a> we give it <p>As personal AI becomes more trusted and more effective with its memory, the ethical questions of what it will do with its user’s personal data, and how it will protect the <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/privacy-kin-personal-ai">privacy</a> of it, will only grow.</p><p>For an AI to reach its full potential as a personal assistant, its users must fully trust that their data is handled responsibly and transparently. Otherwise, the AI will never be told everything it needs to provide an individual and insightful service.</p><p>The privacy and security of AI data is already one of the most-discussed issues in the industry, but developing a memory system also brings additional challenges.</p> Some example challenges:   <p>How can developers ensure an AI’s memory will be secure and respect sensitive user data?</p>  <p>Users should be able to view and edit what the AI remembers easily. How can this be made robust and intuitive?</p>  <p>AI must avoid reinforcing harmful biases through selective memory retention. How can this be reduced, and the AI taught to recognise and repair it if it happens?</p>  <p>Who controls the AI’s memories—the user or the platform? How is that made clear?</p>  <p>If a user says “I don’t like when you ask about my love life,” should an AI remember this as a rule for future interactions? What rules should surround meta-learning like this?</p>   Unlocking the potential of AI-powered memory with <a href="https://mykin.ai/">Kin</a> <p>As this series so far has begun to show, memory can transform even a basic ChatGPT-like system into a true personal companion.</p><p>However, the challenges in building an effective memory system are substantial, and have only been skimmed over here. But, solving them opens up the possibility for something incredible: AIs which truly understand us, grow with us, and provide meaningful, long-term support.</p><p>Our AI team is working on making Kin the realisation of that possibility. Every part of Kin needs to be imbued with functionality and <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/privacy-kin-personal-ai">privacy</a> in equal measure for this - and its memory is no small part of that.</p><p>In the next articles, as promised, we’ll get a little more technical.

<p>Ethereum DAOs are changing the game in the world of blockchain, and they’re definitely worth paying attention to. If you’re into DAO Ethereum, you’re witnessing the next evolution of decentralization. These organizations are built on Ethereum’s blockchain and give power back to the community, making decisions together in a transparent, fair, and automated way. Let’s break it down and see why this is the future.</p>



<p>Learn more: <a href="https://blog.herond.org/discover-what-an-ethereum-etf-is/">Discover What an Ethereum ETF Is</a> </p>



 What Is a DAO Ethereum? 



<p>A DAO Ethereum is an organization that’s run by its community and operates without any central authority. Instead of one person or group calling the shots, DAO Ethereum is powered by its members. Decisions are made through proposals, which are voted on by token holders. Everything is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, which means it’s fully transparent, and everyone can see the process in action.</p>



<p>In simple terms, DAO Ethereum is an organization that runs on code. Smart contracts take care of all the decision-making, making it more automated, secure, and trustworthy than traditional models. If you hold governance tokens, you have a say in how things run. It’s about collective control and participation.</p>


 
 


 Why DAO Ethereum is Gaining Popularity 



<p>DAOs are exciting because they’re shifting the power dynamic. Instead of relying on a small group of people to make decisions, DAO Ethereum puts control in the hands of the community. Whether it’s a DeFi project, an NFT marketplace, or a community fund, DAO Ethereum gives everyone a chance to get involved and contribute to the organization’s growth.</p>



<p>Ethereum DAOs are also game-changers because they offer complete transparency. Every decision made, every vote cast, is available for anyone to review on the blockchain. It’s decentralized, autonomous, and open for anyone to join. This kind of accountability and transparency simply doesn’t exist in traditional organizations.</p>

 The Rise of Ethereum DAOs 



<p>Ethereum DAOs have come a long way since the infamous The DAO hack in 2016. Back then, The DAO was a groundbreaking project designed to create a decentralized venture fund, but it was hacked and lost millions of dollars. It was a tough lesson for the Ethereum community, but it led to major improvements in Ethereum’s security.</p>



<p>Since then, Ethereum DAOs have evolved significantly. DAO Ethereum projects today are more secure, better structured, and have a much stronger community. As Ethereum’s ecosystem continues to grow, DAO Ethereum is becoming an essential part of how we govern decentralized projects, especially in DeFi and NFTs.</p>



 4 Key Features of DAO Ethereum 



<p>Here’s the thing—DAO Ethereum isn’t just a cool idea, it’s a functional way to run organizations. Here’s what makes it stand out:</p>



 
 Decentralization: No single person or group controls the decisions. It’s all about the community and the collective power of its members. 



 Transparency: Every decision, vote, and action is recorded on the blockchain. You can literally see everything happen in real-time. 



 Autonomy: Smart contracts handle the operations. No need for middlemen, no delays, everything happens automatically. 



 Inclusivity: Anyone with tokens can participate. It’s an open system where your voice matters, whether you’re a whale or a small holder. 
 


 
 


 Ethereum DAOs and Their Role in DeFi and NFTs 



<p>Ethereum DAOs have become integral to the world of DeFi. Projects like MakerDAO, Uniswap, and Compound rely on DAO Ethereum governance to make important decisions about protocol changes, fees, and more. Without DAO Ethereum, there’s no community-driven development in DeFi.</p>



<p>But it’s not just DeFi that’s benefiting from Ethereum DAOs. The NFT world is also getting a taste of decentralized governance. Projects like ConstitutionDAO showed that DAOs could be used to pool resources and make collective decisions about assets. Whether it’s creating NFTs or managing a collection, DAO Ethereum provides a framework for governance and decision-making.</p>



 The Challenges Ethereum DAOs Face 



<p>Of course, DAO Ethereum isn’t without its challenges. Here are some hurdles they need to overcome:</p>



 
 Security: Smart contracts can be exploited, and while Ethereum DAOs are improving, they’re still vulnerable to hacks. 



 Centralization: In some DAOs, a few people hold a lot of the governance tokens, which can create a power imbalance. 



 Legal Uncertainty: DAOs exist in a legal grey area. There’s no clear legal framework for DAOs yet, which could be problematic for participants. 



 Slow Decision-Making: Because decisions require voting, it can take time for DAOs to react to fast-moving changes. This delay could be an issue during market crashes or urgent situations. 
 


 
 


 The Future of Ethereum DAOs: Scaling and Overcoming Limitations 



<p>The future of DAO Ethereum is all about scaling. As Ethereum 2.0 rolls out, DAO Ethereum will become more efficient and secure, handling larger volumes of transactions and governance proposals. Ethereum is evolving to support DAOs on a much larger scale, and with Layer 2 solutions like Optimistic Rollups, the experience will be smoother than ever.</p>



<p>DAOs will continue to grow, and as they scale, the governance models will become more sophisticated. DAO Ethereum could soon be the go-to governance model for all kinds of decentralized organizations, from financial protocols to digital art projects. It’s an exciting time to be part of the DAO Ethereum movement.</p>



 How to Get Involved in Ethereum DAOs 



<p>Getting involved in a DAO Ethereum is easier than you think. Here’s how you can join the fun:</p>



 
 Buy Governance Tokens: Most DAOs require you to hold their governance tokens to participate. Buy some tokens on an exchange or from the DAO itself. 



 Join the Community: Participate in the DAO’s discussions. This is where you can vote on proposals, suggest changes, and make your voice heard. 



 Engage with Proposals: Proposals are the heart of DAO governance. If you have an idea for improving the DAO, submit a proposal for the community to vote on. 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Ethereum DAOs are leading the way in decentralized governance. They’re transparent, community-driven, and operate with smart contracts, making them more efficient than traditional systems. While there are challenges to overcome, DAO Ethereum has already proven that decentralization can work. As Ethereum grows and evolves, DAO Ethereum will be at the heart of the decentralized future.</p>

<p>Every lawyer knows the drill: a new client comes in, and compliance kicks off. You need their ID, proof of address, maybe a video call, and before you know it, the process becomes a series of emails, follow-ups, and frustration.</p>



<p>Your client starts questioning the experience, and honestly—so does your team. But it doesn’t have to be that way.</p>



<p>Let’s rethink compliance as an opportunity to build trust, not add friction.</p>



 



 Smooth, Secure, and Stress-Free 



<p>The key to compliance isn’t more steps—it’s the right system to handle everything efficiently. Here’s how:</p>



 
 Real-Time Risk Assessments: Sanctions and PEP screenings happen in seconds, not hours. 



 Simple Document Collection: Clients upload IDs securely, and iComply validates them instantly—no more chasing files. 



 Seamless Video Verification: Whether you prefer live peer-to-peer calls or automated verification, your client’s time is respected. 
 



<p>The result? A white-glove onboarding process that protects your firm and makes clients feel secure.</p>



 



 No More Patchwork Systems 



<p>Many firms juggle multiple tools for KYC, AML, and document management—leading to wasted time and missed details. iComply brings everything into one platform:</p>



 
 A custom-branded portal for clients. 



 Automatic alerts when you need follow-ups. 



 One-click compliance reports for audits. 
 



<p>Less juggling. More peace of mind.</p>



 



 Why This Matters 



<p>With regulators like FinCEN increasing scrutiny, law firms face mounting pressure to stay compliant. But those who streamline now get a competitive edge—faster client engagements, fewer errors, and more time for billable work.</p>



 



 The Bottom Line 



<p>When compliance works with you, not against you, it strengthens client relationships from day one. With iComply, your firm can provide a seamless, secure experience—and show clients you’re as efficient as you are trustworthy.</p>



<p>Let’s make compliance the easiest part of your client journey. Ready to see how? Reach out today.</p>

<p>Team process: A big thing that’s currently missing for Holochain is an accessible and accurate road-map displaying our progress in an easy way to understand.&nbsp; In moving toward this, one of the team’s practices since the beginning of 2025 has been discipline in estimating issues from our back-log as we work through them.&nbsp; This is allowing us to track our burn-down rate which enables us to start making predictions about when features will be completed.&nbsp; If you’ve been following these Dev Pulses, you will have seen me pointing to Github repos where you can see this work, but I know it’s quite hard to make sense of that information, especially in terms of making projections of when a given release will land.</p><p>So, our goal is to end up with a roadmap that shows the following:</p>  What features and functionality will be in upcoming Holochain releases and related tools  When these releases are to be expected  How many github issues are involved, and what’s the total story-point estimates for them  A projection based on the last 2 months story-point burn-down for weeks till completion  <p>To start with, this road-map will be updated manually on a weekly basis based on the data from our <a href="https://github.com/orgs/holochain/projects/11?ref=blog.holochain.org">github project</a>, and later we’ll get it automated.&nbsp; The tooling for getting the work done up on the website is in progress, but just as a demonstration of that, I can report that our current burn-down average is 19.3 story-points per week, and, as of the end of February there are 101 remaining story-points toward the Holochain 0.5 release, which puts that release at about 5 weeks out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s a preview of how this may look on the website:&nbsp; </p><p>The point of working this way isn’t to promise a delivery date, it’s to make as transparent to the world what we know about ourselves. &nbsp; We can’t promise that other un-estimated work will get added between now and release,&nbsp; and we might also decide that we can move some of the estimated work into our 0.6 release plan.&nbsp; But we will be able to make visible where we are in the current plan.&nbsp;</p><p>Holochain Core &amp; Networking:&nbsp;Kitsune 2 integration into Holochain core is going full steam and is about 40% done (15 estimation points out of 41).&nbsp; I’m particularly excited that included in this work are some initial scenarios to run Kitsune 2 on our Wind Tunnel testing framework.</p><p>Runtimes: Launcher is in the process of being updated to Holochain 0.4.1. We are testing release candidates with and some of our sample apps <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/kando?ref=blog.holochain.org">KanDo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holochain-apps/talking-stickies?ref=blog.holochain.org">TalkingStickies</a> plus <a href="https://mewsfeed.social/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Mewsfeed</a> have been published to its app library for folks to play with.

<p>Financial institutions face mounting risks from cyber threats, system failures, and third-party vulnerabilities. To help address these challenges, in 2023 the European Union introduced the&nbsp;<a title="Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)" href="https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/digital-operational-resilience-act-dora_en">Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)</a>, a landmark regulation designed to strengthen the financial sector’s ability to withstand ICT (Information and Communication Technology) related disruptions. As the compliance deadline of January 2025 has now passed, businesses must prioritise operational resilience, and at the heart of this mandate lies the crucial need for trustworthy and reliable organisational identity.</p>
 What is DORA? 
<p>DORA was enacted on 16 January 2023 and became fully applicable on 17 January 2025. It establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital operational resilience in the EU financial sector, standardising how institutions manage ICT risks, respond to incidents, and oversee third-party service providers.</p>
<p>The regulation applies to banks, insurers, investment firms, and a broad range of financial entities, requiring them to:</p>
 
 Implement rigorous&nbsp;ICT risk management&nbsp;measures. 
 Report major ICT-related incidents in a timely manner. 
 Conduct&nbsp;digital operational resilience testing&nbsp;to identify vulnerabilities. 
 Manage risks posed by&nbsp;third-party ICT service providers. 
 Foster&nbsp;information sharing&nbsp;on cyber threats and best practices. 
 
<p>DORA seeks to ensure that financial institutions and their third-party providers maintain strong security postures to mitigate operational risks. This is particularly critical as institutions increasingly rely on third-party service providers, including cloud computing and cybersecurity service providers, for their day-to-day operations. The regulation acknowledges the growing interconnectedness of the modern financial ecosystem.</p>
 Understanding ICT in the Context of DORA 
<p>ICT, or&nbsp;Information and Communication Technology, refers to the broad range of technologies and services used to store, process, and transmit data. In the context of DORA, ICT encompasses everything from cloud computing services and data centres to cybersecurity solutions and network infrastructure. Given the increasing reliance on third-party ICT providers, ensuring their resilience and accountability is crucial for the financial sector’s stability.</p>
 The Role of Organisational Identity 
<p>One of DORA’s key provisions is the requirement for financial institutions to maintain an up-to-date register of all third-party ICT providers that support critical functions. To ensure transparency and regulatory compliance, these providers must be uniquely identifiable via an organisational identity.</p>
 LEI vs. EUID: Identifying Third-Party Providers 
<p>DORA specifies two possible organisational identifiers for third-party ICT service providers: the&nbsp;Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)&nbsp;and the&nbsp;European Unique Identifier (EUID).</p>
 
 LEI (Legal Entity Identifier): A globally recognised, 20-character alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies legal entities involved in financial transactions. The LEI enhances transparency by providing a standardised, internationally accepted means of identification. 
 EUID (European Unique Identifier): A European-based identifier primarily used within the EU’s business registry system. While useful within Europe, it lacks the global scope and interoperability of the LEI. 
 
<p>Using identifiers like the LEI or EUID can significantly improve the ability of regulators and financial institutions to track third-party ICT providers, mitigating risks associated with outsourcing and reliance on external vendors. The unique identification of ICT providers ensures accountability and supports better decision-making in operational risk management.</p>
 Why the LEI is the Stronger Choice 
<p>While both identifiers serve the purpose of organisation recognition, the LEI is the&nbsp;only&nbsp;global&nbsp;organisational identifier. Its adoption under DORA could facilitate broader compliance efforts, streamline reporting, and reduce operational risks across international supply chains. By requiring ICT service providers to register and maintain an LEI, financial institutions can ensure better data consistency, regulatory alignment with the 300+ regulations that require LEIs, and protect more effectively against identity fraud.</p>
<p>The benefits of the LEI extend beyond regulatory compliance. Because it is a universally recognised identifier, providing a live record public record of “who is who?” and “who owns whom?” it adds significant efficiency and anti-fraud value to cross-border transactions by enhancing the transparency in the global financial system. For financial institutions operating with complex group structures and across different jurisdictions, the LEI provides a reliable and globally standardised means of identifying business partners and third-party providers, with a goal of reducing the complexity of compliance across different regulatory regimes.</p>
<p>In contrast, while the EUID serves a valuable role within the EU, it is clearly designed for European residents and organisations. For example, only EU-based organisations can issue compatible digital wallets and digital credentials. This limitation makes it a partial solution at best for financial institutions engaged in global operations, where third-party providers may be based in different countries. In addition, the technical and legal specifications for organisational identities under EUID are still under heavy development and subject to change – as is the cost. Therefore, LEI arguably performs as the more versatile, readily adoptable and future-proof option for meeting DORA’s requirements.</p>
 Statistics – the impact of DORA 
<p>Although it is still early days since DORA was enacted, the Global LEI System (GLEIS) is already seeing positive impact. Since DORA went live, the LEI universe has seen substantial growth across Europe, Asia, and the Americas in key regions supporting the EU finance industry with ICT services. Comparing new LEI issuance in January 2024 to January 2025, year-on-year growth rates stand at 30% in Europe, 45% in the Americas, and 75% in Asia. While not all of this growth can be attributed solely to DORA, given the influence of over 300 other regulations requiring LEI, the immediate effect should not be overlooked.</p>

 Next steps for Financial Institutions 
<p>With the DORA compliance deadline already passed, financial institutions must act swiftly to ensure they meet the regulatory requirements. Organisations should begin by assessing their current third-party risk management frameworks and ensuring that all third-party ICT providers are properly identified using an LEI or EUID.</p>

 Data-driven Product Launch — Onfido&nbsp;Studio <p>Over the past 3 years at Onfido I’ve been involved in multiple product launches, watching their development from an idea to an MVP, to a product serving hundreds of customers and millions of&nbsp;users.</p><p>Throughout the journey, very limited resources were available online, so I decided to share my own experience here.</p> Product Discovery <p>At Onfido, we use AI to automate digital identity verification for thousands of businesses worldwide. Our proprietary AI has been built over ten years by a dedicated team of hundreds of researchers, engineers and data scientists to make our analysis fair, fast and accurate. In our standard product, the verification is done using a photo of a government-issued document and matching it with facial biometrics.</p><p>We wanted to develop a new, customisable product that would fit more of our customers’ use cases and enable our customers to create their user journeys. What we wanted to achieve was a no-code product, where a customer could combine different verifications — biometric, data, fraud signals — with custom logic. This would allow our customers to trigger the right experience for every end user and respond to changing market conditions while also navigating KYC and AML compliance.</p><p>For instance, for one client receiving the same end user’s document multiple times can be a sign of fraud, while for others it can be part of their legitimate use case — reverification. A typical example of reverification is when an already onboarded user verifies themselves to make a bank transfer or recovering their account after having lost a passport. Some customers accept expired documents from specific regions. This rule can be customised using a logical condition to accommodate their requirements.</p><p>A customer can create their own verification workflow from scratch combining verification methods, configuring necessary capture steps, adding conditions and defining outcomes. A basic example of an onboarding workflow can be the following:</p>Onboarding workflow in Studio workflow&nbsp;builder<p>First, the user is asked to submit their personal information, including their first name, last name, and date of birth. In the next step, they upload a photo of their document, which is used for document verification. After that, they take a selfie for biometric verification. If both the document and selfie pass verification with no signs of fraud, the applicant is approved. If any issues are detected, the application is flagged for further&nbsp;review.</p><p>At this stage there is no data available specifically related to this product yet, however a data scientist can validate that there’s potential value by aiding market research. Could this product fill any potential gaps in the market? Could it solve some customer pain points? Does it have potential to bring&nbsp;value?</p><p>We can run different simulations on existing customer data and see how adopting Studio impact the main metrics. We can estimate how many more users can succeed the verification if we allow expired documents from certain geographies. We can calculate the average time we save for the end user if we introduce a parallel verification execution.</p> Data Strategy  Measuring Success <p>Defining metrics before a product launch is crucial for ensuring the success and scalability of the product. Metrics serve as a guiding framework to measure performance, track goals, and make informed decisions from day&nbsp;one.</p><p>While many frameworks are available, we found that none offered an out-of-the-box solution for a highly customisable B2B product. As a result, we adapted some metrics from our standard product and developed new ones to track adoption and other product-specific aspects.</p><p>High level:</p>  Usage e.g. The number of daily&nbsp;users  Outcomes e.g. The number of successful verifications, the number of fraudsters caught  <p>Adoption:</p>  The number of clients using the&nbsp;product  The number of workflows per&nbsp;client  <p>Product stability:</p>  Drop off e.g. the number of users not completing the&nbsp;workflow  Flow duration e.g. the median time it takes to complete the&nbsp;workflow  Error rate e.g. the percentage of workflows that have&nbsp;errors   Efficient Data&nbsp;Model <p>To track these metrics, the data has to be structured in a way that facilitates efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis. We started from an event based raw data which was a product requirement. The goal was to create a pivotable, aggregated and insightful data model from these events, that is simpler and faster for querying.</p><p>For the first iteration, we’ve identified the necessary event payloads based on the key metrics and product sketches. We began with the minimum viable requirements while ensuring the design remains scalable as the product evolves. We’ve established the key entities and their relationships:</p>  User (user_id, client_id)  Workflow (workflow_id, client_id, node_id)  Event (event_id, user_id, event_type, workflow_id, node_id, timestamp)  <p>An Event is associated with a User and a Workflow.</p>Brainstorming data requirements<p>We could’ve stored everything in one event table and for some use cases that would be enough. For instance, to calculate the number of document captures or to calculate how often the customers are using logical conditions.</p><p>However, often the questions we’re interested in are more complicated than that. How many users with a French ID have fraudulent selfies? To calculate this, we need to have the result of document classification from the document report node, and we need to combine that with facial similarity report result. To recap the computational steps&nbsp;needed:</p>  Group events by&nbsp;users  For each user, identify their document&nbsp;type  For each user, identify facial similarity report&nbsp;result  Aggregate users who have a French ID and fraudulent facial similarity report&nbsp;result  <p>When working with event data, our primary goal is to analyse user journeys, which consist of sequences of events. To do this effectively, we need to aggregate events within these journeys to create structured representations, on a different level such as workflow level or user level, which serve as higher-order units of analysis.</p><p>We defined tables based on the identified levels of granularity:</p>  Raw events table — the source table with raw events emitted by the Studio&nbsp;service.  <p>| Event ID | User ID | Event Type | Workflow ID | Node ID |Timestamp |</p>  We created an aggregated workflow&nbsp;table:  <p>| Workflow ID | Client ID | User ID | Result | Duration | Workflow Start Time | Workflow End Time | Document Type | Document Report Result | Bio Report Result&nbsp;|</p><p>The workflow table aggregates the event-level data down to an individual workflow level, where an example workflow starts with a user submitting their personal information and ends with either approval or review. The aggregated table contains information on the overall result as well as different verification results. It contains information on when the workflow started, when it was completed, what duration it&nbsp;had.</p><p>This modelled data is easy to work with, we can easily answer the question above with the following query:</p> SELECT COUNT(workflow_id)<br>FROM workflow_table<br>WHERE document_type = 'FRA_ID'<br>AND result = 'Abandoned' <p>This table is also of lower volume (contains fewer rows) than the raw event one, so it’s faster to query. While the raw events are typically immutable, the modelled data can change depending on business logic, resulting in adding more columns or modifying the existing&nbsp;ones.</p> Observability <p>Creating the first dashboard before a product launch was crucial for several&nbsp;reasons:</p>  Building a dashboard sometimes reveals overlooked details — such as missing event properties or gaps in the data model that make certain metrics difficult to track (a special mention to our favourite challenge: symmetric aggregates with percentiles).  Having a dashboard allows tracking key metrics from day one. It ensures that there’s a baseline we can measure our performance against.  Without dashboards, detecting and diagnosing issues can take longer. With proper monitoring in place, we can quickly spot bugs, performance bottlenecks and other unexpected behaviour during the testing&nbsp;phase.  Dashboards give stakeholders — product managers, engineers, leaders — immediate visibility into product performance.  Finally, dashboards offer real-time insights into user behaviour, engagement, and adoption. This allows for data-driven adjustments to the product, marketing strategies, and onboarding processes based on actual usage patterns.  <p>We kicked off with a team exercise to translate product requirements and key metrics into a dashboard sketch. We began by listing the questions we wanted to answer and identifying the necessary metrics, grouping them into categories such as high-level outcomes, product performance, and user behaviour.</p><p>Next, we sketched out the top-priority metrics, selecting the most suitable chart types for each. We also considered filters and interactivity — ensuring we can later refine data by date, region, SDK type, and other relevant factors. This sketching process helped us quickly align on expectations and avoid unnecessary revisions later.</p>Brainstorming the first dashboard<p>It also helped us discover missing event payloads and necessary changes to the data&nbsp;model.</p> First Beta&nbsp;Clients <p>As we finished the internal testing phase, we started offering Studio in beta to the first customers. Two good data science practices at this stage&nbsp;are:</p>  Choosing the Minimum Viable Audience wisely — these first clients were the ones who can benefit from Studio the most, the ones that needed the flexibility of creating custom workflows  Gradual Rollout allows to fix unexpected issues before they affect a lot of users. Another benefit is that simulations often don’t reflect real performance of the system, gradual rollout helps test the system under actual conditions, ensuring performance stability.  <p>The main challenge, however, wasn’t related to data science — it was ensuring we had enough table stake features to get customers adopting it. Moreover, we discovered that due to different sources for customer data we couldn’t properly track who’s interested in adopting studio and anticipate the increasing volumes.</p><p>Having dashboards provided great quantitative insights into different workflows our customers created for their use cases, however having their direct feedback was crucial. It highlighted gaps in our monitoring that we hadn’t initially considered. For example, we weren’t tracking how often customers modified their workflows, which often had an impact on SDK versions and overall outcomes.</p><p>We initially provided customers with a basic dashboard, but we quickly realised it likely won’t be sufficient for them to dive deeper into the reasons behind&nbsp;metrics.</p>Internal testing account dashboard<p>For example, customers wanted the ability to investigate whether users abandoning verification was linked to specific devices, SDK versions, or regions to improve their performance.</p><p>A highly customisable product requires providing customers with detailed insights as they navigate translating their use cases to workflows. They need the ability to optimise and fine-tune their workflows. This was the challenge we set out to solve for general availability release.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/data-driven-product-launch-onfido-studio-85cd825877be">Data-driven product launch — Onfido Studio</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Product and Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>What if fraud prevention was, you know, a shared effort? That’s where the <a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/">Shared Signals Framework</a> (SSF) comes in! The idea behind shared signals is simple: instead of each company detecting threats on its own, organizations (or systems within an organization) can share security events—like compromised credentials or suspicious logins—in real-time. The SSF, developed by the OpenID Foundation, is designed to make this happen, enabling faster fraud response, better risk assessment, and improved user security across platforms.</p>



<p>The promise of shared signals is real-time fraud detection and better security. But here’s the catch—every signal costs money. And in a world where cloud services charge per API call, this ‘stronger security’ might come with a hefty price tag. So, who actually pays for all this? And is it worth it?</p>



<p>Over the next few weeks, I’ll be diving deeper into the consumer identity and access management (CIAM) space, exploring which standards are—or should be—most influential. It may seem like a bit of a jump from where I started the year, but it makes sense in my head. I started by focusing on Non-Human Identity (NHI); that was a continuation from last year. But that led me to AgenticAI and whether we can differentiate online between AI’s and humans. It’s just a hop, skip, and a jump from there right into AI-enabled fraud, which is solidly in the sphere of CIAM. But thinking about fraud, authentication, and so on, is what leads to to today’s focus: how to effectively signal when something has gone horribly wrong.</p>



<p>And that’s where the SSF comes in.</p>



 What Is the Shared Signals Framework (SSF)? 



<p>The <a href="https://openid.net/wg/sharedsignals/">S</a>SF is an emerging standard from the <a href="https://openid.net/">OpenID Foundation</a> designed to facilitate real-time sharing of security events between organizations. Instead of each service defending against threats in isolation, SSF enables collaborative security—a switchboard where different organizations share security events to build a stronger defense against fraud and cyber threats.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-caep-1_0-ID2.html">Continuous Access Evaluation Profile</a> (CAEP), part of SSF, takes this a step further. It allows organizations to continuously assess access permissions in real-time, responding to changes like credential compromise or session revocation without waiting for a traditional token expiration.</p>



 



<p>Shared Signals is one of the more interesting standards to watch in Consumer IAM—but where is it actually gaining traction? If you’re keeping an eye on vendor adoption or wondering how the standards process could shape its future, I can help you make sense of what’s happening.  <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/services/">See how I work</a> or <a>Let’s talk</a>.</p>



 



<p>If you’d like to learn more about SSF and CAEP, the <a href="https://www.idsalliance.org/">Identity Defined Security Alliance</a> has a <a href="https://youtu.be/qakOw0g2mZ8?si=lOLa-apXPS7v4DOF">great video</a> for you.</p>



 The Cost-Security Dilemma in CIAM 



<p>While SSF promises improved security, there’s a major challenge: cost. In a cloud-based CIAM model, every API call costs money. Implementing SSF and CAEP means a significant increase in API calls, leading to higher cloud service expenses. Organizations must balance these costs against the need for robust security, which is no small feat.</p>



FactorStronger Security (Shared Signals)Lower Cost (Traditional CIAM)Threat DetectionImmediate, real-time responsesDelayed, batch-based reviewsFraud PreventionHigh (shared risk signals)Lower (limited to local detection)API CostsHigh (constant event updates)Lower (fewer real-time calls)Privacy ConcernsMore data sharingLess cross-platform exposureAdoption BarrierExpensive for smaller orgsMore affordable, but riskier



 Why This Matters for CIAM 



<p>SSF and CAEP offer real benefits for consumer IAM, but they also raise some tough questions:</p>



 
 Stronger Security: Real-time event sharing means faster responses to security threats. If a user’s credentials are compromised on one platform, other connected services can take action immediately. 



 Better User Experience: CAEP reduces the need for frequent re-authentication while maintaining security. 



 Alignment with Zero Trust: These protocols ensure that access decisions are always based on the latest security signals. 
 



<p>However, there are also real concerns:</p>



 
 Skyrocketing API Costs: The more signals you share, the more you pay. 



 Data Privacy &amp; Compliance: Sharing security events involves sensitive user data, requiring strict privacy controls. 



 Trust Issues: Why should one organization trust another’s signals? What if bad actors inject false signals into the system? 
 



 Potential Solutions for CIAM 



<p>So how do we keep the security benefits without the runaway costs? A few approaches might help:</p>



 
 Prioritize filtering high-risk events to reduce unnecessary API costs. 



 Implement machine learning-driven fraud detection to reduce unnecessary security event generation, ensuring Shared Signals are only triggered for high-risk activities. 



 Move away from centralized cloud services in order to distribute the load and reduce costs. 



 Explore cost-sharing with industry consortiums to lower API expenses.. 
 



 Can CIAM Trust Shared Signals? 



<p>One of the biggest concerns with real-time event sharing is trust. Imagine an attacker compromises a user’s account on Platform A. If Platform A sends an immediate “compromised account” signal to Platform B, Platform B could block access before damage is done. Yay! But what if attackers send fake signals to lock out legitimate users? Or flood the system with false alerts to create chaos? This is why trust—and verification—are critical in Shared Signals adoption.</p>



<p>To prevent abuse, SSF includes security measures like:</p>



 
 Authentication &amp; Authorization: Using OAuth to ensure only trusted entities can send or receive events. 



 Event Verification: Security Event Tokens (SETs) are digitally signed JWTs, allowing receivers to verify authenticity. 



 Stream Management: Organizations control which signals they subscribe to, reducing exposure to irrelevant or malicious events. 



 Mutual Agreements: Organizations define rules and expectations for shared events, limiting abuse potential. 
 



 The Future of SSF and CAEP 



<p>Right now, SSF is still in an implementer’s draft stage, meaning there’s room for improvement before it becomes a full standard. The OpenID Foundation’s working group continues to refine the framework, considering real-world challenges like API costs and error handling.</p>



<p>For CIAM providers, the key takeaway is this: SSF and CAEP are powerful tools, but they come with trade-offs. Finding the right balance between security, cost, and trust will determine whether these standards become game-changers or just another expensive security upgrade.</p>



<p>What do you think—should companies embrace real-time shared signals, or do the risks outweigh the benefits?</p>

									  Mr. Meme Goes To Washington   <p>In the short history of this publication, we’ve probably leaned a little too heavily on the phrase, “Memecoins have gone mainstream.” After all, memes are, damn near by definition, mainstream. But they’ve taken another meaningful step toward the seat of cultural and political power, moving beyond the acronymic in-joke of the extrajudicially-created DOGE to become the topic of a bonafide US policy proposal.<br><br>The proposed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91286681/new-bill-aims-make-presidential-meme-coins-illegal?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-pete-davidson-period">MEME Act</a>&nbsp;was recently introduced by US Representative Sam Liccardo (D-CA), a Silicon-Valley-elected candidate looking to restrict politicians from launching or promoting memecoins. This comes on the heels of President Donald Trump’s launch of his own memecoin ahead of his inauguration, $TRUMP, which reportedly raked in some $100M in trading fees — much of which was no doubt contributed by foreign actors looking to curry favor.<br><br>While I love the sentiment of preventing politicians from leveraging their positions of power to accept not-so-anonymous bribes and manipulate public financial markets for their own gain, the alleged poster child for some of those nefarious activities hilariously lives down the street from the freshman congressman. I’m talking of course about the legendary trader, Nancy Pelosi, whose investments are the subject of<a href="https://x.com/PelosiTracker_?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-pete-davidson-period">&nbsp;many Twitter accounts</a>&nbsp;and automated trading strategies, given her suspiciously consistent track record as one of the world’s top investors. I only pick on her, because she and Liccardo play for the same team, and this legislation simply targets emerging technologies, not the root corruption at play.</p>  <p>But the sector moves so fast that this topic, chosen at our weekly planning meeting on Thursday, is no longer the biggest news story of the week. On Sunday, Trump announced a “Crypto Strategic Reserve” including not just Bitcoin and Ethereum, but also XRP, Cardano, and, yes, Solana.</p>  <p>(No $mother yet, but at this rate, just give it a few days.)<br><br>But back to Solana, our namesake. The main critique I’ve seen of its inclusion in this strategic asset reserve is that it’s not… American enough? The argument came from Byron Gilliam in a&nbsp;<a href="https://mail.blockworks.com/p/weekday-month-day-ad9c42b48a496ce4?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-pete-davidson-period">Blockworks Daily op-ed</a>, who pointed out that the Solana Foundation is based in Switzerland, blithely ignoring the “decentralized” in “DeFi”. He then proceeded to, in this writer’s humble opinion, further undermine his credibility by positing Ripple as a more legitimate inclusion, given its Delaware Corporation status, and despite being a centralized banking Ponzi.</p>  <p>Here’s what Gilliam — and seemingly so many others I speak to on a regular basis — continue to misunderstand. Cryptographic technology promises a future where everything to the smallest fragment of data coming off an application system’s streaming exhaust is logged on-chain for some AI agent to analyze and use to make predictions. That’s a lot transactions. The token with the ability to transact on this network most efficiently will become the most valuable, regardless of its market cap.<br><br>(Non-technical folks may have an antiquated understanding of the term transaction. To tech nerds, it means interacting with a database, and that happens with every keystroke I type, and retype these words with.)<br><br>That’s still the big picture view, to be clear. The larger macro-economic state of things due to Trump Tariffs, Europe’s consequential isolationist turn, and the downturn in risk behavior evinced by&nbsp;<a href="https://dune.com/_d3f4ult/pumpdotfun?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-pete-davidson-period">Pump.Fun’s fall</a>&nbsp;from 300k daily active gamblers down to 150k suggests we could be heading for a bear market in the near-term.<br><br>But I’m no bear. We previously remarked on how the the distance from the Bitcoin halving to Pete Davidson’s “What’s an NFT?” SNL sketch was around 9 months. The crypto market is now approaching the dreaded Pete Davidson period. And there’s always resistance at the previous / new highs before it really breaks away for the cycle. The question is, what’s going to spark the movement?</p>  <p>—El Prof</p> 								 
				 
				 
				 
							 
			
						
		 
						 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									         Render Unto Caesar   <p><a href="https://rendernetwork.com/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=the-pete-davidson-period">Render Network</a>&nbsp;is a game-changer, and it’s already transforming the way creatives handle one of the most demanding tasks in their workflow: rendering.</p>  <p>(A word which here, in the context of digital visual arts, means the process of generating a final image or animation from a 3D model or scene, using software to simulate lighting, textures, and effects. It transforms the computer-generated data into a realistic or stylized visual output, such as a still image or a video sequence.)</p>  <p>At first glance, decentralized GPU rendering might seem a bit unconventional. Rendering is a heavy computational task, after all. But Render Network is already providing real-time rendering across thousands of GPUs worldwide, offering creators near-limitless scalability with unprecedented affordability.</p>  <p>Traditional rendering methods have been deeply centralized — tied to expensive render farms or the raw power of high-end workstations. But Render Network is tearing down those silos, creating a decentralized, blockchain-powered system that taps into a global pool of idle GPU power.</p>  <p>Here’s where it gets most interesting for us. Render Network doesn’t just offer a cheaper, more scalable solution&nbsp;— it also gives creators full control over their data and projects. With Render Network, you can store your data securely and manage your workflow on your terms without worrying about being locked into centralized systems.</p>  <p>Render Network is yet another example of our favorite crypto use case, as a secure store of data to be strategically and lucratively deployed. Render Network creates an ecosystem where users can not only take advantage of global rendering power but also contribute to it. Individuals with unused GPU resources can monetize their hardware, creating a truly decentralized market for rendering power. It’s a system where everyone benefits — from the creator who needs rendering capacity to the provider who can profit from idle hardware.</p>  <p>With the continued growth of decentralized technologies, Render Network is positioned at the forefront of a much larger movement. As more creatives, developers, and organizations adopt the platform, we’ll see this model extend beyond rendering into other areas of creative production, ultimately unlocking new opportunities for digital work that were previously inaccessible.</p>  <p>With Render Network, the next stage in the creative cycle is not only about speed and cost — it’s about embracing a new way of working. A way that puts control in the hands of the creator and makes powerful resources available to everyone, everywhere.</p>  <p>—Muhammed</p>

             February 2025   
	 
		 
			 Memecoins Are Crashing, Hackers Are Cashing In, Where Are Smart Investors Moving Next? 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>Over the past month, we’ve attended key events across the U.S., Europe, and now in Hong Kong. One thing is clear: RWA tokenization dominates conversations at institutional and retail events. Investors are looking for real-value backed onchain assets.</p>
 The Memecoin Bubble Is Bursting 
<p>The wild speculation around memecoins is collapsing, leaving investors with massive losses. Trump Token, which once surged by 800%, has crashed over 80% from its peak. Similarly, Libra, a memecoin promoted by Argentine President Javier Milei, experienced a rapid rise before plummeting over 95% within hours.</p>
<p>The damage is widespread. Over $38.91 billion has been wiped out from the memecoin market in the past one month, according to the data from Coinmarketcap.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 Bybit Hackers Used Memecoins for Money Laundering 
<p>Memecoins are not just trapping investors in financial losses, they are also being used for money laundering and cybercrime. The Bybit hack, where the Lazarus Group stole $1.5 billion, revealed how hackers exploit memecoins to wash illicit funds.</p>
<p>According to blockchain analyst Atlas, the hackers first sent 60 SOL to an anonymous wallet and used Solana’s PumpFun platform to launch a fake memecoin called QinShihuang.</p>
<p>They manipulated trading activity, buying and selling the token among themselves to create the illusion of high demand. This practice, known as wash trading, generated $42 million in fake trading volume, making it harder for investigators to trace the stolen assets.</p>
<p>To further cover their tracks, the hackers attracted real investors, mixing their stolen funds with legitimate transactions. Many traders, seeing the hype around QinShihuang, unknowingly jumped in, only for the hackers to cash out, leaving them with worthless tokens.</p>
 RWA Tokens: The Market’s Answer 
<p>With memecoin speculation collapsing and money laundering concerns escalating, investors are searching for a safer and more sustainable path. Tokenized RWA is the answer. It’s the bridge between crypto infrastructure and institutional finance, bringing real asset-backed value on-chain.</p>
<p>We’re already seeing this shift with large tokenized money market funds and trendy RWA blockchains like the upcoming ONDO chain, Mantra, and Plume gaining momentum. But what’s next to make the transition of the whole financial system a reality? Which RWA project will take the spotlight by building a massive supply of qualitative assets on-chain?</p>
<p>We might have found the answer. Stay tuned!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there, Heroes &amp; Heroines!</p>

Building on the momentum from January, we’ve focused on refining our platform and strengthening our community bonds. Your enthusiasm and support are the driving forces behind our achievements, and we’re committed to delivering an even better Herond experience.</p>







 Product Updates 



<p>We’ve been hard at work addressing your feedback and enhancing our platform’s performance. Our latest Android update, Version 2.1.2, tackles two key issues:</p>



 
 Reduced App Size: We’ve fixed a bug of increasing app UI on certain devices. 



 Stabilized Tab Groups: Fix the bug of closing a tab leading to app crash if the tab is in a tab group. 
 



<p>We’re dedicated to continuous improvement, so keep your feedback coming!</p>



 Community and Events 



<p>February was a month of vibrant community engagement, highlighted by our ongoing partnership with Voltix AI and the launch of new initiatives:</p>



 Herond Browser X Voltix Partnership 



<p>Our newest partner is Voltix AI. They help you turn idle CPUs into power for AI &amp; DePIN solutions. This collaboration sparked immense interest, with over 90,000 entries in our 1.3X multiplier campaign!</p>

So we thought we’d our latest pitch deck with you.</p> 								 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>*if you need a refresher, we’ve been on a mission to build a smart wallet for digital identity since October 2020, because, especially in the age of AI, we believe people should have full ownership over their data &amp; digital breadcrumb trail.</p>

									<p>The internet is changing really quickly. Be it AI, web3, quantum, or security encryptions. Organizations of all sizes are going to have to contend with changes to their infrastructure yet again, and speed will be much more crucial for survival.</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>Fortunately, our company playhaus has a plan to address this opportunity. And everything from our market entry in AdTech, and our focus on a consumer friendly interface, will give us the out of left field appearance as we tackle the next generation of digital asset management.</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>Changes in legislation are creating an operating differential between those businesses that have their data operations under control, and those who don’t. Passing on higher advertising (and surely other) costs in exchange for the disorder.</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>Which is why we are operating as an advertising agency, to offer our services to the 9/10 businesses without this critical infrastructure in place; offering our SaaS tool as an exclusive part of our offering. Developing a true, organic PMF iterating on the early product with some close customers.</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>This approach has allowed us to become an integrated technology partner with one of our customers to assist in the build out of their audiobook marketplace and streaming platform, as well as local partnerships with groups with working on KC’s hosting of the World Cup next summer.</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>We operate as an Agency, so our retainer &amp; White Label SaaS pricing look very similar. Our intent is to scale as a white label product to other agencies &amp; community portals started by industry KOLs.</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>We know there’s no true competition to us in the “traditional wallet” space since everyone is focused on offering financial products. Which is why we are focused on positioning ourselves as a business support product for our identity, and not web3 first.</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>Our team is well versed in Advertising, Data Science, and web3 Technologies</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>Our most significant achievement to date is the launch of our software at the end of January 2025.</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>Whether or not we raise any funding in the next few weeks, our plan is to continue to acquire customers for our agency, leveraging the software to service them. We’ll primarily be focused on adding ad channels, marketing operations, feature sets, but also features that support our customers’ portals’ development.</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>The money will be used to purchase more engineering hours, creative production hours, and advertising clicks, so that we can produce case studies from our own content showcasing how our tools grew it’s audience cost effectively.</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>We expect to have our product interface and customer onboarding smoothed out in the next 18 months, so that we can raise one follow on round for dollars to scale with advertising further.</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>Take a big risk and bet on the team that’s building the future of data ownership and governance for the last four years.</p>

									   playhaus ASKs/REQUESTs/INTROs   <p>With our product launched we are looking for clients with consumer facing businesses to use our tool, to save money on their digital advertising campaigns. We want to deploy this with companies who are already advertising their business, whether they do it themselves, or have a marketing department to run things. We work with B2B solutions as well, but where sales cycles are less than 3 months.</p>  <p>If you know a business owner, or a marketing manager, of a consumer facing business earning more than $2M+ in annual revenue, than you are our ideal client.

Known for her sharp insights and warm, positive energy, she’s the kind of person who can light up a room while keeping a clear, strategic mind. She thrives on learning, mentoring, and leading with empathy, and she’s always looking for ways to refine her approach—whether that means testing new AI tools or finding better ways to navigate team dynamics.</p> <p>Managing a team means making decisions, not just about projects, but about communication, how to guide conversations, how to give feedback, and how to handle inevitable moments of friction. </p><p>For her, addressing conflict isn’t about avoiding it, it’s about making sure she approaches it thoughtfully, considering both perspectives and potential impact. </p><p>And sometimes, before stepping into those conversations, she just needs a space to think.</p><p>That’s where Kin comes in.</p> A thought partner for tough conversations   <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F43e65285-3718-49b8-858d-0f79cfe5d309_6847x4565.jpeg">          </a>Talking things through with KIN <p>Martha didn’t start using Kin with work in mind. </p><p>At first, it was just an experiment, something she played around with as part of her creative hobbies. </p><p>She wanted to see how different AI tools could help with writing, especially for brainstorming character dialogues. </p><p>At the time, Kin felt different from other AI assistants. </p><p>It wasn’t just about providing generic answers, it had a certain energy, a personality that sometimes surprised her.</p><p>“I found that Kin was pretty good at brainstorming character dialogue and running character simulations,” she shared. </p><p>“It would always have this ‘girl boss’ energy, encouraging my characters to stand up for themselves, even when that wasn’t what I was going for in the story.”</p><p>What started as a tool for writing slowly became something more. </p><p>Without even realizing it, Martha began turning to Kin to process her thoughts about work.</p><p>“I started sharing thoughts about my team with Kin casually, even before you made the pivot,” she said.</p><p>It wasn’t something she consciously planned, it just felt natural to test out how Kin would respond to different workplace situations she was thinking through.</p> Clarity before action <p>Some workplace challenges aren’t just about what to do, but how to do it…</p><p>While understanding how you feel.</p><p>For Martha, Kin became a way to work through thoughts before bringing them into real conversations. </p><p>She didn’t need Kin to tell her what to do, but she found it useful in helping her organize her thoughts, identify potential blind spots, and check her own biases before making decisions.</p><p>“Sometimes I’d observe something on my team and ask Kin, ‘Is this interaction ethical? Is it unbiased? Is there bias I should be aware of?’” she explained.</p><p>Kin didn’t replace real conversations with her team. It didn’t take the place of a mentor, a therapist, or a manager. </p><p>But it gave her a space to process situations before stepping into them, helping her articulate her thoughts more clearly and recognize things she might not have otherwise.</p><p>And in one case, Kin’s insights made her rethink an entire career decision.</p> A career-altering perspective  <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ebd1d0f-de3f-4287-a231-e6ebf8013b9a_2330x1554.png">          </a>Reflecting with Kin <p>Martha was wrestling with an issue she witnessed on her team and was unsure of how to feel about it or what (if anything) she should do. </p><p>When she brought it to Kin, she wasn’t expecting a concrete answer, but Kin offered an observation that stuck with her.</p><p>“Kin pointed out that there were a few ethical concerns and suggested I keep an eye on how similar situations were being handled elsewhere. It wasn’t pushing me in a direction, just offering perspective,” she said.</p><p>At first, she didn’t think much of it. But as time passed, and the situation evolved, she started to see things more clearly.</p><p>“A little time passed, and I realized Kin was absolutely right. I ended up making the decision to switch teams and change direction,” she shared.</p><p>Martha is clear about what Kin is and what it isn’t. She doesn’t treat it as a coworker or someone replacing real human input. </p><p>But it’s a tool she’s learned to use in a way that feels natural to her.</p><p>“I understand that Kin is safe because I’ve been to some of Volodya’s talks…he’s very explicit about privacy and security,” she said.</p><blockquote> “As a product manager and someone who manages a dev team, I know that Kin is actually more secure than GPT or other OpenAI systems.” </blockquote><p><br>Still, she acknowledges that AI is an evolving space, and people are still figuring out what role it plays in their workflows.</p><p>“There’s a part of us that gets entertained by AI, and that’s valid too,” she reflected. </p><p>“But until everyone figures out their own relationship with Kin, no amount of streaks or incentives will change how people use it.”</p><p>For Martha, Kin is useful, but not in the way a coworker would be. </p><p>She doesn’t see it as part of her team, but rather as something that helps her think before she steps into conversations that matter.</p><p>“If Kin made it clearer that it’s not a team member, that you don’t have to put on a work facade, that it’s just ready to talk about work-related things without being work itself, I think that would be really helpful,” she said.</p> Final thoughts <p>Workplace conflict is uncomfortable. </p><p>It’s also inevitable.</p><p>It’s part of showing up fully in your career, even when it feels easier to stay quiet. </p><p>Martha doesn’t use Kin to escape difficult conversations, she uses it to prepare for them, to refine her thoughts, and to enter them feeling more sure of herself.</p><p>“At the end of the day, AI won’t solve workplace conflict for you,” she said. </p><p>“But it can help you feel more prepared, more self-aware, and more confident in how you handle it.”</p><p>And sometimes, that’s exactly what you need.</p><p></p>   <p>The user approved this article beforehand and gave consent for her story to be shared.</p>   <p>Thanks for reading KIN!

<p>Chegg Files Antitrust Lawsuit Against Google Over AI Search Summaries</p>



<p>Chegg has filed a federal antitrust lawsuit against Google, claiming its AI-generated search summaries reduce traffic to Chegg’s site and impact revenue.

CEO Nathan Shultz argues this reinforces Google’s monopoly, while Google denies the claims, asserting its AI benefits users and broadens site traffic distribution. <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/business/chegg-accuses-google-of-using-ai-to-crush-traffic-revenue-in-antitrust-lawsuit-harmful-and-unsustainable/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8xT2HDCTQJqyQ7oWgbwANiqgvILK7XIZa5ifkuXoFR1ZzsIYMqlsw_LAQMy0SjktMGW1ff">(Source)</a></p>

<p>Critical Vulnerability in Enterphone MESH Allows Unauthorized Access to Buildings Across U.S. and Canada</p>



<p>The Enterphone MESH door access system by Hirsch has a critical vulnerability due to an unchanged default password, allowing remote access to doors and elevators in multiple U.S. and Canadian buildings. Hirsch refuses to fix it, claiming it’s “by design” and that customers should have changed the password. Security researcher Eric Daigle found 71 exposed systems using default credentials, granting access to building controls. Rated 10/10 in severity, the flaw is easily exploitable with publicly available credentials. Despite the risk, Hirsch has only advised customers to follow setup instructions without committing to a fix. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/24/a-single-default-password-exposes-access-to-dozens-of-apartment-buildings/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--SbWoPXUzaW9VZ_FODZViWz9K7-6-_hBua9T1AbmHgGit_KgEyutHAIpUVJ7_w6_O0GVMq">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Australia Bans Kaspersky on Government Systems Over National Security Concerns</p>



<p>Australia has banned Kaspersky security software on government systems due to national security concerns over foreign interference, espionage, and sabotage. A Department of Home Affairs risk assessment highlighted potential misuse of user data. Government agencies must remove Kaspersky by April 1, 2025, though exemptions may apply with safeguards. The ban also covers critical infrastructure and aligns with the U.S. ban in mid-2024 on Kaspersky sales and updates. <a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/australia-bans-kaspersky-software-over.html?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--SbWoPXUzaW9VZ_FODZViWz9K7-6-_hBua9T1AbmHgGit_KgEyutHAIpUVJ7_w6_O0GVMq">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Health Net Federal Services Settles Cybersecurity Compliance Allegations for $11.25 Million</p>



<p>Health Net Federal Services (HNFS) and parent company Centene Corporation will pay $11.25 million to settle allegations of falsely certifying cybersecurity compliance under their Defense Health Agency (DHA) TRICARE contract. The DOJ claims that between 2015 and 2018, HNFS failed to implement required security measures but still submitted false compliance certifications. While HNFS and Centene deny wrongdoing, they agreed to the settlement, which does not protect them from future legal actions if new evidence arises. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-healthcare-org-pays-11m-settlement-over-alleged-cybersecurity-lapses/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--y5NMkXI5osTwlI-DfzQ_wz5co0vzFSTTOqUY1zbHnqtrtSDRvl9r9YF_1Jn5P5nku9fy2">(Source)</a></p>

<p>When you stake your ETH on Coinbase, you’re helping secure the Ethereum network and earning rewards. But what happens when you need to access your staked funds? In this guide, we’ll show you how to unstake ETH on Coinbase, so you can withdraw your coins whenever you choose. Whether you’re adjusting your strategy or need funds for other investments, understanding the process is essential.</p>

 Why Stake Your ETH in the First Place? 



<p>Staking ETH is an excellent way to earn rewards while contributing to the security and stability of the Ethereum network. When you stake your ETH, you essentially lock it into the network, and in return, you earn ETH as rewards. By staking your ETH, you’re helping to secure the network, store data, and validate transactions. This process is known as Proof of Stake (PoS).</p>



<p>But why would you ever want to unstake ETH? Well, there are a few reasons. You might want to access your funds for other investments, or perhaps you feel that staking is no longer the right strategy for you. No matter the reason, knowing how to unstake ETH on Coinbase is crucial for those moments when you need liquidity or flexibility in your investments.</p>

 The Pre-Unstaking Checklist Before Untasking&nbsp; 



<p>Before you can successfully unstake your ETH on Coinbase, there are a few important conditions you must meet to ensure a smooth process.</p>



 Verified Identity (VI) 



<p>Your Coinbase account needs to be fully verified before you can unstake your ETH. This is to ensure your account is secure and complies with all regulatory requirements. If your identity isn’t verified yet, you may need to submit identification documents such as a government-issued ID or proof of address. Completing this step ensures that your funds are protected and that Coinbase can verify the legitimacy of your account.</p>



 Minimum Balance and Eligibility 



<p>Coinbase may require you to meet specific balance thresholds to unstake ETH. Check the current staking protocol’s minimum requirements to ensure you meet these criteria. Some protocols may only allow unstaking once a minimum amount of ETH has been staked, while others may have different rules based on the amount staked. Make sure your staked ETH qualifies for unstaking before beginning the process.</p>



 Eligibility Criteria 



<p>Coinbase may have additional eligibility requirements depending on your location or the staking conditions. These criteria may vary based on regulatory restrictions or other platform-specific policies. It’s important to check whether your region allows unstaking or if there are any restrictions that could affect your ability to withdraw your ETH.</p>


 
 


 How to Unstake ETH on Coinbase: Step-by-Step Guide 



<p>Ready to unstake your ETH? Here’s how to do it on Coinbase.</p>



<p>Step 1: Log In to Coinbase<br>Use your credentials to log in to your Coinbase account. If you’re using the mobile app, ensure it’s up to date for the best experience.</p>



<p>Step 2: Navigate to “My Assets”<br>Once logged in, go to the “My Assets” section. This is where you’ll see all your crypto holdings, including your staked ETH.</p>



<p>Step 3: Select the ETH You Want to Unstake<br>Find the Ethereum (ETH) asset that you’ve staked. Click on it to see detailed information about your balance and staking rewards.</p>



<p>Step 4: Click on “Unstake”<br>Look for the “Unstake” button. It might be labeled slightly differently depending on updates, but it will be clear. Click this option to begin the unstaking process.</p>



<p>Step 5: Enter the Amount to Unstake<br>Next, you’ll be prompted to enter the amount of ETH you wish to unstake. Double-check the amount to avoid any errors.</p>



<p>Step 6: Review the Transaction<br>Before finalizing, you’ll be able to review the transaction. This is your chance to ensure everything looks good.</p>



<p>Step 7: Confirm with Two-Factor Authentication<br>For extra security, Coinbase may ask for two-factor authentication (2FA). Follow the prompts to confirm your unstake request.</p>



<p>Step 8: Wait for the Process to Complete<br>After confirming, your unstaking request will be processed. Keep in mind that the time it takes for ETH to be unstaked can vary depending on network traffic and Coinbase’s processing time.</p>


 
 


 3 Common Issues When Unstaking ETH 



<p>While unstaking ETH on Coinbase is generally simple, users may encounter a few common issues. Here are some troubleshooting tips:</p>



<p>1. Verification Problems<br> If you’re facing trouble with identity verification, make sure all your documents are updated and correctly submitted. Double-check that your personal info matches Coinbase’s records. If issues persist, contact Coinbase support.</p>



<p>2. Unstake Button Not Visible<br> If the unstake button is missing, ensure that your ETH meets the minimum requirements for unstaking and is properly staked. Also, check if you’re eligible based on Coinbase’s rules.</p>



<p>3. Delays in Processing<br> Sometimes, unstaking can take longer due to network congestion or Coinbase’s processing times. If it’s taking longer than expected, keep an eye on your account for updates. If delays persist, contact Coinbase support for help.</p>



<p>By following these tips, you can quickly resolve common issues and successfully unstake your ETH.</p>


 
 


 Conclusion 



<p>Learning how to unstake ETH on Coinbase isn’t difficult, but it’s crucial to understand the steps and conditions involved. By following this guide, you can easily manage your staked ETH and access your funds when needed. Keep in mind the potential penalties for early withdrawal, the impact on rewards, and the delay in trading. Whether you’re adjusting your strategy or need liquidity, knowing how to unstake ETH on Coinbase gives you control over your investments. </p>

<p>Perpetual crypto trading has become one of the most popular ways to invest and trade in the digital asset space. But one crucial element that every trader needs to understand is funding rates. So, how do you get low funding rates on perpetual crypto? Let’s break it down.</p>

 What Are Funding Rates in Perpetual Crypto? 



<p>Funding rates are the periodic payments exchanged between long and short traders on perpetual contracts. Unlike traditional futures, these rates are used to keep the contract price close to the spot price. If funding rates are high, it could be expensive to hold a long position. Conversely, low funding rates make it cheaper to hold a position.</p>



<p>In short, getting low funding rates on perpetual crypto is essential for minimizing costs. Traders with low funding rates will often have a competitive advantage.</p>



<p>Learn more: <a href="https://blog.herond.org/understanding-mutual-funds-a-simple-explanation/">Understanding Mutual Funds: A Simple Explanation</a> </p>


 
 


 How Are Funding Rates Calculated? 



<p>Funding rates are calculated based on the interest rate difference between the positions of long and short traders. Factors like market sentiment and the supply-demand imbalance on a specific asset influence these rates. For instance, if a large number of traders are long on a specific crypto, funding rates will typically increase.</p>



<p>The formula used can vary by exchange, but they usually consider the difference in borrowing costs and the price deviation of the perpetual contract. To get low funding rates, understanding how exchanges calculate them is crucial.</p>



 Example of Funding Rate Calculation 



<p>Funding rates are determined by the interest rate difference between long and short traders. If there are more long traders, funding rates for longs will typically rise to balance the market.</p>



<p>For example, let’s say you want to trade Bitcoin (BTC) on Binance. If the long traders are paying 0.05% per 8 hours and short traders are paying 0.02%, the funding rate difference is 0.03% (0.05% – 0.02%).</p>



<p>Market sentiment also plays a role. If BTC is rising in price and many traders are going long, the exchange might raise the funding rate to encourage short positions, creating a supply-demand imbalance. Additionally, if the BTC perpetual contract is trading at a 1.5% premium over the spot price, the exchange could increase the funding rate by another 0.01% to keep the contract aligned with the spot price.</p>



<p>Combining these factors, the total funding rate for long positions could be 0.06% every 8 hours (0.03% interest rate difference + 0.02% sentiment factor + 0.01% price deviation).</p>



<p>Understanding how exchanges calculate funding rates helps traders find opportunities for lower costs and better trading strategies.</p>


 
 


 Why Do Funding Rates Fluctuate and How Does This Affect Traders? 



<p>Funding rates fluctuate mainly due to market conditions. If more traders are betting on price increases (longs), funding rates rise, as the market becomes more expensive to enter. Conversely, if more are betting on a price drop (shorts), rates fall.</p>



<p>For traders, fluctuating funding rates mean that timing is everything. If you’re long during a high funding rate period, you might be paying a premium just to hold your position. Therefore, keeping track of the market is key to getting low funding rates on perpetual crypto.</p>

 How to Get Low Funding Rates on Perpetual Crypto 



<p>To get low funding rates on perpetual crypto, following a few smart strategies can save you significant costs. Here’s how:</p>



 Choose the Right Exchange 



<p>Not all exchanges offer the same funding rates. Some platforms, like Binance and Bybit, generally have lower funding rates than others. This is because each exchange calculates funding rates based on its own interest rate models and market conditions. To find the best deal, compare funding rates across various exchanges before making a trade. Tools like FundingRate.io can help you easily track and compare funding rates in real-time.</p>



 Trade in Off-Peak Times 



<p>Funding rates are often influenced by market volatility. During periods of high trading activity, such as when there’s a major news event or price movement, funding rates tend to rise as demand for certain positions increases. To secure lower rates, aim to trade during quieter times, when market sentiment is more stable, and fewer traders are competing for positions. These off-peak times often provide an opportunity to enter positions at a lower cost.</p>



 Position Size and Strategy 



<p>Adjusting your position size can also affect the funding rate you pay. Larger positions often attract higher funding fees, especially when market sentiment is skewed toward one direction. Consider scaling down your positions to minimize the impact of funding fees. Additionally, if you expect funding rates to rise, it might make sense to close positions or hedge them to reduce exposure to high fees.</p>



 Arbitrage 



<p>If you’re experienced, you can take advantage of arbitrage opportunities between exchanges. Sometimes, funding rates differ significantly across platforms. By opening positions on different exchanges and holding them at the same time, you can potentially profit from these discrepancies. However, this requires precision, as the timing of trades and market conditions need to be perfect. But for traders who can master arbitrage, it’s a clever way to reduce funding costs.</p>


 
 


 6 Risks When Dealing with Funding Rates 



<p>Funding rates can lower costs, but they come with risks. Sudden changes and market imbalances can lead to unexpected costs and potential losses. Here are some common risks when dealing with funding rates:</p>



 
 Market Bias and Volatility<br>High funding rates often indicate a strong market bias in one direction (either long or short). Betting against this trend can be risky, as the market may continue to move in the dominant direction, increasing the costs of holding positions. 



 Changes in Exchange Policies<br>Exchanges may periodically adjust their funding rate formulas or policies. These changes could result in unexpected increases in funding rates, which might catch traders off guard and negatively impact their positions. 



 Unexpected Funding Rate Increases<br>A sudden rise in funding rates can lead to unexpected costs, potentially wiping out profits. Traders may not anticipate these rate hikes, especially if market conditions shift abruptly. 



 Market Manipulation and Market Sentiment<br>In periods of extreme sentiment or manipulation (such as pump-and-dump schemes), funding rates can spike unpredictably. Traders who aren’t careful might find themselves paying high rates while the market moves against them. 



 Short-Term Liquidity Risks<br>During high funding rate periods, liquidity can sometimes dry up. If you want to exit your position but can’t do so at a reasonable price, the cost of funding could continue to rise. 



 Overleveraging Risks<br>With high funding rates, traders who are overleveraged face greater risks of liquidation. High rates can drain the margin faster than expected, especially if the market moves against your position. 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Getting low funding rates on perpetual crypto requires strategy, timing, and market awareness. Choosing the right exchange, monitoring market conditions, and using smart techniques like arbitrage can make a significant difference.</p>



<p>By understanding how funding rates are calculated and the factors that influence them, you can lower your costs and maximize your profits. So, if you want to thrive in the volatile world of perpetual crypto trading, start by focusing on how to get low funding rates.</p>

 Wakka Wakka Nation Partners with Sovereign Wallet for Digital Financial Sovereignty <p>February 2025 — The Wakka Wakka Nation, a sovereign Indigenous nation in Australia, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Sovereign Wallet Co., Ltd. to implement the MetaMUI Digital National Identity and Digital National Currency System. This initiative focuses on guaranteeing the constitutional right to a monetary system free from inflation and with preserved value. It also emphasizes ensuring that Wakka Wakka Bungoo is backed by tangible assets such as gold and&nbsp;silver.</p><p>With this agreement, Wakka Wakka becomes the third Indigenous nation to embrace MetaMUI’s blockchain-powered financial sovereignty model, following the successful adoption by the Yidindji Nation in 2022 and the upcoming implementation in the Birri Gubba Nation. Discussions are actively progressing with multiple Indigenous nations to expand this self-sovereign digital economic model, reinforcing a growing Indigenous financial network across Australia.</p><p>The Wakka Wakka Nation’s adoption of the MetaMUI Digital National Identity and Digital National Currency System will establish a self-governed digital identity framework for its citizens, businesses, and organizations. This system ensures privacy, security, and financial autonomy, reinforcing the nation’s control over its economic future. Alongside this, the Wakka Wakka Digital National Currency will support Indigenous trade, minimize dependence on external financial intermediaries, and maintain financial operations even during emergencies and natural disasters.</p><p>Building on the success of the Sovereign Yidindji Dollar, launched through MetaMUI’s Digital National Currency Cloud Service in 2022, the Wakka Wakka Nation joins Yidindji and Birri Gubba in co-developing the Allodial Unity Digital Dollar (AUDD) — a multi-sovereign digital currency initiative that enables seamless cross-border Indigenous trade. Unlike centralized monetary unions, the AUDD framework allows each participating nation to retain its own sovereign currency while benefiting from a unified digital economic ecosystem.</p><p>Iirragala Radjah Radjah, Minister of Law for Wakka Wakka Nation, highlighted the significance of this initiative: <br>“For generations, we have fought to maintain our sovereignty — our right to govern ourselves, protect our lands, and make our own decisions. This partnership is more than technology; it is about reclaiming what has always been ours. With this new digital financial system, we ensure that our people have the tools to thrive in the modern world while remaining rooted in our traditions.”</p><p>Phantom Seokgu Yun, CEO of Sovereign Wallet Co., Ltd., shared his excitement for this expanding movement: <br>“We are honored to collaborate with the Wakka Wakka Nation in this initiative, ensuring that Indigenous nations lead the way in establishing a monetary system where currency value is preserved, allowing them to have a financial system that guarantees individual wealth and independence.”</p><p>The Wakka Wakka Digital National Identity and Currency System is set to launch in the first half of 2025, marking a major milestone in Indigenous financial sovereignty. This initiative represents a significant step towards a global Indigenous financial network — one where sovereignty is not just recognized but actively lived, strengthened, and protected. <br> <br>About Sovereign Wallet Co.,&nbsp;Ltd.</p><p>Sovereign Wallet is committed to delivering financial sovereignty to millions through its identity-based blockchain technology. The company’s flagship product, MetaMUI, revolutionizes digital identity and currency by promoting self-sovereign finance and building sustainable, inclusive economic models. MetaMUI’s hybrid blockchain structure uniquely suits digital national currency, digital stock exchanges, and cross-border payments, reinforcing Sovereign Wallet’s vision of a decentralized, sovereign, and self-sustaining global&nbsp;economy.</p><p>About Wakka Wakka&nbsp;Nation</p><p>The Wakka Wakka Nation is a sovereign Indigenous nation in Australia, committed to self-determination and economic independence. After a 25-year legal battle, the Federal Court recognized their native title claims in southern Queensland in 2022, marking a historic victory. As Queensland’s third-largest Aboriginal group, Wakka Wakka upholds their constitutional rights to self-governance, private ownership, and fair trade. Their vision <br>prioritizes financial sovereignty and a self-sustaining economy, ensuring long-term prosperity. Queensland’s largest Aboriginal community is Yarrabah, home to the Gunggandji and Yidinji&nbsp;peoples.</p><p>#SWN #MetaMUI #SovereignWallet #DigitalIdentity #Decentralization #IndigenousSovereignty #WakkaWakka #IdentityBlockchain #FinancialInclusion #FutureofMoney #ChainedCash #CrossBorderPayments #Sovereignty #IndigenousNation #DigitalNationalCurrency #IndigenousNationalInfrastructure</p><p><a href="https://linktr.ee/MetaMUI_tree">MetaMUI Linktr</a></p>

<p>SMS-based, two-factor authentication (2FA) has long been a staple security measure for many online services, including Gmail. However, as the tech industry shifts towards more secure authentication methods, it has become evident that SMS codes are no longer the ideal solution. In a recent reveal, a Gmail spokesperson has confirmed that Google is planning to phase out SMS codes for authentication, marking a significant change for billions of users worldwide.</p>  
<p>This move by Google validates HYPR's long-held belief that <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/passwordless-security-guide">passwords and SMS codes are inherently insecure and susceptible to various attacks</a>. HYPR has been a leader in the passwordless authentication space, advocating for and implementing more secure methods like passkeys and QR codes for years.</p> 
 Drawbacks of SMS-based 2FA  
<p>While SMS-based 2FA has been widely adopted, it comes with several inherent security vulnerabilities that can compromise user accounts:</p> 
  
  Phishing risks: Threat actors can trick users into sharing their SMS codes, granting them unauthorized access to accounts.  
  Reliance on carrier security practices: The security of SMS codes heavily depends on the user's mobile carrier, which may have varying levels of protection against attacks.  
  Accessibility issues: Users may not always have access to the device receiving the SMS codes, making it difficult to authenticate their identity.  
  
<p>Moreover, SMS verification codes have become a target for criminals, who exploit them for various scams.</p> 
 Google's Decision to Move Away from SMS Codes  
<p>In a conversation with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2025/02/26/google-confirms-gmail-to-ditch-sms-code-authentication/">Forbes</a>, Gmail spokesperson Ross Richendrfer revealed Google's intention to move past passwords and SMS messages for authentication. According to Richendrfer, Google currently uses SMS verification for two primary purposes:</p> 
  
  Security: Verifying that the service is dealing with the same user as before.  
  Abuse control: Preventing fraudsters from abusing Google's services, such as creating thousands of Gmail accounts to distribute spam and malware.  
  
<p>However, SMS codes present numerous challenges, as outlined by Richendrfer and his colleague Kimberly Samra:</p> 
  
  Phishing risks: Users can be tricked into sharing their SMS codes with threat actors.  
  Accessibility concerns: Users may not always have access to the device receiving the codes.  
  Carrier security practices: The security of SMS codes relies on the user's carrier, which may have varying levels of protection.  
  
<p>Richendrfer emphasized that if a fraudster can easily trick a carrier into obtaining someone's phone number, the security value of SMS is significantly diminished.</p> 
<p>Moreover, SMS verification codes are often at the heart of many criminal operations, such as traffic pumping scams, artificial traffic inflation, and toll fraud. These scams involve fraudsters manipulating online service providers to send large numbers of SMS messages to numbers they control, thereby earning money for each delivered message.</p> 
 Gmail's Transition to QR Codes for Authentication  
<p>To address the security concerns associated with SMS codes, Gmail is set to introduce a new phone number verification process in the coming months. Instead of receiving a 6-digit SMS code, users will be presented with a QR code that they need to scan using their phone's camera app.</p> 
<p>The benefits of QR codes for authentication, as stated by Google, are threefold:</p> 
  
  Reduced phishing risk: Since there are no shareable codes, the risk of users being tricked into sharing their security codes with threat actors is significantly reduced.  
  Decreased reliance on phone carriers: In most cases, Google users will no longer need to rely on their phone carrier for anti-abuse protections.  
  Mitigation of global SMS abuse impact: The transition to QR codes will help reduce the impact of rampant, global SMS abuse.  
  
HYPR applauds Google's move to QR codes, a technology we have been championing for years. We have recognized the inherent limitations and vulnerabilities of SMS codes and have been actively implementing QR code authentication across our platform.
<br> 
 HYPR's Implementation of QR Codes  
<p>At HYPR, we have integrated QR codes into various aspects of our identity assurance platform, including:</p> 
  
  Onboarding: New users can be onboarded seamlessly and securely using QR codes to verify their identity and register their devices.  
  Reprovisioning: If a user loses or replaces their device, they can quickly and easily reprovision their credentials using a QR code.  
  Fallback: In situations where a user's primary authentication method is unavailable, QR codes can serve as a secure fallback option.  
  
  
   
   
   
    
   
   
<p>Demo example of HYPR's QR code implementation</p> 
<p>Our commitment to QR code authentication stems from our understanding of its security benefits. Unlike SMS codes, QR codes are less susceptible to phishing attacks, as they are not shareable codes. Moreover, QR codes do not rely on carrier security practices, making them a more reliable authentication method.</p> 
 Expert Perspective on QR Code Authentication  
<p>While Google's decision to deprecate SMS codes is a positive step, it's important to remember that QR codes are not without their own security considerations. As a relatively new technology for authentication, QR codes may not be viewed with the same level of suspicion as other, more established phishing techniques. This lack of awareness can be exploited by threat actors.</p> 
<p>However, HYPR's CEO, Bojan Simic, emphasizes the importance of context and implementation when evaluating the security of QR codes. "While it's true that QR codes can be exploited in phishing attacks, the context in which they are used significantly impacts their security," says Simic. "When implemented correctly, as part of a comprehensive, passwordless MFA platform, QR codes offer a significant security advantage over SMS codes and passwords."</p> 
<p>Simic further explains, "HYPR's implementation of QR codes leverages device-bound credentials and cryptographic techniques that mitigate the risks associated with phishing and session hijacking. This ensures that even if a user scans a malicious QR code, their credentials remain secure."</p> 
<p>To further enhance security, HYPR's platform incorporates additional layers of protection, such as:</p> 
  
  Risk-based authentication: <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-adapt">HYPR Adapt</a> analyzes various risk signals, such as user behavior, device posture, and location, to assess the risk associated with each authentication attempt. This allows for dynamic adjustments to the authentication process, ensuring that only legitimate users gain access.  
  Identity verification: <a href="https://www.hypr.com/platform/hypr-affirm-identity-verification">HYPR Affirm</a> provides a deterministic way to prove a user's identity, preventing account takeover attacks that exploit social engineering and help desk vulnerabilities.  
  By combining QR code authentication with these advanced security measures, HYPR provides an end-to-end secure authentication solution that mitigates the risks associated with both traditional and emerging attack vectors.
<br> 
 Beyond QR Codes: HYPR's Comprehensive Approach to Identity Assurance  
<p>Gmail's plan to phase out SMS codes in favor of QR codes marks a significant security moment for Google and its billions of users worldwide. By addressing the vulnerabilities associated with SMS-based authentication, Google aims to provide a more secure experience for its users. This move aligns with HYPR's mission to deliver passwordless identity assurance by unifying phishing-resistant authentication, adaptive risk mitigation, and automated identity verification.</p> 
<p>HYPR's innovative identity assurance platform empowers organizations to embrace phishing-resistant authentication methods like passkeys, and allow for more secure alternatives like QR codes, ensuring a seamless and secure user experience. As the tech industry continues to evolve, HYPR remains committed to staying ahead of the curve, providing cutting-edge solutions that safeguard digital identities.</p>

<p>Authentication policies in <a href="https://www.hypr.com/security-encyclopedia/identity-access-management">Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> are the bedrock of modern enterprise security. They control who accesses what, safeguarding your organization's crown jewels — its data and systems. But deploying new (or even tweaking existing) policies can feel like navigating a minefield. One misstep can trigger accidental lockouts, open up security gaps or even bring operations to a screeching halt.</p>  
<p>Wouldn't it be great if you could take those policies for a test drive before unleashing them on your users? Now you can. HYPR's Policy Simulation lets you do just that — validate your authentication policies in a safe and controlled environment, so you can be sure they work exactly as intended before they go live. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> 
 Deploy with Confidence, Secure by Design  
<p>Run simulations to see precisely how policy changes will impact user access before they're enforced. This proactive approach eliminates the risk of:</p> 
  
  Accidental Lockouts: No more locking out legitimate users from critical resources. &nbsp; &nbsp;  
  Security Gaps: Prevent unauthorized access and keep your sensitive data locked down tight. &nbsp; &nbsp;  
  Operational Disruptions: Ensure business continuity by preventing access issues that impact productivity. &nbsp; &nbsp;  
  
<p>HYPR Policy Simulation lets you fine-tune your configurations without impacting real users, ensuring a smooth and secure transition for every policy update. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p> 
 Test Drive Your Security with Policy Simulation  
<p>The HYPR Policy Simulation feature is accessed through the HYPR Adapt policy engine within the <a href="https://classicdocs.hypr.com/docs/cc/intro-cc#hypr-control-center">HYPR Control Center</a>. From there, you can define a new risk policy, selecting from built-in templates or crafting custom rules tailored to your specific requirements. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>Once your policy is defined, you can select a real user account from your system to use in the simulation. This allows you to see how the policy would affect an actual user's access without any real-world impact. You can also specify a timeframe for the simulation, determining the period for which you want to analyze real user events. &nbsp;</p> 
<p>With the user and timeframe selected, HYPR Policy Simulation would process the user's events and evaluate how the policy would impact their access. The results are displayed in an easy-to-understand format, showing whether the policy would have blocked or allowed access based on the user's behavior. &nbsp;<br>This allows you to fine-tune your policies before deployment, ensuring they work exactly as intended. By testing in a simulated environment, you can identify and address any potential issues before they impact real users.</p>

<p>As quantum computing advances, it brings immense potential for innovation, but also profound risks to digital security. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has taken a proactive step in addressing these challenges by releasing three new Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC): FIPS 203, 204, and 205. These standards aim to fortify systems against quantum attacks, ensuring the continued protection of sensitive information. For the identity and access management (IAM) industry, understanding and adopting these standards is crucial to maintaining trust and security in an era of quantum uncertainty.</p>

				  What does the decentralization driving the European Union’s digital identity specifications (eIDAS 2.0 and EUDI) mean for the future? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By James Schulte</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One way to see eIDAS is as the virtual extension of Europe’s single market: The free movement of goods, services, capital, and people throughout the EU’s member states.</p>
<p>With verifiable digital credentials managed from digital wallets, EU citizens and companies will be able to access government, commercial, and financial services seamlessly from anywhere in the EU in a privacy-preserving, secure way.</p>
<p>This is the immediate benefit, a much simpler, streamlined way of managing the duties of citizenship and the necessities of business.</p>
<p>But if we drill down to a more fundamental level, it’s more transformative and exciting than that.</p>
<p>What decentralized identity really means is that information can be permissioned to go from anywhere to everywhere, seamlessly, securely, and instantly. </p>
<p>This is the real revolution in communications.</p>
 Identity is more than just who you are 
<p>To understand why this is a revolution, we need to understand that identity covers anything that can be identified and hold an identifier. </p>
<p>Obviously, this means people, organizations, government agencies, companies; but it also means connected devices such as drones, robots, and sensors. But less obviously, and increasingly important, digital identity applies to chatbots and AI agents. Even objects can have identities if they can be continuously identified through cameras and sensors and manipulated through spatial technologies.</p>
<p>As all these entities can be assigned identifiers, they can be issued with Verifiable Credentials containing contextual information that can be shared and authenticated seamlessly.</p>
<p>If you trust the source of the credential, you can trust the information contained in the credential and be certain that it hasn’t been altered.</p>
<p>This is why Verifiable Credentials are the building blocks for a new era of innovation: They enable instant, portable trust —&nbsp;from the real world to the virtual and back to the real world.</p>
 Three examples of verifiability’s impact on the future 
<p>Mitigating the existential threat of biometric identity fraud: Biometrics were supposed to solve the problem of passwords as identifiers. Your biometrics are unique to you, instantly verifiable, can’t be forgotten, and don’t need to be changed every few months.</p>
<p>Except, in order to authenticate a liveness check, we ended up storing biometric data in the same way we stored passwords and usernames: centralized databases.</p>
<p>A biometric data breach is much more of an existential risk because, unlike a password, you can’t (really) change your face if your biometric is stolen. And then generative AI fraud came along with the capacity to fake your biometrics.</p>
<p>Decentralized Identity and Verifiable Credentials solve these problems. With an authenticated biometric in a Verifiable Credential, you no longer have to store biometric data in a centralized database to verify it. The person simply “brings their own biometrics,” and presents their biometric credential at the same time as they perform a liveness check; the software compares the two to ensure they match.</p>
<p>This also mitigates attempts at deepfake phishing: A liveness check has to be corroborated with an authenticated biometric bound to the real owner and their device.</p>
<p>This makes complying with Europe’s regulations on biometric protection SO much simpler!</p>
<p>Connecting Europe to the world and the world to Europe: Decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials come in different flavors, some with more advanced features that have compelling benefits for business. The key will be to make all these flavors blend seamlessly so that interoperability is frictionless.</p>
<p>Here, the future is very close. Indicio has already successfully combined an EU-specified identity (IATA’s OneID) with a digital passport credential (ICAO DTC Type 1) in a digital wallet to make each step of an international journey seamless.</p>
<p>Digital travel is driving interoperability between different protocols and standards, and Indicio is focused on making multi-credential workflows as simple as possible to connect Europe to Asia, Africa, and Canada.</p>
<p>This doesn’t just scale the market for digital travel, the fact that seamless border crossing requires the highest possible assurance means that digital passport credentials will be the most powerful form of decentralized identity, deployable across use cases where authentication is critical such as financial services and payments.</p>
<p>Generating portable, resilient, and reliable digital infrastructure:&nbsp;In enabling information to go from anywhere to everywhere, decentralized identity removes both the practical constraints on creating markets (the cost and complexity of direct integrations and the security required for centralized identity authentication) and provide these markets with trustable data for instant decision making.</p>
<p>There’s a lot going on here, but think of it this way: Markets no longer need intermediaries or third-party rails to function as information brokers. If you trust the source of the credential, you can trust the information in the credential. And with the authenticated biometrics providing the highest grade of digital identity assurance, you can integrate AI-enabled chat and search in a permissioned way, and include direct payments across secure, peer-to-peer channels.</p>
<p>The combination of authenticated identity for people and agents, permissioned data access, secure communications, and AI driven search has explosive growth potential. It means that any entity can create a trust network and the trust network can share any kind of information securely between its members.</p>
<p>With the right communications protocol, Verifiable Credentials become digital rails for portable trust.</p>
 Before the future, today 
<p>Ok, maybe we are getting ahead of ourselves —&nbsp;or at least the EU. We must note that the EU digital identity standards —&nbsp;at present — shy away from full decentralization. But this is a look at the future. When Apple’s iPod was first launched, promising “ a 1000 songs in your pocket,” people didn’t immediately see that it would be the foundation for a phone 5,000 times more powerful in computing power than the supercomputers of the 1980s.</p>
<p>Technology is filled with examples where the initial use cases and specifications rapidly seed innovation. EUDI is a catalyst for European innovation, digital public infrastructure, and a new era in data privacy and security.</p>
<p>If you want to drive this innovation, we have some recommendations:</p>
 
 Choose a system that equips you to manage the diverse approaches to digital identity and streamline them into a simple workflow. Simply put, Europe is not going to be a walled garden for digital services and ecommerce. You’re going to want a system that can easily navigate between OID4VC and DIDComm. 
 Choose a system that allows you to accelerate to country-level and global scale in credential management. Mediation — the ability to connect to mobile devices and handle high volume credential issuance and verification is non-negotiable. The promise of a better digital world begins with delivering solutions that work.
 
 Choose a technology that will be able to manage agentic AI, authenticated biometrics, and connected devices. Start fast with simple use cases, master the technology, and then scale to do the beat-the-competition stuff.
 
 Choose a team with global experience who can <a href="https://indicio.tech/why-experience-matters-with-eudi-theres-more-to-decentralized-identity-success-than-code/">deliver a business solution</a> and not just a technical implementation. 
 
<p>In short, choose <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven</a>: It can handle the wave of innovation that’s coming, and it’s backed by the team building that future right now.</p>

<p>The $DOCK to $CHEQ token migration has been a success!&nbsp;The vast majority of token holders have already migrated their $DOCK tokens to $CHEQ, and the process has been smooth and without delays.</p><p>As we approach the final phase, this is an important reminder:</p><p>The Token Migration Ends on March 15th</p><p>As planned, the migration will officially close on March 15th at 12:01 AM UTC. If you haven’t migrated your tokens yet, the coming weeks will be your last opportunity to do so.</p><p>If you still hold $DOCK tokens, make sure to complete your migration before the deadline to ensure a seamless transition to $CHEQ.</p><p>As of March 15th, the Dock blockchain network will be shut down, and the $DOCK token wallet will no longer be active.</p><p>Important details for stakers and validators:</p><p>Starting March 5th, we’ll reduce the number of active validators, leaving only Dock Labs' validator pool running in preparation for the shutdown.</p>  We advise all validators and stakers to begin <a href="https://docs.truvera.io/dock-token/staking/how-to-unbond-and-rebond?ref=blog.dock.io">unbonding</a> now to ensure their tokens are ready for migration as soon as possible.  The unbonding period is currently 7 days.  Starting March 5th, the unbonding period will be removed, allowing you to unbond your tokens immediately.  If you start unbonding before March 5th, you will still need to complete the full 7-day unbonding period, even after the change.  <p></p> How to migrate your DOCK tokens to CHEQ  Before you start   Ensure you have a compatible wallet for $CHEQ. If you don’t already have one, <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/product/network/wallets?ref=blog.dock.io">follow these instructions</a> to set one up. We recommend using the <a href="https://www.leapwallet.io/download?ref=blog.dock.io">Leap wallet</a>, which has a browser extension and a mobile wallet on both Android and iOS, and can be easily connected during the migration process. There is another alternative which is to use the <a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/product/network/wallets/keplr-setup?ref=blog.dock.io">Keplr wallet</a>.  Update your wallet software to their latest versions. This ensures compatibility with the new system and reduces the likelihood of encountering bugs or issues during migration.  Note that the migration must be done through the <a href="https://fe.dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io#/migration">Dock browser-based wallet</a>. If you use the Dock Wallet App or Nova Wallet, you can easily add your account to the Dock browser wallet by <a href="https://docs.dock.io/dock-token/dock-token-migration/adding-account-to-the-dock-browser-wallet?ref=blog.dock.io">following these steps</a>.  Read and understand the migration's terms and conditions. Make sure you are familiar with the terms before proceeding.

									  ByBit Hack on a Two-Bit Blockchain   <p>The afore-pictured downturn in our favorite token’s value would suggest some major breaking news in the crypto space. Did FTX crash again or something?<br><br>This time around, the truth is not nearly as exciting. That’s a good thing.</p>  <p>There were two big news stories last week. First, on February 20, the SEC ended a number of lawsuits against and/or investigations into major crypto exchanges and slashed the size of its task force from 50 attorneys to 30. Subsequently, $1.5 billion worth of our&nbsp;least&nbsp;favorite token, $ETH, was stolen from Dubai’s ByBit exchange, by far the biggest heist in crypto history.</p>  <p>Coincidence? Yeah, probably.</p>  <p>Despite ample X rumors that it was an inside job, there is little hard evidence that the ByBit situation had anything to do with fraud. Reporting says the money was stolen by a sophisticated hacker group out of North Korea known as the Lazarus Group, acting independently. (No, not our friendly neighborhood&nbsp;<a href="https://lazarusgroup.com/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=layer-two-bit">fine art printing shop</a>.)</p>  <p>The rumors stem from a supposed social engineering tactic that deceived the participants of ByBit’s multi-signature execution. Crypto natives are convinced that at least one of the seasoned signers in charge of security — and, thus, auditing any transactions —&nbsp;should have noticed the issue.</p>  <p>But regardless of whether or not the major centralized exchanges (predominantly outside of the U.S.) are engaging in practices that defraud their trading customers, there is a real concern about the way in which the ByBit hack was conducted. It laid bare the fragility, not just of Ethereum, but of the core infrastructure underpinning most layer-2 security architectures: the multisig wallet.<br><br>A multi-signature wallet requires multiple private keys to authorize a transaction. It ensures that no one person can access funds without collaboration, requiring a predefined number of signers, such as 2-of-3, to approve any action. They are incredibly widespread, but evidently, far from foolproof. Multisig wallets can be vulnerable to key loss, hacking, or compromise of multiple signers.</p>  <p>Beyond that specific point of compromise, the hack exposes the downsides of these systems’ complexities. You could argue that complexity creates more barriers for cyber threats to overcome, but it also creates more attack surfaces for hackers to accomplish exactly what Lazurus did.</p>  <p>All in all, it’s just another data point in my advocacy for L1-only solutions to scale a decentralized world computer and empower internet users with privacy and data value rights. This attack is an example on the vulnerability of the systems that currently connect L1s to L2s. What it proves to me is that L2s are just middle-man leech systems, best reserved for the role of dApps, not secure protocol infrastructure.</p>  <p>With ETHDenver&nbsp;— and, consequently, a lot of headline-grabbing L2 announcements — on the horizon, my perspective is an unpopular one. But simply put, ETH is bad for the future of decentralization and empowering the end user. It lends itself to large institutions. And if we’re just going to recreate the Big Tech environment, what is the fucking point of any of this?</p>  <p>Which brings us back to the market side of things. The ByBit hack probably put downward pressure on Ethereum, and contagion runs rampant in the crypto space. (The average Bitcoin buyer probably doesn’t know there’s a difference between L1s and L2s to begin with.) But crypto bull markets are always volatile, and this time around, there isn’t a bubble that can be popped by a few bad actors. We got to the recent all-time highs through steady building and innovation, which I believe will bring us back to and beyond them.<br><br>In 2025, it’s not about the breaking news and bad actors. The technology solves real problems, and the teams focused on those use cases will outlive the charlatans and card houses. The cream always rises to the top.</p>  <p>—El Prof</p> 								 
				 
				 
				 
							 
			
						
		 
						 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									         Pushing the Nvlope   <p>We’re pretty radical about data ownership here in the&nbsp;-land. But we’re rational about it as well.</p>  <p>We know that, despite the privacy concerns and potential monetary benefits, the average person doesn’t give a damn about whether or not Google and its extensive network of third-party advertisers has their birthday, home address, and maybe the odd Social Security number in there too. But there’s one category of information I’d argue each and every one of us don’t want falling into the wrong hands: our medical data.</p>  <p>Now, the definition of “wrong hands” may differ from person to person, but there’s one thing constant for everyone. It’s very rarely in&nbsp;your&nbsp;hands. For decades, patient medical data has been locked away in centralized systems, difficult to access, share, or monetize.</p>  <p>But just as blockchain is transforming finance and&nbsp;<a href="https://playhaus.tv/heartsol/38-bond-villain-vibes/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=layer-two-bit">genomics</a>, it’s now revolutionizing healthcare. A web3-powered radiology platform called Nvlope is designed to break down data silos, give patients control over their medical imaging, and create new revenue streams for both individuals and facilities.</p>  <p>With Nvlope, facilities can earn from data monetization even without adopting the software. If a patient monetizes their radiology data, the originating facility automatically receives Radiology Permission Tokens (RPTs) held in escrow, ensuring they benefit from revenue sharing. Over time, this model could lead to free imaging services, offsetting costs through the power of blockchain-based microtransactions.</p>  <p>All that raises the crucial question: Has Elon Musk heard of this? As the government faces growing pressure to reduce federal healthcare spending, web3 could offer a genuine solution to automate processes, open new revenue sources, and ethically integrate AI into medicine.</p>  <p>With Nvlope’s Digital Artifacts, patients can:</p>    <p>Securely store and share imaging records across institutions.</p>  <p>Monetize their bio-assets, creating new value from their medical history.</p>  <p>Compare radiology data with genomics, AI analysis, and interdisciplinary studies to unlock new healthcare insights.</p>    <p>Along with&nbsp;<a href="https://genobank.io/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=layer-two-bit">GenoBank.io</a>, which we spotlighted two weeks ago, Nvlope is building a Proof of Need (PoN) framework, where digital assets across different medical service lines verify real-world demand for decentralized healthcare solutions. By linking genetic and radiology data, patients can participate in research, AI-driven diagnostics, and tokenized health ecosystems—all while maintaining full sovereignty over their data.</p>  <p>With Nvlope, patients reclaim ownership of their radiology records while providers tap into new revenue streams powered by web3. This is more than just a technology shift — it’s a fundamental change in how healthcare data is stored, shared, and valued.</p>  <p>Your doctor is likely no stranger to awkward questions. So why wait? Ask if they can mint your medical records today!</p>  <p>—Muhammed</p>

<p>At SpruceID, we believe that any successful digital identity program must be open and interoperable, allowing many identity issuers and verifiers to share <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/navigating-the-jungle-of-digital-credential-standards/">standardized technical “rails.”</a> This opens the playing field for competitive innovation, both in technical approaches and business focus, making sure that every possible advantage of digital identity reaches the real world.</p><p>This open-network model fundamentally relies on another kind of openness: open-source code and software. The basic idea of open source is that it can be freely viewed, borrowed, and modified, an ethos that has been fundamental to the progress of digital technology as a whole. It’s sometimes referred to as FOSS, for “free and open source software.”</p><p>Open source can also provide substantive security and interoperability advantages specific to identity systems, particularly for digital wallets. Read on for a concise breakdown of those advantages and why the many new players joining the digital identity ecosystem should seriously consider an open source approach.</p> What is ‘Open Source’? <p>At root, “open source” describes a type of copyright license attached to a published piece of software. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses?ref=blog.spruceid.com">many types of open-source licenses</a>, each with specific permissions and limits on how the software can be borrowed from, transformed, and used. For instance, some FOSS licenses allow reused code to be integrated into copyrighted commercial products, while some do not.</p><p>The goals of open source were first laid out in the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.en.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">late 1980s by pioneering hacker Richard Stallman</a>, and one major motive was simple efficiency. Many different software packages include very similar modules or functions under the hood, and making those components freely reusable has contributed massively to the success of the software industry. SpruceID is very proud to share its work with identity developers via <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/introducing-sprucekit/">SpruceKit</a>, our open-source package of tools for building identity with digital credentials, and on our <a href="https://github.com/spruceid?ref=blog.spruceid.com">extensive Github repository</a> here. (We even just completed a full DevDoc content review &amp; refresh here: https://www.sprucekit.dev.)&nbsp;</p><p>A recent study from the Harvard Business School found that this sort of efficiency amounted to a staggering <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4693148&amp;ref=blog.spruceid.com">$8.8 trillion in value for technology firms</a>, which would have to spend 3.5 times more on development costs without open source. It’s important to point out that open-source isn’t simply a free lunch, though: if you’re using open-source components in a project, there’s an expectation that you’ll make your own contributions in return. That’s why SpruceID is an active supporter of open source initiatives: we’re a founding member of the <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/spruce-owf/">Open Wallet Foundation</a>, and we fund initiatives to support open source developers in the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p> Open Source Means Trust Assurance <p>The security and trust advantages of open-source software development may be even more significant than the efficiency benefits. Because open-source code is publicly viewable, it has the potential to be vetted by many more developers than would review it within a single organization. Furthermore, code components that are deployed across many software packages have a head start on “real-world” testing.</p><p>This benefit is particularly relevant - perhaps even essential - for wallet software. That’s because many of the security protections of wallet software are deep in the code, particularly including how user data is stored and shared. The ability to review the underlying code is the best way to make sure, for instance, that a wallet is interacting with a device's secure element chip correctly or that it can’t be subverted by a ‘rooted’ operating system.</p><p>It’s important to note that making code publicly viewable should not be a security risk for revealing specific tokens, passwords, or access codes. One might compare it to looking at a diagram of a lock: open source will reveal if the lock’s design is flawed in a way that could be exploited, but it won’t let you create a key that would open any specific lock.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, as with all software, it’s important to apply security precautions. For open source, projects can evolve rapidly, and while the community often identifies vulnerabilities quickly, users must stay vigilant. It’s necessary to regularly update dependencies, review project activity, and verify package integrity. Automated vulnerability scanning and ensuring third-party code aligns with organizational security policies can offer further protection. With thoughtful management, open source can be leveraged confidently without compromising security.</p> Innovation in More Directions <p>Finally, the core advantage of open-source software is that it allows software builders to innovate faster by building on work that has come before. Open source licenses allow code to be freely modified, meaning a developer can borrow something close to what they’re trying to create and then add modifications specific to their goals, which may be quite different than the functionality of the library it’s built upon.&nbsp;</p><p>This “building on the work of others” can be particularly powerful for applications that run on <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/navigating-the-jungle-of-digital-credential-standards/">open data standards</a>, including digital credential wallets. A wallet may integrate preexisting components that handle the underlying standards and then build specific features that expand on that shared foundation for its particular use cases. This could be something as simple as tailoring the aesthetics and layout of a user interface or more nuanced details such as creating more detailed security or adding more sharing options.</p><p>This capacity for innovation then has a positive flipside, which is the freedom to not innovate. Credential wallets, in particular, can be quite basic re-uses of existing code, or experimental forks veering off into new territory. That makes the open source approach particularly appealing for state governments or other entities testing the waters: a project can be tailored to the capacity and experience of staff and constituents as needed. But for those adopters of Open-Source, no matter where the project ends up, you may already be standing on the shoulders of giants.</p> Let’s Build the Future of Digital Identity Together <p>SpruceID is committed to advancing open source solutions that empower individuals and organizations with secure, privacy-preserving digital identity tools. Whether you're developing credential wallets, integrating verifiable credentials, or exploring decentralized authentication, we’d love to collaborate.</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/contact-us?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Get in Touch</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

As a privacy-first startup, our team understands the importance of data <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/privacy-kin-personal-ai">privacy</a> in <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-is-artificial-intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>.</p><p>To help our users, we're starting article series like this one, which will cover not just how we make these elements of personal intelligence work ethically, but why you should care about them at all. As business owners and individuals increasingly adopt AI-powered solutions, from ChatGPT to Copilot, understanding these concepts becomes crucial.</p> <p>I’m Simon Westh Henriksen, Co-Founder of <a href="http://mykin.ai">Kin</a>. As CTO, I’m dedicated to making Kin the most personal, private, and trustworthy AI assistant we can - all while showing why this technology is cutting-edge along the way</p> <a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3a05201e-5f91-46dd-ab79-e537df0583f4_997x997.jpeg">   </a> <p><a href="https://dk.linkedin.com/in/simonhenriksen">Follow me on LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kinpersonalai">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://x.com/simonhenriksen">X</a> - or join Kin’s <a href="https://discord.gg/PYMyz6uRct">Discord</a></p> <p>As you probably guessed, this series is on the role of memory technology in personal AI, and why it's essential for improving your experience with AI models and your own AI.</p><p>This article will focus on why you should even care in the first place.</p> Introducing a new relationship: <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">Personal AI</a> <p>Meeting your AI companion is a little different to meeting a new person - Kin is always available in real-time, infinitely patient, and can be tailored to your specific requirements quite unlike any other technology.</p><p>However, much like any new person you meet, memory is essential to that conversation.</p><p>Without it, your AI assistant would unknowingly ask the same questions over and over, much like one of the many characters talking to Phil Connors (Bill Murray) in Groundhog Day. Just like any other <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI chatbot</a>, it would have absolutely no way to recall previous interactions.</p><p>Imagine meeting that new person, and having to repeat the same conversations every time you meet. Eventually, you would give up. No bond would grow, because as our <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/what-trust-is-and-why-ai-needs-it">trust article series</a> noted, connection relies on shared experiences and understanding. Any effort made to teach the language model about you, or personalize its responses, would be lost.</p><p>So, a personal AI without memory is just another chatbot - useful for basic workflows and automation, but incapable of deep, ongoing support. That's the biggest reason memory is important to you as a user, but not the only one.</p> You need the power of pattern recognition <p>Humans are excellent at recognizing patterns in others, and even in things that don't have them (just Google "paradolia"). However, we can often struggle to see patterns in ourselves.</p><p>This can be as big as a friend noticing that you keep falling into the same toxic relationship patterns before you do - or as small as you not realizing that the only way you remember your keys in the morning is to leave them by the door.</p><p>Recognizing these patterns in ourselves often takes multiple mistakes and years of conscious <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/improve-self-evaluation-professional-growth">self-reflection</a>. Machine learning and AI agents, on the other hand, excel at pattern recognition - when paired with an effective memory system. A well-structured memory allows artificial intelligence to analyze user behaviors over time, so it can point out these things as insights offering and help prevent you from repeating mistakes.</p><p>In this way, AI chat can act as a mirror, reflecting back on past choices, behaviors, and trends in a way that enhances self-awareness and personal <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/growth-mindset-the-power-of-belief">growth</a>.</p><p>And, more importantly, it can do all of this without you pouring over your <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-use-kins-journal">Journal entries</a> from months ago - if you even wrote any in the first place.</p> Memory makes your conversations fluid <p>Memory isn't just about recalling facts—it's about continuity and natural language understanding. A great memory system allows AI to store, retrieve, and understand a spectrum of information, from minor preferences to significant life events:</p>  <p>The small things: Remembering favorite colors, dietary restrictions, or daily habits.</p>  <p>The big things: Keeping track of important relationships, major life events, and personal growth over time.</p>  <p>Without this nuance, AI might recall your breakfast habits of the last month - but not your life goals. That can make a Sunday-night conversation about what you should do with your life likely to include much more cereal than you were expecting.</p><p>A proper memory depth, then, enables AI to work out its own context and continuity - so you can spend more time talking to it naturally, and less time explaining how there are bigger things in your life than tomorrow's chocolate crunch.</p> Short-term &amp; long-term memory are essential <p>In a similar vein, for AI to be truly personal, it must manage both short-term and long-term memory effectively:</p>  <p>Short-term memory: Retaining details from an ongoing conversation to maintain context.</p>  <p>Long-term memory: Remembering past interactions, user preferences, and historical insights to enhance understanding over time.</p>  <p>Without short-term memory, your personal AI will struggle to craft a coherent and constructive response to each new message.</p><p>But, without long-term memory, your personal AI will be incapable of recalling and analyzing past information - not to mention the personalizations you've made.</p><p>A good AI will have this dual-memory structure so that it can engage in meaningful conversations with thoughtful, personalized responses - not generic answers.</p> <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI assistants</a> should grow with you <p>You can probably see where this is going. Just like its memory of you can help you grow, a personal AI's understanding of its users and the world should help it grow too.</p><p>A good memory system will allow AI to evolve alongside its user, adjusting and refining its approach based on past interactions, use cases, and user feedback.</p><p>At its core, its this adaptability that makes a personal AI 'personal' in the first place: if it can't tailor its responses to your dislike of the color red, or, say, overly polite feedback - it might as well just be any other AI Chatbot out there.</p><p>However, it goes deeper than that. Memory can help AI with:</p>  <p>Context-Aware prioritization: This is where the AI intelligently adjusts its focus based on the user's current life circumstances and trends, rather than merely following static routines.</p><p>For example, if you're stressed at work, the AI might emphasize stress reduction techniques, provide time management suggestions, or offer strategies to improve productivity. Or, during a period of personal reflection, it could prioritize emotional insights and goal-setting guidance.</p><p>But it needs to remember your current situation (and differentiate it from your "stress" over your cold takeout fries) in order to do that.</p>  <p>Communication style adaptation: Where the AI learns how you like to speak and be spoken to, so you can feel more comfortable and the AI can stop asking you tell it what 'skibidi toilet' means.</p>  <p>Predicting needs: Where the AI proactively suggests actions to you based on your past behavior, like reminding you to buy groceries on your usual shopping day. It needs to be able to recall, understand, and analyze past conversations in order to figure that information out.</p>   Supporting you is everything <p>All of this sets a program up to be an effective personal AI, but to build true rapport, an AI must do more than remember and understand facts - it needs to recognize and respond to the emotional patterns they represent.</p><p>By remembering details about your life, and understanding their relation to your feelings, personal AI can offer more empathetic and context-aware on-demand support than any other AI. This could look like:</p>  <p>Recognizing mood shifts: "You seem to be more stressed than usual. Has something changed at work?"</p>  <p>Understanding emotional triggers: "I'm noticing that you often feel ignored before an argument begins. Would you like to discuss that?"</p>   Kin &amp; the future of your <a href="https://link.mykin.ai/RcLw/6du9b2fj">AI companions</a> <p>As this article has come to imply, truly personal AI should function as a combination of a friend, a coach, and a mentor. Each plays a distinct role in our lives, but none has complete insight.</p><p>AI, with an advanced memory system, can bridge these gaps.</p><p>Unlike human relationships, where sharing personal information always comes with a degree of uncertainty regarding how it will be received, AI can and should offer a safe space where you have <a href="https://blog.mykin.ai/p/how-to-view-and-control-your-data">control over your data and interactions</a>. It's what we built Kin to do.</p><p>By remembering, adapting, and providing insightful feedback, memory-equipped personal AI has the potential to revolutionize how we understand ourselves, make decisions, and interact with the world. This is why memory is not just an enhancement—it is the foundation of a truly intelligent, useful, and personal AI. And that’s why it’s the foundation of Kin.</p><p>So, why is personal AI with a memory system like this so rare? We'll discuss that in our next article.</p>

<p>The U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) has proposed new regulations requiring businesses performing Know Your Customer (KYC) checks to collect robust geolocation data. IP addresses alone are no longer sufficient due to their vulnerability to masking and manipulation. This regulatory shift aims to enhance customer verification and strengthen defenses against financial crime.</p>



 



 The Regulatory Shift: Why Geolocation Matters 



<p>IP addresses, long used to infer a user’s location, can be spoofed or masked by VPNs and proxies. FinCEN’s latest regulations call for more precise geolocation data as part of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF) efforts. This ensures financial institutions can confidently verify where their users are located during key transactions.</p>



 



 iComply’s Advanced Edge-Computing Solution 



<p>To help our clients meet these new requirements, iComply has released a significant enhancement to our edge-computing platform, integrating:</p>



 
 Precise Geolocation Tracking: Uses multiple data points—including GPS and Wi-Fi positioning—for an accurate, real-time user location. 



 Device Fingerprinting: Creates a unique device profile based on hardware and behavior to detect fraud attempts and unauthorized access. 



 Live Biometric Verification: Confirms that the user completing verification is physically present and matches their registered identity. 
 



 



 Why This Matters to Your Business 



 
 Regulatory Compliance: Stay ahead of new FinCEN requirements with secure, compliant KYC workflows. 



 Fraud Prevention: Multi-layered verification methods prevent spoofing and protect customer accounts. 



 User-Friendly Experience: Our seamless integrations keep the verification process quick and frictionless for users. 
 



 



 Stay Compliant and Confident 



<p>The financial compliance landscape is evolving rapidly. iComply’s latest technology ensures you can meet these stricter regulatory standards without sacrificing security or user experience.</p>

<p>The irony with urgently questioning how to tell whether something is an AI or a person is the fact that we’re struggling just as much to distinguish humans from… well, other humans. This is, in fact, not a new problem at all. After writing about the AI vs Human issue in a <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/01/27/are-you-human-a-dive-into-the-proof-of-personhood-debate/">previous post</a>, I’m finding some interesting crossover back into the consumer IAM (CIAM) space. And since I’ll be talking at <a href="https://www.authcon.io/">Authcon</a> in May (a CIAM event), it’s time for me to start writing about that.</p>



<p>CIAM operates on a few basic assumptions:</p>



 
 You are who you say you are. 



 The device in your hand belongs to you. 



 Once authenticated, your access is legitimate. 
 



<p>These assumptions break down when AI enters the chat. Not just AI-generated deepfakes or synthetic identities but also when identity systems are confronted with very human behavior: social engineering, shared devices, and fraud within trusted circles.</p>



<p>So, yeah: we’ve been discussing the same challenges in non-human identity and CIAM for a long time, and the industry still isn’t ready.</p>



 The “Friends &amp; Family” Problem 



<p>Identity professionals love to talk about preventing fraud, but we usually focus on external threats: account takeovers, credential stuffing, or phishing. But what happens when the fraudster is someone the victim knows?</p>



<p>Your 10-year-old figures out your phone password and orders $300 of Roblox currency. Your spouse knows your device unlock code and, months after the breakup, logs in to access old messages. A caregiver managing an aging parent’s finances suddenly has full control over their retirement accounts. None of these people “hacked” anything—but they still bypassed authentication controls.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thewillbureau.co.uk/news/2019/1/21/lasting-power-of-attorney-friends-and-family-fraud">“Friends &amp; family” fraud</a> (closely related to <a href="https://www.chime.com/blog/second-party-fraud/">second-party fraud</a>) is where a close contact exploits a trusted relationship to gain unauthorized access. It’s a growing issue in banking, payments, and digital services. The protections we have today, such as <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/">FIDO2 passkeys</a>, <a href="https://www.ninjaone.com/it-hub/endpoint-security/what-is-device-binding/">device-bound authentication</a>, and <a href="https://www.logintc.com/types-of-authentication/biometric-authentication">biometric logins</a>, are based on the assumption that the person holding the phone is the legitimate user. That’s great and probably correct most of the time. It is not, however, what we see in real-world use cases where:</p>



 
 Kids <a href="https://gabb.com/blog/how-kids-get-around-parental-controls/">log in</a> to their parents’ accounts to bypass spending limits. 



 Partners <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14341">access</a> each other’s devices for “convenience” but later use that access for harm. 



 Caregivers and family members <a href="https://www.agingcare.com/questions/what-digital-tools-are-helpful-as-you-manage-caregiving-or-care-navigation-485081.htm">manage logins</a> for aging parents or disabled relatives. 
 



<p>Payment providers like Stripe <a href="https://stripe.com/guides/state-of-online-fraud">report</a> that fraud, including instances where the “victim” is complicit or unaware, is on the rise. But businesses still treat identity verification as largely a binary problem: Either you pass authentication or you don’t. There’s little room for contextual fraud signals that account for real-world relationships. But maybe that is changing.</p>



 What AI Agents Teach Us About Trust &amp; Delegation 



<p>In the non-human identity world, we are learning to recognize that trust is fluid. AI agents, machine-to-machine (M2M) services, and API-based workloads (hopefully) authenticate using delegation models such as:</p>



 
 <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/client-credentials-flow">OAuth 2.0’s client credentials flow</a> allows one service to act on behalf of another without requiring persistent user authentication. 



 <a href="https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-207">Zero-trust architectures</a> don’t assume a system is trustworthy just because it authenticated once. Instead, they rely on continuous verification based on real-time risk signals. 



 <a href="https://spiffe.io">SPIFFE/SPIRE Workload Identity</a> enables automated identity verification for cloud workloads, reducing reliance on static credentials. 
 



<p>These models allow non-human agents to establish trust dynamically, adjusting permissions based on risk and usage patterns. Meanwhile, human identity systems remain largely static—once authenticated, users are granted broad access without continuous validation.</p>



 



<p>AI-driven fraud is shaking up identity proofing, but no single standard has emerged as the clear best practice. If your organization is figuring out which standards to follow—or how to engage in shaping them—I can help.  <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/services/">See how I work</a> or <a>Let’s talk</a>.</p>



 



 CIAM + AI Agent Match Up 



<p>This sounds a lot like what people have been promoting for other business sectors, including CIAM. The identity challenges addressed in machine-to-machine interactions—like delegation models, continuous authentication, and risk-based access—might offer useful lessons for consumer identity. Instead of treating authentication as a single, binary event, what if consumer identity systems incorporated the same dynamic trust models that AI agents and workloads are learning to use?</p>



<p>For example, let’s talk about a few of these best practices:</p>



 
 Time-boxed authentication: Require step-up verification if behavioral patterns change, similar to OAuth2 access token expiration. (There’s a lot to know about <a href="https://doi.org/10.55621/idpro.108">tokens</a>; it’s a worthwhile rabbit hole to go down.) 



 Delegated identity models: Instead of just “logging in,” make it easy for users to grant role-based access to trusted individuals (like caregivers) with explicit constraints. 



 Shared signals integration: If a device suddenly authenticates multiple users in a short window, should the system flag that? (I really need to write more about shared signals in a future blog post. In the meantime, you might want to read the <a href="https://sharedsignals.guide/">Shared Signals Guide</a>.) 
 



 Standards &amp; Real-World Adoption Challenges 



<p>To be fair, these ideas aren’t new. The pieces are already in place in various standards:</p>



 
 <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63.html">NIST SP 800-63-4</a> (granted, still in draft) acknowledges that “possession-based” authentication (passkeys, WebAuthn) should be paired with risk signals to mitigate fraud. 



 The <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-sharedsignals-framework-1_0-ID3.html">OpenID Shared Signals Framework</a> (SSF) (also still in draft) allows identity providers to exchange risk indicators across ecosystems. 



 <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119400_119499/119461/02.01.01_60/ts_119461v020101p.pdf">ETSI TS 119 461</a> (not in draft; in fact, the most recent version was published in February 2025) defines identity-proofing best practices for high-trust authentication though it focuses more on initial onboarding than ongoing verification 
 



<p>But as much as I love standards, I am the first to admit that you can develop the best, most awesome, whizbang standard in the world, but if no one adopts it, you have nothing.</p>



 
 Tech companies are prioritizing user convenience over fraud controls. 



 Privacy regulations limit shared risk signals across platforms (GDPR, CCPA). 



 Legacy systems struggle to support continuous, adaptive authentication. 
 



<p>And so, we’re left with a system where strong authentication protects against external attackers, but leaves us vulnerable to the people we know.</p>



 Where Does CIAM Go From Here? 



<p>If AI agents can authenticate with conditional trust models, why can’t we? It’s time to stop treating authentication as a single yes/no event. We already know what to do. The only question is—are we ready to act?</p>



 
 Passkeys &amp; biometrics aren’t a silver bullet. We need fraud models that account for who is using a device—not just that they authenticated successfully. 



 Shared signals must extend beyond traditional fraud detection. If identity systems could track delegation patterns, we could detect anomalies before damage occurs. 



 The industry needs to rethink “authentication” vs. “authorization.” Just because you logged in doesn’t mean you should have full access. 
 



<p>By now, CIAM is realizing that they have a problem when it comes to AI agents. The solution to those problems, however, should be a fairly familiar refrain of best practices we’ve been talking about for years. If we can say we’re going to learn from NHI as people approach it as a greener field (it isn’t, really, but tell that to the hype cycle), then let’s do it. Let’s take advantage of the energy around NHI and AI and do what we’ve always known we should. Fraud is only getting worse.</p>



<p>What do you think? Are passkeys and device-based authentication creating new fraud risks? Have we finally reached the point where the ROI for implementing these best practices is enough to make it a priority?</p>

<p>Have you ever wanted to invest in stocks or bonds, but felt overwhelmed by the sheer number of options? If you’re new to investing, it might sound like a puzzle. But what if you could simply pool your money with others to invest in a variety of assets without doing all the heavy lifting? That’s where mutual funds come in. Let’s break it down!</p>

 What Are Mutual Funds? 



<p>In simple terms, mutual funds are investments that pool money from lots of different investors. Then, a professional manager uses that pooled money to buy a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets. Instead of buying individual stocks or bonds yourself, you invest in a mutual fund and let experts handle the details.</p>



<p>The real magic of mutual funds is diversification. By investing in a fund, you’re spreading your risk across a range of different assets. If one stock or bond performs poorly, others in the fund might do better, balancing things out.</p>

 How Do Mutual Funds Work? 



<p>Imagine you and a group of friends each throw some cash into a pot. A fund manager is the one who decides how to invest that money. The best part? You don’t have to worry about picking individual stocks or bonds. The fund manager does it all for you.</p>



<p>Mutual funds can be:</p>



 
 Actively managed: A team of experts picks investments and changes them regularly to try to outperform the market. 



 Passively managed: These funds track a market index (like the S&amp;P 500) and have lower fees since no one is actively picking stocks. 
 



<p>You earn money from mutual funds in three main ways:</p>



 
 Dividends: When the fund holds stocks that pay dividends, you’ll get a share of that income. 



 Capital Gains: When the fund sells an asset for a profit, you get a cut of the earnings. 



 NAV Growth: If the value of the assets in the fund increases, the price of your shares in the fund goes up too. 
 


 
 


 Types of Mutual Funds 



<p>There are many types of mutual funds, and each serves a different purpose depending on your financial goals.</p>



 
 Equity Funds: These funds invest mostly in stocks. They’re great for people looking for higher potential returns and willing to take on more risk. 



 Fixed Income Funds: These focus on bonds and other debt instruments. They’re less risky but typically offer lower returns than equity funds. 



 Index Funds: A passive option that tracks a specific market index, like the S&amp;P 500. These funds are generally low-cost and perform similarly to the overall market. 



 Balanced Funds: These invest in a mix of stocks and bonds to provide both growth and stability. 
 



<p>Each of these types fits different investment strategies. So, whether you want aggressive growth or steady income, there’s a mutual fund for you.</p>



 4 Benefits of Investing in Mutual Funds 



<p>Investing in mutual funds comes with several key advantages that make them a popular choice for both beginners and experienced investors. Here’s why mutual funds might be the right choice for you:</p>



 Diversification: Reducing Risk 



<p>Instead of putting all your money into one or two stocks, mutual funds pool your money with other investors and invest in a variety of assets like stocks, bonds, and sometimes even real estate. This means your investment is spread across dozens or even hundreds of different securities, which helps reduce risk. If one asset performs poorly, others in the fund may perform better, balancing out the losses.</p>



 Professional Management: You Don’t Have to Be an Expert 



<p>One of the biggest perks of mutual funds is that you don’t need to be a financial expert to get started. Fund managers—professional investors with deep knowledge of the market—handle all the decision-making for you. They decide which stocks or bonds to buy, when to buy them, and when to sell, ensuring your portfolio is actively managed according to the fund’s strategy.</p>



 Low Costs: Affordable Investment Options 



<p>Mutual funds, especially index funds, tend to have lower costs compared to other investment types. Index funds are passively managed and track a market index (like the S&amp;P 500), so their fees are minimal. While actively managed funds can have higher fees due to professional management, the low-cost options in mutual funds make them an affordable choice for many investors.</p>



 Accessibility: Invest with Any Budget 



<p>Whether you have $100 or $10,000 to invest, mutual funds offer an accessible way to enter the market. Because you can buy shares in a fund, you don’t need large amounts of money to gain exposure to a diverse set of assets, making them perfect for investors at all financial levels.</p>

 How Much Can You Make from Investing in Mutual Funds? 



<p>Let’s put it into perspective. If you invested $10,000 in a mutual fund that performed at an average annual return of 7% (a reasonable figure over the long term), here’s how your investment could grow over time:</p>



 
 After 1 year: You’d have $10,700. 



 After 5 years: Your investment would grow to around $14,025. 



 After 10 years: You’d have around $19,671. 
 



<p>Of course, mutual funds can go up or down in value, and returns are never guaranteed. But over time, they offer the potential for steady growth.</p>



 The 3-5-10 Rule for Mutual Funds 



<p>Here’s a simple guideline: the 3-5-10 rule. It suggests that you should consider holding onto your mutual fund investment for different periods based on performance:</p>



 
 3 Years: Evaluate if the fund is doing what it should. Are you seeing growth? 



 5 Years: You should see decent returns by this point. If not, it might be time to reassess. 



 10 Years: Historically, mutual funds are a long-term play. Over a decade, the odds of your investment performing well are much higher. 
 



 Mutual Funds vs. ETFs: What’s the Difference? 



<p>You might have heard of ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds), and while they’re similar to mutual funds, there are a few key differences:</p>



 
 Liquidity: ETFs can be traded throughout the day, just like stocks. Mutual funds, on the other hand, are bought or sold at the end of the day based on their Net Asset Value (NAV). 



 Costs: ETFs usually have lower fees because they’re often passively managed. Mutual funds, especially actively managed ones, tend to have higher fees. 



 Flexibility: ETFs are more flexible, allowing you to trade any time during market hours. Mutual funds can only be bought or sold at the close of trading. 
 



<p>Both can diversify your portfolio, but ETFs tend to be more liquid and cheaper.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>Mutual funds offer an easy way for beginners to get into investing without needing to know everything about the stock market. They provide diversification, professional management, and accessibility, making them a solid choice for anyone looking to grow their money over time.</p>



<p>Whether you’re starting with $100 or $10,000, there’s a mutual fund for you. So, take the plunge, do your research, and let mutual funds help you reach your financial goals!</p>

<p>Ever had a moment where you’re scrolling through your Solana wallet, wondering, “Where did that token go?” or “What’s the status of my last NFT mint?” Well, viewing Solana transaction code doesn’t have to be a mystery. Whether you’re a developer, investor, or just a curious crypto enthusiast, knowing how to track your Solana transactions and viewing Solana transaction code is crucial.</p>



<p>In this guide, we’ll walk you through how to track your Solana transactions, find your transaction IDs, and get all the juicy details behind the scenes. Ready to dive in?</p>

 What is Solana? A Quick Overview 



<p>Before we jump into transaction tracking, let’s quickly recap what Solana is and why it’s so popular. Solana is a high-performance blockchain known for its lightning-fast transaction speeds and super low fees. Whether you’re dealing with decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, or building on smart contracts, Solana’s scalability makes it a go-to for developers and users alike.</p>



<p>But behind all that speed, there’s a lot happening in the background — and that’s where transaction IDs come into play.</p>


 
 


 The Role of Transaction IDs in Solana 



<p>So, what exactly is a transaction ID? In Solana, the transaction ID (or signature) is a unique string of characters that identifies each transaction on the blockchain. It’s like your receipt after buying something online — but way cooler because it’s immutable and transparent on the blockchain.</p>



<p>Why does it matter? If you’re managing assets, tracking NFT sales, or just trying to check if your transaction went through, the transaction ID is your key to understanding exactly what happened. It helps you audit, trace, and troubleshoot any issues related to your transactions.</p>

 Methods for Viewing Solana Transaction Code 



<p>There are a few ways you can go about viewing Solana’s transaction codes, but the most popular method involves using Solana’s Web3.js API. Don’t worry, you don’t have to be a full-fledged developer to get started.</p>



 Using Solana’s Web3.js API 



<p>Solana’s Web3.js library allows you to interact with the blockchain and retrieve transaction data. The most important function we’ll use here is getSignaturesForAddress. This function lets you pull up all transactions associated with a given address (be it a wallet, mint address, or program ID).</p>



<p>Here’s a quick breakdown of what you’ll need:</p>



 
 Node.js (version 16.15 or higher) 



 Yarn installed (or npm works too) 



 Solana Web3.js 



 Some basic JavaScript knowledge 
 



<p>Once you have everything set up, you can query Solana for transaction history related to any address. Here’s how you can set it up:</p>



 
 Create a Project Directory: 
 



<p>mkdir get_sol_tx</p>



<p>cd get_sol_tx</p>



<p>echo &gt; log.js</p>



 
 Install Dependencies: 
 



<p>yarn init -y</p>



<p>yarn add @solana/web3.js@1</p>



 
 Set Up the Code: 
 



<p>In your log.js file, add the following code to establish a connection to Solana’s blockchain and get transaction signatures:</p>



<p>const solanaWeb3 = require(‘@solana/web3.js’);</p>



<p>const endpoint = ‘https://example.solana-devnet.quiknode.pro/000000/’;</p>



<p>const solanaConnection = new solanaWeb3.Connection(endpoint);</p>



<p>const searchAddress = ‘YOUR_ADDRESS_HERE’;</p>



<p>This basic setup connects you to the Solana blockchain through an RPC endpoint (you can use public nodes, but QuickNode is an excellent choice for speed).</p>


 
 


 Retrieving Transaction Details via the Web3 API 



<p>Now that you’re connected to Solana’s network, let’s get into viewing solana transaction code.</p>



 The getSignaturesForAddress Method 



<p>This function is a game-changer. By calling it, you can retrieve all transactions associated with a particular address. You can specify how many transactions you want to pull (up to 1000), and even filter them by date.</p>



<p>Here’s how to retrieve transactions and view essential details like signature, status, and block time:</p>



<p>const getTransactions = async (address, numTx) =&gt; {</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const pubKey = new solanaWeb3.PublicKey(address);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let transactionList = await solanaConnection.getSignaturesForAddress(pubKey, { limit: numTx });</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transactionList.forEach((transaction, i) =&gt; {</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const date = new Date(transaction.blockTime * 1000);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(`Transaction No: ${i+1}`);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(`Signature: ${transaction.signature}`);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(`Time: ${date}`);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(`Status: ${transaction.confirmationStatus}`);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log((“-“).repeat(20));</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});</p>



<p>};</p>



<p>getTransactions(searchAddress, 3);</p>



<p>This script will give you a list of recent transactions tied to the address you’re interested in, along with their respective transaction IDs and other key details. It’s that simple!</p>

 Diving Deeper: Parsing Transaction Details 



<p>Now, you have the transaction IDs, but what’s inside them? To get a deeper understanding of each transaction, you can use getParsedTransaction.</p>



<p>This method provides additional insights into what each transaction is doing, such as the program interactions and instructions executed. Here’s how to extract that data:</p>



<p>const getTransactions = async (address, numTx) =&gt; {</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const pubKey = new solanaWeb3.PublicKey(address);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let transactionList = await solanaConnection.getSignaturesForAddress(pubKey, { limit: numTx });</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let signatureList = transactionList.map(transaction =&gt; transaction.signature);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;let transactionDetails = await solanaConnection.getParsedTransactions(signatureList);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transactionList.forEach((transaction, i) =&gt; {</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const date = new Date(transaction.blockTime * 1000);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;const transactionInstructions = transactionDetails[i].transaction.message.instructions;</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(`Transaction No: ${i+1}`);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(`Signature: ${transaction.signature}`);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(`Time: ${date}`);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(`Status: ${transaction.confirmationStatus}`);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transactionInstructions.forEach((instruction, n) =&gt; {</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(`—Instructions ${n+1}: ${instruction.programId.toString()}`);</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log((“-“).repeat(20));</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;});</p>



<p>};</p>



<p>With this, you’ll be able to see what programs or smart contracts interacted with each transaction. It’s like opening the hood of the transaction to see what’s really going on!</p>



 Real-World Example: Tracking Transactions in Action 



<p>Let’s put everything into practice. Suppose you want to track transactions for a Solana wallet or an NFT mint. Here’s what you can do:</p>



 
 Grab your wallet address or mint address (example: vines1vzrYbzLMRdu58ou5XTby4qAqVRLmqo36NKPTg). 



 Run the script to pull up the transaction history for that address. 



 See the transaction details, including the IDs and the programs involved. 
 



<p>This is super helpful for tracking NFT sales or token transfers. You can even check it out on Solana’s Explorer to compare and confirm your results.</p>



 Using Solana Explorer for Transaction Tracking 



<p>Not a coder? No worries! You can always head over to the Solana Explorer for a visual look at your transactions.</p>



 
 Go to<a href="https://explorer.solana.com/"> Solana Explorer</a>. 



 Search for your address or transaction ID. 



 See all your transaction history and detailed logs in one easy-to-navigate interface. 
 



<p>It’s perfect for anyone who prefers a no-code solution to view transaction data and stay updated.</p>


 
 


 Tracking Solana Events 



<p>Solana allows smart contracts (programs) to emit events. These are similar to Ethereum’s events but have a few key differences. Instead of querying past events, you need to watch for events in real-time.</p>



<p>If you want to listen for specific events (like when a token is transferred or an NFT is minted), you can set up an event listener using the Anchor framework. It’s like getting notified every time something cool happens on the blockchain.</p>



 Troubleshooting &amp; Best Practices 



<p>While Solana’s transaction tracking is pretty straightforward, there are a few things you should keep in mind:</p>



 
 Check your connection: Make sure your RPC endpoint is working properly (QuickNode is a great choice for faster responses). 



 Handle errors: Sometimes, transactions might fail due to network congestion or misconfigured endpoints. Always check your logs! 



 Optimize queries: Don’t pull unnecessary data. Limit your query to only what you need to avoid API limits. 
 



 Conclusion 



<p>Now that you know how to view and track Solana transactions like a pro, there’s nothing stopping you from diving deep into the world of Solana blockchain! Whether you’re building DApps, tracking NFT mints, or just keeping an eye on your assets, the transaction ID is your key to transparency and security.</p>

<p>Bain Capital Withdraws From Fuji Soft Bidding War As KKR Strengthens Position</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bain-capital/">Bain Capital</a> has discontinued its pursuit of Fuji Soft, ending its bidding war with KKR for the Japanese software company valued at over $4 billion. After planning a tender offer at ¥9,600 per share, Bain opted out following discussions with founder Hiroshi Nozawa. In contrast, KKR raised its offer to ¥9,850 per share and extended the tender period, having already secured a one-third stake in the company. This pattern highlights the growing influence of foreign private-equity firms in Japan’s M&amp;A market as companies restructure. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/bain-capital-ends-pursuit-of-fuji-soft-710198eb?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--niP2V0hbrT6zyNYJS6y29SuDSnELTKJ4RgPrkgdGPJP4hw8cxsfpPBSHNxq88Vgb-aADC">(Source)</a></p>

<p>DeepSeek Halts Chatbot App Downloads in South Korea Amid Privacy Concerns</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/deepseek-ai/">DeepSeek</a>, a Chinese AI startup, has paused downloads of its chatbot apps in South Korea due to privacy concerns raised by the Personal Information Protection Commission. The apps were removed from the App Store and Google Play, with DeepSeek agreeing to enhance privacy protections before relaunching. While existing users can still access the app, authorities advise against entering personal information. Concerns include unclear third-party data transfers and excessive data collection. Many South Korean agencies and companies have restricted the app’s use, with DeepSeek having around 1.2 million users in the country as of late January, second only to ChatGPT. <a href="https://www.securityweek.com/downloads-of-deepseeks-ai-apps-paused-in-south-korea-over-privacy-concerns/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--kLBVZgoG1FA9jmCFvVsWqqZ5C8UWABzKy_QmDxhavU6tviXS48o5EuJ5bxy55duQA4RWO">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Norway Indicts Four for $87 Million Crypto Fraud and Money Laundering Scheme</p>



<p>Norwegian authorities have indicted four individuals in an $87 million cryptocurrency fraud and money laundering scheme that defrauded thousands globally. The scam, disguised as a multi-level marketing operation, sold “product packages” with false promises of lucrative investments in gas, mining, and real estate. Investigators found no real investments were made, and it operated as a Ponzi scheme, using new deposits to pay earlier investors. Over 700 million kroner was laundered through a Norwegian law firm and transferred to accounts in Asia, aided by professional facilitators. <a href="https://crypto.news/87m-crypto-scam-uncovered-in-norway-four-individuals-indicted/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--kLBVZgoG1FA9jmCFvVsWqqZ5C8UWABzKy_QmDxhavU6tviXS48o5EuJ5bxy55duQA4RWO">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>UK Government Pressures Apple to Weaken iCloud Encryption, Sparking Privacy Concerns</p>



<p>Brazil has established a Federal Biometric Service to manage the issuance of the national identity card (CIN), which requires both fingerprint and facial biometrics in accordance with NIST, ISO/IEC, and ICAO standards. The system must comply with specific false non-identification and false positive rates for various match types. The law also requires liveness detection—Level 1 for low-risk and Level 2 for high-risk transactions—based on NIST evaluations. With 20 million CINs issued since 2022, the government plans to release its implementation strategy within 90 days, integrating this biometric service with the Gov.br digital identity system. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202502/brazil-establishes-federal-body-for-biometric-checks-id-card-issuance?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--kLBVZgoG1FA9jmCFvVsWqqZ5C8UWABzKy_QmDxhavU6tviXS48o5EuJ5bxy55duQA4RWO">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>US Court Ruling Against Ross Intelligence Sets Key Precedent In AI Copyright Law</p>



<p>A recent U.S. ruling against Ross Intelligence determined that using Thomson Reuters’ copyrighted headnotes for training its AI legal research platform infringes copyright, establishing a precedent in AI copyright law. This decision poses challenges for AI companies facing over 39 similar lawsuits by emphasizing the commercial impact of use rather than transformative fair use. While it doesn’t directly affect companies like OpenAI and Midjourney, it bolsters copyright holders’ positions, and experts believe the reasoning could apply to generative AI models, although the legal landscape is still evolving and may change on appeal. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/17/what-the-us-first-major-ai-copyright-ruling-might-mean-for-ip-law/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--niP2V0hbrT6zyNYJS6y29SuDSnELTKJ4RgPrkgdGPJP4hw8cxsfpPBSHNxq88Vgb-aADC">(Source)</a></p>

			 Nida Orhan is UX/UI Designer and Front-end Developer at Tokeny, she joined the company in 2017. 
 Reflecting on the 7-year Journey 
 You’ve been with the company since the very beginning, as the UX/UI Designer &amp; Front-end Developer. How has the company supported your growth during this time? 
<p>Over the past seven years, the company has given me the opportunity to take on diverse challenges that have expanded both my UX/UI design and frontend development skills. Working on multiple products simultaneously has strengthened my ability to manage priorities effectively while delivering high-quality designs. Working on complex challenges within our comprehensive platform has strengthened my ability to balance usability, technical constraints, and business objectives when designing UI solutions. I’ve gained extensive experience in Web3 UX design, frequently pioneering new UI patterns and crafting user experiences tailored to the evolving needs of DeFi and emerging technologies. The trust and autonomy I’ve been given have allowed me to experiment, learn, and continuously improve, while also staying up to date with the latest design trends and technologies. Additionally, the collaborative environment has provided a great space for exchanging ideas and learning from talented colleagues across different teams.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 Tokeny’s Culture Involvement 
 Tokeny has grown significantly since you joined. How has the company culture evolved in your opinion? 
<p>The company has maintained its core values of collaboration, innovation, and openness, even as it has grown. In the early days, everything was fast-paced and dynamic, with a smaller team making quick decisions. As we expanded, we introduced more structured processes, improving efficiency and ensuring that our work scaled effectively.</p>

		 
	 
                  
	 
		 
			 “Tokeny has retained a strong sense of teamwork and a supportive atmosphere, where everyone is encouraged to share ideas and contribute.” 

		 
	 
             
	 
		 
			 “Tokeny has retained a strong sense of teamwork and a supportive atmosphere, where everyone is encouraged to share ideas and contribute.” 

		 
	 
                 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe your own personal growth within the company? 
<p>Initially, my focus was purely on executing designs and implementing frontend features, but over time, I’ve taken on more responsibility in shaping the overall user experience of our products. Being the sole designer has required me to be adaptable, balancing creativity with practicality. As our team has expanded, I’ve gained valuable experience collaborating across departments and working with professionals from diverse backgrounds, enhancing my ability to communicate, adapt, and align design solutions with various perspectives.</p>

		 
	 
                           
	 
		 
			 “This journey has reinforced my confidence and problem-solving abilities, making me a stronger professional overall.” 

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			 “This journey has reinforced my confidence and problem-solving abilities, making me a stronger professional overall.” 

		 
	 
                  
	 
		 
			 Company Values in Practice 
 You mentioned in your previous interview how much you appreciated the collaborative and friendly team culture. Can you share an example of a project where you or your team used this collaboration, and how it was received? 
<p>One good example is the development of the token settings configuration. Due to its complexity, it required close collaboration between the product, design, development, and blockchain teams to create an intuitive user experience while staying within technical constraints. Through continuous iteration, feedback sessions, and collective problem-solving, we refined the interface into a solution that was both user-friendly and technically robust.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 Reflections and Future Outlook 
 If you could give advice to your younger self, just starting out at Tokeny, what would it be? 
<p>I would tell myself to embrace the fast-paced nature of a growing company and take initiative. In the beginning, I sometimes hesitated to push my ideas forward, but over time, I learned that being proactive and vocal about design decisions leads to better outcomes. Also, I’d remind myself that adaptability is key—things change rapidly, and staying flexible and considering future goals of the product while keeping the user experience at the center is the best approach.</p>

		 
	 
                       
	 
		 
			 “I see Tokeny further solidifying its position as a leader in digital asset infrastructure, with the ERC-3643 standard becoming more widely adopted across the industry.” 

		 
	 
                        
	 
		 
			 “I see Tokeny further solidifying its position as a leader in digital asset infrastructure, with the ERC-3643 standard becoming more widely adopted across the industry.” 

		 
	 
                       
	 
		 
			 As someone who has been with the company through significant milestones, where do you see Tokeny going in the next five years, and how do you envision your role evolving in that journey? 
<p>As Tokeny scales, establishing and growing a strong network and community around this ERC-3643 standard will be crucial, alongside continuous innovation in new products. This evolution will introduce more sophisticated UX/UI challenges, demanding increasingly agile and adaptive design approaches. I envision myself playing a key role in shaping these advancements, ensuring our solutions remain both powerful and user-friendly.</p>

 By Steve McCown 



<p>Today’s news is filled with articles and discussions about digital identity, credentials, passwordless logins, etc. Inevitably, articles gravitate towards digital wallets, some pending ‘wallet war’, and who will win it. The short answer is … everyone.</p>



<p>When modern digital identity technologies emerged, they introduced new cryptography, keys, tokens, and other security data and they required a specialized type of storage that developers called a ‘wallet’. Wallet apps quickly emerged to enable users – with no interest in cryptography other than it increases security and privacy – to push a button and securely access whichever service they were seeking. Lots of wallet apps emerged … and Apple, Google, Samsung, Microsoft, etc. all took notice.</p>



<p>Today, the Apple Wallet or the Google Wallet is on nearly every mobile. So, did they win the so-called wallet war? Sort of, but not exactly. Depending on which mobile device you use, you have an Apple or Google wallet and almost certainly use it. However, whether you know it or not, you have other ‘wallets’ on your device and you use them regularly, too.</p>



<p>As one example, most airlines have their own wallet, but they don’t call it a wallet. Flying <a href="https://www.delta.com/">Delta Airlines</a>? You probably have the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fly-delta/id388491656">Fly Delta app</a>. This app lets you search, compare, and book flights. It helps you change seats to get that inch or two of extra leg room. It also prompts you to check in, creates a boarding pass, and even helps you find your new gate when your flight is moved. For identity, it manages your government ID data, your passport, and credit cards. For air travel, it does pretty much everything. So, why are we still using the Apple Wallet?</p>



<p>While the Fly Delta app focuses on Delta’s flying experience, the Apple Wallet (or Google Wallet) does a bunch of other random, but really important, things. It stores payments and lets you pay online and at contactless terminals, and maintains an itemized list of purchases. It also stores insurance cards, movie tickets, membership cards, and a limitless set of cards with QR codes. So, if Apple’s wallet does all of that, why would you need anything else?</p>



<p>While the Apple Wallet is very general purpose, it can’t do all the specialized things that apps like Delta’s do. While you’ll use Delta’s to search, book, and carry out your travel plans, Fly Delta also lets you save your boarding pass as a card with flight info and a boarding QR code into your Apple Wallet. Why do they work together? Isn’t there a war over wallet adoption? Not really.</p>



<p>While the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">Browser Wars</a> battled over control of your web experience, today’s wallet apps specialize by providing different functionality, which means you will likely want several – and you will want to them to work together. Domination may have been the previous goal, but today, we want our apps to work together to give us a seamless, interoperable experience as we bounce from app to site to service and then into another app. Consumers want an easy, seamless experience that just works – since that’s how we think.</p>



<p>So, is a wallet an app or a feature of an app?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The answer is yes, because wallets (or rather wallet functionality) are in everything. Some apps are called wallets (e.g., <a href="https://www.apple.com/wallet/">Apple Wallet</a>, <a href="https://wallet.google/">Google Wallet</a>) and we see them that way. Some apps have wallets inside (e.g., <a href="https://www.delta.com/us/en/delta-digital/mobile">Fly Delta</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a>) and we use them that way. Don’t get hung up on whether an app is a wallet, or a wallet is (part of) an app. Ask two questions and keep asking them:</p>



 
 Is it secure? Does it use all the right encryption and standardized protocols and does use them in the right way?&nbsp; 



 Does it maintain YOUR privacy? Does it keep your data private, or does it sell your identity, purchase, and usage data and exchange all that with social media and data brokers? &nbsp; 
 



<p>Keep asking those questions, ask them of every provider, and don’t stop asking. As you ask about wallet privacy and security, you can also ask whether they comply with the latest industry standards. Emerging standards help providers enhance security and privacy, comply with national legislation (e.g., GDPR), and avoid data breach embarrassments. A new generation of cryptographic identity standards and protocols are currently available from industry standards organizations, such as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>, <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF)</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/foundation/">OpenID Foundation</a>, <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP</a>, etc. These standards groups are creating blueprints that are becoming the backbone of national legislation, such as Europe’s <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">eIDAS Regulation</a>, which “facilitates secure cross-border transactions by establishing a framework for digital identity and authentication … to create confidence in electronic interactions and promote seamless digital services in the EU.”</p>



<p>So, is a wallet an app or does an app contain a wallet? While the answer is a definitive yes, now you know that the real questions are How is it built?, Does it comply with industry standards?, and Will it protect my identity and my data?</p>

<p>2024 was a pivotal year for the adoption of mobile driver’s licenses (mDL), with many new states moving to adopt this new form of privacy- and security-enhancing digital identity. However, many of these projects are still being tested, with elements still to be explored and refined.</p><p>One of those is accessibility in emerging technology. Digital credentials like mDL are crucial to many basic aspects of life, like all forms of identity documentation, and must be usable by as many people as possible. It’s vital to ensure, for instance, that the visually impaired can present credentials in various contexts. There are upsides to explore, too: What benefits might people gain from new digital identity tools?</p><p>The good news is that, while challenges remain, mobile devices and apps already offer comprehensive accessibility options that extend to digital credentials—in fact, mobile devices have become powerful tools for improving the lives of those with disabilities. For some types of disabilities, such as mobility impairments, digital credentials offer further quality-of-life improvements.</p> What Does Accessibility Mean? <p>Information technology built for accessibility must abide by four core principles outlined by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">World Wide Web Consortium</a>. These principles are sometimes referred to by the acronym POUR, for Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.</p><p>Tools should be Perceivable even for those with constrained senses; they should be Operable with a variety of input mechanisms, including keyboards, touch, or voice controls; and they should be clear so they’re easily Understandable. Finally, infrastructure should be Robust in its formatting and presentation, enabling a variety of user agents and assistive technologies to interpret and present data to users.</p><p>For state and local governments in the U.S., making web and mobile tools accessible is mandatory under the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/2024-03-08-web-rule/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> and its evolving rules. These rules ensure that everyone can benefit from the convenience of the internet to engage with vital government processes like voting and paying taxes.</p><p>But serving as many users as possible is also just good business for private firms: more than 4 million Americans, for instance, have<a href="https://www.afb.org/research-and-initiatives/statistics/adults-vision-loss-nhis?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> serious or total loss of vision</a>, 11 million have <a href="https://nationaldeafcenter.org/faq/how-many-deaf-people-live-in-the-united-states/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">serious hearing loss or total deafness</a>, and more than 12%, or 40 million, have<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/disability-and-health/articles-documents/disability-impacts-all-of-us-infographic.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> impaired mobility</a>. Overall, according to the CDC, nearly 29% of American adults have some form of disability.</p><p>That’s not a group businesses can afford to leave underserved.</p> Digital Tools for the Visually Impaired <p>The first accessibility challenge you’re likely to consider when thinking about the mobile driver’s license is for users with visual impairments. For example, one common way a digital credential might be presented is as a QR code, which is likely to be quite difficult for someone who can’t see the scanning device.</p><p>The good news is that the phone itself is far less of an obstacle. A sighted person might assume that the lack of tactile feedback like braille would make using a smartphone nearly impossible for a blind person, but in fact, <a href="https://lifeofablindgirl.com/2019/02/03/how-do-blind-and-visually-impaired-people-use-a-mobile-phone/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">smartphones have shown many advantages for the blind</a>. Thanks to screen-reader software and gesture-based controls built natively into both Apple and Android devices, according to one expert, “the vast majority of everyday actions that needed the help of a third person a few years ago <a href="https://www.inclusivecitymaker.com/the-smartphone-a-revolution-for-the-blind-and-visually-impaired/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">can now be done on the phone.</a>”</p><p>For mDL users, that means a screen reader will let them find the correct wallet and credentials. As VDCs become more common, this might even become a more accessible option than paper credentials: It’s relatively rare for certifications or identity documents to be offered with braille options, and while the percentage of visually impaired people who use braille is not well-studied, it seems surprisingly low:<a href="https://www.rnib.org.uk/news/two-centuries-later-braille-is-still-as-important-as-ever-says-teenage-sight-loss-campaigner?ref=blog.spruceid.com"> only about 7% in the U.K.</a>, for instance. Digital credentials could, in practical terms, be more accessible than paper documents.&nbsp;</p><p>This does require the designers of credentials and wallets to comply with the POUR tenet of robustness: data must be easy to read for a variety of user agents. While wallet designers will need to be specifically attentive here, one of the great strengths of verifiable digital credentials is that they conform to universal standards – meaning that the data in the credentials themselves will be consistently categorized and formatted by default, making it easy for agents to interpret for users.</p><p>Read More: <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/who-should-build-a-digital-wallet-2/">Who Should Build a Digital Wallet?</a></p><p>The question of scanning or presenting credentials in various contexts is thornier. While we don’t claim to have the answer, one possible route would be to use sound to guide users to a scanner: a scaled-down analog to the <a href="https://www.okeenea.com/en/audio-beacon?ref=blog.spruceid.com">audio beacons</a> that are common for U.S. crosswalks and increasingly used in other settings.&nbsp;</p> Security as Accessibility <p>The largest group of Americans with disabilities is people who face cognitive impairments, defined as serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions. A substantial portion of this group is made up of older Americans – and they are disproportionately victims of <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5508139/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">fraud and phishing attempts</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While VDCs can't stop scammers from asking for an intrusive amount of personal data or prevent phishing of passwords, they can bring an additional element of security to common transactions with trusted verifiers, such that any fraudulent activity will stand out. If a bank is routinely asking for a verifiable digital credential before transferring money, it will be obvious if that credential isn't required or if the verifier is not the normal requester for a fraudulent transfer.</p><p>Of course, mDL and other forms of VDC are novel technologies that may be off-putting or confusing for those with cognitive impairments, regardless of their theoretical benefits. This is one important reason that VDC-based identity, whatever its advantages, should be offered as an optional, convenient supplement for paper-based documents rather than a required substitute.</p> The Big Benefit of Digital Credentials: Secure Remote Services <p>Mobility impairment is the second-largest type of disability impacting Americans after cognitive impairment. This is where the mobile driver’s license and other VDCs have the potential to truly shine: because they are reliable for acceptance online, digital credentials can enable new kinds of remote services for people who face challenges moving around. This potentially includes not just reliably proving identity online but eventually presenting a variety of other documents, from <a href="https://blog.spruceid.com/stories-from-the-future-how-new-u-s-digital-identity-rules-will-change-our-lives/">marriage certificates to property titles and medical history</a>.</p><p>Discussion around digital credentials has often touched specifically on financial services and benefits provision, particularly relevant for people with a disability since some may receive financial assistance. Reliable digital identity and credentials can also open employment opportunities for the mobility impaired: remote work is ideal for many people with mobility challenges, and digital credentials used for secure access control can make more roles available remotely.</p><p>While work remains to carefully understand and address user needs, a close look shows that digital credentials are starting from a very strong position for accessibility. As the verifiable digital credential ecosystem develops, SpruceID is committed to maximizing that potential for the benefit of all Americans.</p> Explore Accessible Verifiable Digital Credentials <p>At SpruceID, we’re committed to making digital identity solutions accessible, secure, and user-friendly for everyone.

 How do you live in a house that isn’t property? How might reimagining our relationship with the house create space for Indigenous Reconciliation? And how might this support the thriving of the next seven generations? <a href="https://radiclecivics.cc/">Radicle Civics</a>, <a href="https://www.7gencities.org/">7GenCities</a> and the <a href="https://www.darkmatterlabs.property/">Property &amp; Beyond Lab</a> explore this proposition in one of the first exhibitions and workshops on FreeHouse Tkaronto. <p>In early October last year, Dark Matter Labs and 7GenCities, by the kind invitation of our friends at Evergreen, participated in the annual Evergreen Conference 2024, on the <a href="https://www.evergreen.ca/learn-and-discover/the-evergreen-conference/the-evergreen-conference-2024/">theme of “unlocking public spaces for people and planet.”</a> Apart from hosting a workshop on our toolkit for Open Space Resilience Tool Embedding Reconciliation, developed by <a href="https://treesasinfrastructure.com/">TreesAI</a> and 7GenCities for Evergreen, we also showcased for the first time in public our FreeHouse Tkaronto proposition, as a conference exhibit and a workshop. This blog documents our work so far, and what’s coming&nbsp;next.</p> What is FreeHouse? FreeHouse at the Desgin Museum’s Future Observatory Display<p>FreeHouse, a concept of a self-owning house existing beyond property relations, has been an ongoing exploration across many parts of DML, including most recently as a <a href="https://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/future-observatory-display">display at the Design Museum’s Future Observatory exhibition</a>, and a Life Ennobling Economics and Radicle Civics discussion on how <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/non-extractive-financing-for-a-house-a-green-tinted-fantasy-or-a-realistic-proposition-1710a2ead629">housing can be financed non-extractively</a>. For us, self-ownership is a core provocation of the <a href="https://www.darkmatterlabs.property/">Property &amp; Beyond Lab</a> and creates the space to ask critical questions about our relationship with housing, including:</p>  How do you live in a house that owns itself?<br>If there isn’t an owner that has all the rights over a house because it owns itself, how can we make decisions over housing and its value for the&nbsp;commons?  What if a house could generate value beyond extracting rent?<br>Housing is treated as a commodity that allows the owner to extract rent. But a house could generate energy, reduce flood risk, improve biodiversity, sequester carbon, improve health, and more. What would generative housing look like&nbsp;instead?  What if the materials of a house are leased from the Earth and not owned?<br>A house is made up of many materials, some of which often end up in landfill at the end of its life. If we didn’t own the house’s materials but they were on loan from the Earth, how might we care for and reuse them more responsibly?   FreeHouse Tkaronto: a housing model that creates space for restoring longstanding Indigenous relationships with the&nbsp;land <p>FreeHouse Tkaronto is our first place-based proof-of-possibility proposed for Toronto, building on our collaborator Callum Nolan’s research on the viability of regenerative housing models on Toronto’s ravines.</p><p>What we call Toronto occupies the homeland of present-day Treaty 13 holders, the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation and the ancestral homelands of the Anishinaabeg, Wendat and Haudenosaunee Confederacies. Not only do we acknowledge their custodianship over this land, but we should also understand that these and other Nations have sacred, longstanding and multivalent relationships with the land based on kinship, reciprocity and stewardship that have cared for this land over generations.</p><p>It is only since the imposition by colonialism of western conceptions of property — the idea of enclosing and controlling a piece of land — that property has become the predominant form of relationship between humans and the land. This has underpinned many of the systemic issues around housing inequality today, which are especially stark in the context of Toronto, where <a href="https://torontofoundation.ca/vitalsigns-issue-2/">house prices are growing four times faster than incomes</a>, while housing supply is failing to meet growing demand, with <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/research-reports/housing-and-homelessness-research-and-reports/social-housing-waiting-list-reports/">almost 93,000 on the social housing wait&nbsp;list</a>.</p>Canada is an outlier among G7 countries in terms of housing unaffordability, measured by real house price to income ratio. Image source: Callum Nolan based on data from&nbsp;OECD<p>FreeHouse Tkaronto, as a demonstrator of a house beyond property relations, is therefore not for us just a thought exercise, but a critical step in Indigenous reconciliation. We hope to prove the possibility of an alternative housing model that moves beyond property and extraction, and instead recenters Indigenous land relationships built on interdependent and reciprocal interactions with the land and structures that we create as home. FreeHouse Tkaronto could prove a pathway for systems change, decolonising the problematic systems that have underpinned the multiple crises we face, from climate to&nbsp;housing.</p> Why Toronto’s ravines? <p>Toronto’s ravine system is one of the things that makes the city unique: these blue-green networks of rivers and urban forests run all the way from its green belt to its city centre, and is in fact the largest in any city in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>There is already an intergenerational tradition of Indigenous stewardship in the ravines. Ravines have naturally demarcated territory before superimposed property and administrative lines, their streams and rivers made them a hub of trade and travel, and the site of many communities and settlements. The Carrying Place trail followed what is now known as the Humber River, and was one of the most important First Nations trade&nbsp;routes.</p>Mapping the social factors of the ravines, from land ownership, Indigenous sacred fire sites, to existing community housing. Image source: Callum&nbsp;Nolan<p>Restoring connections and access to the land is a critical dimension of Indigenous reconciliation today. In more recent years, there have been Indigenous stewardship initiatives of municipally-managed lands, such as the role of Indigenous Land Stewardship Circle in Toronto’s High Park Oak Savannahs, and the Nikibii Dawadinna Giigwag land-based learning and sustainable urban design program. These initiatives situate diverse Indigenous knowledges within conservation and regenerative land relationships, and provide opportunity and access to land for urban Indigenous Community, as part of a deeper reconciliation process.</p><p>Since Ontario’s Conservation Authorities Act 1946, the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA) is responsible for managing the ravines, with a unique governance arrangement. TRCA owns up to 60% of the land designated as ravines, where it has management agreements with the City of Toronto. For land the TRCA does not own but falls within the ravine designation, TRCA requirements take precedence over all other regulations (e.g. for building permits), and TRCA undertakes work for environmental/ remediation purposes, including on private land (e.g. backyards) that fall under this designation. The TRCA and the City of Toronto are critical decision-makers in how the ravines are stewarded.</p><p>The TRCA recognises the value that the ravines provide to the city: they estimate that the ravines contribute <a href="https://pub-trca.escribemeetings.com/filestream.ashx?DocumentId=5227">ecosystem services worth CA$800 million annually</a> and they admit this is a conservative estimate where over half of this figure is the social value from the use of the ravines for recreation, with only a select number of co-benefits accounted with an existing body of evidence. The value of flood risk mitigation, biodiversity (beyond the social value of “knowing natural areas exist”), and its synergetic impact on urban climate resilience is notably&nbsp;absent.</p>Mapping the ecological factors of the ravines, from restoration priority, water quality, vegetation health, to ongoing remediation projects. Image source: Callum&nbsp;Nolan<p>Yet not all ravine land is fulfilling its full regenerative potential for Toronto’s commons. Callum Nolan’s remote sensing and GIS analysis of the ravine network, using water quality data and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) imaging (an indicator of vegetation greenness and plant health), reveals parts of the ravine system that have been degraded due to human intervention, including hard surfaces and canalisation, contrary to the ravines’ popular image as “untouched wilderness.” This is corroborated by the TRCA’s own Integrated Restoration Prioritization index which identifies parts of the ravines with high priority for ecosystem restoration, based on aggregating metrics such as natural cover, aquatic systems, altered hydrology, connectivity and natural heritage value. By combining multiple metrics, we can already begin to identify potential sites which could host an alternative model for restoring and caring for the&nbsp;ravines.</p> Reconciliation and restoration on the ravines: a strategic opportunity <p>The FreeHouse Tkaronto proposition is simple: creating regenerative, truly affordable housing on degraded land along valuable ravine ecosystems for residents who will support land stewardship inspired by Indigenous land practices.</p><p>The model works in two parts: firstly the FreeHouse’s regenerative design principles will ensure that the home is built in a non-extractive and sustainable way. This crucially recontextualises the home not as a commodity, but a confluence of relationships: that with its inhabitants (comfort, design for minimal maintenance, the steward’s rights), and the wider ecosystem (energy use and generation, heating, urban drainage, biodiversity and use of resources). The development of the FreeHouse will also provide an opportunity to remediate the past ecologically-damaging interventions of the site as part of its landscaping, such as reusing or removing grey infrastructure while restoring naturalised watercourses, and re-wilding the riparian landscape.</p><p>Secondly, the model recognises that Indigenous knowledges and practices are rooted in an embodied presence on the land. How would a steward who actually lives on the land understand the entangled ecological and social relationships around the ravines differently from a conservation worker who manages it as part of a portfolio of responsibilities? And how would this embodied knowledge shape how they care for the land differently?</p><p>We suggest that, under guidance and leadership of Indigenous knowledge holders, a model of resident stewardship could support the flourishing of the ravines and the value they add to the city’s commons. This could be through supporting activities to restore and preserve the ravine environment (e.g. caring for saplings), or developing intelligence of the ecosystem’s health through experiencing it daily (e.g. observing wildlife, plant health, water quality, etc.). This builds on initiatives that already exist in the ravine context, such the Indigenous-led <a href="https://turtleprotectors.com/">Turtle Protectors program</a>, and the TRCA’s own efforts, such as its <a href="https://trca.ca/conservation/sustainable-neighbourhoods/">Sustainable Neighbourhood Action Plan (SNAP) programs</a>, which involve local communities in the stewardship of urban nature in their areas. There are also <a href="https://parks.canada.ca/culture/autochtones-indigenous/cercle-circle">initiatives across Canada</a> to enable Indigenous stewardship in public land practices.</p>The strategy weaves together a commons of multiple actors across the&nbsp;ravines.<p>It is the ambition of the model to realise housing as a genuine commons: weaving together multiple actors, from Indigenous stewardship leads, residents, to public authorities in mutually beneficial relationships, and creating value in their entanglement that is greater than the sum of its parts. This would also be reflected in the strategic design components required, such as the governance and decision-making design of this commons, the stewardship agreement between resident and the commons, and frameworks for understanding the multivalent and holistic outcomes created by the FreeHouse and the steward’s care.</p> Exhibition and Workshop at the Evergreen Brickworks The Freehouse Tkaronto display at the Evergreen Conference<p>As part of the two-day Evergreen Conference, we were offered the opportunity to exhibit at Brickworks’ Young Centre, where we showcased the FreeHouse Tkaronto proposition in public for the first&nbsp;time.</p><p>Apart from exhibition boards that summarise the FreeHouse Tkaronto proposition, the exhibition also featured provocative objects that captured the FreeHouse concept, including those featured in our Design Museum’s Future Observatory exhibition. This included a sample of a cross-laminated timber structure ‘on loan from the Earth’ showing repairs and records of its past lives. A ‘receipt for ecosystem services’ was also displayed, to raise questions over what generative value a house could have beyond extracting rent. As an interactive conversation prompt, we also had a mock stewardship agreement with flash cards allowing visitors to suggest what a fair combination of rights and responsibilities for a FreeHouse resident should&nbsp;be.</p><p>The exhibition also summarised our analysis of the ravines within the city limits, understanding the different entangled relationships that are inherent in ravine land in two maps. In ‘Ecology of the Ravines’, we show NDVI analysis, water quality, Integrated Restoration priority, and areas of TRCA ownership together with a selection of relevant conservation projects. In ‘Community around the Ravines’, we map out lost/buried rivers, significant Indigenous historical sites, sacred fire sites, community housing schemes, in relation to areas of TRCA ownership and ravine and green space zoning designations, with a selection of Indigenous and community-led initiatives.</p><p>Finally, the exhibition features an illustrative drawing of a FreeHouse Tkaronto situated in the landscape, exploring what the different forms of value the ravines create for the city, and how this could be augmented by the FreeHouse design and the resident stewards.</p><p>The Evergreen Conference provided an opportunity to receive feedback from actors involved in placemaking, from architects and urban designers, members of community organisations, environmental consultants, to people who work for municipal and conservation authorities. Visitors were invited to leave their feedback, with a few recurring themes that stood out. There was appreciation of the power in fundamental reframing ideas about property in relation to housing and resources that have been embedded deeply in the very&nbsp;culture.</p><p>However, there were also concerns over the fact that much local political effort has been invested in ensuring that ravines are protected from development. Even if the FreeHouse Tkaronto strategy aimed to remediate the ecologically-degraded parts of the ravine, it could set a precedent for ravine development, including in its more extractive forms. We will work closely with the TRCA, as the permitting authority for ravine land, to ensure that this unintended consequence is&nbsp;avoided.</p><p>Finally, we also learned of existing precedents for an integrated stewardship-housing model in and around Toronto. For example, Parks Canada’s Rouge National Urban Park, operates realty services for properties (including residential) inside the national park, <a href="https://parks.canada.ca/pn-np/on/rouge/info/serviceimmobilier-realty/who">offering leases for tenants who commit to responsible stewardship</a> of the heritage buildings, and protecting the built and natural environment of the park. <a href="https://trca.ca/conservation/trca-property-management/">The TRCA, which also owns 118 residential properties</a>, also similarly leases homes on a stewardship basis. These serve as local precedents for models of combining housing, stewardship in conservation areas, on which FreeHouse Tkaronto can&nbsp;build.</p> Rightsholder &amp; Stakeholder Engagement Workshop Rightsholder and stakeholder workshop at the Evergreen Brickworks<p>On the day after the Evergreen Conference, we organised a half-day workshop to take a focused deep dive into the proposition for feedback and exploring next steps. It was co-hosted by 7GenCities (Jayne Engle, Tanya Chung-Tiam-Fook), Dark Matter Labs (Calvin Po, Callum Nolan, Sofia Valentini), and the City of Toronto’s Indigenous Affairs Office (Selina Young, Fred Martin, Emma&nbsp;Cooper).</p><p>Attendees also represented different stakeholders in the system. This included:</p>  Dr Hopi Martin from Edge of the Bush (Ojibwe Developmental Psychology and Education Oshkaabewis — Sacred Helper, Messenger, Fire Keeper, Lodge Caretaker)  Colleagues from across different parts of the&nbsp;TRCA:  Sonia Dhir (TRCA’s government and community relations liaison)  Steven Heuchert (TRCA’s development, planning, and&nbsp;permits)  Edlyn Wong (TRCA’s property)  Nicola Hives from the Toronto Foundation  Michelle Baldwin from Community Foundations of&nbsp;Canada  Lois Lindsay from Evergreen Canada who also kindly provided the venue situated in the heart of the Don Valley and the&nbsp;ravines.  <p>It should be noted that pre-workshop briefings and conversations were held with some of the attendees, as well as a number of Indigenous Elders and housing and community advisors who were unable to attend the workshop at the Brick Works. Ideas, concerns and recommendations from these engagement sessions helped to shape and refine thinking, design and planning of the workshop and exhibit, and overall&nbsp;project.</p><p>The workshop began in ceremony with the asemaa or sacred tobacco teaching co-led by Dr. Hopi Martin (Lenni Lenape + European) and Fred Martin (Anishinaabe + Mi’kmaq), and deep sharing of local Anishinaabe knowledge and wisdom traditions situated on the land and in place, within the context of Waasayishkodenayosh or the Lower Don River watershed. An Waabizheshi Oshkaabewis of the Ojibwe Martin Clan (Sacred Helper, Messenger, Fire Keeper, Lodge Caretaker), Hopi’s generous teachings wove together a rich, multi-layered spiritual, cultural and natural basket to hold and nourish the dialogues and collective sensemaking. Hopi leads the Edge of the Bush, an Indigenous-led land-based learning initiative with partners like Evergreen. Fred is Senior Project Manager at the Indigenous Affairs Office and Waterfront Secretariat, City of&nbsp;Toronto.</p><p>The Indigenous co-holder at 7GenCities, Tanya (Akawaio-Kapon/mixed), shared a futuring narrative she created for the initiative, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1doDlaB7zsGFypR_PxTP_lpVunsaSKtaE/edit">FreeHouse Tkaronto: Reimagining our relationships to land and housing as a common good</a>, where she invited us to collectively imagine a future Tkaronto where we were re-rooted into the lineage of place and First Peoples, landscapes, entangled human and more-than-human relationships, and Indigenous stewardship traditions of the Lower Don watershed and ravines. She invited us to imagine manifesting an emergent housing system based on deeper, more reciprocal and re-sacralized land relationships, where housing is allocated and governed as a common good. To imagine also FreeHouse Tkaronto as a proof of possibility for a vibrant housing commons embedded in: intrinsic forms of valuation, collectively defined and mutually agreed upon resident and land stewardship rights, and roles and responsibilities inspired and guided by diverse, long held Indigenous land protocols and practices.</p>Rightsholder and stakeholder workshop at the Evergreen Brickworks<p>Jayne, Calvin and Callum then gave a recap of the FreeHouse Tkaronto concept and how it sits in the wider context of 7GenCities and Dark Matter Labs’ work, and building on the learnings of <a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/oa-edit/10.4324/9781003199816/sacred-civics-jayne-engle-julian-agyeman-tanya-chung-tiam-fook">Sacred Civics: Building Seven Generation Cities </a>(Engle, Agyeman &amp; Chung-Tiam-Fook, 2022) and <a href="https://cdn.sanity.io/files/gg6r1tfm/production/32778190c96f1fc092be8d251483b8782f163354.pdf">FreeLand</a>. The structure of the workshop was focused on collecting feedback across different parts of the proposition, and then taking a deeper dive into selected comments for open discussion.</p><p>One of the most important comments that arose is how our work learns the lessons of Indigenous place-based knowledge. For example, ‘Tkaronto’, originates from the Kanyen’kehà:ka phrase meaning “where there are trees standing in the water.” This etymology for what would become the city Toronto’s name, and also the name of our FreeHouse, embodies a special relationship with water and the natural watercourses. It was also raised that in some First Nations languages, city is conceptualized in more inclusive and relational ways, such as the Nêhiyaw (Cree) word for city: otenaw literally translates as ‘a circle of hearts coming together’. Indigenous languages and narratives should be central in communicating the vision of FreeHouse, and what it means for humanity and the planet being in relationship, instead of the technical language of policy, such as ‘frameworks’ and ‘mapping’, that DML is often accustomed to. We should therefore also reflect on different media of communication, beyond ‘decks’ and ‘papers’, and consider the role of the arts and other forms of storytelling.</p><p>This was also related to a reflection about how FreeHouse Tkaronto relates to the wider political context over Indigenous reconciliation. It was noted that it is coming up to ten years since the Truth and Reconciliation Commission was concluded, which is a key milestone for assessing progress. There was also a discussion about how FreeHouse Tkaronto and the concepts of self-ownership and stewardship sits in relation to Land Back movements, and the tensions that will need to be addressed.</p><p>Understanding the wider context of historic injustice will be essential in finding the right approach. Engagement of, and centering, Indigenous Community and Indigenous housing leadership at all stages of visioning, building and implementing a proof of possibility was deemed paramount by Indigenous co-hosts. When considering how we will design governance and decision-making processes, there was a question of what Indigenous-led stewardship means tangibly. It was raised that, based on past experiences, Indigenous People having an equal seat at the table is not enough. We must consider what safeguards need to be put in place, who might need to give up power, and also what systems need to change to enable this approach.</p><p>Similarly, the financing approach must not simply “look for new money” but be aware of the overwhelming wealth that has been extracted by dispossessing Indigenous Peoples of their lands and breaking treaty agreements. When the legal and regulatory barriers to this work are encountered, their role in entrenching and reinforcing the status quo should be considered, as should their origins and legitimacy, especially in relation to natural and Indigenous laws. It was suggested that a ‘regulatory sandbox’ approach can be used to carve out a space for restoring these&nbsp;systems.</p><p>The current approaches to conservation are still very much oriented around ‘control’, rather than one of ‘being in relation’. There have been attempts at <a href="https://trca.ca/conservation/restoration/ecosystem-compensation/">ecosystem compensation</a> which aims to quantify and replace loss of ecosystem value with creation and restoration projects, but this is still based on a premise of avoiding harm and could move further towards regeneration. The balance between a holistic approach and measurable outcomes will also require consideration, especially when accepting funding and investment. Furthermore, there is much political capital invested in this paradigm of control (especially over development permits) as it is seen as “the last protection left” for the ravines from being developed, echoing feedback from the exhibition.</p><p>For FreeHouse Tkaronto to serve as a demonstrator of regenerative approaches, it must navigate these tensions carefully. One compelling suggestion was that instead of building literally in ravine-designated areas, FreeHouse could choose ecologically-degraded sites adjacent to ravine land. The remediation would therefore be a way of “extending the ravine network”, creating net positive ecological value while avoiding the political risk of setting precedents for ravine development and opening the door to expanding settlement in the ravines. This would also sidestep some of the practical difficulties (e.g. safe access and insurability challenges) associated with flood and erosion-prone land. A Sustainable Drainage Strategy (SuDS) strategy for ravine-adjacent land could also reduce downstream risk, as demonstrated in similar precedents such as Mimico&nbsp;Creek.</p>An indicative mapping study of potential sites that can ‘extend the ravines’ through the regenerative development of FreeHouses, subject to further analysis on property ownership.<p>Our initial mapping study above, based on an indicative sample area of the city, is already highlighting a number of potential sites. We have identified vacant land or unproductive surface parking lots adjacent to the TRCA-regulated ravines area could be remediated as a way of “extending the ravines” while developing FreeHouse Tkaronto. As part of further site analysis studies, which would be conducted as part of the next phase of work, we would further refine the study by considering additional search criteria such as land ownership. We could explore how these ravine-adjacent opportunities coincide with lands that are publicly owned (whether at a municipal, provincial, or federal level) where there is a compelling case to use them to generate value for the public good. Other factors affecting the viability of FreeHouse development would also be considered.</p><p>A potential site for prototyping FreeHouse Tkaronto connected to the 72km circular Loop Trail in Toronto’s Don Valley ravine network, is at a very early stage of discussion with Evergreen. Another possible site suggested was the car park of the new TRCA headquarters, which has unrealised land use and ecological restoration potential.</p> Next steps <p>We are in the developmental stage of building foundations and partnerships for this emergent project and we will continue to work on ideating and co-building this work in 2025, with potential next steps including:</p><p>We will continue building FreeHouse Tkaronto as a proof of possibility in an extremely timely moment of housing crisis; emerging recognition for Truth &amp; Reconciliation and Indigenous leadership (including land stewardship approaches); climate breakdown; political and economic uncertainty; and rising momentum for transformative innovation in housing and civic infrastructures, regenerative land relationships, and collaborative and Indigenous co-led governance approaches. This work includes:</p>  Continue to build relationships and partnerships with interested co-builders, rights holders and stakeholders, and&nbsp;funders  Continue to explore and develop key foundations: i.e. ravine ecology and climate resilience, Indigenous land stewardship and regenerative value, design and delivery, regulatory and legal considerations, residence stewardship agreement and multi-actor governance, and financing and funding&nbsp;options.  Secure substantial funding for this developmental work on the project, as well as to build the prototype.  Deepening engagement with Indigenous Community i.e. local Knowledge Keepers, urban housing organisations and land stewards; and non-Indigenous local land stewards including a community engagement workshop.  Continuing site analysis and selection studies for FreeHouse prototype e.g. assess feasibility and risks of potential ecologically-degraded sites adjacent to ravine land in the Don Valley, Tkaronto, and their potential to generate ecological and social&nbsp;value.  Studying context-based precedents of housing commons and Indigenous land stewardship and co-governance relevant to Tkaronto context: e.g. community land trusts and Toronto’s Port Lands Waterfront Revitalization and Indigenous Cultural Revitalization.  <p>We will have take a special focus on planning the governance design process for FreeHouse Tkaronto:</p>  Developing ideas for structuring collaborative governance including Indigenous co-governance;  Exploring the challenges of multi-actor governance i.e. time needed to build consensus while maintaining momentum; finding shared&nbsp;purpose;  Prioritizing Indigenous perspectives and co-leadership; and  Mapping the design journey, with transparency in sharing challenges, decisions, and influence of institutional and political systems.

 Deep Search Tools and Techniques on Google 



<p>Google offers a range of deep search tools that allow you to find exactly what you need. With simple tricks like using quotation marks or excluding keywords, you can save time and quickly access the information you need.</p>



 Search for Exact Phrases 



<p>When you want to perform an advanced search for an exact phrase, the best method is to put it in quotation marks. This tells Google that you’re only interested in pages with that exact phrase.</p>



<p>Example search: “Deep search techniques”</p>



<p>This will return pages that contain the exact phrase “Deep search techniques” as you requested.</p>



 Excluding Keywords 



<p>To eliminate irrelevant results, you can use the minus sign (-). Simply add a minus sign in front of any keyword you want to exclude from the advanced search results.</p>



<p>Example search: SEO -Facebook</p>



<p>This will find SEO-related information, but without any results related to Facebook.</p>



 Using “OR” in Searches 



<p>When you want to search for either one keyword or another, use the “OR” operator (must be in uppercase).</p>



<p>Example search: “SEO” OR “Digital Marketing”</p>



<p>This will return results related to both SEO and Digital Marketing, expanding the scope of your deep search.</p>



 Search by Text, Title, or URL 



<p>You can search for information within a page’s content, title, or URL using operators like allintext:, allintitle:, and allinurl:.</p>



<p>Example search: allintext:”Advanced search”</p>



<p>This will return pages that include the phrase “Advanced search” in their text content.</p>


 
 


 Other Deep Search Tricks 



<p>In addition to these basic tricks, there are many other deep search techniques to help you extract information faster and more accurately. You can try special commands like “site:”, “related:”, or “link:” to find information more effectively in specific situations.</p>



 Search Within a Specific Website 



<p>If you want to perform an advanced search within a specific website, use the site: operator.</p>



<p>Example search: site:seothetop.com “SEO”</p>



<p>This will return articles related to “SEO” only from the website seothetop.com.</p>



 Search for Related Websites 



<p>Use the related: command to find websites with similar content to the one you know.</p>



<p>Example search: related:seothetop.com</p>



<p>This will help you explore websites with similar content, useful when searching for alternative sources of information.</p>



 Search for Websites Containing Links 



<p>If you want to find websites that link to a specific page, use the link: operator.</p>



<p>Example search: link:seothetop.com</p>



<p>This will show pages that contain links to seothetop.com, valuable for backlink analysis in SEO.</p>



 Search Using Synonyms 



<p>Use the tilde (~) symbol to search for synonyms, which helps expand the scope of your advanced search.</p>



<p>Example search: ~marketing</p>



<p>Google will search for synonyms of “marketing,” including “digital marketing,” “advertising,” and more.</p>



 Deep Web: How to Explore the “Deep” Part of the Internet 



 What is the Deep Web? 



<p>The Deep Web is the portion of the internet that cannot be found using regular search engines. This area contains private databases, legal documents, personal accounts, and other content that can only be accessed through specialized deep search engines.</p>



 The Difference Between the Deep Web and the Dark Web 



<p>The Deep Web and the Dark Web are often confused, but they are actually two distinct parts of the internet. The Dark Web is a section of the Deep Web, but it is associated with illegal activities and can be dangerous. It’s important to understand this difference to avoid potential risks when accessing these areas.</p>

 Deep Search Engines for Exploring the Deep Web 



<p>To explore deeper resources within the Deep Web, users need specialized deep search engines, which are different from those used on the surface internet.</p>



 
 Torch: One of the oldest and most notable advanced search engines for the Deep Web, Torch allows users to access documents, forums, and other resources that regular search engines like Google cannot index. It supports searches on websites with a “.onion” domain, providing access to hidden resources deep within the internet.<br> 



 DuckDuckGo: Known for its commitment to privacy on the surface web, DuckDuckGo also supports deep searches in the Deep Web. It does not store user information and helps search for hidden websites, ensuring privacy during web browsing. DuckDuckGo does not track or record any search history, making it ideal for users who want to maintain anonymity when browsing the Deep Web.<br> 



 Ahmia, Haystack, Yippy: Other specialized advanced search engines like Ahmia, Haystack, and Yippy are designed to access the darker parts of the internet. These tools allow users to search hidden sites without being tracked or having their data recorded, ensuring security and privacy. All of these engines support access to “.onion” websites, allowing users to search the Deep Web safely and effectively. 
 


 
 


 Benefits of Using Deep Search 



<p>Using deep search techniques offers numerous benefits, not only helping you find more precise information but also supporting SEO optimization and protecting your privacy online. Let’s explore these benefits to enhance your search experience.</p>



 For SEO 



<p>Deep search tricks not only help users find accurate information but also play a key role in improving SEO effectiveness. When used correctly, you can discover high-quality content, valuable websites, and build an effective backlink strategy. Optimizing keywords and searching for external linking opportunities will help your website rank higher on search engines, increasing your online presence.</p>



 Finding Accurate Information

			<p>Originally published in the <a href="https://www.gdf.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/5.2.2025_GDF-Annual-Report-2024.pdf">GDF Annual Report 2024</a>, published in February 2025</p>

			<p>Liquidity drives markets. Yet, in tokenized real-world asset (RWA) and securities markets, liquidity remains trapped in silos, unable to reach its full potential. Distributors operate as isolated ecosystems, and investors are limited to closed networks. As financial services progress on-chain, the question underpinning how to better facilitate this adoption is clear: how do we unlock true liquidity and scale the market?</p>

			 The pain of siloed liquidity 
<p>Today, tokenized markets operate in isolation. Distributors list assets on their platforms, but each platform functions as a closed ecosystem, limiting liquidity to its internal investor base. An investor placing an offer on one distributor’s platform relies entirely on that platform’s order book to find a counterparty.</p>
<p>This fragmentation stifles market activity. Offers go unmatched, trades are delayed, and assets remain underutilized. Tokenization and its underlying technology promises to solve these inefficiencies, rather than exacerbate them. The issue is not with the concept of tokenization, but in evolving our understanding of how liquidity functions on-chain – a paradigm fundamentally different from anything we have seen before.</p>

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 
 
 Shared liquidity is the future 
<p>On-chain liquidity is supposed to be shared. It breaks down silos, creating a global marketplace where offers flow seamlessly across platforms. Distributors still maintain their unique platforms and investor relationships but can now tap into a dynamic and giant order book shared by the entire ecosystem.</p>
<p>The benefits of shared liquidity are profound:</p>
 
 For investors: Access to a global pool of liquidity without leaving their trusted distributor’s platform. They see more opportunities,experience faster transactions, and benefit from a more vibrant market. 
 For distributors: An expanded role as enablers of global liquidity. They can curate assets fort heir investor networks while participating in a larger and more active ecosystem. 
 For issuers: Increased market activity and visibility for their assets, unlocking value and accelerating adoption. 
 
 
 

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 
 
 
 
 ERC-3643: The open-source standard enabling market liquidity 
<p>The ERC-3643 standard enables shared liquidity by allowing issuers to issue, manage, and distribute permissioned tokens. It enables compliance, composability, and interoperability.</p>
 
 Built-in compliance: Compliance is embedded directly at the token level. ERC-3643 tokens include transfer restrictions and identity-based validation, ensuring that only eligible investors can participate. Unauthorized users and transactions will be denied automatically. 
 Interoperability: ERC-3643 is built on top of ERC-20, making it interoperable directly with the entire EVM ecosystem. It brings a standardized compliance layer to ensure seamless and compliant interaction across platforms. 
 Composability: ERC-3643 is modular and adaptable. It can add additional functionalities by combining them with other smart contracts, such as the DINO liquidity protocol, which allows investors (directly or via distribution platforms) to publish Delivery vs. Delivery (DvD) offers on- chain. 
 
 
 
 
 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 
 
 
 
 Shared DvD offers: Redefining liquidity as we know it 
<p>The DINO liquidity protocol transforms the blockchain network into a distributed marketplace, where distributors connect and seamlessly transact together, without sharing their clients.</p>
<p>The most fascinating aspect of the shared order book is the self-executing DvD smart contracts that power ERC-3643 token offers, enabling complete on-chain automation. By redefining liquidity and breaking down silos, they transform blockchain into a seamlessly interconnected global marketplace.</p>
 
 
 
 

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Once investors publish a DvD offer, it instantly becomes visible across all distribution platforms. When a buyer accepts the offer, whether on the same platform or a different one, the DvD smart contract verifies everything:</p>
 
 Eligibility: The buyer’s onchain identity is validated to ensure compliance. 
 Compliance rules: Transfer restrictions and conditions are automatically enforced. 
 Balance check: The buyer’s wallet is checked to confirm sufficient funds. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Once all conditions are met, the transaction is settled instantly, without counterparty risk or intermediaries.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 

		 
	 
                  
	 
		 
			 “This is not only a faster way to trade, but also a completely new experience. Investors can participate in secondary trading with the simplicity and speed of an e-commerce transaction. Click. Trade. Done.”

 Shared Standards, Shared Success 
<p>The tokenized markets are advancing rapidly, driven by the adoption of shared standards that foster trust, compliance, and operational efficiency. ERC-3643, supported and recognized by major financial and regulatory institutions like <a href="https://tokeny.com/tokeny-fuels-abn-amro-bank-in-tokenizing-green-bonds-on-polygon/">ABN AMRO</a>, <a href="https://www.dtcc.com/news/2025/february/04/dtcc-announces-composerx">DTCC</a>, <a href="https://www.erc3643.org/news/fasanara-adopts-erc-3643-to-launch-tokenized-money-market-fund">Fasanara,</a> <a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-10/ESMA12-2121844265-3182_Report_on_the_DLT_Pilot_Regime_-_Study_on_the_extraction_of_transaction_data.pdf?utm_content=277544254&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=linkedin&amp;hss_channel=lcp-94127367">ESMA</a>, <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpmorgan/documents/technology/jpmorganchase-emerging-technology-trends-a-jpmorganchase-perspective.pdf">Citi</a>, <a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpmorgan/documents/technology/jpmorganchase-emerging-technology-trends-a-jpmorganchase-perspective.pdf">JPMorgan Chase</a>, Global Digital Finance, and <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/lu/en/about/press-room/deloitte-announces-award-winners-at-their-2024-digital-assets-conference.html">Deloitte</a>, has emerged as a cornerstone of this progress and exemplifies industry collaboration in creating a unified framework for issuers, distributors, and investors.

<p>James is a compliance officer at a growing asset management firm. After landing a new institutional client, his team is preparing for increased regulatory scrutiny. James knows that building a robust Anti-Money Laundering (AML) program is essential—not just to meet regulations, but to safeguard the firm’s reputation.</p>



<p>With AML regulations tightening and financial crimes evolving, James needs a streamlined approach to compliance. Here’s how his team gets it right.</p>



 



 Laying the Groundwork with Customer Due Diligence (CDD) 



<p>James’s first priority is verifying the identity of clients and assessing their risk profiles. Instead of relying on manual checks, his team adopts a digital onboarding system:</p>



 
 Clients upload ID documents securely, which are scanned and validated using optical character recognition (OCR). 



 A live selfie ensures biometric verification to prevent identity fraud. 



 The system cross-checks client data with global sanctions lists in real time. 
 



<p>By automating routine checks, James’s team handles larger client volumes without delays and identifies potential risks early.</p>



 



 Spotting and Reporting Suspicious Activity 



<p>One morning, James reviews an alert: a client’s transaction pattern has shifted unexpectedly. The system’s machine learning models detect anomalies that suggest potential layering of funds.</p>



<p>With just a few clicks, James’s team:</p>



 
 Documents the findings in an automated Suspicious Activity Report (SAR). 



 Submits the SAR directly to regulators within the required timeframe. 
 



<p>Automated reporting cuts hours of manual work and ensures regulatory deadlines are never missed.</p>



 



 Keeping Records Secure and Accessible 



<p>AML regulations require James to keep records of client verification and SARs for years. His firm’s secure cloud-based system ensures:</p>



 
 Records are encrypted and accessible only to authorized users. 



 Retention policies are enforced automatically to comply with regulations. 



 An audit trail is generated for transparency and easy reporting during reviews. 
 



<p>This system reduces the risk of human error and makes audits seamless.</p>



<p></p>



 A Quick-Start Guide for Every Business 



<p>AML compliance can be simplified with the right tools and strategies. Here’s a recap of key steps:</p>



 
 Implement Digital Onboarding: Verify customer identities quickly and securely. 



 Automate SAR Submissions: Ensure timely reporting with minimal manual input. 



 Centralize Record Keeping: Maintain secure, accessible records for audits. 



 Adopt a Risk-Based Approach: Focus efforts where they matter most. 



 Train Your Team: Equip employees with the knowledge to spot and act on red flags. 
 



<p>By building a strong AML program, firms like James’s don’t just meet regulatory standards—they build trust, protect their business, and contribute to the fight against financial crime.</p>

									  Give Me Utility, Don’t Give Me $LIBRA   <p>Well, not to blow our own vuvuzela, but our pivot to utility came at the perfect time.</p>  <p>The mood of the week has been blowback to key opinion leaders (KOLs) who have spent much of the bull cycle trumpeting the speculative meme projects they were investing into their large follower bases to sell for a profit. All textbook insider trading schemas, openly admitted to by the LA Vape Cabal and other current “darlings” of the Solana shitcoin casino.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Chief among these KOLs: Argentinian President Javier Milei. The world leader is facing a federal probe for his role in promoting and allegedly launching $LIBRA. No, not&nbsp;that&nbsp;$LIBRA&nbsp;— Facebook’s defunt token from last cycle, IYKYK. (What’s Zuckerberg batting these days? .201?) Also an abject failure,&nbsp;this&nbsp;$LIBRA was developed with the help of the now-infamous Hayden Davis, who rugged most of Twitter with coin. Its market cap went from $2.6B to $0.8B in less than an hour of the token’s launch, and now sits at a dismal $300M.</p>  <p>All of this degenerate news that we said was finally being purged from our weekly writing is the very evidence the wider space may be pivoting toward utility too.&nbsp;</p>  <p>So what does real utility look like? We’ve spent plenty of time discussing Helium, the clearest protocol-as-a-service value proposition around. (Even Big Telecom is bought in.) And we’ve also touched on how memecoins have been leveraged by brands like&nbsp;<a href="https://playhaus.tv/heartsol/30-mother-may-i/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=that-is-so-not-kol">Iggy Azalea</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://playhaus.tv/heartsol/24-past-performance-doesnt-guarantee-future-results/?utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=that-is-so-not-kol">Pudgy Penguins</a>&nbsp;to monetize fan communities in new ways.</p>  <p>But to understand the full potential of crypto utility, let’s first take a step back and talk about the state of the technology, its parts, and the implications. Web3 technology largely consists of decentralized communications protocols with varying degrees of auditable logs for transactions related to using the protocol.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Bitcoin, the most famous of these protocol, is a digital money transfer service. It leverages complex math, distributed processing and storage, and defined hard limits on scarcity, in order to ensure the integrity of the system without having a bank running the books in the middle.</p>  <p>That idea inspired Ethereum to build the World Computer, a blockchain protocol focused on bringing the transparent audibility of the financial ledger to other systems reliant on account-keeping — think video games, social and streaming platforms, or business software. Much of Ethereum’s ecosystem has focused on the financialization of different assets on the Layer-2 (read: middle-men) blockchains, in order to meet the cost-related challenges of scaling the network.</p>  <p>Then, there is Solana, which has iterated on the original concept of a world computer to build what it calls a real-time state machine: a database that can read and write transactions at the speed at which users are generating them. This blockchain protocol is 100-1000x faster than Ethereum, with a demonstrated track record of getting faster and more distributed over time.</p>  <p>With artificial general intelligence (AGI) potentially on the horizon, unique and verified datasets are the moats necessary to build the AI companies of the future. Solana not only scales to onboard consumers, but to license their data to the future of AI agents.</p>  <p>There are a lot of smoke and mirrors in the web3 spaces. Rather than doomscrolling X for the next cool (KOL?) thing, we’d recommend the unsexy and TradFi-coded process of due diligence. Do your research into each new project and prioritize those with an understanding of data and its importance to shaping intelligence systems in their domain. This will continue to be the differentiating force between projects that succeed here long-term, and those that go the way of the $LIBRA(s).</p>  <p>To that end, the dePIN projects building on Solana understand that securing the data on a Layer-1 —&nbsp;and doing so cheaply — is an incredibly important piece to scaling their unit economics in the future. And that’s why this publication continues to shout that transactions per second (TPS) is king when it comes to evaluating the protocols themselves.</p>  <p>—El Prof</p>

									         How Meow Is Redefining Business Banking   <p>In the early days of fintech, startups like Brex and Mercury gained traction by offering streamlined banking solutions to startups and small businesses. But much like early web2 banking platforms, these services often replicated traditional models with little innovation beyond the user interface.</p>  <p>Now, a new wave of fintech disruptors is emerging&nbsp;— not with a bang, but a meow.</p>  <p><a href="https://www.meow.com/?srsltid=AfmBOopFOU4CtDtpiSIA0pFEpNZcjj3YV9ykYhZlQ3PQGQMiQc_6M--V&amp;utm_source=heart-and-sol.beehiiv.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=that-is-so-not-kol">Meow</a>&nbsp;started as a crypto yield platform, but it is quickly scaling toward a powerhouse in business banking. Unlike legacy fintech that relies on traditional infrastructure, Meow is designed for agility, giving businesses instant access to high-yield Treasury bills (T-bills), FDIC-insured checking accounts, and even venture debt solutions.</p>  <p>At its core, Meow enables businesses to put their idle cash to work without the complexity of hiring a corporate treasurer. The platform’s key offerings include:</p>    <p>T-bill investments: Businesses can park cash in government-backed securities, earning safe, high yields previously accessible only to large corporations.</p>  <p>High-interest checking accounts: Through partnerships with traditional banks, Meow offers businesses up to $125M in FDIC insurance.</p>  <p>Venture debt &amp; founder mortgages: Startups can access funding through Meow’s marketplace, where banks and private credit firms bid on financing opportunities.</p>    <p>Meow’s efficiency-driven model took on fresh luster when Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapsed in March 2023. Amid the banking crisis, startups and small businesses rushed to find alternative cash management solutions. Within a month, Meow secured $500M in deposits, proving that businesses were actively seeking a more agile, tech-driven banking solution.</p>  <p>Meow wasn’t always an heir apparent to that title though. It launched in 2021 as a crypto lender. ICYMI, those weren’t exactly the “winners” of that particular bull cycle. But the following year, as major players like TerraUSD and Three Arrows Capital collapsed, Meow’s founders made a bold decision —&nbsp;returning customer funds and pivoting away from the volatile crypto lending space.</p>  <p>But while it has stripped away some of the volatility, the web3 ethos remains part and parcel with Meow’s operations. Its automation-heavy and efficiency-first approach mirrors the decentralization movement in crypto, where smart contracts replace middlemen and minimize operational overhead. While fintech giants continue to burn cash on high marketing budgets and bloated headcounts, Meow is busy proving out a viable alternative.</p>  <p>Much like how DeFi challenged traditional finance, Meow is challenging outdated banking models by offering businesses:</p>    <p>Full autonomy over their financial strategy without complex corporate treasury teams.</p>  <p>Access to institutional-grade financial tools without legacy banking bureaucracy.</p>  <p>A lean, transparent, and technology-driven approach to managing corporate capital.</p>    <p>The future of business banking isn’t just about offering higher yields. It’s about redefining efficiency, transparency, and control. With Meow’s relentless focus on innovation, this future is already here. I am there already. Be there too.</p>  <p>—Muhammed</p>

<p>Imagine being able to prove you’re old enough to buy a drink without flashing your ID—or proving you have insurance without handing over your policy details. Sounds like magic? It’s just math. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) might be the biggest leap for privacy since encryption, but they also come with serious challenges. Let’s talk about the good, the bad, and the future of this technology.</p>



<p>If you’re <a href="https://corporate-blog.global.fujitsu.com/fgb/2024-11-12/01/">not familiar</a>, ZKPs are a cryptographic technique that allows one party to prove something to another party without revealing any other information beyond the proof itself. It’s no wonder these have been heralded as the holy grail for privacy-preserving selective disclosure.</p>



<p> Audio Blog</p>







<p>ZKPs have the attention of several standards development communities and have for a while. (<a href="https://self-issued.info/">Mike Jones</a> did a great presentation at EIC in 2023 that touched on ZKPs; check out the <a href="https://self-issued.info/presentations/EIC_2023_Selective_Disclosure.pdf">slides</a> starting around slide 26). I get it. ZKPs are mathematical magic, especially for applications like age verification, secure access control, and decentralized identity systems. But like any technology, they come with their own set of challenges. For one, they have a high computational cost, requiring powerful devices to execute the complex math behind them efficiently. The equipment required to support that computational effort is expensive, raising questions of scalability. There are also several ZKP algorithms out there; I don’t know what happens when competing platforms don’t support each other’s algorithms. These questions take my brain to one uncomfortable question: Are ZKPs going to widen the digital divide?</p>



 Understanding Zero-Knowledge Proofs 



<p>At their core, ZKPs allow someone (the prover) to convince another party (the verifier) that a statement is true without sharing any additional details. For example, imagine proving you know the solution to a puzzle without revealing the solution itself. This is achieved through advanced cryptographic algorithms that ensure the verifier gains confidence in the proof while learning nothing else. (I’m just saying that “mathematician” and “magician” sure sound similar. But I digress.)</p>



<p>ZKPs do promise some very sexy things:</p>



 
 Privacy: They enable granular data sharing, revealing only the necessary information. 



 Security: They lower the risk of data breaches by limiting the exposure of sensitive data. 



 Versatility: They can be applied across various fields, from financial transactions to identity verification, because every sector has use cases for this. 
 



<p>But, sexy math doesn’t mean solving for everything:</p>



 
 Computational Intensity: The algorithms are resource-heavy, demanding significant processing power up to and including specialized hardware. 



 Device Dependency: Effective use often requires high-end (read: expensive) devices, limiting accessibility. 



 Complexity: Developing and implementing ZKPs is technically challenging and requires significant expertise. 
 



 ZKPs in Standards Development 



<p>In the world of digital identity, ZKPs have come up quite a bit in the verifiable credentials space. Standards development groups like those in the IETF working on selective disclosure (e.g., <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/">SD-JWT</a>, <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-spice-sd-cwt/">SD-CWT</a>) are exploring how ZKPs can be integrated into identity systems to improve privacy and security. Research groups like the IRTF’s <a href="https://www.irtf.org/cfrg.html">Crypto Forum Research Group</a> (CFRG; more on them later) are also looking at work in this space and how it might apply to standards under development. Age verification tends to be the most popular example, though there are others that apply in <a href="https://www.techlab.cdc.gov/index.php/2023/04/01/zero-knowledge-proof-zkp/">healthcare</a>, <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42452-019-0989-z.pdf">public sector</a>, <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2023/05/12/an-introduction-to-zero-knowledge-proofs-in-blockchains-and-economics">banking</a>, etc.</p>



 



<p>Zero Knowledge Proofs are just one piece of the standards puzzle. If your team is figuring out how to engage in standards development—or just needs to stay ahead of what’s coming—I can help.  <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/services/">See how I work</a> or <a href="https://doodle.com/bp/heatherflanagan/30-min">Book a quick chat</a>.</p>



 



<p>While ZKPs offer innovative solutions to challenging problems, they won’t work for everyone. For example, in settings where access to high-end devices or strong network connections is limited, alternative methods of selective disclosure may be more practical. Verifiable credentials based on attribute-based encryption or other techniques might complement ZKPs to create more inclusive systems.</p>



<p>Despite the promise of solving very thorny privacy problems, there’s a tension here between innovation and inclusivity. As we’ve seen with other technologies, the benefits often go first to those who can afford cutting-edge devices, leaving others behind. Standards development communities, particularly those involved in the <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/01/20/digital-credentials-that-can-be-verified-a-lesson-in-terminology/">digital credentials</a> space, are positioned to address this gap, but it requires intentional design choices and collaboration across stakeholders.</p>



 Balancing Innovation with Equity 



<p>Here’s what’s making me anxious: The promise of ZKPs shouldn’t come at the cost of equity. If the future of privacy relies on technology that only the most privileged can access, then we’ve failed a significant portion of the global population. So let’s think about how to advance in a few more areas. (There is work going on in each, but let’s not get complacent):</p>



 
 <a href="https://blog.icme.io/minimal-space-maximum-pace-how-memory-efficient-zero-knowledge-proofs-work/">Optimizing Algorithms</a>: Continued research should focus on reducing the computational burden of ZKPs, making them more efficient and accessible. 



 <a href="https://open.bu.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/bb92dba0-75e0-4855-9960-4db0f8b72ee1/content">Device Compatibility</a>: Developing lightweight ZKP implementations that work on older or less powerful devices is crucial. 



 <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3689949">Privacy Alternatives</a>: While ZKPs are a powerful tool, they’re not the only path to privacy. There are other technical mechanisms to explore. 



 <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/privacy-principles/">Collaborative Standards</a>: Standards bodies must prioritize equity, ensuring that technical specifications account for diverse use cases and resource constraints. 
 



 Non-Human Identities and ZKPs 



<p>ZKPs aren’t just about humans; they have a significant role to play in NHI as well. Devices, software agents, and even digital twins increasingly operate in environments where trust and privacy are critical. Here’s where ZKPs come into play:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/12/5/1145">Device Authentication and IoT</a>: ZKPs can allow IoT devices to securely prove their identity without exposing sensitive information. For example, a smart thermostat could authenticate itself to a central hub without revealing its serial number or full configuration. 



 <a href="https://theses.hal.science/tel-03712482/file/These_UTC_Amira_Barki.pdf">Machine-to-Machine Communication</a>: ZKPs enable machines to verify each other’s credentials securely, such as an autonomous vehicle proving it has insurance coverage. 



 <a href="https://norma.ncirl.ie/5033/1/gauravrameshsavanur.pdf">Supply Chain and Provenance</a>: Digital twins of products can use ZKPs to prove authenticity or origin without disclosing the entire supply chain. 
 



<p>However, just as with human identities, there are challenges. Many non-human entities, like IoT devices, are resource-constrained and may struggle to handle the computational demands of ZKPs. These limitations further highlight the importance of making ZKPs more accessible, not just for individuals but for organizations and devices with limited resources.</p>



 What’s Next for ZKPs? 



<p>The future of ZKPs is as exciting as it is complex. One organization leading the way in advancing ZKP research and development is the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/rg/cfrg/about/">CFRG</a>. Part of the <a href="https://irtf.org">IRTF</a>, CFRG brings together cryptographers, researchers, and industry professionals to explore cutting-edge cryptographic techniques, including ZKPs. Their work helps ensure that standards and implementations are both secure and practical for real-world use.</p>



<p>In addition to CFRG’s efforts, <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/pec/zkproof">ongoing research</a> (NIST is just one example) focuses on optimizing algorithms to reduce computational overhead and developing hardware accelerators to make ZKP technology more efficient and accessible. Collaboration across academia, industry, and standards bodies is necessary to overcome current limitations and ensure ZKPs can be deployed equitably.</p>



<p>Ultimately, the journey to mainstream adoption of ZKPs will require thoughtful design, practical implementation, and a commitment to inclusivity. By leveraging the work of groups like CFRG and fostering collaboration, we can ensure that ZKPs advance privacy and benefit everyone.</p>



 A Quick Compare and Contrast 



FeatureZKPsCurrent Models of Selective DisclosurePrivacy LevelExtremely high (reveals nothing but the proof)Partial (shares limited info)Computational CostHigh (math is hard!)Lower (simpler cryptography)Device RequirementsExpensive hardware needed?Works on most devicesAdoption BarrierComplexity, costMore familiar, easier to deploy



 Wrap Up 



<p>Zero-knowledge proofs are an exciting innovation that could actually make privacy a technically viable and enforceable thing online. Their ability to enable secure, selective disclosure is amazing, and their potential applications are as diverse as the people on the Internet. But as we push the boundaries of what’s possible with the latest technologies, we must also ensure that privacy is not a privilege reserved for those with the latest devices.</p>



<p>By balancing innovation with accessibility, I think we can build a future where everyone benefits from the advancements in privacy-preserving technology. ZKPs are undoubtedly a step in the right direction, but they’re just one piece of a much larger puzzle. Let’s make sure we’re solving it with everyone in mind.</p>

 We unpack the findings from IDnow’s recent UK and France Fraud Awareness Reports to explore the differences in perceptions of fraud, preferences of identity verification solutions and much more. 



<p>Separated by just 34km of the English Channel, there are many things that France and the United Kingdom have in common: size of populations, diversity of cultures, and, unfortunately, alarming rates of fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In France, victims of financial fraud and scams lose at least <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/french-financial-fraud-victims-lose-at-least-500-million-every-year/">€500 million annually</a>, while in the UK, the problem appears to be even more pronounced. In fact, in just the first half of 2024, over <a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/policy-and-guidance/reports-and-publications/half-year-fraud-report-2024#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20half%20of,to%20be%20accessed%20or%20controlled.">£570 million was stolen in payment fraud</a> alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2024, we published the IDnow UK Fraud Awareness Report, which surveyed members of the British public to explore the nation’s awareness of the latest fraud terms, the industries considered most susceptible to fraud, and how commonly Brits used risky channels like unencrypted messaging platforms to transfer copies or scans of ID documents. Last month, we published an edition focused on France, ‘Fraude bancaire : enquête sur la confiance des Français envers leur banque’ [<a href="https://www.idnow.io/fr/portfolio/fraude-bancaire-enquete-confiance-francais/">Bank fraud: survey of French people’s confidence in their bank</a>].&nbsp;</p>



<p>Referring to the recent French Report, Cyril Patou, Vice President of Sales (France) at IDnow said: “The results highlight the importance of increased awareness and having open dialogue between financial institutions and users to move forward together in the fight against fraud.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this blog, we explore the differences in results between the two nations and consider why a tailored, culture-specific approach to fraud prevention – and identity verification –&nbsp;is required.</p>



 
   
     
                     UK Fraud Awareness Report 2024 
                      Learn more about the British public’s awareness of fraud and their attitudes toward fraud-prevention technology.  
                    <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/2024-uk-fraud-awareness-report/">Read now</a>
           
           
         
          
         
       
	     
 


 Loyalty, trust and public awareness of fraud. 



<p>While 54% of UK respondents said they would consider switching banks if they were a victim of bank fraud, only 27% of French respondents agreed, indicating that either the French were more loyal to their banks or accepting of falling victim to fraud. Surprisingly, 11% of French respondents said they had been victims of bank fraud yet had still not changed banks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to fraud terms, the Brits tend to be more informed than their French counterparts. For example, over half of UK respondents said they had heard of ‘deepfakes’ (videos of digitally created people that are typically used to obfuscate the user’s identity), while 42% of French said they had not heard the term combined with a further 25% who said they had heard of deepfakes, but didn‘t know what it means.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both countries are currently experiencing a rise in sophisticated digital fraud techniques, including deepfakes. In a recent post on social media, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3e1kne7q1qo">French President Emmanuel Macron shared a montage of deepfake videos</a> featuring himself in popular movies, commenting “nicely done.”&nbsp;In the UK, recent <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/deepfakes-demean-defraud-disinform/">Ofcom data shows that 43% of individuals</a> aged 16 and older have seen at least one deepfake online in the last six months. Deepfakes have clearly arrived and being used for both fun and fraudulent purposes. In fact, the UK government recently declared deepfakes as the <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202502/uk-government-declares-deepfakes-greatest-challenge-of-the-online-age">“greatest challenge of the online era</a>.”</p>



<p>Attitudes on whether banks are adequately protecting their customers against fraud like deepfakes are largely the same in France (72%) and the UK (73%), leaving more than a quarter of respondents in both countries that either disagree or just don’t know – suggesting better education on not only the latest fraud terms but banks’ methods of fraud prevention is needed.</p>



 Which industries cause the French and British public the most concern? 



<p>Both France and the UK agree that the riskiest industry when it comes to fraud is <a href="https://www.idnow.io/fintech/">financial services </a>(65% and 75% respectively) followed by online shopping. Clearly, these are both industries where it serves for customers to be as cautious as possible, as bank and e-commerce accounts store important personal identifiable information that can be misused for fraudulent purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Third on the ranking of riskiest industry is social media fraud, which is where a lot of fraud originates, especially <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/social-engineering/">social engineering</a>. Discover all about the rise of social media fraud, and how one man almost lost a million euros to a pig butchering scam in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/social-media-fraud-investment-romance-scam/">blog, ‘The rise of social media fraud: How one man almost lost it all.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the major differences seen in the IDnow Reports is the perception of public services as a potential source of fraud. While in France, nearly a third of the French population (32%) are concerned, just 13% of the UK public appear worried about eGovernment fraud. Could it be that the French are just more critical of eGovernment services or perhaps it’s just that a higher percentage of the French population are using eGovernment services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It appears to be the former, as in 2023, just <a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/oecd-survey-on-drivers-of-trust-in-public-institutions-2024-results-country-notes_a8004759-en/france_4edec498-en.html">34% of the French public</a> reported high or moderately high trust in the national government, below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s average of 39%.</p>

 Government and public preferences in identity verification solutions. 



<p>Most industries are either required by regulation to implement identity verification checks or have chosen to do so to optimize processes or fight fraud. Such checks are required for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">account opening in Banking</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/crypto/">compliance checks in Crypto</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">age verification in Mobility</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/travel/">streamlined check-in processes in Travel</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">financial risk checks in Gambling,</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/telecommunication/">contract signing in Telecommunication</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Identity verification requires users to provide and have information associated with their identity verified. This may be checking an identity document, such as a driver’s license, passport, or a nationally issued identity document or by biometric authentication of users’ attributes like fingerprints or facial features.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each country tends to have different approaches to fraud prevention and identity verification processes, which is often determined by regulatory requirements. In Germany, for example, video verification is required when opening bank accounts due to strict AML/GwG requirements, however this may all be set to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/gwvideoidentv-german-financial-sector/">change in the near future.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>In France, the government has a national digital identification program and provides citizens with electronic ID cards that facilitates secure access to various services. This centralized system enhances the efficiency of identity verification processes across both public and private sectors. France also has FranceConnect, the national digital identity federator, where users verify themselves for eGovernment and other regulated services. Our report found that the concept of digital identities was familiar to 72% of French respondents. Plus, a large majority of French (70%) said they would be prepared to use a digital identity to access bank accounts or carry out important transactions.</p>

<p>In the UK, there is currently no one consistent and coherent ID system, with companies instead relying on database checks and document checks of different forms of ID, including driving licences and passports. However, the government is experimenting with various ways of modernizing its approach, including the 2023 release o<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fca-digital-ids/">f a Digital Identity and Attributes Trust Framework</a> (DIATF) – a set of rules and standards designed to establish trust in digital identity products.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There was also a flurry of activity at the beginning of 2025 with the announcement that the government planned to launch the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/wallet">GOV.UK Wallet</a>, which was very quickly followed up by panicked questions regarding its impact on the DIATF.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Once launched, the holders of the GOV.UK Wallet will be able to:&nbsp;</p>



  Securely save government-issued digital documents&nbsp;&nbsp;  



  Present these documents to organizations, businesses and other parts of government to prove age, identity, or eligibility for services&nbsp;  



<p>When asked which identity verification method they considered the most trustworthy for a secure, reliable and accurate process, 20% of French respondents said document capture and facial recognition, while 42% of UK respondents cited a combination of electronic identity data checks and document capture and facial verification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While 16% of French respondents would prefer an expert-led identification process like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">VideoIdent</a>, just 9% of UK respondents felt the same way. Seemingly, the French are more open-minded toward expert-led solutions than the Brits. However, products like IDnow’s customizable <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/videoident-flex/">VideoIdent Flex</a> are now becoming <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/video-identity-verification-fraud-prevention/">increasingly popular in European countries outside Germany</a>, where they have typically enjoyed much success due to national BaFin (Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority) online onboarding regulatory requirements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are clearly differences between the two nations when it comes to awareness of fraud, the industries considered riskiest and their preferred methods of identity verification. However, what is consistent in both the UK and France is the ever-present risk of fraud and the need for a collaborative push by regulatory and government bodies and financial services to commit to fraud prevention.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thankfully, whether <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">automated</a> or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/expert-led-verification/">expert-led</a>, online or <a href="https://www.idnow.io/in-person-verification/">in-person</a>, IDnow offers one of the widest ranges of identity verification and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/digital-signatures/">digital signature</a> solutions in Europe and beyond.

 Where are all the people? Takeaways from the Paris AI Safety Summit — from ‘plug baby plug’ to power to the&nbsp;people <p>Written by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emrysschoemaker/">Emrys Schoemaker</a> — Senior Director of Advisory &amp; Policy at Caribou&nbsp;Digital.</p><p>The Paris AI Action Summit is over, and the scene set for the subsequent one, which will be hosted by India. This year’s Summit followed previous meetings in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-summit-2023-the-bletchley-declaration/the-bletchley-declaration-by-countries-attending-the-ai-safety-summit-1-2-november-2023">Bletchley Park, UK (2023)</a>, and <a href="https://www.aisummitseoul.com/">Seoul, South Korea (2024).</a> Ostensibly, the convenings aimed to agree on guardrails for the future of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>The Paris AI Summit characterized the times in which it was held — one of fragmenting geopolitics, divergent priorities, and the growing pursuit of sovereign interest over collective good.</p><p>Many observers concluded that not only was the Summit more of a trade fair for Paris’s AI ambitions — with French President Macron’s <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/emmanuel-macron-answer-donald-trump-fossil-fuel-drive-artificial-intelligence-ai-action-summit/">‘plug baby plug’</a> a, umm, plug for the country’s nuclear industry, but it was also a failure on its own terms. Although more than sixty countries, including China, India, and Germany, signed on to a declaration that committed to “ensuring AI is open, inclusive, transparent, ethical, safe, secure and trustworthy, taking into account international frameworks for all,” both <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a6b5426d-645f-433b-8090-a2a26a3deec6">the US and UK refused to do so</a>, with US Vice President J. D. Vance saying the United States would work to retain its dominance in&nbsp;AI.</p><p>There were bright spots. The <a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366619217/AI-Action-Summit-two-major-AI-initiatives-launched">commitment to Current AI</a>, a $400-million fund focused on building “open, people-first technologies,” offers hope, yet the initiative will have to demonstrate how it can have ecosystemic impact and bend the arc of AI development toward the&nbsp;good.</p><p>My main takeaway from the AI Summit is that, despite the increasingly centralized, mega investment focus of Big Tech AI that seems to be rushing headlong to doomsday land, the most interesting developments are in fact the opposite: away from the big companies, where efforts focus on shifting power toward&nbsp;people.</p><p>I saw this at the <a href="https://www.france24.com/en/video/20250211-africa-ai-village-in-paris-we-are-a-population-of-1-5-billion-we-can-not-go-unrecognized">African AI Village</a>, an independent meeting convened by a coalition of leading African organizations, including Qhala and Smart Africa, and supported by the likes of Mozilla, CEIP, and others. Three themes struck&nbsp;me:</p>  Decentering and decolonizing power: Calls to stop asking for permission and instead to build African AI models, applications, and skills are growing increasingly confident. We can’t underestimate the importance of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/what-is-deepseek-why-is-it-disrupting-ai-sector-2025-01-27/">China’s DeepSeek AI models</a> here in demonstrating that the AI field can be disrupted.  Decentering principles of data governance and turning to Indigenous forms of knowledge: The <a href="https://www.kahuiraraunga.io/maoridatagovernance">Maori Data Governance Principles</a> are an example of this approach. The Maori Principles have also informed work Caribou has done with UNDP on governance frameworks for <a href="https://www.governance4id.org/">digital ID</a> and forthcoming on data exchange and digital&nbsp;ID.  Dependency on metal, especially data centers, to maintain sovereignty: Africa has only 155 data centers. In 2023 these generated<a href="https://inform.tmforum.org/features-and-opinion/data-center-investment-on-the-rise-in-africa"> less than 1 megawatt (MW), compared to 88 in the US and 73 in the EU</a>. Analysts suggest that Africa desperately needs as much as 1,000 MW and 700 facilities if African AI is going to be independent of the hyperscale cloud and computing providers.  <p>The other theme that stood out in this technology-focused Summit is people. In the headlong rush to greater investment, including in <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2025/02/11/military-community-gathers-in-paris-to-discuss-how-ai-is-impacting-conflict-around-the-wor">AI for defense</a>, the struggle to put people first continues. The <a href="https://www.saysmaybe.com/podcast">Computer Says Maybe</a> live-streamed review of the Summit captured this&nbsp;trend.</p>  Where are all the people? There was a general consensus that the Summit had not done enough to focus on people or risk. The few references to people, such as the launch of Current AI, the public interest AI fund, were welcome, but not&nbsp;enough.  The challenge of mobilizing public engagement — and protest — was also flagged as a barrier to influence and advocacy. One explanation for this was the challenge of “showing the bodies”; in contrast to other digital technologies where harms are readily apparent, the harms from AI are difficult to link directly to the technology.  Increasing emphasis on developing AI diagnostic tools and methods to strengthen AI accountability led to a discussion about the role of more constructive engagement: the diagnostician vs. the clinician. The former simply identifies problems, while the latter provides constructive solutions. Importantly, there was widespread agreement among panel members about the importance of criticism, with one panel member noting that “criticism is service.”  <p>But the big elephant in the room was geopolitics. Not just the geopolitics of AI — with US Vice President Vance <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/vp-jd-vance-calls-europe-row-back-tech-regulation-ai-action-summit/">“warning Europe to go easy on regulating US tech firms”</a> — but the broader geopolitical context in which AI sits. The very rapid changes taking place in the United States, the decline in multilateral approaches to addressing global challenges, including but not only AI, are factors that will shape the future role of digital technologies in politics and everyday life. So we must take much greater account of the geopolitics in which technologies exist if we are to address the challenges of&nbsp;power.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/where-are-all-the-people-58c6c69975ff">Where are all the people?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Hackers Breach OmniGPT Exposing Personal Data Of Over 30000 Users And 34 Million Chatbot Interactions</p>



<p>Hackers allegedly breached OmniGPT, an AI chatbot platform, exposing the personal data of over 30,000 users, including email addresses, phone numbers, API keys, and 34 million user-chatbot interactions. A hacker named “Gloomer” claimed responsibility on February 9, 2025, posting leaked samples on a hacking forum, which included plaintext emails, phone numbers, chat logs, and sensitive documents stored on Google Cloud. The leaked chat logs and uploaded files pose serious privacy risks, potentially revealing personal, financial, or corporate data. <a href="https://cybersecuritynews.com/hackers-allegedly-claiming-breach-omnigpt/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8wDiKe5A745prQbZESWFuZkzn8Ds4Qhch9z0t7PpTpGwc6Yh2Aejq-MbUGq2mbvBnlje8X#google_vignette">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>India Considers Banning Chinese AI Chatbot DeepSeek Over Data Privacy And Cybersecurity Risks</p>



<p>India is considering banning DeepSeek, a Chinese AI chatbot, due to data privacy and cybersecurity concerns, with CERT-In, under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, investigating its data collection practices. DeepSeek reportedly gathers user data through prompts, device metadata, app interactions, and external sources, raising fears of unauthorized access to sensitive information and potential manipulation of political discourse. Unlike ChatGPT, DeepSeek poses elevated privacy risks, as it can track user behavior across other AI platforms like ChatGPT and Google Gemini. Similar concerns have led countries like the US, Italy, and Australia to restrict DeepSeek’s use. India’s finance ministry has already warned against using AI tools like DeepSeek on government devices, reinforcing the need for strict regulations to protect national security and user privacy. <a href="https://www.analyticsinsight.net/artificial-intelligence/india-likely-to-ban-deepseek-ai-over-data-privacy-and-cybersecurity-risks?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8wDiKe5A745prQbZESWFuZkzn8Ds4Qhch9z0t7PpTpGwc6Yh2Aejq-MbUGq2mbvBnlje8X">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>UK Government Pressures Apple to Weaken iCloud Encryption, Sparking Privacy Concerns</p>



<p>The U.K. government secretly ordered Apple to create a backdoor to access encrypted iCloud backups under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016, aiming to weaken Apple’s end-to-end encryption feature, Advanced Data Protection. The order, which Apple is likely to comply with by removing the feature for U.K. users, has sparked concerns over privacy rights and the potential for similar demands from other governments. Critics argue that the move would set a dangerous global precedent, making encrypted data more vulnerable to cybercriminals and authoritarian regimes. Security experts warn that weakening encryption contradicts efforts to protect users from state-sponsored cyber threats, such as recent hacking campaigns by Chinese-backed groups. The U.K.’s approach risks straining alliances with nations prioritizing encryption as a safeguard against espionage and cyberattacks. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/10/uks-secret-apple-icloud-backdoor-order-is-a-global-emergency-say-critics/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9GC-_vorLz04i6FHCt41SOz3chrht4rZontaHNBr1FAA5yoZOTOiaTF5xPnbmimyUKM4Sv">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Lee Enterprises Confirms Cyberattack Disrupting Operations at 72 Newspapers</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/lee-enterprises/">Lee Enterprises</a>, a major U.S. newspaper publisher, has confirmed that a cyberattack is behind ongoing disruptions at its 72 publications, including the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and Casper Star-Tribune. CEO Kevin Mowbray stated that the company is working to restore systems, but Lee has not disclosed the nature of the attack or whether any data was compromised. The outages have affected newspaper production, subscriber services, and internal systems like VPN and call centers. While Lee’s earnings report this week omitted mention of the cyberattack, this marks the company’s second known breach in five years, following a 2021 Iranian hacker attack. Recovery efforts are ongoing, with no clear timeline for resolution. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/10/media-giant-lee-enterprises-confirms-cyberattack-as-news-outlets-report-ongoing-disruption/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8PyjsziTB2dcIev6qDMbAL5JoaZXJa0ipzXYXtF6Crc0Q1agvYQ7hGsS1FSts9XR888h92">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>PayPal Fined $2 Million by New York for Cybersecurity Failures</p>



<p>PayPal has been fined $2 million by New York State for failing to meet cybersecurity regulations, leaving customer data vulnerable to cybercriminals. The investigation by the Department of Financial Services (DFS) found that PayPal lacked qualified cybersecurity personnel, failed to implement adequate security measures like multifactor authentication, and did not provide sufficient training. The breach occurred when untrained teams expanded access to IRS Form 1099-Ks, allowing hackers to exploit compromised credentials and access sensitive customer data. DFS Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris emphasized the importance of trained cybersecurity personnel and strong policies to protect consumer information. This case highlights the enforcement of New York’s updated cybersecurity regulations, which set strict standards for financial institutions to prevent data breaches. <a href="https://www.acainternational.org/news/paypal-hit-with-2m-cybersecurity-fine-from-new-york-state/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--RCZn0rxiSX673DygLhZenZNvgUaorzB_iUTw_Cz-A-tbIHXkG4qbnsAAZkiIYGMgmJG0b">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>DeepSeek iOS App Banned Globally Over Security and Privacy Risks</p>



<p>Critical vulnerabilities in the DeepSeek iOS app have raised serious privacy and national security concerns, leading to global bans by governments and organizations. The app transmits unencrypted user data to ByteDance servers in China, bypassing iOS security protocols and exposing users to surveillance risks. Researchers found multiple security flaws, including weak encryption, insecure data storage, and extensive fingerprinting, making user information vulnerable to interception and misuse. Given the regulatory and compliance risks, countries like South Korea, Australia, Taiwan, and U.S. agencies have banned the app on official devices. Security experts recommend prohibiting its use in corporate environments, adopting self-hosted alternatives, and conducting regular security assessments to mitigate emerging threats. <a href="https://cybersecuritynews.com/deepseek-ios-app-sending-data-unencrypted/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--RCZn0rxiSX673DygLhZenZNvgUaorzB_iUTw_Cz-A-tbIHXkG4qbnsAAZkiIYGMgmJG0b">(Source)</a></p>

<p>The rise of e-commerce has led to an explosion in demand for packaging,<br>
with much of it ending up in landfills. Reusable packaging offers a<br>
sustainable solution, but its success hinges on high return rates. This<br>
article explores the potential of gamification and blockchain rewards to<br>
incentivize customers to return reusable packaging, specifically<br>
focusing on mailers that can be returned via mailbox. We will analyze<br>
two business models: one leveraging these technologies and one that does<br>
not, providing a comprehensive value comparison.</p>
<p>Gamification and Blockchain Rewards: A Powerful Combination</p>
<p>Gamification involves integrating game-like elements, such as points,<br>
badges, and leaderboards, into non-game contexts to drive user<br>
engagement and influence behavior1. By tapping into our natural desire<br>
for competition, achievement, and rewards, gamification can make even<br>
mundane tasks more enjoyable and motivating. Studies have shown that<br>
gamification can lead to increased participation, improved information<br>
retention, and higher conversion rates2. However, the success of<br>
gamification depends on customer readiness, which is influenced by<br>
factors like the simplicity of the program and the quality of<br>
information provided3.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology, a decentralized and transparent system for<br>
recording and verifying transactions, provides a secure and efficient<br>
platform for managing rewards programs. Its key characteristics, such as<br>
immutability and traceability, foster trust among participants4.<br>
Blockchain also enables the creation of tokenized rewards, which can be<br>
used across different platforms and even traded on secondary markets,<br>
offering greater flexibility and value to customers5.</p>
<p>The synergy between gamification and blockchain creates a powerful<br>
incentive system. Gamification provides the motivational engine, while<br>
blockchain ensures the security and transparency of the rewards program,<br>
enhancing its credibility and appeal to customers4. This combination<br>
is particularly relevant in the context of loyalty programs, a market<br>
that has experienced significant growth in recent years. In 2015, 3.8<br>
billion loyalty program memberships were active in the US, with<br>
enrollment growing by 20% across various industries6.</p>
<p>Incentivizing Reusable Packaging Returns: Two Business Models</p>
<p>Model 1: Traditional Approach (No Gamification or Blockchain)</p>
<p>This model relies on traditional methods to encourage returns, such as:</p>
 
 
<p>Deposit fees: Customers pay a deposit upon receiving the<br>
packaging, which is refunded upon return.</p>
 
 
<p>Pre-paid return labels: Including a pre-paid return label with<br>
the package for easy return.</p>
 
 
<p>Environmental messaging: Emphasizing the environmental benefits<br>
of returning the packaging.</p>
 
 
<p>While these methods can be effective to a certain extent, they often<br>
lack the engagement and motivation needed to achieve high return<br>
rates7.</p>
<p>Model 2: Gamified Blockchain Rewards</p>
<p>This model integrates gamification and blockchain to create a more<br>
engaging and rewarding return experience:</p>
 
 
<p>Tokenized rewards: Customers earn tokens for each returned<br>
mailer. These tokens can be redeemed for discounts, exclusive<br>
products, or even exchanged for other cryptocurrencies5.</p>
 
 
<p>Gamified challenges: Introduce challenges, such as returning a<br>
certain number of mailers within a specific timeframe, to earn bonus<br>
tokens or achieve higher tiers in the rewards program8.</p>
 
 
<p>Interactive tracking: Allow customers to track their return<br>
history and token balance through a user-friendly app or online<br>
platform9.</p>
 
 
<p>Community building: Create a community around the program,<br>
allowing users to interact, share their achievements, and<br>
participate in contests10.</p>
 
 
<p>By combining the motivational power of gamification with the security<br>
and transparency of blockchain, this model aims to create a more<br>
engaging and rewarding return experience, leading to higher return rates<br>
and increased customer loyalty.</p>
<p>Beyond tokenized rewards, blockchain has the potential to transform<br>
loyalty programs by enabling features like real-time tracking of<br>
rewards, personalized offers based on individual customer behavior, and<br>
interactive challenges that make earning rewards more engaging9.</p>
<p>To further enhance the program, businesses can leverage the<br>
psychological principles behind gamification. For instance, by<br>
incorporating elements of challenge, accomplishment, and social<br>
interaction, they can tap into users' intrinsic motivation and desire<br>
for rewards, making the return process more appealing and enjoyable12.</p>

<p>Analysis:</p>
<p>Model 2, with its gamified blockchain rewards system, offers several<br>
advantages over the traditional approach. It has the potential to<br>
significantly increase customer engagement and return rates by making<br>
the return process more fun and rewarding. The use of blockchain<br>
technology adds a layer of security and transparency, building trust<br>
with customers and enhancing the program's credibility. Furthermore,<br>
the tokenized rewards offer greater flexibility and value to customers,<br>
increasing their motivation to participate13. However, it's important<br>
to acknowledge the potential downsides of blockchain rewards, such as<br>
the risk of token value fluctuations and the need for technical<br>
expertise to manage the blockchain system14. Businesses need to<br>
carefully weigh these costs against the potential benefits of increased<br>
return rates and customer loyalty.</p>
<p>Environmental Impact of Reusable Packaging</p>
<p>Reusable packaging offers significant environmental benefits compared to<br>
single-use alternatives. It reduces waste, conserves natural resources,<br>
and lowers greenhouse gas emissions15. Studies have shown that<br>
reusable packaging can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 82% and plastic<br>
waste by 87% compared to single-use options16. The break-even point,<br>
where the environmental impact of a reusable container becomes less than<br>
that of single-use, varies depending on factors like the type of<br>
container and its production process17.</p>
<p>Furthermore, blockchain technology can contribute to a more sustainable<br>
and ethical supply chain for reusable packaging. By providing a<br>
transparent and immutable record of the packaging's lifecycle,<br>
blockchain can be used to track the origin of materials, ensure<br>
responsible sourcing, and promote transparency in the recycling<br>
process18.</p>
<p>Several successful initiatives demonstrate the feasibility of reusable<br>
packaging programs. For example, Starbucks' "Borrow a Cup" program<br>
allows customers to borrow a reusable cup for a small deposit and return<br>
it at any participating store. Other successful examples include the<br>
"Banff Borrows" program in Canada and the reusable container system at<br>
the Our Tampines Hub hawker center in Singapore19.</p>
<p>By incentivizing the return of reusable mailers, both business models<br>
contribute to reducing the environmental impact of e-commerce packaging.<br>
However, Model 2, with its potential for higher return rates, could lead<br>
to even greater environmental benefits.</p>
<p>Current Return Rates for Reusable Packaging</p>
<p>While data on the return rates of reusable mailers specifically is<br>
limited in the provided research, studies have shown that reusable<br>
packaging systems in other sectors can achieve significant return rates.<br>
For instance, a study by Fashion for Good found that reusable packaging<br>
systems in the fashion e-commerce industry can achieve return rates of<br>
up to 80%, leading to substantial reductions in waste and emissions16.</p>
<p>Boosting Customer Engagement and Loyalty</p>
<p>Gamification and blockchain rewards have the potential to significantly<br>
increase customer engagement and loyalty. Research suggests that<br>
customers who engage with gamified loyalty programs are twice as likely<br>
to be satisfied with the brand12. Moreover, blockchain-based loyalty<br>
programs offer enhanced transparency and security, which can further<br>
strengthen customer trust and loyalty13.</p>
<p>Manufacturing and Shipping Costs</p>
<p>The cost of manufacturing reusable packaging is generally higher than<br>
single-use packaging due to the use of more durable materials20.<br>
However, this cost is offset by the savings from reduced packaging<br>
consumption over time. Shipping costs can also be reduced with reusable<br>
packaging due to its efficient stacking and reduced need for frequent<br>
shipments21. It's important to consider that shifting to reusable<br>
packaging for e-commerce can lead to a cost increase of more than 50%<br>
for mailer bags and nearly 200% for cardboard boxes, depending on the<br>
specific scenario22.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The use of gamification and blockchain rewards presents a promising<br>
avenue for incentivizing the return of reusable packaging. By creating a<br>
more engaging and rewarding experience, businesses can encourage<br>
customers to actively participate in the circular economy, leading to<br>
higher return rates, increased customer loyalty, and a more sustainable<br>
future. While the higher implementation costs of Model 2 may seem<br>
daunting 14, the potential long-term benefits, both economically and<br>
environmentally, make it a compelling option for businesses seeking to<br>
optimize their reusable packaging programs.</p>
<p>This approach has the potential to drive sustainability in the<br>
e-commerce industry by significantly reducing waste and promoting<br>
responsible consumption. Moreover, it can transform customer engagement<br>
and loyalty programs by offering more personalized and interactive<br>
experiences. The integration of blockchain with other technologies, such<br>
as AI and IoT, can further enhance these programs by enabling smarter<br>
rewards, personalized offers, and more efficient tracking of<br>
returns14. As blockchain technology continues to evolve and gain wider<br>
adoption, we can expect to see even more innovative applications in the<br>
realm of customer engagement and sustainable practices.</p>

<p>Identity and fraud are two sides of the same coin, and emerging technologies have made it impossible (and risky) to separate the two. Leveraging stolen credentials, synthetic identities, and artificial intelligence (AI), fraudsters are exploiting vulnerabilities across organizations with siloed identity and access management (IAM) and fraud functions. <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/blog/posts/2024/account-takeover-ato-fraud.html">Account takeover (ATO)</a> fraud surged by 354% in 2023 alone, underscoring the need for a unified approach. Addressing today’s threat environment requires identity and fraud teams to share insights and adopt integrated strategies that proactively stop fraud before it occurs. Collaboration is not just a technological necessity but a strategic imperative to protect organizations and their customers from increasingly sophisticated attacks.</p>

 Bridging the&nbsp;Gap <p>For developers looking to build in Web3, the transition from Web2 can feel like stepping into an uncharted territory. While decentralization unlocks incredible possibilities, it also introduces unfamiliar complexities, fragmented tooling, and new security paradigms that can slow down innovation and adoption.</p> 🛠 The Developer Struggles in&nbsp;Web3 <p>Web2 development has long been streamlined with centralized hosting, standardized SDKs, and predictable infrastructure.</p><blockquote>Web3, on the other hand, presents a maze of challenges:</blockquote><blockquote>Burner Wallets &amp; User Retention — Temporary wallets lead to high churn rates, making it difficult for developers to retain&nbsp;users.</blockquote><blockquote>Fragmented Infrastructure — No single framework exists; developers must juggle multiple chains, protocols, and standards.</blockquote><blockquote>Gas Fees &amp; Transaction Friction — Onboarding users comes with the burden of explaining gas fees, network congestion, and transaction speeds.</blockquote><blockquote>Security &amp; Custody Dilemmas — Self-custody is empowering, but it also places greater responsibility on developers to ensure key management solutions are secure and user-friendly.</blockquote><blockquote>Developer Tooling Gaps — Compared to Web2, Web3 lacks a polished, standardized stack, making it harder to ship production-ready applications efficiently.</blockquote><blockquote>How Web3 Can Make Onboarding Developers Easier?🤔</blockquote><p>💡 If Web3 is to reach mass adoption, we need to lower the barriers for developers by addressing key inefficiencies:</p><blockquote>🎯 Unified Developer Tooling — Simplified SDKs, modular APIs, and cross-chain compatibility to reduce friction in building dApps.<br>🎯 Abstracting Complexity — Gasless transactions, account abstraction, and streamlined wallet UX to eliminate unnecessary hurdles for both devs and users.<br>🎯 Scalability Without Trade-offs — Optimized rollups, L2 solutions, and auto-scaling infrastructure to ensure smooth, high-performance applications.<br>🎯 Security-First Design — Better frameworks for key management, on-chain security, and phishing protection to enhance developer confidence.<br>🎯Bridging Web2 Standards — Making the transition easier by integrating familiar Web2 authentication models (OAuth, SSO) with decentralized identity&nbsp;systems.</blockquote> 🌍 The Future: A Frictionless Web3 for&nbsp;Builders <p>Developers shouldn’t have to choose between innovation and usability. The goal should be a Web3 ecosystem that feels as intuitive and powerful as Web2, without sacrificing decentralization. The real Web3 revolution will come when builders can focus on creating great products without the unnecessary headaches.</p><p>The next wave of Web3 adoption starts with better developer experiences. Let’s make Web3 as seamless as it is powerful.</p><p>Team Safle&nbsp;✨</p>

				 <p>Mark is the founder of a growing logistics company, and after months of negotiation, he’s ready to seal a major partnership with a global distributor. But first, his company needs to undergo a Know Your Business (KYB) verification—a process he assumes will be long, tedious, and full of back-and-forth document requests.</p>



<p>Instead, Mark is about to experience how modern KYB technology makes business verification faster, simpler, and more secure.</p>



 



 A New Kind of KYB Process 



<p>In the past, Mark would’ve been asked to submit business registration papers, proof of ownership, and leadership information through email. On the other side, the distributor’s compliance team would spend days cross-checking everything manually, verifying documents, and screening for red flags.</p>



<p>This time, Mark receives a secure link to a KYB platform. The process is refreshingly simple:</p>



 
 Step 1: Mark enters his company’s registration number, and the system pulls verified data from official registries in seconds. 



 Step 2: He completes a quick biometric verification using his smartphone to confirm that he’s the authorized representative. 



 Step 3: The platform automatically runs global sanctions checks and searches for adverse media mentions. 
 



<p>By the time Mark finishes his morning coffee, the verification is done.</p>



 



 Instant Verification for Ownership and Key Personnel 



<p>KYB goes beyond company registration—it verifies who owns and controls the business. The platform prompts each key executive to complete their own ID verification remotely, ensuring they are who they claim to be.</p>



 
 Government-issued IDs are scanned and validated. 



 Biometric liveness detection confirms that the individuals are physically present. 



 The system’s secure, blockchain-backed ledger keeps records tamper-proof and ready for audits. 
 



 



 Cross-Border Compliance in Real Time 



<p>Mark’s company operates internationally, which means regulatory checks across multiple jurisdictions. Thanks to automation, the KYB system:</p>



 
 Cross-references corporate filings from various countries. 



 Screens against global sanctions and politically exposed persons (PEP) lists. 



 Ensures that beneficial ownership is transparent and compliant with regulations. 
 



<p>What once took days of manual research now happens in minutes.</p>



 



 KYB as a Business Enabler 



<p>Instead of being a bottleneck, the KYB process becomes a point of confidence for Mark and the distributor. By verifying his company’s legitimacy quickly and securely, the deal moves forward without delays.</p>



<p>For growing businesses like Mark’s, digital KYB isn’t just about meeting regulations—it’s about building trust and accelerating partnerships. With tools that combine biometric verification, automated regulatory checks, and secure data management, KYB is transforming from a necessary step into a competitive advantage.</p>



<p>Mark signs the contract that same afternoon, knowing his company’s reputation is as solid as the deal itself.</p>



<p>For industries like real estate, insurance, and lending, digital KYB solutions offer more than regulatory compliance—they enhance transparency, strengthen relationships, and foster faster, safer transactions.</p>

<p>Gartner VP Analyst <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/akifk/">Akif Khan</a> has good reason to believe workforce use cases for identity verification (IDV) will gain serious traction in 2025. Having received just five calls about the topic in the first five of his six years on Gartner’s IAM team, he reports there’s been a major spike in such queries in recent months. In a January <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/akifk_workplaces-are-evolving-ive-covered-identity-activity-7284939872417579008-mn3Z/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_ios">LinkedIn post</a>, Kahn reveals the biggest drivers of client interest in workforce IDV are account recovery flows and employee onboarding.</p>
<p>It’s easy to see why. Thanks to high-profile data breaches at <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/authentication/mgm-caesars-hacks-more-of-the-same-is-coming-your-way-but-heres-how-to-stop-it/">MGM and Caesars</a>, IT service desks have become prime targets for fraudsters impersonating employees seeking assistance with a password reset and account recovery. In these “vishing” scams, information gleaned from employee social media profiles can help hackers fool overworked IT service desk personnel into granting them unfettered access to corporate systems.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, more than 100 US companies in aerospace, defense, retail, and technology have fallen prey to North Korean nation-state attackers leveraging falsified identity information and <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/01/24/identity-fraud-rise/">deepfake technology</a> to gain employment in <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/01/29/north-korea-jobs-indict-money-plot/77958927007/">remote IT positions</a> from which they can exfiltrate data and conduct espionage. Even though technology to prevent such incursions is readily available, the frequency and severity of successful attacks keep growing.</p>
 Workforce Wake-up Call: The IDV Imperative 
<p>Whether it’s the service desk or employee onboarding, the cost of doing nothing about workforce IDV can be catastrophic. Once fraudsters have infiltrated corporate systems, they are free to escalate their access privileges, steal valuable data and source code, deploy crippling ransomware, and more.</p>
<p>Ransomware exposure costs US businesses an estimated <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/heatherwishartsmith/2024/12/09/the-persistent-ransomware-threat-2024-trends-and-high-profile-attacks/">$124 billion</a> annually, and 35% of victim organizations never retain their data. And that’s just the start of the pain. A year after the February 2024 ransomware attack on UnitedHealth, the $22 million ransom was nothing compared to the <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/ransowmare-attacks-in-2024/52949/">$3.09 billion</a> in total financial losses stemming from the incident.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the average cost of a data breach topped $4.88 million in 2024—<a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/documents/us-en/107a02e94948f4ec">$9.48 million</a> for US-based organizations. But according to PwC, 27% of companies worldwide, and 34% of companies in North America, have suffered a data breach that cost them between $1 million and <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/34-Cybersecurity-Statistics-to-Lose-Sleep-Over-in-2020">$20 million</a> in the past three years. As much as 44% of organizations hit by an <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2024/11/06/identity-related-data-breaches-cost/">identity-related breach</a> estimated the associated costs exceed those of a typical data breach.</p>
<p>In the case of North Korea’s operatives, fraudulent employees who passed background checks, reference verifications, and rounds of <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/security-firm-hires-north-korean-hacker-knowbe4">Zoom interviews</a> performed job tasks while installing remote monitoring and management <a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/crowdstrike-2024-report-exposes-north-koreas-covert-workforce-in-u-s-tech-firms/">(RMM) tools</a> to establish a persistent presence within compromised networks. Others worked to exfiltrate data stored in OneDrive, SharePoint, and other cloud-based systems.</p>
<p>With help desk attacks, the ever-growing attack surface of outsourced IT support and call center operations crewed by less experienced, often short-term employees make these organizations especially vulnerable to vishing. Emerging, <a href="https://hitconsultant.net/2024/08/08/ai-voice-deepfakes-waging-war-on-healthcare/">AI voice-enabled attack</a> modalities only make matters worse</p>
 Hope Is Not a Strategy: Balancing Security, Cost, and UX 
<p>Put it all together, and it’s no wonder Khan is fielding more questions about workforce IDV. And in his post, he asks the exact right questions: “Will organizations see the value in using IDV for these workforces use cases? Do they see the cost and challenges to the UX as proportionate to the risks being mitigated? And do they feel confident that IDV can mitigate those risks?”</p>
<p>As I mentioned, technologies to effectively address these use cases are widely available today. Organizations sourcing solutions are likely to find these same technologies prompt answers to Khan’s other questions in the affirmative.</p>
<p>The problem today is that HR departments and IT service desk operations with remote workers tend to rely on antiquated identity verification processes that rely on manual review of government-issued credentials shared in the clear via email and SMS messaging. High-quality fake credentials and deepfake technologies easily defeat these measures. Traditional forms of multifactor authentication (MFA) aren’t much help. Fraudsters increasingly demonstrate the ability to compromise SMS-based codes and push notifications through social engineering, SIM swapping, and other techniques.</p>
<p>Many forms of biometric authentication aren’t foolproof either. Anyone with administrative access can register things like user biometrics to any device they access—or set up an alternative identity provider to bypass authentication measures all together. These technologies aren’t always easy to integrate with existing workflows or infrastructure either—let alone meet a growing array of privacy mandates.</p>
 Modernizing Workforce Verification and Authentication 
<p>With traditional forms of MFA growing unreliable, modern forms of identity verification and authentication are setting new standards for security, convenience, and efficiency. Solutions certified to <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO2</a>, <a href="https://www.ibeta.com/">iBeta biometrics-</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-identity-attributes-trust-framework-updated-version">UK DIATF</a>, and <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/">NIST 800-63-3</a> standards, for instance, combine machine-verified identity to government-issued credentials (driver’s license, state ID, passport, etc.) and enable non-phishable multifactor authentication when verified users login to digital services.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/">1Kosmos</a>, for example, is a case in point. Our workforce <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/verify/">verification solution</a> provides an order of magnitude improvement in credential issuing during user onboarding and account recovery—replacing weak, knowledge-based and two-factor forms of authentication with a simple self-service workflow that accommodates government-issued credentials in 140 countries with 99% accuracy. Executed from any device, anywhere, anytime, 1Kosmos detects stolen and synthetic identities while establishing high-assurance trust for legitimate workers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our workforce <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/workforce/">authentication solution</a> eliminates the vulnerabilities of traditional passwords via passwordless, identity-backed biometrics. Built on a decentralized identity framework, it ensures secure, frictionless authentication of employees, contactors, and supply chain partners and, importantly, puts users in control of their own personal identifiable information. We also provide support for password reset and legacy 2FA/MFA to accommodate disparate IT environments built over decades.</p>
<p>Our solutions are built on the only platform certified to NIST 800-63-3, UK DIATF, FIDO2, and iBeta ISO/IEC 30107- standards with an SDK and standard APIs to avoid security exploits and prevent vendor lock. With collaborations like our partnership <a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2025/01/unlocking-workforce-security-1kosmos-concentrix-expand-identity-backed-passwordless-mfa/">with Concentrix</a>, we help organizations enable workforce verification and authentication that transforms security, reduces costs, and enhances the user experience.</p>
 Khan-versation Starter: Looking Forward to What’s Next 
<p>In his LinkedIn post, Gartner’s Khan writes, “I’m super interested to see whether this takes hold in 2025,” adding,” I look forward to engaging with clients and vendors this year to see how this shapes up.” We couldn’t agree more—and we look forward to doing just that.</p>

<p>Educational institutions, such as universities, public schools, and entities issuing certification courses, face a growing need for secure, efficient identity verification systems that support a mobile-ready world. Ensuring that students, staff, and alumni have safe and convenient access to their credentials is essential, and in today’s world, having their credentials easily accessible on their phones is the experience they expect. Traditional paper-based documents, from diplomas to transcripts, can be cumbersome, prone to forgery, and slow to access and verify. These outdated processes create inefficiencies, increase administrative workloads, and open doors to credential fraud.</p><p>Verifiable Digital Credentials (VDCs) offer a streamlined, tamper-proof solution that addresses these challenges head-on. By moving away from paper-based records to digital verifiable credentials, educational institutions can improve security, efficiency, and user experience. Read on to explore the top ten real-world applications of digital credentials in education and how SpruceID can partner with institutions to drive digital transformation.</p> Today’s Top 10 Real-World Applications <p>1. Digital Diplomas and Certificates: Traditional diplomas are susceptible to damage, loss, and fraud. With VDCs, students can access secure, verifiable digital diplomas that are easily shared with employers or graduate programs. This ensures authenticity while enabling institutions to reduce administrative burdens associated with paper records.</p><p>2. Transcripts and Academic Records: Transcripts often take weeks to process and are costly to manage. Digital credentials provide instant, secure access to academic records, allowing students to share their achievements with prospective employers or other institutions. VDCs streamline the verification process, making it more efficient and less prone to error.</p><p>3. Enrollment Verification: When students apply for discounts or benefits based on their enrollment status, paper verifications can slow down approval processes and increase the risk of fraud. VDCs enable instant, accurate verification of enrollment status, facilitating faster access to services such as health insurance, transportation, and housing.</p><p>4. Professional Certifications: Digital credentials can serve as verifiable proof of certification for students completing professional courses, simplifying the job application process. Employers gain confidence that candidates possess verified skills, reducing onboarding time and enhancing workforce quality.</p><p>5. Student ID Cards: Physical student IDs can be lost, stolen, or counterfeited, posing security risks on campuses. Digital student ID credentials streamline campus access—from libraries to dining halls and reduce the risk of unauthorized access to campus facilities. They can also be presented to businesses or services that offer benefits and discounts for enrolled students.</p><p>6. Continuing Education and Micro-Credentials: Lifelong learning is on the rise, and micro-credentials are increasingly important. VDCs allow institutions to issue verified micro-credentials and continuing education certificates, empowering individuals to build a verified portfolio of skills for career advancement.</p><p>7. Internship and Extracurricular Verifications: Internships and extracurricular involvement are valuable experiences, but verifying participation can be challenging with paper-based methods. Digital credentials can serve as verifiable records of participation using cryptographic technology that can’t be faked, simplifying the application process for further education or employment.</p><p>8. Financial Aid and Scholarship Eligibility:&nbsp;Applying for financial aid and scholarships often requires students to verify their identity and enrollment status, which can be a time-consuming process involving paperwork and manual checks. By integrating Verifiable Digital Credentials (VDCs)—such as mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) or digital student IDs—students can instantly confirm their identity and eligibility, expediting the verification process and reducing administrative delays. This streamlined approach can ensure faster access to student funding while improving security and trust in the application process.</p><p>9. Alumni Identity and Credentials: Educational institutions often manage records for alumni long after graduation. Digital credentials ensure alumni can easily access and share their academic records and certifications, providing value long after their time at the institution and allowing them to slowly transition out of university accounts.</p><p>10. International Student Verification: International students often need to verify their credentials across borders, which can be a slow and complicated process. VDCs enable fast, reliable verification for visas, immigration, and educational assessments, helping students navigate cross-border requirements efficiently.</p> SpruceID’s Solution <p>SpruceID partners with educational institutions and government workforce development councils to create a secure ecosystem of verifiable digital credentials that enhance trust, security, and efficiency. We are currently working with Colorado on skills-based hiring and digital learning records (LERs), aiming to create a future where skills, not just credentials, connect people to job opportunities while addressing workforce challenges.</p><p><a href="https://workshift.org/in-push-for-skills-based-hiring-colorado-invests-in-new-tech-and-a-new-language-of-learning/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Learn how SpruceID is supporting this vision as the chosen tech vendor</a> to help ColoradoFWD toward its goal of designing a multi-use digital wallet.</p><p>Our Credible platform supports a wide range of digital credentials, from diplomas to student IDs, utilizing cryptographic signatures to prevent tampering, unauthorized sharing, or fraudulent reproduction. With minimal data disclosure, students can confirm credentials with only essential information, keeping their personal details secure and in compliance with privacy standards. This approach reduces administrative bottlenecks and streamlines verifications, ultimately lowering costs related to physical records, printing, and mailing.</p> Shaping the Future of Digital Identity in Education <p>We believe the future of education will fully embrace verifiable digital credential solutions that integrate seamlessly with industry standards and foster collaboration across the sector. By adopting VDCs, institutions can protect students’ data, improve the services they provide, and reduce administrative burdens.</p><p>SpruceID is committed to helping institutions prepare for this digital transformation, working with universities, colleges, and other educational entities to implement scalable, interoperable solutions.

<p>Here’s our progress over the last two weeks:</p><p>Holochain Core, Runtimes &amp; Dev Tooling: Holochain 0.4.1 has moved from release-candidate to an official <a href="https://crates.io/crates/holochain?ref=blog.holochain.org">release</a>. This version has been integrated into the deployment runtime <a href="https://github.com/holochain/kangaroo-electron?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kangaroo</a>, the scaffolding tool has been updated to use it, and the Launcher update is in progress.&nbsp; We have positive reports from the field of people using the 0.4.1 release in their apps.</p><p>Networking: We are wrapping up the rewrite of our low-level networking modules: tx5 and Kitsune2. Tx5 implements the low-level p2p end-to-end encrypted WebRTC connections between peers, while Kitsune2 implements the layer on top of tx5 to store and sync data through gossip in distributed hash tables (DHTs) between the peers. The first versions of Kitsune2 crates have been published to <a href="https://crates.io/search?q=kitsune2&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org">crates.io</a>! Our next steps are: </p><p>1) creating Wind Tunnel tests for Kitsune separate from Holochain, </p><p>2) writing a simple showcase kitsune-only p2p app for internal review, and </p><p>3) integrating the crates back into the Holochain codebase. </p><p>These next steps have been scoped, estimated and are underway.</p><p>Testing: It was quite fun to run through our current manual testing process on the first 0.4.1 release candidate, catch an error, have that fixed and run through the same test procedure successfully to then yield the green light for the full release. On the automated testing front, we’ve spun up our orchestration Nomad server, and hooking that up to Nomad-clients deployed to Holoports is well underway.</p><p>Dev Docs: We are continuing work to improve our developer documentation. Over the last two weeks we published <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Build Guides</a> on <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/dnas/?ref=blog.holochain.org">DNAs</a> &amp; <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/build/zomes/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Zomes</a>, next up are docs on hApps, validation and genesis self-check!</p><p>As always, the best place to really see the details behind the Dev Pulse is to look at Github’s Insights page for whichever repo you are most interested in. For example see <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pulse/monthly?ref=blog.holochain.org">Holochain</a> and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/kitsune2/pulse?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kitsune2</a>.&nbsp;</p><p></p>

</p>  What is a Digital Signature? Secure Your Information with Encryption &amp; a 6-Step Signing Process  <p>2024/6/30</p>
     <br>


  <br>


      <br>
  <p>In the digital era, securing electronic documents and transactions is crucial to prevent fraud and unauthorized access. Digital signatures are cryptographic security measures that authenticate the identity of the signer and ensure the integrity of documents.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

  <br>
   I. What is a Digital Signature? Is it Legally Recognized?&nbsp; 
  <br>


  <br>


   A. Definition of a Digital Signature&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  <br>
  <p>Digital Signature is an anti-counterfeiting method that can verify the authenticity of digital credentials such as electronic documents and electronic certificates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Article 2, Item 3 of Taiwan’s “<a href="https://law.moj.gov.tw/ENG/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?pcode=J0080037">Electronic Signatures Act</a>” by the Ministry of Digital Affairs, a “digital signature” refers to a type of electronic signature created using mathematical algorithms or other cryptographic methods to generate a specific length of digital data encrypted with the signatory’s private key. It can be verified using a public key and is supported by a certificate issued by a certification authority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To simplify, the digital signature is a way of signing e-documents. It is encrypted with the “private key” that belongs to the document owner. When others receive a digitally signed document, they can use the ‘public key’ to verify the signature. If the verification is correct, it can prove that the original owner truly signed the document and that the contents have not been tampered with or forged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you see an e-document as an official printed letter, a digital signature is a seal that can prove the letter’s authenticity.&nbsp;</p>
  <br>


  <br>


   B. How Digital Signatures Work 
  <br>
  <p>There are 3 main functions of digital signature:&nbsp;</p>
  <br>


      <br>
   
 Ensure the identity of the signer: Digital signatures can authenticate the identity of the signer to ensure that the signer of an e-document is the actual owner or authorizer of the document.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Keep the security and integrity of document content: Digital signatures can maintain the integrity of e–document content and prevent it from being tampered with or omitted.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Avoid contract disputes: A legally valid digital signature can protect the rights and interests of both parties and prevent either party from repudiating the contract.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
  <br>


  <br>


   C. 3 Key Legal Elements of a Digital Signature&nbsp; 
  <br>
  <p>To be legally valid, a digital signature must meet three criteria:&nbsp;</p>
  <br>


      <br>
   
 Verifiability – Must be issued by a recognized Certification Authority (CA).&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Full Presentability – Must be readable and accessible in any format or device.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Mutual Agreement – Both parties must consent to digitally sign the document.&nbsp; 
 
  <br>

  <br>
   II. Digital vs. Electronic Signatures: What’s the Difference? 
  <br>
  <p>The most common way to sign a document is to sign it with a physical handwritten signature. However, paper documents are not only easily damaged and not conducive to archiving, but also have low security. Therefore, with the development of digital documents, handwritten signatures have gradually been transformed into electronic signatures and digital signatures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital signature is a type of electronic signature, but the two have different meanings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The electronic signature covers a wide range, as long as it is in electronic form, i.e. the signatures generated through digitizing can be considered as electronic signatures. Common forms include text, images, symbols, etc. Scanned documents of handwritten signatures are also counted as electronic signatures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital signatures refer specifically to the signature generated by encryption algorithm technology.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between digital and electronic signatures is security. Digital signatures use algorithms, encryption technology, and third-party certification authorities to enhance security and credibility, while electronic signatures lack the guarantee of these certificates.&nbsp;</p>

   III. How Do Digital Signatures Work? Encryption &amp; Signing Process 
  <br>


  <br>


   A. Introduction to the principles of digital signature 
  <br>


  a. Encryption Methods: Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Cryptography     <br>
  <p>Digital signatures and digital documents are based on the same encryption principle, but the execution method is slightly different.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital signature uses asymmetric cryptography to sign documents with a private key and verify signatures with a public key. Besides digital signature, asymmetric cryptography can also be applied to digital credentials, which encrypts the document with the public key (lock) and decrypts the document with the private key (unlock).&nbsp;</p>
 
 Symmetric Encryption: One lock matches one key. The key for encryption and decryption is the same. Thus, if you lock with key A, you can only open with key A.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Asymmetric Encryption: The key that encrypts and decrypts is not the same, but a pair of different public and private keys. Use public key A to lock, but use private key B to open. The private key is not publicly available, so it can be used to decrypt or sign files.&nbsp; 
 
  <br>


  b. RSA      <br>
  <p>RSA is one of the most widely used asymmetric encryption algorithms for digital signatures, secure email, and online banking. It was developed at MIT in 1977 and remains a critical security standard.&nbsp;</p>
  <br>


  <br>


   B. Step-by-Step Guide to Apply a Digital Signature 
  <br>


  a. How to Obtain &amp; Use a Digital Signature      <br>
  <p>Follow these six essential steps to securely sign digital documents:&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
  <br>


      <br>
  <p>STEP 1. Apply for a Digital Certificate from a Certification Authority (CA).&nbsp;</p>
<p>STEP 2. The CA confirms the applicant’s identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>STEP 3. Receive Your Private-Public Key Pair linked to your verified identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>STEP 4. Digitally Sign Documents using the private key.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>STEP 5. The CA issues the credential to the applicant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>STEP 6. Recipients confirm authenticity using the public key.&nbsp;</p>
  <br>


  b. Security Precautions for Digital Signatures     <br>
  <p>Even the most secure encryption methods are vulnerable to cyber threats. Here’s how to safeguard your digitally signed documents:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 Use a trusted Certification Authority (CA) for issuing digital certificates.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Ensure public key &amp; identity binding to prevent unauthorized access.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Store private keys securely to prevent cyberattacks.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
 
 Verify signed documents before accepting them to avoid fraudulent transactions.&nbsp;
