 Following the launch of Veriscope on the Shyft Network blockchain and integration from the world’s leading crypto exchanges, we break down how Veriscope’s solution to the “Sunrise Issue” solves one of the biggest regulatory challenges facing the industry and regulators alike. <p>Imagine for a moment: you head outside, stare up into the sky, and see a beautiful mix of red, orange, and blue above as the sunrise slowly takes&nbsp;form.</p><p>You ask yourself: is anyone else seeing&nbsp;this?</p><p>The answer? Well, it’s complicated. While the sun rises for everyone on Earth, it doesn’t happen for us all at the same time. Time zones exist to acknowledge this fact of life, establishing set (albeit changing) times each day when the sun comes up over the horizon in different parts of the&nbsp;world.</p><blockquote>Read: <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/were-live-veriscope-launches-on-mainnet-with-binance-bitfinex-tether-huobi-moonpay-deribit-58cfa6ec65ef">We’re Live: Veriscope Launches on Mainnet with Binance, Bitfinex, Tether, Huobi, Moonpay, Deribit, Gate.io and&nbsp;more</a></blockquote><p>Ok, so now you’re probably wondering: why am I getting an Astronomy 101 lesson in a Shyft Network blog? As with the rising sun, global crypto regulation, specifically anti-money laundering (AML) takes shape and is implemented in different ways and at different times depending on what country, or jurisdiction, you are in. When the real question is not whether regulation is coming or not, but when and how; the tricky part is, how do we prepare ourselves for the inevitable?</p><p>Enter the Sunrise&nbsp;Issue.</p> FATF &amp; The Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>In 2019, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental organization focused on preventing money laundering and other malicious financial activities, set its sights on crypto. The FATF proposed that the Travel Rule, a requirement for regulated firms to collect and share the personal data of participants in financial transactions, should now apply to what they defined as VASPs (Virtual Asset Service Providers). Broadly speaking, a VASP is a cryptocurrency exchange, liquidity provider or custodian; whether centralized or decentralized. According to the FATF’s pseudo-binding Recommendations, VASPs are required to collect personal data on participants in financial exchanges exceeding 1,000 USD/EUR. Some countries have lowered the threshold to&nbsp;zero.</p><p>For the VASPs subject to FATF’s latest Recommendations and the Travel Rule, identifying info such as names and account numbers of transacting parties (senders, recipients) is now required to be “in compliance” as these Recommendations are implemented into local regulations on a country-by-country basis.</p><p>Veriscope, Shyft Network’s Travel Rule solution, was developed to grant VASPs a decentralized solution for complying with global regulations, such as the FATF’s Travel Rule. Veriscope allows VASPs to be Travel Rule-compliant by enabling them to automatically discover which VASP (an exchange, liquidity provider or custodial wallet) is the recipient of crypto assets sent by their customers. Then, Veriscope enables VASPs to transmit the required customer data to each other to ensure that their customers are not involved in money laundering, sanctions evasion, or other illicit activity. Veriscope automates the discovery of VASP details on-chain and the secure and authenticated exchange of customers’ private&nbsp;data.</p><p>Veriscope’s seamless approach protects customers and empowers local and global VASPs to be compliant when processing transactions regardless of when their counterparty VASPs agree to start using a Travel Rule solution (Veriscope) or where they operate across the&nbsp;world.</p><p>So why is the last part so important? Because just like the sunrise takes place at different times around the world, so does the implementation of the FATF’s Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> Setting up the&nbsp;Sunrise <p>So let’s break it&nbsp;down:</p>  VASP “A” operates in a jurisdiction where Travel Rule compliance is required. VASP A can see the sunrise in their location and wants the ability to talk about it without someone else who lives in a different place, where the sun hasn’t yet gone up (VASP&nbsp;B).  VASP “B” is located somewhere where the Travel Rule isn’t yet a regulatory obligation.  VASP A sends an information request to VASP B. In layman’s terms, this means that VASP A simply wants to talk to VASP B about their experience watching the sunrise. They ask (or post a request) for this information from VASP B, who will respond once the sun has risen wherever they are, enabling them to successfully answer VASP’s A question, regardless of how much time has passed between the question and&nbsp;answer.  However, this isn’t always the case. Does VASP B really need to answer VASP A’s request for information about the sunrise? So if the sender needs information that the recipient is not (yet) obligated to provide, how can the sender be compliant? Alas, the Sunrise&nbsp;Issue.  <p>The Sunrise Issue has become a challenging roadblock to global Travel Rule compliance because, as said above, different countries adopt Travel Rule laws at different times. The result — and issue — is that certain VASPs who comply with FATF Travel Rule today might want to share customer details with their VASP counterparties who have not implemented a Travel Rule solution (even though they might tomorrow).</p> Shyft, Veriscope, and a Sunrise&nbsp;Solution <p>Veriscope, Shyft Network’s Travel Rule solution, was developed to solve this very issue. Due to an innovative technology called “historic look back,” Veriscope allows VASPs to obtain information on any transaction regardless of when the transaction happened, even if it happened before the receiving VASP signed on with Veriscope or another Travel Rule solution. To obtain these details, originator VASPs post information requests that will be responded to when the beneficiary VASP joins the network. As a new VASP joins, they receive these historical requests and can respond with the necessary information. No other Travel Rule solution can do&nbsp;this.</p><p>So let’s return to where we started, looking up at the sky as the sun begins to appear from over the horizon. If regulation requires us to only transact with those who, like us, see the sun rising (i.e. are compliant with the Travel Rule), how do we help those who are still living in darkness (i.e. don’t have the requirement to support Travel Rule)? We don’t leave them behind. Veriscope allows them to transact when the sun rises for them, but based on a time when the sun rose for us, generate the supporting material that shows that they are compliant, and enable a globalized network of VASPs to remain at the vanguard of this technological movement.</p><p>How do we do this? Veriscope achieves historic lookback through immutable on-chain records, providing an open, permanent audit trail of every request for information submitted by VASPs. Additionally, Veriscope’s interoperability permits ultra-secure VASP-to-VASP communication and can enable the broadest VASP network reach by integrating with other Travel Rule protocols. We should say, whilst we use Blockchain technology to drive Veriscope and to power this feature, no customer private information is stored on there; instead, this information is exchanged over a direct peer-to-peer communication between&nbsp;VASPs.</p> Looking Forward <p>We are living (and transacting) in a time where regulation in crypto is experiencing more significant complexities than ever before. As of late March 2022, we even learned that the European Parliament <a href="https://decrypt.co/96539/eu-parliament-votes-impose-kyc-private-crypto-wallets">had voted on implementing new sanctions</a> that would require KYC (know-your-customer) on private, unhosted crypto wallets. So how can we adhere to growing regulation and a need for more identifying information on crypto customers without giving up our identity completely? It’s for this very reason that Veriscope was&nbsp;created.</p><p>We know that compliant solutions like Veriscope and its ability to solve regulatory problems like the Sunrise Issue will benefit everyone. Regulators we work with every day are impressed by our solution’s unique feature and how it can help bridge the gap between compliant and non-compliant VASPs and the jurisdictions they operate in. Ultimately, we all share the dream of mass adoption of cryptocurrency as a better path forward for financial markets and&nbsp;society.</p><blockquote>Read: <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/8-reasons-to-choose-veriscope-cryptos-most-frictionless-secure-travel-rule-solution-d714b8056d08">8 Reasons to Choose Veriscope, Crypto’s Most Frictionless &amp; Secure Travel Rule&nbsp;Solution</a></blockquote><p>Regulation and compliance are no longer requirements we should consider a “bad word” or roadblock to circumnavigate. Through solutions like Veriscope, we can bring everyone from this incredible world together to move forward as one, not merely around obstacles that have long hindered our progress.</p><p>Like the beautiful morning light from the sun, we should all be able to share in the innovative power of crypto transactions safely and securely. Finally, we can all see the sunrise together — and be ready when the light&nbsp;hits.</p><p>Visit our new Veriscope website to learn more and implement our Travel Rule solution. <a href="https://veriscope.network/">https://veriscope.network/</a></p><p>— Shyft&nbsp;Network</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/">Website</a> / <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/">Medium</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/JGac8fqk">Discord</a></p>

<p>The access control specialist <a href="https://www.legic.com/home">LEGIC Identsystems</a> is partnering with <a href="https://www.zwipe.com/">Zwipe</a> to provide its clients with biometric security cards. To that end, the company will be integrating the Zwipe Access solution with its own LEGIC Security Platform.</p>



  



<p>The Zwipe Access solution essentially turns a conventional access card into a more secure multi-factor authentication option through the use of a built-in fingerprint sensor. The card can be presented at a badge reader like any other physical credential, but the person will only be granted access if there is a fingerprint match when the card is detected. As a result, other people cannot use the card in the event that it gets lost or stolen.</p>



<p>Zwipe Access has additional benefits from a privacy perspective. Each user’s print is captured with the built-in fingerprint sensor, and the biometric template is encrypted and stored in a secure element on the card itself. That means that the organization issuing the cards does not need to maintain any kind of biometric database, which in turn makes it easier to comply with GDPR regulations. The cards are also compatible with legacy readers, so organizations can upgrade to biometric security without needing to replace their existing access hardware.</p>



<p>“Zwipe’s batteryless smartcards add a new layer of security to the huge installed base of LEGIC card-based access control systems worldwide,” said LEGIC BU Access Control Head John Harvey. “This innovation brings benefits that were formerly only available on smartphone solutions, while preserving existing infrastructure and drastically reducing time-to-market.”</p>



<p>“We are already working on several sharp customer cases based on LEGIC’s Security Platform,” added Zwipe CEO André Løvestam. “We are confident this is only the start of a long series of opportunities with LEGIC.”</p>



<p>Zwipe formally <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/zwipe-modifies-biometric-payment-cards-access-control-applications-120101/">unveiled its new Access solution</a> at the tail end of 2021, using a modified version of the same technology that <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/zwipe-says-f-code-certifications-fully-validate-its-core-biometric-card-tech-811051/">powers is biometric payment cards</a>. The company has already delivered <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/zwipe-provide-biometric-cards-indias-skarn-robotics-022306/">access solutions for India’s sKarn RoboticS</a>, and has indicated that physical security will be <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/zwipe-anticipates-breakthrough-year-2022-010302/">key to its growth prospects</a> in the months ahead.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facetec.com/">FaceTec</a> is doubling down on its pioneering spoof bounty program, raising the total potential payout from $100,000 to $200,000.</p>



<p>The program <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facetec-bounty-program-for-successful-hacks-of-biometric-authentication-solution-610256/">was first launched</a> in October of 2019, when FaceTec announced a three-level spoof bounty program would pay up to $30,000 to enterprising hackers who were able to trick its face-based authentication system into a false positive. In 2020, the company <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facetec-raises-biometric-spoof-bounty-to-100000-total-908051/">upped the ante significantly</a>, raising the total potential payout to $100,000, with various sums offered across five categories of presentation attack, having added a fourth level testing against biometric template tampering, and a fifth level in which hackers would attempt to bypass a device’s camera to fool the system.</p>



<p>In announcing its latest increase to the spoof bounty payout, FaceTec emphasized the threat of deepfake technology in particular, citing recent reports from Pennsylvania State, Zhejiang University, Shandong University, and the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity in calling it the number one threat to remote identity proofing systems. FaceTec CEO Kevin Alan Tussy, who has previously <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/100k-biometric-spoof-bounty-facetec-ceo-kevin-alan-tussy-interview-part-1-908148/">spoken with FindBiometrics</a> in detail about the spoof bounty program, suggested that independent testing authorities have struggled to keep pace with hackers.</p>



<p>The persistent threat of ‘spoofing’ or ‘presentation attacks’ has given rise to growing concerns in recent years about biometric systems’ capabilities of detecting the use of techniques that are designed to mimic legitimate biometric credentials for fraudulent purposes. These concerns have led a growing number of vendors to put their solutions through third-party testing programs, which evaluate solutions based on their compliance with the three levels of the ISO 30107 presentation attack detection standards. In maintaining an active bounty program, FaceTec is effectively undergoing an ongoing, public evaluation that remains subject to the constantly evolving spoof-threat landscape.</p>



<p>“We hoped PAD testing labs would evolve with threats, but they haven’t kept up, allowing unscrupulous liveness vendors to dramatically exaggerate their security levels,” he said. “Organizations choose FaceTec because security is paramount to them. Breaches can now cost billions, and more people are being hurt by identity theft than ever before. FaceTec’s mission is to stop fraud, not just check a regulatory box.”</p>



<p>FaceTec’s doubling down on its spoof bounty program is remarkable not only as a sign of the company’s confidence in its biometric authentication technology, but also a signal of its ongoing commitment to transparent industry leadership after FaceTec’s allegation at the start of this year that a rival vendor had <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facetec-sues-iproov-over-alleged-biometric-technology-patent-infringement-501051/">exploited the spoof bounty program</a> to steal trade secrets.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/04/03/now-that-q1-is-over-is-the-bull-market-back/">first quarter of 2022</a> in crypto markets was relatively steady with Bitcoin experiencing modest gains at the quarter’s end. Notably, several <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/15/bitcoin-breakout-elusive-as-traders-price-in-7-fed-rate-hikes-for-2022/">Fed rate hikes</a> were announced, and the Biden administration issued sweeping executive orders for <a href="https://news.bloombergtax.com/daily-tax-report/biden-pushes-for-more-coordinated-approach-to-crypto-oversight">plans to address crypto regulation</a>. The industry also saw a <a href="https://blockworks.co/bored-ape-yacht-club-creator-secures-whopping-450m-seed/">$4B valuation for Yuga Labs</a>.</p>



<p>Key Milestones</p>



<p>Our Q1 of 2022 was about expanding our reach into permissioned market spaces. In January, we <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/liquid-meta-partners-civic-technologies-123000872.html">announced a partnership</a> with a leading DeFi infrastructure company, Liquid Meta Capital Holdings Ltd. The purpose of our partnership is to bring trusted, secure permissioned identity services to DeFi and enable Liquid Meta to provide capital liquidity to permissioned dApps. Ultimately, the goal will be to promote the overall adoption of DeFi.</p>



<p>We also continued to build traction in the DeFi space through an integration with Credix Finance. Credix is building a decentralized marketplace to give borrowers in emerging countries access to previously untapped capital. Furthering the impact of this partnership was <a href="https://twitter.com/ProjectSerum/status/1493617065596489735">Credix’s receipt of a hackathon prize</a> for the Project Serum Convergence Hackathon. Their entry was a fully permissioned protocol transfer of assets, using Civic Pass.</p>



<p>As NFT marketplaces continued to implement and refine permissioning in their marketplaces, we took steps to improve the Civic Pass experience, starting with improving the minting process on Candy Machine. We tightened up our infrastructure, migrated Captcha providers and fixed bugs on the minting code. The result is a Civic Pass Captcha experience that’s <a href="https://twitter.com/civickey/status/1504561369776996370">noticeably faster and smoother</a>.</p>



<p>Together with our partner, Snowcrash, a new NFT marketplace from Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group, we <a href="https://decrypt.co/95959/solana-nft-platform-snowcrash-taps-civic-combat-bots">announced an integration</a> of our identity verification protocol in order to curb bot manipulation on the Snowcrash platform. Civic brought seasoned experience to the integration, having protected more than 200 mints, helped nearly 100,000 buyers successfully mint NFTs, and blocked a staggering 1,000,000+ bots from attempting purchases.</p>



<p>Finally, we expanded our reach by integrating with other blockchains. Casper Labs is a network designed to accelerate enterprise and developer adoption of its proof-of-stake blockchain technology built off the Casper CBC specification. We’ve <a href="https://twitter.com/Casper_Labs">partnered with Casper</a> to give dApps the ability to meet permissioning requirements.<a href="https://twitter.com/metacask"> </a>Our partner, Metacask, is the first dApp to <a href="https://twitter.com/metacask/status/1511642792388349957">showcase the integration</a>.</p>



<p>Civic in the News</p>



<p>In the fourth quarter, Civic accumulated a total online readership of more than 77 million viewers, as a result of press releases and news media coverage. Our partnership announcement with Snowcrash was covered by <a href="https://decrypt.co/95959/solana-nft-platform-snowcrash-taps-civic-combat-bots">Decrypt</a>, <a href="https://www.cryptotimes.io/snowcrash-teams-up-with-civic-to-prevent-bots-for-sony-and-universal/">The Crypto Times</a>, <a href="https://www.aliens.com/livenews/latest/solana-nft-platform-snowcrash-will-integrate-civic-to-curb-robot-operation-issues">Aliens</a> and <a href="https://www.dcforecasts.com/blockchain-news/snowcrash-solana-nft-platform-tapped-civic-to-fight-bots/">DC Forecasts</a>. Our Liquid Meta announcement was picked up by <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/liquid-meta-partners-civic-technologies-123000872.html">Yahoo</a>, Authority, Street Insider and Crypto News BTC. And, Cryptopedia <a href="https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/civic-identity-cvc-crypto-civic-crypto-cvc-token">published an overview</a> of our company.</p>



<p>We also participated in events. Our CEO, Chris Hart, spoke at the Digital Currency Summit. We sponsored and participated in Solana Hacker houses in <a href="https://twitter.com/civickey/status/1498834872177074178?">Prague</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/redacted_j/status/1483129798323015681">Chicago</a> and Seattle. We closed out the quarter by announcing our Snowcrash partnership at NFT LA.</p>



<p>Coming Soon</p>



<p>As the market for NFTs continues to develop, we’ve been building out opportunities for dApps to have permissioned spaces. This work will result in an improved framework for Civic Pass in the market by fostering easier adoption, integration and usage. You can expect to see the initial stages of this revised framework come to life in Q2.</p>



<p>Additionally, we are very excited about the tools we are currently building to enable the ultimate owners of identity, the individual, manage their web3 identities cross wallet, cross-chain and in a self sovereign model.</p>



<p>We are already speeding ahead in Q2 and are looking forward to making announcements in the coming months. Stay tuned!</p>

 In this 5-part series, we’ll look at how enterprises can rapidly deliver customer privacy solutions with the Sudo Platform digital identities and decentralized identity capabilities. Today, we’ll set the scene by introducing the data privacy problem and the Sudo solution. In future articles, we’ll dive deeper into the detail. 



<p></p>



 The data privacy problem 



<p></p>



<p>As you know, personal&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a>&nbsp;is simultaneously being supported and attacked —&nbsp;supported&nbsp;by privacy-enhancing regulations and&nbsp;attacked&nbsp;via loopholes and by those simply ignoring privacy laws.</p>



<p>Big Tech companies are capturing, abstracting, aggregating, packaging, analyzing and selling every user interaction. Knowledge about user behavior is the&nbsp;product&nbsp;— and it’s fair to say, we are in the midst of a&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">privacy crisis</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So,&nbsp;how should we respond to this crisis? We say through a new type of technology built with strong cryptographic security at its base.</p>



 The Sudo solution 



<p></p>



<p>Today, enterprises are urgently seeking ways to meet customer demands for safer and more private interactions with their services and the digital world. We believe the solution lies in empowering people to determine what information they share, and how, when and with whom they share it. We do this through the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>&nbsp;digital identity that users can take into the world and use in place of their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personal information</a>&nbsp;in many different scenarios in their daily physical and digital lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through our&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, enterprise developers can rapidly integrate digital identities into their applications and build a deeper level of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">trust</a>&nbsp;with their users. The platform provides extensive privacy capabilities, from communications to secure browsing to payments, all centered around digital identities.&nbsp;<br><br>We’re also enhancing these digital identities with&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">decentralized identity</a>&nbsp;technologies. Built on blockchain technology, decentralized identity provides a strong foundation for a much improved privacy experience for the user. Indeed, decentralization is being called the most important privacy innovation for the coming decade.&nbsp;</p>



 Definitions of decentralized identity vary, but this definition works well:&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>… an approach to identity and access management (IAM) that seeks ways to allow individuals to manage their own personally identifiable information (PII) instead of using a central authority. An important goal of decentralized identity is to create standards that will allow internet users to control which applications and services can have access to specific types of PII.</p>



<p>The two most common IAM models on the internet are centralized (e.g.&nbsp;I create an account on a system) or federated (e.g.&nbsp;I use my Facebook account to sign on to systems). Decentralized identity removes the control from these centralized systems and gives it to the user to control their own identity data and how it’s used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Decentralized identity is built on a set of industry standards and technology implementations that allow identities to be secure and user-controlled, while still being interoperable with numerous services at the user’s discretion. This standardized approach maintains the flexibility that users have come to expect from today’s internet while creating a higher level of privacy protections that they require to be privacy protected in the current digital landscape. That has motivated Anonyome Labs to focus on empowering enterprises with decentralized identity tools and capabilities.&nbsp;(Read&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/decentralized-identity-key-concepts-explained/">Decentralized Identity: Key Concepts Explained</a>.)</p>



<p>Beyond Sudo Platform, Anonyome Labs supports the ongoing development of decentralized identity by:</p>



  helping to run three decentralized identity-focused blockchains  being an active contributor to the decentralized identity standards organizations  contributing source code back to the decentralized identity open source community.&nbsp;  



 <br>Decentralized identity is the future of privacy and identity management on the internet. In this article series, we’ll outline the opportunity. Next week we’ll look at the full-scale attack on privacy and how the Sudo digital identity can help users reclaim control over their personal information.<br>

<p><a href="https://www.id.me/">ID.me</a> is still attracting scrutiny from lawmakers worried about its contract with the IRS. In January, the tax agency had announced that biometric verification with <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/irs-makes-id-me-mandatory-people-accessing-online-accounts-011802/">ID.me would soon be mandatory</a> for everyone trying to access their accounts online, though it has since <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/irs-abandons-biometric-login-plan-020807/">walked back from that decision</a> in response to the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/us-senators-target-irs-with-proposed-facial-recognition-ban-030701/">backlash from Congress</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/privacy-activists-hope-irs-policy-shift-will-lead-facial-recognition-legislation-030806/">the general public</a>.</p>



  



<p>However, that does not appear to have been enough to placate federal legislators. The House of Representatives has now opened an investigation into ID.me’s activities, kicking off the probe with a 10-page letter to ID.me CEO Blake Hall. The letter comes courtesy of the House Oversight Committee and the House subcommittee for issues related to COVID-19.</p>



<p>In terms of content, the letter asks ID.me to submit records about its technology and all of its contracts with state and federal agencies to the Committee for review. The investigators specifically want to know how many people have completed ID.me’s face-based identity verification process, and how many were rejected while trying to access a government service. A high number of rejections would suggest that there are accuracy issues with ID.me’s facial recognition technology, and raise concerns about inclusion for the elderly and other people who do not have access to smartphones or computers with facial recognition cameras.</p>



<p>ID.me uses facial biometric <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/id-me-confirms-technology-partnerships-with-paravision-iproov-012708/">technology from Paravision and iProov</a>. The company’s solution matches a selfie to the image on a photo ID during the onboarding process.</p>



<p>The letter also asks ID.me to share details about its average wait time, and about its data retention policies. ID.me has previously stated that it has registered around 73 million users, and that it will delete any biometric data should a user make such a request. The IRS, meanwhile, had told lawmakers that it would ask ID.me to delete all selfies and selfie videos by March 11, though it is not yet clear if the agency has followed through on that promise.</p>



<p>ID.me currently has contracts with 30 states and 10 federal agencies. The states are primarily using the company’s technology to try to stop <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/id-me-offers-identity-services-help-unemployment-backlog-071306/">unemployment fraud during the pandemic</a>, while the IRS is using it for authentication when people want to log into an account. The IRS contract is worth $86 million, though the House Committee is asking whether or not the agency can terminate the agreement, and how much it would cost to do so.</p>



<p>As it stands, the IRS is <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/offering-non-biometric-option-irs-sticks-with-id-me-online-taxpayer-verification-7022201/">continuing to use ID.me</a>, while ID.me has <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/id-me-expands-non-biometric-identity-verification-services-020904/">expanded its non-biometric identity verification options</a> to ensure continuity of service. In that regard, ID.me allows people to schedule a video chat with a human agent in lieu of an automated biometric check. The same technology is used to resolve rejected cases, and ID.me now offers offline identity verification services at select in-person locations.</p>



<p>The House of Representatives is nevertheless worried about transparency and accountability with regard to the use of facial recognition. <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/lawmakers-reintroduce-bill-to-ban-federal-use-of-facial-recognition-706182/">Attempts to regulate the technology</a> at the federal level have not yet gained any traction, so the lawmakers are hoping that the investigation can create some oversight and lead to the development of more meaningful privacy protections.</p>



<p>“Without clear rules of the road, agencies will continue to turn to companies like&nbsp;ID.me, which heightens the risk that essential services will not be equitably provided to Americans, or will be outright denied, and that their biometric data won’t be properly safeguarded,” said New York Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, who chairs the House Oversight Committee.</p>

<p>FindBiometrics is gearing up for its second virtual summit of 2022. The <a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/20454161-8e78-4ae6-bc85-df7aa59a037b/summary?RefId=np">Travel &amp; Tourism Identity Summit</a> will kick off on May 18 at 11 a.m. EDT, and will feature a slew of industry experts who will be on hand to discuss the trends and technologies that are transforming the modern travel and hospitality experience.</p>



<p>Those conversations are increasingly vital now that the world is starting to reopen in the wake of COVID-19. People are once again traveling, and returning to stadiums, <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/gsma-to-use-clear-health-pass-to-screen-mwcla-attendees-810111/">convention centers</a>, and other large venues for sporting events, concerts, and everything in between.</p>



<p>Digital identity is helping to facilitate that return. The technology can automate many aspects of the customer experience, and make it easier to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clears-health-pass-support-safe-return-las-vegas-convention-centers-040502/">check someone’s vaccine credentials</a>. Meanwhile, biometric technologies like face and iris recognition give people a way to verify their identities in a safe and contactless fashion.</p>



<p>The FindBiometrics Travel &amp; Tourism Identity Summit will highlight some of the more specific applications of digital identity tech. For example, one panel will show how cruise lines are using digital identity to prevent identity theft in international waters, while another will explore the ways in which biometrics are <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/nist-report-suggests-facial-recognition-reliable-airport-screening-tool-072001/">streamlining passenger screening in air travel</a>. Digital identity can similarly help fans get from the parking lot to their seat <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/iifx-fancentric-conference-to-tackle-innovation-in-sports-and-entertainment-502093/">when they go to the game</a>.</p>



<p>In many cases, consumers can start their identity journey at home to speed up the screening process when they get to their destination. The integration of digital identity and mobile technologies is changing the way that the world does business, and organizations that don’t adapt will fall behind in an increasingly competitive international marketplace.</p>



<p>With that in mind, be sure to sign up for our Travel &amp; Tourism Identity Summit on May 18, 2022. Registration for the fully virtual event is free, and guests will be treated to multiple panels, interviews, keynote presentations, and interactive Q&amp;As, along with dedicated expo halls featuring demos of some of the latest biometric identity solutions.</p>

 On April 7th, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a letter to its supervised financial institutions asking them to disclose any current and future cryptoasset-related activities they intend to engage in.

<p>On April 7th, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a<a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/financial-institution-letters/2022/fil22016.html#letter"> letter</a> to its supervised financial institutions asking them to disclose any current and future cryptoasset-related activities they intend to engage in. The FDIC – being one of the more risk-averse regulators in the United States – outlines its concerns regarding the overall “safety and soundness risks, as well as financial stability and consumer protection” risks of cryptoasset products and service offerings from banks. This letter from the FDIC does not come as a surprise, especially when the FDIC’s new Acting Chair – Martin Gruenberg – named crypto as one of the agency’s top priorities for 2022.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Does your favourite app or website ask your consent or approval when they collect your&nbsp;data?</p><p>Let’s take the popular WhatsApp as an example. Do you know what data WhatsApp collects about you and where it stores it? When WhatsApp changed its data privacy policy in Jan 2021, it caused panic among users due to a lack of clarity on what those changes were.

The reason being, Signal doesn’t collect personal information like WhatsApp.</p><p>This sequence of incidents puts the spotlight on data&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>According to the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP), the world’s largest information privacy organization, “Data privacy is focused on the use and governance of personal data — things like putting policies in place to ensure that consumers’ personal information is being collected, shared, and used in appropriate ways.”</p><p>While this definition is a good starting point to understand what data privacy is, it doesn’t really cover the entire&nbsp;picture.</p><p>To help you get a good grasp of the data privacy concepts and what it means for you, we have put together some relevant articles that make for an interesting read.

On April Fools Day this year, Vitalik posted an article to his blog titled 'In Defense of Bitcoin Maximalism,' but instead of being a pure troll, the Ethereum Founder approached the piece with truth and crafted a salient &amp; compelling argument.</p> <p>By steel-manning maximalism, &nbsp;Vitalik lays out a very reasonable case for the merits intolerance and toxicity. Philosophical and contrarian episodes like these help us understand the industry better, encouraging empathy for all sides of the debate.</p> <p>We explore this in context of Ethereum maximalism as well, and Vitalik offers some sage advice to Bankless. This conversation is far more philosophy-based than tech-based, but as we've seen, Vitalik is as comfortable in this setting as he is discussing the latest EIPs or protocol upgrades.</p> <p>Also, Vitalik spills the tea on Twitter's new favorite drink—the VB.</p> <p>------ 📣 THE GRAPH | Graph Day in San Francisco | June 2-5 <a href="https://bankless.cc/GraphDay">https://bankless.cc/GraphDay</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://podcast.banklesshq.com/">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>------ BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:&nbsp;</p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALED ETHEREUM <a href="https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>❎ ACROSS | BRIDGE TO LAYER 2 <a href="https://bankless.cc/Across">https://bankless.cc/Across</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>🏦 ALTO IRA | TAX-FREE CRYPTO <a href="https://bankless.cc/AltoIRA">https://bankless.cc/AltoIRA</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>👻 AAVE V3 | LEND &amp; BORROW CRYPTO <a href="https://bankless.cc/aave">https://bankless.cc/aave</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>⚡️ LIDO | LIQUID ETH STAKING &nbsp;<a href="https://bankless.cc/lido">https://bankless.cc/lido</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>🔐 LEDGER | NANO S PLUS WALLET <a href="https://bankless.cc/Ledger">https://bankless.cc/Ledger&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>------ Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro 8:30 Green Tea and Twitter Hate 15:47 The April Fools Article 22:35 Crypto Grifters and Security 29:22 Taking Responsibility 37:19 Performative Weirdness 43:33 The Culture Stack 49:14 Value Tradeoffs 53:40 Lessons from BTC Maximalism 57:45 Why Maximalism is Good 1:02:30 Why Maximalism is Ridiculous 1:12:16 The Best of Both Worlds 1:16:10 Bored Weird Vitalik NFTs 1:23:05 Spotlights vs Insults 1:29:30 ETH Maximalism 1:39:41 Advice for Bankless 1:45:15 Composability &amp; Onboarding 1:53:00 The Middle Path</p> <p>------ Resources:</p> <p>Vitalik on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin">https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Vitalik's Blog Post: <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/04/01/maximalist.html">https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/04/01/maximalist.html</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Time Magazine: <a href="https://time.com/6158182/vitalik-buterin-ethereum-profile/">https://time.com/6158182/vitalik-buterin-ethereum-profile/</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Survive, Thrive Theory of the Political Spectrum: <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/04/a-thrivesurvive-theory-of-the-political-spectrum/"> https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/04/a-thrivesurvive-theory-of-the-political-spectrum/</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>Bored Weird Vitalik Club: <a href="https://weirdvitalik.com/">https://weirdvitalik.com/</a>&nbsp;</p> <p>----- Not financial or tax advice.

 The Underlying Logic of Building for Web3 with&nbsp;Ontology <p>Ontology and Dorahacks are hosting a <a href="https://dorahacks.io/grant/ontology/">virtual hackathon</a> as part of our Ontology EVM Fund initiative to support the development of Web3 dApps on the Ontology EVM. The virtual hackathon runs from 1st-30th April and supports Web3 innovation on Ontology, particularly in privacy and decentralized identity. We have made a $100K developer prize pool available.</p><p>To support interested developers, we ran an Ontology Grant Hackathon Workshop, where Li Jun and Humpty Calderon covered some of the key reasons for building on the Ontology public blockchain. Here, we summarise some of the most important points, and hope that they are useful guidelines as to why developing for Web3 makes sense with Ontology.</p><p>Since inception, Ontology has had a singular focus on building the decentralized infrastructure to support privacy applications. As such, the Ontology public blockchain is not only fast, accessible and secure, but it incorporates important protocols to optimize the development process for&nbsp;Web3.</p><p>Currently, public blockchains are mainly focused on digital asset management. However, Web3 is set to change this. Identity, personal data, credit scores, and all kinds of public information will need to be stored on public blockchains to make Web3 a reality. This is where Ontology is focused; Building the fundamental architecture to support Web3 dApps. As such, you can think of Ontology as a public blockchain with built in Web3 protocols for management of such things like decentralized identity, personal data and credit&nbsp;scores.</p><p>Ontology also supports multi-virtual machines (VM), which makes it the most VM supported blockchain. We offer the NeoVM, WasmVM, and now the Ontology EVM. This provides developers with a host of familiar tools with which to build, whether that’s more traditional programming environments, or more blockchain specific environments such as the building tools around Ethereum.</p><p>This multi-VM approach means that we support 4 types of smart contracts. These can be used individually, or you can easily build interactions between different VMs. This means you could build different parts of a dApp using different smart contracts, and they integrate across multiple-VMs to optimize&nbsp;results.</p><p>An important question to ask is, why build on the Ontology EVM? The answer, in part, is because of all the things we’ve already spoken about. It’s easy and efficient to launch existing projects on Ontology at the same time as Ethereum and other EVM supporting chains. If you’re an EVM based dApp developer, then you have access to all of the tools you are comfortable with. The Ontology EVM supports Ethereum addresses, provides a safe and secure bridge to move between formats, and supports the majority of Web3 JSON-RPC&nbsp;APIs.</p><p>Beyond this, it provides you with access to the fundamental tools and protocols that we have already built to provide the necessary Web3 infrastructure. This saves time and resources, as you don’t need to build your own protocols for every dApp you develop, we provide modular functionality.</p><p>The core products for this functionality are <a href="http://ont.id">ONT ID</a>, a multi-chain decentralized identity framework, bringing fundamental functionality for Web3, and <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a>, which provides ease of access to the Web3 environment and natively integrates ONT&nbsp;ID.</p><p>Finally, we bring an active and engaged community, spanning several languages and incorporating existing partnerships and <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/over-1-5-million-users-now-managing-their-digital-identity-using-ont-id-ontologys-decentralized-7f696a5af98d">over 1.5million</a> created ONT IDs. We look forward to you joining&nbsp;us.</p><p>If you are interested in taking part in the Ontology Grant Hackathon on Dorahacks, you can read a guide <a href="https://dorahacks.io/blog/guides/ontology-builders-guide/">here</a>, and apply for the grant <a href="https://dorahacks.io/grant/ontology/">here</a>.

<p>Impact of the Digital Markets Act (DMA) on eIDAS and digital identity in Europe.</p>



 The Digital Markets Act (DMA) is on the finish line. 



<p>On March 24th, 2022, <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/de/TXT/?qid=1608116887159&amp;uri=COM%3A2020%3A842%3AFIN">the European Parliament and Council reached an agreement on the final version of the Digital Markets Act (DMA)</a>. According to the European Commission, the DMA regulation is expected to be reviewed and enacted by October 2022. The important fact to note is the DMA would be completed in less than two years from the first draft in December 2020. This underscores how important this regulation is for the European Union and its member states.</p>



 What is the Digital Markets Act (DMA)? 



<p>The DMA aims to control dominant online platforms and ensure that they behave fairly. Together with the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/digital-service-act-dsa/">Digital Services Act (DSA)</a>, the DMA is one of the centerpieces of the European digital strategy. The objective of the DMA is to foster innovation, growth, fair competition, and facilitate the scaling up of smaller platforms, SMEs and start-ups. Furthermore, the DMA aims to rebalance and protect the European users, companies, and public authorities according to European values, which place citizens at the center.</p>



 What is the Digital Services Act (DSA)? 



<p>The Digital Services Act (DSA), in addition to the DMA, introduces a new set of rules to control intermediary services. These services include internet infrastructure, hosting services as well as online platforms. While the DMA is focused on regulating market dominance to ensure fair competition, the DSA is focused on the operational obligations, which focus on data handling, data privacy, filtering fake news, and illegal content. The DSA was developed in parallel to the DMA, and the final version is expected to be agreed to shortly.</p>



 Who are the gatekeepers? 



<p>The DMA establishes a set of narrowly defined objective criteria for qualifying a large online platform as a so-called “gatekeeper”.</p>



<p>The European Commission uses the following high-level criteria to define a gatekeeper company:</p>



  has a strong economic position, significant impact on the internal market and is active in multiple EU countries  has a strong intermediation position, meaning that it links a large user base to a large number of businesses  has (or is about to have) an entrenched and durable position in the market, meaning that it is stable over time  



<p>In practice, the DMA classifies companies with a market capitalization of at least 75 billion euros or a turnover in the European economic area of at least 7.5 billion euros is a gatekeeper. The platforms concerned further must have 45 million monthly users in the EU and 10,000 active business users per year. Given the high requirements, mostly the largest tech giants, such as Alphabet (Google), Meta (Facebook), Amazon, Apple, or the travel platform Booking.com, among others, fall under the scrutiny of the DMA. The high bars were chosen to not put any burden on the smaller platforms but target the characteristics of dominant tech giants that tip the market.</p>



 What makes the DMA different from existing antitrust laws? 



<p>What makes the DMA special compared to existing antitrust laws is its proactive approach. While existing antitrust laws have been designed to maintain healthy markets, their countermeasures came under criticism as being too slow and reactive to cope with monopolistic markets driven by certain digital tech giants, specifically the gatekeepers. The DMA is looking to change that by proactively approaching unfair competition and market practices to prevent such platform providers in the future.</p>



<p>Further, the DMA includes the right to carry out investigations and sanction non-compliant behavior. The sanctions introduce a new level of penalties, such as periodic penalty payments of up to 5% of the average daily turnover and fines of up to 10% of the company’s total worldwide annual turnover. In the event of a repeat offense, the European Commission can impose a fine of up to 20% of its total worldwide turnover. In the past, penalties often have been too low to hurt the tech giants, given their enormous size and billions in revenues. The new penalties are meant to make a relevant impact that enable the European Union to enforce their market regulations.</p>



 What are the implications for eIDAS and digital identity in Europe? 



<p>The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas/">eIDAS regulation</a> is one of the key pillars of digitalization of the European Union. Therefore, the DMA and DSA coming into force will also influence the realization of digital identity in Europe.<br>In practice, the DMA will further emphasize and enforce “interoperability,” a key theme of the eIDAS regulation including the proposal for a European digital identity framework (EUID). The DMA will function as a means to not only keep the gatekeepers in check, but also foster competition and innovation. This will allow smaller providers the ability to access and offer new ancillary services.</p>



<p>Such services now focus on the EUID and forthcoming e-Wallet proposal. After the success of mobile payment wallets, the tech giants, Apple and Google, are now expanding wallet’s functionality into the digital identity space. Apple recently introduced support for ISO 13018-5 mobile driver’s licenses in the USA, with the states Arizona and Georgia to first implement it and further states to follow. eIDAS and the DMA, on the other hand, go beyond collaborations with individual platform providers. The EUID Wallet initiative will support interactions with European Qualified Trust Service Providers (QTSPs), access to public administration, and enable the remote/local creation of Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES).</p>



<blockquote><p>“IDnow welcomes the objectives of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/digital-markets-act-dma/">Digital Markets Act (DMA)</a> as it will strengthen choice and offer better quality service through a competitive playing field not only for the European economy, but also the digital identity ecosystem. We believe that digital identity and the related personal information is highly sensitive and therefore needs to stay within control of the European community, both on the oversight and the operational level. Further, we believe that the DMA in hand with eIDAS will foster the digital identity market and support us with building European market leaders that will serve the European citizens in their best interest.”</p>Armin Bauer, CTO &amp; Founder IDnow</blockquote>



<p>While the exact implications of the DMA and DSA on eIDAS 2.0, the next version of eIDAS, are yet to be defined, both regulations will support the general objective of eIDAS to protect European users, their identities, and data sovereignty. Further, they will protect and strengthen the European trust service and digital identity ecosystem.</p>

 Covid-19 has highlighted the systemic vulnerabilities in the Swedish and planetary food systems, while creating the political economy for deep transformation. This paper seeks to outline the increasingly critical relationship between food and the healthy development of our minds and bodies, and therefore the future prosperity of our economies and societies. <p>Covid-19 is increasingly forcing us to recognise that food plays a central role in the human health defense systems <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213453020301890">[1]</a>. Yet our health treatment systems are trailing behind, with nutrition left out of governments’ key recommendations announced during the Covid-19 pandemic [image&nbsp;1].</p>Image 1: general recommendations by the public health authority during&nbsp;Covid-19<p>For society as a whole to become resilient and healthy, it appears crucial to recognise the effects of food’s regenerative potential and its capacity for systemic prevention of illness and the avoidance of societal harm. However, to enable this, government officials, food systems actors, health care workers, marketing offices, researchers and civil society need to actively start redesigning the systems and institutional infrastructures around our food systems and address deep societal lock-ins.</p><p>We recognise these are easy sentences to write and that a true transformation will require fundamental new models of change and innovations at the systemic level. Even if the evidence for the necessity of a shift is clear, what is needed to address its deep rooted challenges, currently preventing a shift to happen, is less&nbsp;clear.</p> Evidence for the relationship between food and the human mind and&nbsp;body <p>Evidence exists for the multiple ways in which food and health are interconnected.</p><p>Today there is evidence for the negative human and financial impact of health-depriving foods. For example, today’s obesity epidemic cost Sweden SEK70 billion every year <a href="https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/livsvillkor-levnadsvanor/fysisk-aktivitet-och-matvanor/overvikt-och-fetma/#:~:text=Baserat%20p%C3%A5%20att%20drygt%20en,f%C3%B6r%20individen%20och%20f%C3%B6r%20samh%C3%A4llet.">[2]</a>, type 2 diabetes cost SEK18 billion <a href="https://ihe.se/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IHE-Rapport_2015_1.pdf">[3]</a> and heart and lung diseases cost SEK60 billion<a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/e8gvzq1fwq00/412SVQCzTi6JmXv6rmY15y/336a3ff35c595fe9f9a816aaebeff06b/IHE_Rapport_2021.pdf">[4]</a> (these costs have significant overlap and can not be directly added together as one sum), compared to the total budget for health care, which 2020 was SEK102 billion <a href="https://www.regeringen.se/sveriges-regering/finansdepartementet/statens-budget/statens-budget-i-siffror/">[5]</a>.

Therefore, enabling the availability of healthy foods and the conscious consumption of it, across the whole spectrum of society, is a burden that can not be put on the individual alone.</p> Identifying the root causes to why change is not happening <p>With the availability of evidence and the crystallisation of damage, the open question is why we are not addressing these challenges. There is no single answer or magic bullet, rather there are multiple factors as to why this is not not yet happening at the scale and speed necessary. It is crucial to take a systems perspective in analysis of this challenge and consider the root causes of the symptoms made visible in society by the Covid-19 pandemic. These root causes impact both physical infrastructures and the metabolic flows of food systems e.g. the logistics of water, energy, nutrients, fertilizers, seeds, waste,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Interventions to address these root causes would need to sit across multiple layers such&nbsp;as:</p><p>Based on interviews conducted in the Rapid Transition Lab (including a doctor focused on functional medicine, a nurse at a cancer treatment clinic, a nutritionist and two health coaches) and additional desk-top research, there appears to be three critical challenges to consider:</p>  Pricing and accounting of food is struggling to consider its regenerative potential nor the negative externalities created through its production and consumption,  Food lobbying (e.g. around what can be called milk <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/8384/sweden-milk-war-oatly">[30]</a>), misleading marketing campaigns and labelling of food <a href="https://annfernholm.se/2022/01/07/hemmakvall-inleder-aret-med-vilseledande-reklam/">[31]</a> is making it hard for consumers to navigate the impact of the items displayed on the supermarket shelves and online stores’ interfaces,  Disconnect between the food and pharmaceutical industries. Food companies are trying to make money through the system challenged by what is described above and pharmaceutical companies by selling patented drugs. This is minimizing the funds available for research into diet’s role in medical treatment, prevention and regeneration.  <p>When looking closer at the food system’s incentive structures it becomes clear that ingredients triggering the brain to want more <a href="https://www.bokus.com/bok/9789113116389/halsosegrar-den-vetenskapliga-vagen-till-ett-friskare-liv/">[32]</a>, for example sugar, salt, saturated fats, or all three combined <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0117959">[33]</a>, becomes a desirable for anyone trying to make a quick profit from food. Unfortunately, these items tend to give no or minimal support to the five health defense systems, and over time, large consumption of such products can even harm them [<a href="https://2heal.se/om-oss/">34</a> interview]. Today this reality is not being reflected in the cost of the production nor the price for the consumers. It seems to be that the pricing and the accounting systems are not designed for people’s, nor the planet’s, regenerative health.</p><p>If consumes like to make better choices by themselves, the words, colours, and symbols on the wrapping of ingredients are often misleading <a href="https://foodpharmacyco.com/category/ann-fernholm-en/">[35]</a>; creating cascading effects at societal scale. What is more, people are bombarded with commercials about cheap prices on traditional and social media channels, putting the focus on price over quality [<a href="https://www.johannescullberg.com/">36</a> interview]. It appears, therefore, that the negative freedom enjoyed by food companies to use certain language and imagery when marketing food is actually diminishing people’s positive freedom to enjoy healthy lives and consequently creating increased liabilities for future generations <a href="https://obgyn.duke.edu/about/our-faculty/susan-kay-murphy-phd">[37]</a>.</p><p>The last structural challenge (mentioned in this blog) is the lack of high-quality and large-scale research into the relationship between diet, healing, prevention, and regeneration. Today, large clinical studies, necessary to change treatment recommendations <a href="https://www.kostfonden.se/varfor/#starkt_forksning">[38]</a>, are almost always sponsored or entirely paid for by pharmaceutical companies <a href="https://www.tidningencurie.se/nyheter/2016/03/02/trovardigheten-hotas-av-bestallda-studier/#:~:text=L%C3%A4kemedelsbranschen%20i%20Sverige%20satsar%20%C3%A5rligen,samarbete%20med%20akademi%20och%20sjukv%C3%A5rd.">[39]</a>. They have little reason to prove that for example, cranberries can be used in cancer treatment <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5039576/">[40]</a>, as they can not write a patent for cranberries. Therefore, there are very few large and high-quality clinical studies made to show foods’ regenerative role in society <a href="https://www.kostfonden.se/varfor/#starkt_forksning">[41]</a>. In Sweden, this means that governments and doctors have too little evidence to back up detailed recommendations about using food in prevention and treatment. Without the necessary investment into this area of research, the necessary change will be very difficult to accomplish.</p><p>To ensure resilience in society it is therefore critical to create the incentives for researchers, government officials, food systems actors, health care workers, marketing offices, and individuals to become a part of a new transitional system that enables food to play a regenerative role in building society’s capacity to&nbsp;heal.</p> Enabling the transformation <p>Multiple entangled interventions will be necessary to transform the current scenario, requiring the involvement of actors from across the food and health care systems, national, regional, and municipal governments, research institutions, and civil society. To start a conversation with these actor groups, four propositions, addressing the three main challenge areas (described above), have been made and outlined as ‘what if…’ statements below. We invite you to engage with them together with us, exploring why or why not these could help to drive the change necessary.</p> (1) Pricing not just the production but the externalities of&nbsp;foods <p>Increasingly food and our food systems have been optimized from a production costs and supply side optimisation perspective. This reality has supported the massive reduction in the cost of food and calories over the last 18 years <a href="https://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/foodpricesindex/en/">[42]</a>, while off loading increasingly significant societal costs. These liabilities include, as earlier described, the impacts of sugary, fatty and salty food items and the loss of nutrition dense foods on 1) sick leave costs, 2) life style driven health care costs and 3) opportunity costs; in terms of the cognitive capacity of society as whole. This is not including the food systems’ impact on the environment, such as GHG emissions <a href="https://essd.copernicus.org/preprints/essd-2021-389/">[43]</a>, biodiversity loss <a href="https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6wg2/pdf/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FinalDraft_Chapter05.pdf">[44]</a>and soil erosion <a href="https://report.ipcc.ch/ar6wg2/pdf/IPCC_AR6_WGII_FinalDraft_Chapter05.pdf">[45]</a> — to name a few. Today these outcomes are almost always ignored when food is being&nbsp;priced.</p><p>What if the societal and environmental costs generated throughout the supply chain of food had to be considered and paid into an autonomous self-balancing system, held by a public good trust, which simultaneously cross finances and balances different parts of the food economy that create societal value? The externalities that are generated throughout the food value chain would be considered at each level, from farmers to producers to distributors, to create a true value market inclusive of future societal liabilities and assets. The cost of negative externalities, and the value of positive externalities, would be standardised and decided collectively yet self determined by the actors involved when pricing their products — for example a farmer when selling their cabbage, a manufacturer when selling their cabbage&nbsp;crisps.</p><p>What if this balancing system even considered how different people are impacted by different foods?</p>Image 2: Pricing not just the production but the externalities of&nbsp;foods<p>Such a system would seek to shift the incentives in the current food system and encourage consumers to buy those foods that are benefiting their health defense systems and the&nbsp;planet.</p><p>As farmers and producers would need to evidence their self-set prices (through verifying externalities generated) they are incentivized to both continuously self-evaluate their practices and continuously improve them as means to reduce liability costs and increase competitiveness under the new market and price&nbsp;logics.</p><p>This systemic realignment of our food system and incentives to societal outcomes as opposed to capital optimisation is&nbsp;vital.</p><p>Some actors are already testing new logics to pricing food. Felix Climate Store <a href="https://webershandwick.eu/our-work/felix-the-climate-store/">[46]</a> is one example and in our interview with them, we understood that when they based their prices on a product’s CO2 emissions, items that usually never get left on the shelves became harder to sell, for example, their classic frozen meatballs.</p><p>In order to increase the complexity of the pricing beyond CO2 emissions and look at multiple outcomes at the same time (suggested by the what if… statement above) would require highly-complex information infrastructures. Companies would need to be able to combine different types of data (public, private, sometimes personal) in order to build real-time and context based pricing models. This might not be a 1st horizon scenario, however, with the technology at hand today, this could become possible over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Still there are multiple important questions to ask before moving forward with such an idea. For example, who decides what positive and negative outcomes are and for who? Considering the development of accuracy in measurement, how would the system tackle discrepancies in externalities estimated and measured e.g. would there be retrospective adjustments, if so who would hold the risk for that, would bespoke insurance products be needed? What would be required in terms of labelling, displaying and packaging of foods? What would be asked of the individual to navigate this system? What research would be needed to cover current knowledge gaps about how different food impacts people differently? recommendations? And the list could go&nbsp;on.</p> (2) Accounting for the re-generative potential of&nbsp;food <p>Many decisions in today’s economy are informed by the reports created by accountants. Still, the existing accounting systems are struggling, similar to the pricing models, to account for the spillover liabilities and assets created in the wider system. Instead accountants are concentrated on the economic costs and revenues of one specific entity, in order to put a number at the end of the balance sheet. This is creating a simplified picture of the complex value flows generated by the supply chain of food and the systemic discounting of externalities (this is not only an issue within the food system&nbsp;<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/a-smart-commons-528f4e53cec2">[47]</a>).</p><p>What if the accounting systems and accountability structures were able to account for the entangled values and liabilities created by food and include the many co-beneficiaries impacted? By combining new accounting practices and monitoring systems (making sense of the outcomes created) new lines could be added to the balance sheet. Maybe even items that do not directly impact the entity concerned? This would paint a different picture for companies to consider when making decisions.</p>Image 3: Accounting for the re-generative potential of&nbsp;food<p>Such a shift would create incentives to consider the entangled values and liabilities generated throughout the supply chain when choosing, for example, what crops to grow, as well as how to grow&nbsp;them.</p><p>The new sustainability reporting requirements <a href="https://www.icaew.com/insights/viewpoints-on-the-news/2021/nov-2021/new-sustainability-standards-board-targets-globally-comparable-reporting">[48]</a> are an important step in this direction, as companies are being asked to report their social and environmental impact. However, until these impacts are visible on the balance sheet, we may not see enough change as urgently necessary [49]. Visibility would influence a companies’ ability to raise capital, and the cost of that capital, it would also influence the insurance premiums needed. Equally, it would make it more transparent for customers how a certain company operates.</p><p>At the same time as this shift seems important, it can not be discussed without mentioning the risk of trying to put a number on social and environmental impacts. What sort of design decisions would be needed to be taken in order to calculate this, for example what impacts, over what time-span — and who would take these decisions? For example, how would the interests of non-human actors and future generations be taken into account, and what would happen in situations where a balancing between interests would be needed? What new capabilities, skills and professional training would be needed in order to develop this system? And, as this would also require highly-complex information infrastructures, when could this be made possible?</p> (3) Taxonomy for regenerative food <p>Today the marketing and labeling of food is often done through culturally associated claims, such as clean, all natural, real fruit, happy cows, independent family farmers, humane and environmentally responsible products, naturally sweet and the list could go on. The ambition is to create a cultural wrapper around food which overwhelms its actual nutritional value and associated regulatory requirements, to enable us to believe a product is good and healthy for us/or the planet, without the associative evidence or&nbsp;reality.</p><p>It is becoming clear that this cultural taxonomy of food has been massively exploited for the intentional or the unintentional misdirection of informed&nbsp;choices.</p><p>What if there was a new evidence-based-claims requirement for the taxonomy for regenerative food? Instead of only addressing the words regenerative and food, this could include a whole series of different words and sentences. Let us walk through an&nbsp;example.</p><p>Imagine a new food product is being placed into the market. The producer would in this case be required to make a self-declarative impact model of the product’s impact on different people, society and the environment. Based on this open model, they would be permitted (or not) to make a portfolio of self-declarative claims, such as this product will improve your immune system or the local soil quality. The portfolio of claims could then be structured as a sign that this is a regenerative food, if, for example, the model shows sustainable input, positive societal outcomes and low externality/positive externality process.</p><p>These claims would need to acknowledge the situational variance, i.e different foods have differential impacts on different people, at different times and different foods have different impacts on soils and ecosystems in different climates. This would mean that the portfolio of claims shifts depending on who the buyer is and when the purchase is being&nbsp;made</p><p>Similarly, what if products which are systemically degenerative would be required to label their regressive impacts similar to cigarettes?</p>Image 4: Taxonomy for regenerative food<p>Such a taxonomy would, beyond helping customers navigate different options, create the incentives for food actors to monitor the impact of their businesses. This would increase the awareness of externalities created in the system and potentially encourage improvements to be made. The evidence would need to consider the entire supply chain and could further inform new collaborations across the&nbsp;chain.</p><p>Äkta Vara is an existing customer owned organisation trying to address issues with food labeling and marketing using campaigns and their Ä-mark <a href="https://www.aktavara.org/">[50]</a>. They are making it more transparent what a product contains, or maybe rather what it does not contain. Another example is kliMAT, allowing customers to scan items and find out their climate footprint <a href="https://klimatappen.se/">[51]</a>. While both of these examples help the customer to navigate the shelves of a food store, neither creates a framework for how to name and market. Currently this is regulated by the EU-taxonomy <a href="https://www.livsmedelsverket.se/foretagande-regler-kontroll/regler-for-livsmedelsforetag/information-markning-och-pastaenden">[52]</a>, which is not able to address the complexity of impacts in the&nbsp;system.</p><p>While this “EU Taxonomy 2.0” for regenerative food could improve the current situation, it is important to note that the marketing of food is still likely to be miss-leading; mostly due to the difficulty of ensuring quality of evidence, and therefore verifying, claims. This is not necessarily due to intentional misleading of customers, but rather because a food item’s impact is dependant on the entire supply chain, which is entangled with many other systems. Any generalization, therefore, becomes hard to make, without an over simplification. This requires us to ask how to create the necessary information infrastructures to evidence claims uniformly and while allowing actors to make sense of their specific&nbsp;impacts?</p> (4) Invest in evidencing <p>Today there is a funding gap for research about food’s impact on the body <a href="https://www.kostfonden.se/varfor/#starkt_forksning">[53]</a>. As stated earlier in this article, the main root cause of this is the disconnect between the food and pharma industries and the lack of incentives to prove that food can be regenerative.</p><p>What if the self-balancing pricing system was used as a seed fund, matching public and private investment into research to evidence food’s impact on the body and mind? This research would be necessary to make the earlier suggested pricing, accounting and taxonomy models work and could encourage private and public bodies to raise their investments.</p>Image 5: Invest in evidencing<p>Once there is enough evidence to make the new models function, there would be clear incentives for private companies and public bodies to keep investing in this area of research (as it would help them prove what their impact on society and environment is).</p><p>The increased understanding of food’s impact on mind and body would not only enable the new incentive models, it would further help the health care system navigate how to use food in prevention and treatment. When a next pandemic arrives, governments may even know what diet to recommend populations to eat in order to help their health defence systems to stand up against the&nbsp;disease.</p><p>Kostfonden is a fund that is already trying to address the current funding issue. They are particularly targeting food’s role in treatment <a href="https://www.kostfonden.se/">[54]</a>. However, it is not enough and it will be important to better understand diets’ role in personalised prevention and regeneration (personalised food is a growing area within the food sector and will need to be explored by&nbsp;itself).</p><p>However, before the investments are pooled, the suggested funding model would need to carefully consider its governance structures. What is the decision-making architecture for deciding who, or what, gets funding? There are already issues with food lobbying in research related to food <a href="https://www.adlibris.com/se/bok/fejkmaten-9789127173583?affId=2939453&amp;utm_source=tradedoubler&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=annfernholm.se&amp;tduid=bccf80942c42f1cd13ce74f0a5b55ac9">[55]</a>, how can this be an opportunity to ensure that the research is done for public good? Equally, how can the fund ensure long-term sustainability for researchers while leaving space for the inherited uncertainty in the process? What would the Intellectual property requirements be for research to avoid recreating many of the ills and perverse incentives of our current food&nbsp;system?</p><p>Lastly, how can the insights and results generated from the research become radically legible for people across food and health care systems, different layers of governments as well as individuals? And who is responsible for these translations?</p><p>Combined, these four “what if…” statements, could, if realised with careful consideration, have transformative potential and ensure that food’s regenerative ability is seriously considered throughout its supply chains. However, these suggestions are not enough and it will be crucial to identify additional intervention points moving&nbsp;forward.</p>Image 6: Provocation ecosystem<p>Therefore, in the coming months, we will continue exploring the questions and ideas raised in this blog together with different stakeholders.

<p>The Colombian identity verification specialist <a href="https://www.truora.com/">Truora</a> is looking to expand after bringing in $15 million in a round of Series A funding. The company was founded in 2018, and started to ramp up its operations with $3.5 million in seed funding in 2019.</p>



  



<p>The company is now valued at $75 million following its Series A raise, which was led by <a href="https://www.aceltechnologies.com/">Acel</a> and <a href="https://www.propel.vc/">Propel</a>, the latter of which is the fintech investment division of <a href="https://www.bbva.com/en/">BBVA</a>. Kaszek and Y Combinator also participated in the round alongside several prominent angel investors.</p>



<p>Truora is planning to use the funds to raise its profile in Mexico, and to expand to new markets in the US and Europe. The company is currently active in nine countries, and has opened offices in Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Peru, and San Francisco, beyond its headquarters in Colombia.</p>



<p>In terms of technology, Truora is best known for its Truconnect solution, which debuted in 2021 and allows organizations to verify the identities of their customers through WhatsApp. The company noted that as much as 90 percent of the population uses WhatsApp in Latin America (roughly 550 million people), making it a convenient identity verification option for many consumers. The WhatsApp service can be deployed in less than a day through a no-code integration process.</p>



<p>Truora’s full portfolio includes chatbot, facial recognition, and document verification technology, in addition to background check services. The company is specifically hoping to target smaller businesses that do not have access to state-of-the art technology resources, to make sure that they have access to reliable onboarding and identity verification services despite their more limited infrastructure. Truora believes that its solutions are well-suited to the online retail and fintech sectors, since its technology can speed up the authentication process and boost customer retention rates.</p>



<p>On the personnel front, Truora is planning to use some of the money to increase its headcount. The company is placing a particular focus on women in tech, and is looking to add 50 female employees to its payroll in the next few years. Seventy percent of the company’s leadership team and 45 percent of its staff are women, and it wants to raise the latter figure to a full 50 percent.</p>



<p>Truora currently brings in $45 million in annual recurring revenue, though it indicated that that number is anticipated to quintuple within the next year. Much of that new revenue is expected to come from Mexico, which is now the company’s fastest-growing market .</p>



<p>BBVA has separately launched Veridas as a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bbva-das-nano-increase-investment-biometric-authentication-firm-veridas-111203/">joint venture with das-Nano</a> to develop biometric onboarding technology for the financial industry. Veridas recently set up a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/veridas-opens-new-offices-san-francisco-mexico-city-032905/">new office in Mexico City</a>, while BBVA Mexico has partnered with Visa to bring a fingerprint-powered <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bbva-mexico-reveals-fingerprint-scanning-visa-card-76202104/">biometric payment card</a> to the country.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.clearme.com/">CLEAR</a> continues to expand its CLEAR Plus airport screening program across the United States. The company is now offering its iris-based subscription service to travelers at Ontario International Airport (ONT) in California.</p>



  



<p>Ontario is the sixth California airport to receive the service, following a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clear-brings-effortless-security-screening-oakland-international-airport-041601/">CLEAR deployment in Oakland</a> in April of 2021. The tally is now at 41 airports nationally, with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clear-brings-iris-screening-system-palm-beach-airport-112201/">Florida’s Palm Beach International Airport</a> standing as one of the other recent additions to the list.</p>



<p>CLEAR Plus lanes will be open at both terminals of Ontario International. Those who are interested in taking advantage of the feature will need to sign up for a membership and register their iris biometrics. They will then be able to go to one of the expedited CLEAR lanes when they pass through airport security, where they will need to complete an iris recognition scan to confirm their identity. A CLEAR agent will then take them to the front of the line for the usual TSA physical security screening.</p>



<p>“Expanding our footprint to more airports in the Golden State has been an important priority as we continue working toward our vision for a world of frictionless experiences and journeys,” said CLEAR CEO Caryn Seidman-Becker. “Our launch at ONT reflects our commitment to our members, airports and communities across California, and we look forward to continued growth in the months and years ahead.”</p>



<p>According to CLEAR, the Ontario lanes will create 23 jobs and generate $2.2 million for the local economy. A CLEAR Plus subscription goes for $15 a month, though discounts are being offered to government officials, active military members, veterans, and those who are members with Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and American Express.&nbsp;<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clear-renews-biometric-screening-partnership-denver-airport-122105/">Denver</a>, <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clear-expands-biometric-screening-program-boston-airport-111002/">Boston</a>, and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/clears-contactless-biometric-screening-comes-nashville-airport-081808/">Nashville</a> are some of the other US airports that have already installed CLEAR Plus lanes for their customers.</p>

<p>Subaru has unveiled the latest iteration of its Outback SUV. The 2023 edition of the car made its debut at the New York International Auto Show, and comes with a slew of modern safety and infotainment features designed to improve the in-car experience.</p>



  



<p>Most notably, the Outback will once again feature Subaru’s EyeSight Driver Assist Technology, as well as its <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/facial-recognition-subaru-suv-safety-feature-903311/">DriverFocus Distraction Mitigation System</a>. EyeSight Driver Assist uses two cameras to monitor the exterior of the vehicle. The system can warn the driver about the presence of an object in a blind spot, and comes with Lane Change Assist, Lane Centering, and Emergency Steering features to help drivers maintain a consistent position while on the road. If the car is moving at less than 50 mph, the Pre-Collision Braking System can also hit the brakes to prevent a crash if a biker or pedestrian crosses the road unexpectedly.</p>



<p>The DriverFocus system, on the other hand, turns its attention toward the driver. The system uses an infrared camera with facial recognition capabilities to watch for signs of drowsiness or distracted driving, and will send both audio and visual alerts to everyone in the vehicle. DriverFocus ensures that the person behind the wheel is keeping their eyes on the road.</p>



<p>The premium Outback Touring model comes with an additional Wide-Angle Mono Camera that further expands the field of view for the EyeSight Driver Assist system. In the meantime, every model comes with an 11.6-inch in-car touchscreen display that serves as the hub for the infotainment system. The device is compatible with an optional Front View Monitor that lets drivers see blind spots in front of the vehicle, and can be used to stream audio or take phone calls thanks to its Bluetooth capabilities.</p>



<p>In terms of navigation, the new Outback comes with TomTom and SiriusXM Travel Link technologies that let drivers set a destination with a voice command. The car also marks the Subaru debut of what3words, an innovative navigation system that assigns a unique three-word address to virtually every location on the planet.</p>



<p>DriverFocus made its debut in the <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/new-subaru-suv-recognizes-drivers-faces-908211/">2019 Subaru Forrester</a>, and was cited as a key factor when Parents magazine named it as one of the <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/biometric-tech-subaru-forester-acclaim-804043/">10 Best Family Cars of the year</a>. what3words, meanwhile, has already been <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/cerence-furthers-integration-what3words-navigation-system-072802/">integrated into Cerence’s in-car voice assistant platform</a>.</p>

<p>This is a very short Dev Pulse; I just want to cover the changes in this week’s Holochain release. (Note: there were no public 0.0.133 or 0.0.134 releases due to automation issues; these have been fixed (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1336">#1336</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1342">#1342</a>).)</p> Holochain 0.0.135: External links, HDK stabilisation <p>Breaking changes: HDK<br>Compatible HDK versions: 0.0.129</p> External links <p>Links have gotten some more changes (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1298">#1298</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1308">#1308</a>), bringing us closer to the Holochain Resource Locators <a href="https://www.holochain.org/roadmap/">milestone</a>. Now you can use headers as your link base or target, without having to re-type them to entry hashes (which worked but felt kinda hacky to me). But not only that — you can now use external hashes as well! Hashes now come in one extra flavour, <a href="https://docs.rs/holo_hash/0.0.23/holo_hash/hash_type/enum.AnyLinkable.html"><code>AnyLinkable</code></a>, and all link manipulation functions now expect a new type called <a href="https://docs.rs/holo_hash/0.0.23/holo_hash/type.AnyLinkableHash.html"><code>AnyLinkableHash</code></a>, which can be converted from an <a href="https://docs.rs/holo_hash/0.0.23/holo_hash/type.EntryHash.html">entry</a>, <a href="https://docs.rs/holo_hash/0.0.23/holo_hash/type.HeaderHash.html">header</a>, or <a href="https://docs.rs/holo_hash/0.0.23/holo_hash/type.ExternalHash.html">external</a> hash (note: the DNA hash is still not linkable, by design). That makes this a breaking change for the HDK. All you need to do for existing code, though, is put <code>.into()</code> at the end of an entry or agent hash value to convert it into <code>AnyLinkableHash</code>.</p><p>You can learn more about how Holochain uses and formats hashes by reading through the excellent <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.126/hdk/hash/index.html">HDK documentation update</a> from two weeks ago.</p> Integrity/coordination split begins <p>The other change is that we’ve started to split the HDK in two. You’ll recall two Dev Pulses ago that one of our upcoming <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-roadmap-online/#holochain-roadmap-is-now-live">milestones</a> is Stable Validation, which means that we are promising a stable core to the HDK so you can write stable hApps with stable DHTs. (See the pattern? Stability!)</p><p>This core, called Holochain Deterministic Integrity (HDI), is a subset of the current HDK’s functionality — only the types and host functions needed to define and validate data. In the future, zomes built with HDI will be the only zomes that contribute to the DNA’s hash, which will let you update business logic written with the less-stable full HDK without causing a network fork.</p><p>This release marks the beginning of the split. It moves all the features needed for deterministic integrity into two new crates — <code><a href="https://crates.io/crates/holochain_integrity_types/0.0.2">holochain_integrity_types</a></code> for the types and &nbsp;<code><a href="https://crates.io/crates/holochain_deterministic_integrity/0.0.2">holochain_deterministic_integrity</a></code> for the host functions (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1305">#1305</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1324">#1324</a>). (In the process, the HDK no longer depends on rusqlite!) At this point, you don’t need to do any code edits, as these crates get imported into the HDK for you. But your zomes will need to be recompiled in order to be compatible with this week’s Holochain release.</p><p>Next up will be a way of specifying whether a zome is an integrity or coordination zome in your DNA manifest (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1325">#1325</a>, likely to be in next week’s release). When this is introduced in a later release, you will likely need to split your code into integrity and coordination zomes. I promise I’ll write more about it when the changes solidify and make it into a release.</p> Various fixes and updates   The codebase is getting cleaned up with an eye to further stabilise the HDK. Types which require a membrane proof now require the <code>SerializedBytes</code> of the proof to be put into an <code>Arc</code>, so as to prevent the need to internally clone this potentially large amount of data. For instance, the <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.129/hdk/prelude/struct.AgentValidationPkg.html">AgentValidationPkg</a></code> type now refers to the <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.129/hdk/prelude/type.MembraneProof.html">MembraneProof</a></code> type, which is simply an alias for <code>Option&lt;SerializedBytes&gt;</code>. This change will require some minor refactoring if you’re using membrane proofs. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1311">#1311</a>)  Internal tests and compilation issues are being fixed (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1319">#1319</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1304">#1304</a>).  WASM error messages now contain their line numbers for better debuggability (holochain-wasmer <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain-wasmer/pull/81">#81</a>).  The admin API couldn’t install hApp bundles that were more than 16 MB in size; this is now fixed. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1322">#1322</a>)  Missing validation dependencies are now fetched asynchronously. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1268">#1268</a>)  <p>That’s all for this week! Expect big changes in the next few weeks — as mentioned, though, these changes are intended to ultimately lighten your code maintenance burden, making DHT forks a rare event.</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@basvde?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Bas van den Eijkhof</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/links?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

   One of the more tedious parts of a design system team’s job is auditing for component and token usage in live products. With products often in different states of implementing our design system, part of our job is to find inconsistencies, suggest the use of available components, or offer better uses for design&nbsp;tokens.

<p>One of the more tedious parts of a design system team’s job is auditing for component and token usage in live products. With products often in different states of implementing our design system, part of our job is to find inconsistencies, suggest the use of available components, or offer better uses for <a href="https://medium.com/@lukasoppermann/design-tokens-what-are-they-how-will-they-help-you-b73f80f602ab">design&nbsp;tokens</a>.</p><p>While working on <a href="https://github.com/onfido/castor">Castor</a> (Onfido’s in-house design system), we often ask ourselves: “Is that a Castor select component or a custom component that‘s been *styled* similar to a Castor select?”. We squint at various shades of dark-grey text to try and discern whether they are consistent. We try to recall if that media icon was part of our official icon set or&nbsp;not?</p><p>We have many tools and metrics to help us answer questions like: which products are using which components, what % of colors in a product are RGB or Hex values instead of using our design tokens (we call these values orphans)? We also use Figma’s analytics and asset management tools for the design side. The problem with these is they’re either high level or are non-visual. To get the information we need, we frequently have to open a web inspector on a page and hunt for clues (classes, values, CSS variables).</p><p>There must be a better&nbsp;way.</p> The power of&nbsp;systems <p>Luckily for us, one of the best things about well-built design systems is consistency. When digging in the web inspector, we would look for signs of usage by looking for common patterns in the&nbsp;code.</p><p>All the components in Castor have CSS classes which are all prefixed with ods- (which stands for Onfido Design&nbsp;System):</p> class="ods-button" <br>class="ods-select" <br>class="ods-tooltip" <p>Similarly, our color tokens are centrally managed in two layers, Theme aliases, and Base&nbsp;colors.</p> --ods-color-content-main: var(--ods-color-neutral-800), 1;  --ods-color-neutral-800: 59, 167, 32; <p>The rules to identify these things were relatively simple, so what if we could visualize these things based on those&nbsp;rules?</p> User style sheets to the&nbsp;rescue <p>User style sheets are local CSS styles that override existing styles on a page. You write them yourself and typically manage them with a browser extension. I chose <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-style-script/ecjfaoeopefafjpdgnfcjnhinpbldjij">Custom Style Script</a> due to its ability to toggle each style on or off using the icon in the “State” column. If you’re not very familiar with CSS/HTML, you may need to bring in a helpful front-end developer to help at this&nbsp;point.</p><p>(I wish I had some magic bits of code that you could just copy/paste, and off you go, but each system will be different, and the approaches here may not apply to&nbsp;yours.)</p> Visualizing components <p>First, we wanted to see if we could make any components with Castor class prefixes visually obvious. Thanks to some advanced CSS selectors, we can do something like&nbsp;this:</p> [class^='ods-'], [class*=' ods-'] {<br> outline: 3px dashed red !important;<br>} <p>This rule selects any element that starts with our ods- (Onfido design system) class prefix and puts a big outline you absolutely can not miss on&nbsp;them.</p><p>So this relatively consistent looking&nbsp;UI:</p><p>Becomes this:</p><p>We can now immediately see that the Creation date filter, the Search field, and the Sandbox toggle are not using our Castor components.</p><p>You can add or tweak any selectors as you wish to give you confidence that all your components are visible (we ran this on our <a href="https://castor.vercel.app/">Storybook instance</a> to&nbsp;check).</p> Design Tokens <p>Components are only one part of a design system. <a href="https://lukasoppermann.medium.com/design-tokens-what-are-they-how-will-they-help-you-b73f80f602ab">Design tokens</a> for us are equally important, so how do we visualize token use? We’ve focused on color tokens for now, and we want to visualize Theme colors and Base colors independently. To do this, we override the default palettes for these colors with colors well outside our brand&nbsp;palette.</p><p>Our theme tokens have content&nbsp;, border&nbsp;, and background variants, so we picked three shades of purple to indicate&nbsp;these.</p><p>Our base palettes have up to 11 shades of each color, which we can override with this new green shade. It doesn’t matter if there’s no differentiation between palette colors for our purposes.</p> Visualizing theme&nbsp;colors <p>Because our theme colors are defined in a single CSS file, we can copy the CSS rules directly from the web inspector panel.</p> :root {<br>    --ods-color-content-main: var(--ods-color-neutral-800), 1;<br>    ... <p>In a code editor (I used <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>) we replace the var() value with hard-coded RGB values of our purple shades. Darkest for content, middle for borders, lightest for backgrounds.</p> :root {<br>    --ods-color-content-main: 172, 9, 199, 1;<br>    ... <p>When we paste these rules into a new user style and refresh the page, we get&nbsp;this:</p><p>We can now easily see that while Castor’s Field Label components aren’t in use, all the Field Labels use semantic theme colors, which is excellent. However, our “Checks” heading and our search component are not. We can also see that the Creation date component partially uses theme colors, but not for the text content inside. These are all problems we can add to the team’s&nbsp;backlog.</p><p>While we strongly encourage theme colors, as they enable dynamic theme switching and are just semantically easy to use, they aren’t required. Designers and engineers are free to use base palette colors if they choose. So let’s visualize those and see what slips through the cracks before we write our&nbsp;tickets.</p> Visualizing base&nbsp;colors <p>Base colors are stored in a similar format, except that they just contain straight RGB values. We take our tone scale which ranges from -100 to -900 and simply replace the RGB values with the values of our green shades, from light to&nbsp;dark.</p> :root {<br>    --ods-color-neutral-900: 40, 160, 10;<br>    --ods-color-neutral-800: 59, 167, 32;<br>    --ods-color-neutral-700: 78, 174, 54;<br>    ... <p>Again, when we paste this into Custom Style Script (as a separate row), and refresh our page, we get&nbsp;this:</p><p>We can now see that we have pretty good base color coverage over the UI. However, the Search placeholder text and icon colors are not shades of green, so these are our orphan (RGB/Hex) colors.</p> Digital superpowers! <p>We now have a set of 3 style sheets that we can toggle on/off on any web-based product that uses Castor and get similar insights. You could probably do more here with user JS scripts or different combinations of CSS selectors.</p><p>I’d love to see what you all come up with to improve these techniques for your design&nbsp;systems.</p><p>The immediate work we would suggest for the team’s backlog is now a lot&nbsp;clearer:</p>  Update the search field to use the Castor search component  Update the sandbox toggle to the newly developed Castor component  Update the filter field labels to use Castor components (low priority, as they work OK and are using theme&nbsp;colors)  Update the checks heading color to content-main for consistency with the rest of the text on the&nbsp;page  <p>Remember that it’s definitely worth using the web inspector once you spot anomalies visually, as sometimes it can just be your CSS rules misbehaving.</p><p>That’s it; thanks so much for reading. You can find me over at <a href="https://twitter.com/subcide">@subcide</a> on Twitter or follow me on Medium for future articles.</p><p>HUGE thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/usethetics">Rogier Barendregt</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mopland">Mark Opland</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/disco_lu">Luis Ouriach</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rabelloo">Andre Rabello</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/marcobieglo">Marc Obieglo</a>, and <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/">Grammarly</a> for helping me improve this piece.&nbsp;👏</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech/evaluating-design-system-adoption-using-custom-css-a46026853308">Evaluating design system adoption using custom CSS</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/onfido-tech">Onfido Product and Tech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

Instead of developing this per service, organizations are well-advised to rely on standards and services provided via APIs. This also helps in reducing the complexity in implementing standards support, such as for OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC). Authlete provides a platform that supports simplified integration of OAuth and OIDC capabilities as well as Financial-grade API (FAPI) support into digital services, while shielding the complexity of the protocols by handling these in a backend service.

<p>This blog article is part of our blog series “Pushing fintech regulation forward”.</p>



<p>Fintechs have to respond to a rapidly changing environment. They need to adopt new technologies to offer innovative products and services while also staying compliant with evolving regulations.</p>



<p>For many years, regulation has developed to meet the operations of larger, traditional financial institutions. However, even if a fintech is smaller, it still needs to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/regulatory-risks-fintechs/">manage similar risks and protect against criminal or fraudulent behavior</a>. This is now reflected in fintechs being subject to the same regulatory oversight.</p>



<p>There have been calls for an overhaul of the fintech regulation market to better respond to this need to grow and innovate quickly while also keeping markets safe. </p>



<p>Whatever changes may happen in the future, complying with KYC and AML regulations will remain key. These regulations are well defined in most countries and have evolved to meet new criminal methods over the past decades. In Europe, this includes the AMLD (now in its sixth iteration) and eIDAS regulations.</p>



 Artificial Intelligence (AI) and KYC 



<p>Artificial Intelligence and machine learning techniques now form an important part of KYC and AML implementation. </p>



<p>AI offers improved accuracy and speed of customer onboarding. It can be used in many areas, including automated identity verification, biometric matching, and ongoing transaction monitoring. Read more: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/leveraging-ai-fintech-id-verification/">Leveraging AI as a fintech for ID verification</a></p>



<p>The acceptance of such technologies is rapidly increasing. The general AML regulations in most countries (such as AMLD in Europe) do not include technology specifics, but many regulators have confirmed the acceptability of AI and machine learning techniques. </p>



<p>The trend is set for this acceptance to expand, giving many fintechs the confidence to adopt such techniques.</p>



<p>AI and machine learning offer many benefits. Such techniques are lower cost than traditional manual processes and much faster. They are also safer, with more accurate predictions/matches and a lower chance of human error. </p>



<p>Accurate and near real-time verification also have advantages for customers. The overall user experience is improved – and, with it, customer conversion rates.</p>



 







 Challenges of AI and machine learning technology 



<p>As with any major change, or adoption of new technology, there are also challenges and difficulties with AI and machine learning. Staying aware of these is key to minimizing the impact. Working with a reliable technology provider will also help. </p>



<p>The first set of challenges relates to the use of AI techniques and machine learning algorithms in general.</p>



 Poor data quality or preparation 



<p>AI and machine learning algorithms rely on data for training. Access to historical or training data is needed, and results must be checked. Plus, both quality and quantity of data are needed too. This is more of a concern at the start of using a new system or algorithm, since data is limited. But over time, this situation improves as more data becomes available.</p>



 Avoiding AI bias 



<p>Training needs to be carefully managed and checked to avoid AI bias leading to poor results. AI bias refers to the situation where the AI is wrongly trained to reflect human biases. This could be due to human trainers or poor data. Facial recognition as part of KYC is one area that is particularly susceptible to this.</p>



<p>Such biases are not intentional, of course, and they can be hard to pick up. Methods to avoid bias include preparing truly representative data sets, considering outputs rationally, and reviewing AI results against real data.</p>



 Human involvement is still needed 



<p>AI can only do so much. Human involvement is needed in both the training phase and in real-time usage. During training, human input guides machine learning in identifying failures such as non-matches or fraud cases. These could be real failures or false positives, and algorithms need to learn from this. Also, remember that KYC and AML constantly evolve to meet new challenges and fraud methods. This means that ongoing updates and training for machine learning algorithms are common.</p>



<p>AI is largely automated when implemented, but human oversight is still needed. </p>



<p>To stay safe and compliant with regulations, adopters of AI need to realize when it does not work. In identity verification, this includes cases where the AI cannot be sure of an identity. Such cases must be identified and flagged for human review.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/id-verification-meeting-uae-regulations/">IDnow’s AutoIdent</a> handles this using specialist staff. Cases can be sent for video-based manual review, completed in real-time, and at minimal disturbance to the user. Read on: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/consumer-choice-identity-verification/">Consumer choice for Identity Verification</a></p>



 Managing additional risks introduced by AI and machine learning 



<p>Any new method or process introduces risks, which is undoubtedly the case with AI and machine learning in financial services. These could be in any area, and the unknown element is part of the challenge.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/market-studies/ms19-1-credit-information-market-study">UK FCA carried out a study of this in 2019</a>, involving close to 300 financial institutions. This identified several risk areas, but also highlighted that organizations were well aware of how to address them.</p>



<p>Rather than introducing entirely new risks, the FCA felt that machine learning instead re-enforced already existing risks. These can be managed through appropriate staff training and data validation frameworks.</p>



<p>The risk areas identified included:</p>



  Insufficient training of staff to use systems.  Risks introduced by the complexity of an AI system and challenges in validating and governance of systems.  Issues with data quality leading to inaccurate results.

 Challenges of integrating AI into fintech and KYC solutions 



<p>Integrating AI into the onboarding process is not necessarily straightforward. There are further challenges that are specific to KYC, verification, and onboarding that adopters of AI should be aware of.</p>



 Managing customer expectations and experience 



<p>People are used to human interaction. The switch to automation needs to be managed against different experiences and expectations in different markets. This is more likely to cause customer frustration in other AI applications, such as chatbots, but fintechs should still be aware of this possibility with AML and KYC.</p>



 Integrating KYC into the onboarding process 



<p>AI and machine learning algorithms may be invisible to the end-user, but their effect certainly is not. This includes detecting security features in identity documents and performing live biometric facial comparisons.</p>



<p>Done right, this should be seamless to the end customer. Errors or problems could lead to a lack of confidence in security. Failures or slow processes as part of onboarding could lead to customers abandoning sign up. These situations are clearly not good for brand, reputation, or for customer conversion rates. Problems here could worsen as AI becomes more widespread and customer expectations increase.</p>



 Staying up to date with regulations. 



<p>This is a major consideration for RegTech companies. KYC and AML regulations are well defined by FAFT and national regulators. However, these regulations are largely technology neutral. Fintech companies, just like banks, need to stay aware of this and be prepared to justify the technologies used.</p>



<p>More and more national regulators are permitting the use of AI techniques. Countries that allow <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/id-verification-autoident-meeting-eu-regulations/">full AI usage currently include the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Belgium, and Finland</a>. Other European countries permit video-based KYC. Germany has long been the most regulated market, and it has now accepted an element of automation combined with a manual review.</p>



<p>The acceptance of full AI is increasing and will eventually pave the way for much easier expansion for fintechs. Until it is fully accepted, though, fintechs will need to stay aware of differences and be able to adapt methods and offerings for different markets. The use of manual live video reviews is a major part of this for KYC, allowing hybrid verification to be used in place of full automation.</p>

Projects that do not win an [Earmarked Grant] are then considered for funding under the [General Grant] category.  Any remaining funds inside an Earmark, are then moved towards [General&nbsp;Grants]  [New &amp; Core Tech] teams are thus eligible to be funded from both [Grant Categories].  Returning teams are eligible to be funded from [General&nbsp;Grants].  50% or more “Yes” Votes receive a&nbsp;grant.  Any remaining funds inside the [General Grants] Category are moved back to the treasury.  <p>Working Groups</p><p>Head to the <a href="https://discord.gg/TnXjkR5">Ocean Discord</a> and dive into each Working Group.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Andrea Beskers</a></p><p>Web and the metaverse is a trendy topic, so it is even nicer to enjoy a more nuanced view of the subject. An optimistic but still realistic sneek peak of our digital future. Katryna Dow from Meeco will elaborate on the challenges of Web3 in her Keynote <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5138">The Omniverse SWOT</a> on Thursday, May 12, at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2022</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a preview of what to expect, we asked Katryna some questions about her presentation.</p>
<p> </p>
 What is the Omniverse and why the title? 
<p>To be honest, I was trying to avoid the word metaverse. And also because I think this new paradigm that we're moving into, it's not like we're going to leave the physical world or our surroundings behind and only move to the digital, I think what it is, we're starting to see the fusion of both. And so what I was trying to do is capture the idea of everyone's talking about the metaverse, but actually it is more than that. It's this connection between the physical and the digital.</p>
<p></p>
 Why do you think Web3 is going to be so different from where we are now? 
<p>Why was Web2 different from Web1? Why was the pre-Internet different from Internet? Why were fire and wheel different from, you know, fire and wheel? And I think what we're looking at is an evolutionary process. And if you're born into a web3 world or you're growing up in a web3 world, it's normal, right? But for those of us that are moving from one paradigm to another, we want to hold on to the things that we were used to, the things that worked, we're challenged by the new. And I think we're on the cusp of another evolution. And it will probably be in hindsight that we will say, okay, they were the major differences. But I think it'll be the new capabilities that we probably can't even imagine right now that over the next decade will just be mainstream.</p>
<p></p>
 You often talk about this fusing of the physical and digital, and you describe a more immersive world - what impact does that have on identity and security? 
<p>I think the immersive part is really what we've got to get our heads around. And I think if you want to understand who's doing this really well, is kids in the gaming worlds. You know, whether or not that's headsets or something in their ear or their whole sort of being in the game or playing with somebody that they, you know, may not ever know who they are in the physical world. And so what does that mean? Well, that means there are issues of trust that means there are issues of safety. That means there are issues of, you know, is this a person or a bot? Is this secure? But that generation right now that are growing up in this immersive world that is already every day in a virtual world, in a gaming world, in making connections where there is a sort of proxy for trust, there's lots of great things about that, breaks down many barriers. But as we know, coming from having been trying to build that trust from an enterprise point of view around privacy and security as the perimeter in enterprise has been expanding. Now, imagine wrapping that around your home and wrapping that around your wearables imagine wrapping that around yourself. And imagine technology from a medical point of view starts to move inside the body. So that perimeter is really hard to see. Where that perimeter even is in the future is becoming immersive. It's becoming blurred and with that blurring, we're going to have a whole range of new challenges from an identity point of view, a trust point of view, and really importantly, from a security point of view.</p>
<p></p>
 Is privacy still achievable in such a world? 
<p>Look, I want to think so, but I'm being pragmatic and realistic. I think as we move into this combination of physical and digital and even if that is done in a very respectful and trusted way, for us to have an open digital world, a digital economy, a trusted digital space, probably the ability to be completely separate and completely private is going to become more of a challenge. However, I am concerned that privacy may be something that will be only available to people with the means. They may be the financial means or the means to control. So I have hope, but I also see that it's going to be hard though. However, I think as these concerns around privacy are mounting, I think the opportunity to win the trust battle. So if we do lose ground on privacy, I think the opportunity to win ground in terms of trust and transparency and agency is probably going to be the biggest enablers of that. And then as a result of that, it may help to underpin what we want to achieve from a privacy rights point of view.</p>
<p></p>
 You mentioned the next wave of identity and security innovation - why would someone come to this session? 
<p>I think it's all of the things we've just talked about over the last 15 years. EIC has been the place where these challenges around identity, enterprise identity, the move to the cloud, the embracing of AI the move to distributed, blockchain. Each time we've had these evolutions, it's raised a whole range of new opportunities, threats, of weaknesses, and so we've worked through that over the last decade and a half, each time these new technologies have emerged. How do you apply them? And I think the reason I would hope people would enjoy this session and why is that we look to Web3, we look to the Omniverse, we look to this environment without perimeters. And what we have to build in is security and trust. And that is going to provide a whole range of new opportunities and some new threats, which means there'll be the chance to solve problems in new ways. And I hope this helps to spark that conversation.</p>

<p>For 44 million Americans, the weight of unyielding student loan debt is a major cause of <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/select/how-to-cope-with-stress-of-student-loans/">stress and anxiety</a>, a barrier to homeownership and can be a lifelong impediment to building wealth. Nationwide, the total student debt level stands at a staggering <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/17/student-debt-is-a-main-obstacle-for-millennials-wanting-to-buy-a-house.html">$1.7 trillion</a>. Managing that debt has proven to be complicated and inefficient for borrowers and lenders alike.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Access to consumer-permissioned student loan data presents a unique opportunity. Innovators can step in and create apps and build better services that leverage student loan data through Finicity’s open banking platform, to help consumers with student loan debt.</p>
 Introducing Normalized Student Loan Data 
<p>For fintech innovators, lenders, refinancers, employers and institutions of higher education, working with student loan data has been challenging. Until now, the data hasn’t been normalized. Higher learning institutions have used different naming conventions for data fields, making documentation harder to read, compare or translate. Lenders and servicers have to navigate a forest of screenshots, phone calls with lengthy hold times and unsecure paper documents in their efforts to verify loan information.</p>
<p>These time-consuming manual processes incur labor costs to lenders and servicers. This can cause stress, revenue loss, time loss and negatively impact the lender’s operational efficiency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finicity has normalized the data across data fields, vocabulary, naming conventions and applications of rules, resulting in a modernized ecosystem for all stakeholders through its open banking platform. This significantly reduces the time to market for your student loan solutions.</p>
 Innovation Platform Using Student Loan Data 
<p>Student loan data doesn’t have to be confusing or complicated. With Finicity open banking, an optimized API call can help reduce costs, and is delivered in a formation that doesn’t require additional coding. Our API endpoint can yield the complete loan details, and the full payment details of a student loan account, including up to 24 months of transaction history.</p>
<p></p>
 Data Coverage&nbsp; 
 
 Normalized, comprehensive data covering greater than 92% of student loan accounts. It’s delivered through our open banking platform, with connections to student loan accounts that include federal Direct Loans, FFEL &amp; Perkins, and some of the largest private lenders and servicers (e.g. Navient, Nelnet, Aidvantage, Sallie Mae, Discover, Firstmark, Commonbond, LendKey, etc). 
 
 Quality of Data 
 
 Extensive Loan Account Details:&nbsp; An API call to the Fincity open banking platform can yield a primary account, transactions by account, loan payment details, statements, account owner and much more. Data is aggregated at the three largest levels of the student loan hierarchy; student loan, student loan group and student loan account, while also being able to provide customer &amp; institution-level details. 
 Transaction lookback period has been extended to more accurately capture transaction additions or changes. Up to twenty-four months of transactions can be offered in one API call for an extended view of account history. 
 Complementary data insight solutions with analytics of a borrower’s credits, debits and balances to deliver smarter credit decisioning. 
 Reliable Uptime Data Monitoring: Multi-tier data integrity and student loan-specific data monitoring. 
 
 Create Winning Borrower Experiences 
<p>Innovators can quickly develop and scale new and improved financial services with Finicity’s open banking platform. Student loans are the second-largest debt sector in the United States. There is a massive opportunity to develop new apps and services to help individuals with student loan debt. Through partnering with our clients, Finicity’s open banking platform is powering solutions to help the 44 million Americans who carry student loan balances.&nbsp;</p>
 Some of the ways innovators can upgrade the borrower experience, using permissioned student loan data: 
 
 Create frictionless onboarding and account setup for borrowers to apply for loans, set up accounts, manage repayment and distribute funding to students. 
 Better data for better credit decisioning. It’s pretty simple. Student loan borrowers want a better experience. Lenders want the most accurate and real-time data for better credit decisioning. So we’ve combined the best data with smart insights to transform the lending experience. 
 Finicity data powers leading personal finance management (PFM) apps. These tools allow borrowers to view, monitor and manage their debt in near real time by pulling smart, categorized and permissioned loan data into the app. If borrowers can easily understand their financial position and repayment options, they may reduce stress and more effectively manage their debt.&nbsp; 
 Attracting and retaining the best talent in today’s job market is a challenge for any company. Leveraging permissioned student loan data, some employers are creating benefits like 401k accounts that match student loan payments and direct matching of student loan payments back to the student loan. 
 By using the account details endpoint, it’s possible to verify that a student is enrolled in at least half-time coursework by the National Student Loan Data System. Using this data, a rich field of possibility opens up for student-specific benefits. Discounts, rewards and loyalty programs can be built specifically for current students. 
 Even the more administrative aspects of student loans can be modernized by open banking technology. Student borrowers can be offered the ability to easily and securely apply for federal programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness or an Income-Driven Repayment plan. No wading through W2s, paystubs and long, frustrating calls to student loan servicers. Quick and secure. 
 
 Step Into the Future 
<p>Break out of the spider web of paper documents, screenshots, phone calls and mismatched data. Replace countless lost hours of productivity with optimized API calls that offer the comprehensive, relevant, normalized data to build solutions on.</p>
<p>Innovate with us to create knowledge-based services that empower students, so they can manage, consolidate, refinance and repay their obligations with the level of transparency that they deserve.&nbsp;</p>

   What is DevOps? 

<p>DevOps is one of those buzzwords. Ask three DevOps professionals what it means, and you might get four different answers. Most will agree that DevOps usually describes a mix of tools and techniques combining aspects of systems administration, software development, IT, release engineering, security, and often QA. At its best, DevOps synergizes the strengths of these fields to reduce toil through automation and improve software quality through continuous testing and deployment, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code">infrastructure as code</a>. At its worst, DevOps is used as an excuse to ask a single under-resourced team to do the work of several groups, in an ever-increasing spiral of tech debt. Most DevOps roles fall somewhere on the spectrum between these extremes.</p>

<p>While many tech professionals know Okta and its competitors as the way they access their corporate email and chat, there are actually four main areas where Okta’s product family interfaces with the DevOps skillset.</p>

 Accessing SaaS services and tooling 

<p>In 2022, it’s vanishingly rare for a tech company to host every software product that they use on-premises. Although there are open or <a href="https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted">self-hosted versions</a> of every major tool in the modern workflow, maintaining separate services gets prohibitively expensive. Instead of hosting physical servers, most organizations rent cloud resources. Instead of running email (<a href="https://list.org/">Mailman</a>), chat (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1459">IRC</a>, <a href="https://xmpp.org/about/technology-overview/">XMPP</a>), user account management (<a href="https://ldap.com/">LDAP</a>), and more in-house, companies instead rent services providing these features from specialist providers.</p>

<p>Before the pattern of using a central identity provider and protocols like OAuth became commonplace, users would have to manage a separate login and password to every software-as-a-service vendor that their company used. This created security and administrative headaches for everyone involved. But thanks to widespread adoption of the underlying protocols, a company can now use a single identity provider like Okta to allow everyone in the organization to access all of the software that it buys for them.</p>

<p>As well as the obvious workplace services like Slack and email, DevOps engineers might use their Okta accounts to sign in to cloud service providers like <a href="https://www.okta.com/aws/">AWS</a>, <a href="https://www.okta.com/%20partners/google/">GCP</a>, or <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/azure-portal-login/#overview">Azure</a>.</p>

<p>In a CI/CD pipeline, one might use Okta to log in to <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/jenkins/#overview">Jenkins</a>, <a href="https://docs.armory.io/armory-enterprise/armory-admin/auth-okta-configure/">Spinnaker</a>, or even <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/circleci/#overview">CircleCI</a>. If an organization uses <a href="https://saml-doc.okta.com/Provisioning_Docs/GitHub_Enterprise_Provisioning.html">GitHub Enterprise</a>, DevOps personnel can use Okta to sign in there too. Okta can even help ensure that the right people can update infrastructure code by managing access to <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/docker-hub/#overview">Docker Hub</a> or <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/terraform-cloud/#overview">Terraform Cloud</a>!</p>

 Automating Okta administration tasks 
<p>Just as sysadmins and IT managed identity for small to medium organizations in the olden days, DevOps engineers may be responsible for some administrative tasks in their company’s Okta instance.</p>

<p>Software and infrastructure administration and management tasks can be automated using a plethora of tools, including HashiCorp’s Terraform. Terraform allows users to describe the desired state of their resources, and then changes the resources to match that description.  Using <a href="https://github.com/okta/terraform-provider-okta">Okta’s Terraform provider</a>, users can manage their Okta resources and track their changes with version control. This is particularly useful for those whose business needs have them managing many different Okta accounts and trying to keep the settings consistent across all of them.</p>

 Managing server access 

<p>Modern code and infrastructure best practices recommend architecting systems to require minimal human access and intervention. But production-readiness is always a balancing act between aspirations and real-world limitations, and many successful codebases were architected before modern tooling made these hands-off design patterns feasible. Updating production code and infrastructure is often likened to repairing a jet engine while in flight: it has to keep working after every change that you make. When logging into servers is an important part of existing workflows, streamlining that process can be an essential step toward moving past the need to fix things by hand at all.</p>

<p>One way to improve the security and user experience of SSHing or RDPing to servers is to stop asking users to manage their own keys, and stop asking servers to keep track of who’s allowed to access them. In an organization whose identity provider already tracks which team members should have infrastructure access, <a href="https://www.okta.com/demo/okta-advanced-server-access/">Okta’s ASA</a> (formerly ScaleFT) provides a great way to reduce the value of SSH and RDP credentials by making them ephemeral.</p>

<p>Additionally, Okta is working on <a href="https://www.okta.com/press-room/press-releases/okta-introduces-new-okta-privileged-access-product-to-strengthen-security/">more new products</a> for privileged access management, which will be interesting in the DevOps use case.</p>

 Introspecting Okta 

<p>When DevOps refers to a catch-all role focused on the care and feeding of infrastructure, monitoring and alerting fall under its purview.</p>

<p>So far, we’ve talked about information flowing from Okta to your software and services, answering questions like “is this login request legitimate?” Automating Okta administration tasks with Terraform pushes configuration from the user to Okta. There’s one more direction that information can move relative to your identity provider, however: a stream of metadata about what the identity provider is doing can flow out of the provider and into your monitoring and alerting tools.</p>

<p>Okta supports a variety of <a href="https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/Exporting-Okta-Log-Data">integrations</a> for monitoring its various moving parts. For instance, integrations can be set up to exfiltrate Okta logs to <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/okta/">DataDog</a>, <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/splunk-add-on-for-okta/">Splunk</a>, or <a href="https://www.okta.com/integrations/sumologic/">SumoLogic</a>. These solutions can combine information about your Okta account with information from your other systems in ways limited only by your imagination: Would you like to get an alert when a user who has recently changed their password accesses a particular resource? How about if the total login failures involving a particular account, across Okta and your other systems, exceed a particular threshold? Would postmortems be easier if every user action logged by Okta showed up alongside the other data in your favorite monitoring tool?</p>

 In Conclusion 

<p>Although the field itself is ambiguously defined, DevOps tools and practices constantly interface with identity. DevOps done right ensures that the people can access the resources they should, and not the ones they shouldn’t. DevOps practitioners can use Okta to control identity-related behavior of their infrastructure through its many integrations, and can in turn customize and manage their Okta instances by using Terraform and Okta’s metrics and monitoring APIs.</p>

<p>If you work in DevOps, you can’t escape the responsibility of managing identity as it relates to your infrastructure. But you can choose how to manage it: Will your organization support you in delegating these tasks to specialists? Do you have a use case where it’s better to attempt to reinvent these wheels yourself?</p>

<p>A few weeks ago a developer named <a href="https://github.com/felri">Felipe</a> joined the <a href="https://discord.gg/GsSxDvq9wW">DEV.HC Discord</a>, where devs get together to mentor each other and build hApps. I was amazed when, in the course of just one week, he managed to put together a proof-of-concept for a peer-to-peer video chat hApp!</p><p>He’s calling it Doom (no, not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)">that</a> Doom, but ‘decentralised Zoom’), and you can check out the source code at the <a href="https://github.com/felri/doom">felri/doom GitHub repository</a>.</p><p>Doom mashes together two peer-to-peer technologies. Holochain handles the ‘signalling’, or the ‘making the connection’ part. If Doom were the phone system, signalling would involve me pulling a phone book off my wall, looking your number up, dialing your number, and letting the phone network connect my phone to yours. But while the phone network is largely centralised, Holochain is <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/its-aliiiiiive/#elemental-chat-on-holoports-passing-real-world-tests-with-flying-colours">almost</a> entirely P2P.</p><p>The other P2P component is called <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a>, and your computer already supports it — it’s built right into your browser. So once Holochain handles signalling and makes the introduction between my computer and yours, our web browsers take over and stream our video directly to each other.</p><blockquote>What really excited me is that he put this together in only four evenings’ worth of work!</blockquote><p>It is just a proof-of-concept, and will likely take more work to develop into a production-level product if Felipe chooses to do that. But this story opened my eyes to how quickly a developer can put together a fully P2P application with Holochain.</p><p>Here’s Felipe’s feedback on the development process:</p><blockquote>80% of the time was in the frontend, the holochain part was pretty easy with a bunch of examples you guys sent me<br><br>everything took 4 nights of work<br><br>yeah, holochain is absurdly easy to play</blockquote><p>And finally, here’s a demo video showing Felipe meeting with himself over a local network :)</p>

				  Valuable benefit packages offered for free to deliver training, technical, and business support to drive Node Operator success.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Sumiran Agarwal</p>
<p>The companies that run nodes on the <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-mainnet/">Indicio Network</a> are the tip of the spear in decentralized identity innovation: They support a decentralized network on five continents that delivers the performance and reliability needed for enterprise grade products and services. This is open-source collaboration at its best.</p>
<p>But what do the companies get for their service?</p>
<p>One view is that the end result is the reward. We all will, ultimately, benefit from the technology, so we should all contribute to advancing the technology. While most companies in the decentralized identity space are values driven, time and effort are required to host and maintain a copy of the ledger. Looking at doing this as a civic or purely altruistic gesture didn’t strike us as the right model for building a service that mission-critical transactions depend on.</p>
<p>Indicio’s mission is to advance decentralized identity technologies, and if we were going to create and inspire a community to do this through creating and running a decentralized identity network, we had to encourage and reward the work done by Node Operators with tangible, valuable benefits.</p>
<p>Thus began our Node Operator Benefit program 1.0, which began the learning exercise to determine what these benefits might be, and which was followed by 2.0, which advanced co-marketing activities and engagement with our node operators through better communication.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, as the Indicio Network has grown to 28 Node Operators, we’re announcing a substantial upgrade.</p>
<p>Node Operator Community Program 3.0 adds five benefit packages that each provide education, technical, and business development support to meet the needs of a growing business. Each Node Operator, after three months of hosting a node, can take one free package per year. The monetary value of each package ranges from $2,000 to $4,000.</p>
<p>Package 1: Introductory Training</p>
<p>Indicio has emerged as the leading provider of <a href="https://indicio.tech/training-workshops/">education and training</a> in decentralized identity technologies, with hands-on workshops to companies and to the wider community through the Hyperledger Foundation.</p>
<p>The Introductory Training Package provides two, 4-hour sessions on the basics of digital identity for groups of up to five people. It is an ideal option for companies, teams, and organizations that are only becoming familiar with decentralized identity, and want to understand the fundamental technologies powering it.</p>
<p>Package 2: Advanced Training</p>
<p>This package provides groups up to five people with two, 4-hour training sessions. The first covers the basics of digital identity and the second covers advanced decentralized identity technologies, such as Transaction Endorsement, DIDComm, DID:Indy methods.</p>
<p>Package 3: Architectural and Technical Exploration</p>
<p>This package is ideal for companies that need technical and/or architectural guidance to convert their business ideas into deliverable projects. Indicio’s senior staff will provide personal architectural and technical guidance based on the business needs of the Node Operator over two, 1-hour sessions supplemented with four hours of offline work by Indicio.</p>
<p>Package 4: Business Consulting&nbsp;</p>
<p>This package is ideal for companies who are just starting out in this space or have new ideas and need a sounding board with industry experts. It consists of quarterly&nbsp; one-hour business consulting sessions (four sessions per year) based on market deployments and trends. It will focus on navigating the complexities in building a successful use case and eventually a business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Package 5: Technical Support</p>
<p>This consists of ten hours of advanced technical guidance from Indicio’s senior staff. This is an ideal option for organizations that may require support as it works through a blocker or embarks on an update or the addition of an advanced feature.</p>
<p>Indicio has made advancing decentralized identity a core part of its Public Benefit Mission, and we believe that the way to do this is to nurture community success. We all benefit when our Node Operators succeed—and we will continue to identify and innovate ways to drive their, and our, collective success.</p>

 Computers that intuitively understand and respond to your body language? The idea is pretty out there but it’s not new. You might have heard it called ubiquitous or ambient computing. 



<p></p>



<p>This functionality means a device would read the user’s body language to pick up&nbsp;intent, and then respond accordingly, just as a human would with another human. Good&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90725730/google-is-designing-computers-that-respect-your-personal-space">examples</a>&nbsp;are your device automatically pausing the movie you’re watching when you leave the couch, or bringing up your emails for you as you come near. Spooky, right?&nbsp;</p>



<p>It might come as no surprise then that the company leading the charge in ubiquitous or ambient computing is the all-seeing, all-knowing Google. Who else?</p>



 Google is&nbsp;using the science of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/proxemics">proxemics</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;understand personal space and how humans respect and interact within in it, and advancing its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3046876/control-your-next-smartwatch-with-a-wave-of-your-hand?_ga=2.36264416.1779289167.1645818431-546908249.1637247784">Soli radar sensor</a>&nbsp;which we’ve seen in Nest Hub for sleep tracking, for example. The goal is to interact with our devices without touching them.&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>According to an article in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90725730/google-is-designing-computers-that-respect-your-personal-space">Fast Company</a>, “Soli sees your body as nothing more than a blob. But through the right lens, this blob has inertia, posture, and a gaze—all of the things we constantly size up when we interact with other people.”</p>



<p>Leonardo Giusti, Head of Design at Google’s Advanced Technology &amp; Projects (ATAP) Lab says,&nbsp;“As this technology gets more present in our life, it’s fair to ask tech to take a few more cues from us,” says Giusti. “The same way a partner would tell you to grab an umbrella on the way out [the door on a rainy day], a thermostat by the door could do the same thing.”</p>



<p>We find the idea of computers reading body language intriguing and have no doubt it will come to fruition. But we also find the idea that Google is designing computers that respect&nbsp;personal space&nbsp;highly amusing when we all know the tech giant doesn’t even respect&nbsp;personal data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As privacy commentator Techni-Calli&nbsp;(@Iwillleavenow)&nbsp;said on Twitter: “Google is designing computers that respect* your personal space”</p>



<p>*by completely invading your personal space, obliterating your privacy, and tracking your every move.</p>



<p>As the old saying goes, what will they think of next?</p>



<p>If the tech fascinates you, read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90725730/google-is-designing-computers-that-respect-your-personal-space">this</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3046876/control-your-next-smartwatch-with-a-wave-of-your-hand?_ga=2.36264416.1779289167.1645818431-546908249.1637247784">this</a>&nbsp;from Fast Company.</p>

<p>Web3Auth is excited to present a fruitful collaboration with StarkWare which coincides with the announcement of The Auth Network, a permissionless key management infrastructure that powers Web3Auth’s plug and play SDK that provides self-custodial social logins to dApps and&nbsp;wallets.</p><p>StarkNet, a STARK-powered L2 ZK-Rollup, enables applications to achieve unlimited scale for their computation, without compromising Ethereum’s composability and security.</p> Why are we&nbsp;excited? <blockquote>“Collaborating with StarkWare is a natural extension of our vision to quickly onboard the next billion into Web3. Any developer building on StarkNet can now easily onboard users into their wallet or dApp in the most intuitive way possible in just under a few&nbsp;seconds”</blockquote><blockquote>— Zhen, co-founder of&nbsp;Web3Auth</blockquote><blockquote>“We are excited to see another important piece of our ecosystem’s infrastructure being developed. Our collaboration with Web3Auth’s Key Management Infrastructure further strengthens our foundational infrastructure for StarkNet and StarkEx to onboard the next wave of users into&nbsp;crypto”</blockquote><blockquote>— Uri Kolodny, co-founder of StarkWare</blockquote> How Web3Auth helps builders on StartkNet and&nbsp;StarkEx? <p>Web3Auth is an open-source non-custodial Auth SDK that couples Passwordless Social Logins with non-custodial MPC key management. Developers can now integrate the SDK to any dApp/wallet on StarkNet and StarkEx with a few lines of code and provide a login experience that both mainstream users and crypto native users are already familiar with. Users can log in to dApps through emails, linked OAuth via Google, Twitter, Discord, and Reddit, or with a wallet of their choice, be it such as Metamask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, or the many others, without worrying about cumbersome seed&nbsp;phrases.</p> What’s in it for&nbsp;users? <p>The SDK, powered by The Auth Network, uses MPC, TSS, and threshold cryptography to manage a user’s key securely. It enables users to split their keys into multiple factors. It then secures these factors with different access points available to users, such as their social login, device, and social&nbsp;network.</p><p>This immediately improves on the existing key management standard (i.e., “seed phrases”). The user moves away from the risk of losing the key because even losing a single factor won’t compromise the entire key and factors stay revocable.</p> Get started&nbsp;now   Head over to<a href="https://docs.web3auth.io/guides/openlogin-starkkey"> Web3Auth + StarkNet integration guide</a> for a detailed How-to tutorial.

<p>About the author: <a href="https://twitter.com/veeslavin">Vadim Slavin</a> is GlobaliD’s Director of the Credentials Platform. The Credentials Platform (CP) is a marketplace for verifiable credentials, which enables users of GlobaliD to discover, request, and share identity verification and other services offered by third-party issuers.</p><p>As many of you are already aware, regulators are working closely with industry participants to chart the future of digital identity. One venue to foster such interactions are sponsored tech springs designed to catalyze deep thinking and develop solutions for some of the industry’s toughest problems.</p><p>Last month, I was chosen to participate in the latest such tech sprint, sponsored by the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/fincen/">Department of the Treasury/Financial Crimes Enforcement Network</a> (FinCEN) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/fdic/">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation</a> (FDIC). Of the 200 people who applied, 60 were selected and placed in eight&nbsp;teams.</p><p>My team, ConfIDence Labs, included:</p>  Vadim Slavin,&nbsp;GlobaliD  Dakota Clum,&nbsp;Bonifii  Nancy Guglielmo, Bank Policy Institute  Elizabeth Cronan, GeoComply  Tracy Manning, LexisNexis Risk Solutions  Michael Engle,&nbsp;1Kosmos  Candler Eve, MidFirst&nbsp;Bank”   Measuring digital identity effectiveness <p>This tech sprint was not about offering the best approaches to digital identity. (I must have missed that one.) Instead, the focus was on measuring the effectiveness of digital identity proofing.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2022/pr22030.html">Fincen and the FDIC</a>, digital identity proofing is defined as “the process used to collect, validate, and verify information about a&nbsp;person.”</p><p>Here’s how they <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/fditech/techsprints/measuring-effectiveness.html">described the purpose of the&nbsp;sprint</a>:</p><blockquote>Digital identity proofing is a foundational element to enable digital financial services to function properly. This element is challenged by the proliferation of compromised personally identifiable information (PII), the increasing use of synthetic identities, and the presence of multiple, varied approaches to identity proofing. Simultaneously, technological developments are enabling dynamic identity evidence such as state mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) or other identity credentials that are frequently updatable and interoperable, as well as behavioral analytics.</blockquote><blockquote>After three weeks of brainstorming and meeting with FDIC and FinCEN, eight participating teams developed solutions addressing the problem statement:</blockquote><blockquote>“What is a scalable, cost-efficient, risk-based solution to measure the effectiveness of digital identity proofing to ensure that individuals who remotely (i.e., not in person) present themselves for financial activities are who they claim to&nbsp;be?”</blockquote><p>In short, the U.S. government wanted to know how to compare one solution, process, or program to another. For example, if we were to compare the sign-up process for Coinbase and Bank of America, we needed to determine which onboarding flow was “better.”</p> Our approach <p>Everyone on team ConfIDence Labs had unique views on the subject, naturally bringing learnings from their own company’s approaches. We decided that we needed an objective scoring criteria that reflected adherence to principles of identity assurance levels such as the ones <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63a.html">spelled out by NIST</a> and risk scoring tactics such as the one <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/identity-proofing-and-verification-of-an-individual">suggested by the UK government</a>.</p><p>Additionally, we wanted to bring to light other attributes of identity proofing that we felt were just as important — inclusion, compliance, adoptability, and, of course, security.</p><p>The end result was a worksheet — not unlike the one required for assessing SOC2 compliance — where each of the above 5 rubrics are scored independently and objectively.</p>An example of an assessment based on our proposed scoring&nbsp;rubrics<p>Of our proposed scoring rubrics, Assurance was the most fleshed out. We envisioned a scoring mechanism that would reward cross-referencing verifications of each attribute of a user’s profile. In other words, there is higher assurance in someone’s identity if multiple sources of evidence were used to verify the same information — such as a customer’s name, email, or government ID.</p><p>Taking all of this one step further, we pitched a sandbox environment where financial institutions could offer their identity proofing programs for objective evaluation using our scoring framework. Not only that, they would be able to mix and match different third-party verification service providers to get to a better score. You could imagine a future where multiple service providers compete based on their evaluation scores.</p>Our proposed sandbox environment<p>For our efforts, three awards were given across three categories — Creativity, Effectiveness / Impact, Market Readiness.</p><p>For the Creativity category, which Team ConfIDence Labs (my team) <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2022/pr22030.html">ultimately won</a>, the U.S. government provided the following requirements:</p>  How substantively new or different is the Tech Sprint Team’s approach from those currently considered in the marketplace?  To what degree does the approach introduce a potential paradigm shift in how financial institutions and regulators can measure the effectiveness of digital identity proofing?  Does the approach present an innovative way of encouraging small to midsize financial institutions to deploy or more effectively deploy digital identity proofing technologies?   Final thoughts <p>First, I’d like to thank all of my teammates. It was a pleasure learning from them and working together toward the common goal of improving digital identity&nbsp;systems.</p><p>As a team, we also applaud FinCEN and the FDIC for these continued engagement efforts with the industry. The purpose of this latest digital identity tech sprint was to get the conversation started, seed new ideas, and nudge us toward industry cooperation.</p><p>Mission accomplished, I’d&nbsp;say.</p><p>Martin Henning, FDIC’s Deputy Director Operational Risk, <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2022/pr22030.html">echoed these sentiments</a>:</p><blockquote>“We brought together a diverse collection of innovative and energetic minds to think deeply about how we can ensure bank customers are who they claim to be in our increasingly digital age. Helping financial institutions to stop identity fraud will help us to continue to have confidence in the safety and soundness of our banks and the integrity of the U.S. banking&nbsp;system.”</blockquote><blockquote>“We are grateful for the partnership of the FDIC and the participation of all the Tech Sprint teams. It is critical that financial institutions have reliable ways to identify their customers, particularly in our increasingly digital world,” said Him Das, the Acting Director of FinCEN. “Identity is a fundamental cornerstone of financial integrity, and identity proofing is precisely the type of complex issue that benefits from public–private collaborations like this Tech&nbsp;Sprint.”</blockquote><p>We look forward to the next&nbsp;one!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/how-my-team-won-fincen-fdics-digital-identity-tech-sprint-3af744b818a5">How my team won FinCEN/FDIC’s Digital Identity Tech Sprint</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 We’re Live: Veriscope Launches on Mainnet with Binance, Bitfinex, Tether, Huobi, Moonpay, Deribit, Gate.io and&nbsp;more  Veriscope, our decentralized, open-sourced Travel Rule solution, goes live on the Shyft Network mainnet with a unique ability to solve the “Sunrise&nbsp;Issue”. <p>After many months of testing, we’re proud to announce today the launch of Veriscope on the Shyft Network&nbsp;Mainnet.</p><p>Veriscope, a fully decentralized, open-source tool that offers crypto exchanges a comprehensive solution to the so-called “Sunrise Issue” — addressing what has until now been a vexing, unsolvable challenge for crypto exchanges as they come into compliance with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Anti-money laundering (AML) Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>The “Sunrise Issue” arose in recent years as crypto exchanges across the globe began work to adopt the Travel Rule at different times, resulting in some exchanges coming into compliance with the requirement at different times than their counterparties. The Travel Rule requirements can only be met if all (both) counterparties are in compliance. Regulators have demanded a solution to the&nbsp;issue,</p><blockquote>“The ‘Sunrise Issue’ is a complex problem, and only Veriscope has been able to solve it,” said Malcolm Wright, Head of Veriscope. “Governments are deeply concerned about crypto’s use in illicit finance, and sanctions evasion in particular — as they should be — and with Veriscope, we are able to offer an efficient, elegant compliance solution for the entire industry.”</blockquote><p>The industry acclaimed feature comes as major exchanges and liquidity providers including Binance, Deribit, Nexo, Tether, Huobi, Moonpay, Gate.io, Bitfinex, Local Bitcoins, GSR, Galaxy Digital, Coinshares, Coinhako, BTSE Nogle, and more adopt Veriscope as their Travel Rule solution.</p><p>The FATF Travel Rule requires collection and exchange of customer details to adhere to international rules against money laundering, sanctions evasion and other malicious activities.</p><p>Veriscope enables Travel Rule compliance while protecting customer data through a peer-to-peer data connection that does not store any personally identifiable information (PII), uses encrypted communication, and is the only solution to provide for user consent for data sharing and storage to comply with GDPR regulations.</p><p><a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/8-reasons-to-choose-veriscope-cryptos-most-frictionless-secure-travel-rule-solution-d714b8056d08">Read: 8 Reasons to Choose Veriscope, Crypto’s Most Frictionless &amp; Secure Travel Rule&nbsp;Solution</a></p><p>The launch of Veriscope, and with it the solution to the “sunrise problem”, includes an all-star list of leading industry names concluding that Veriscope met their regulatory needs for Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><blockquote>“Veriscope is already scaling globally as more and more exchanges understand the comprehensive benefits of the tool,” said Joseph Weinberg, co-founder of Shyft Network and veteran of crypto security and regulatory solutions. “The tool takes a unique, decentralized approach to identifying counterparty exchanges solely from the crypto address. Because we don’t require any additional information from an exchange’s customers, we can rebuild Travel Rule data on historic transactions. The result is that our client is in full compliance with the Travel Rule, and the customer experience is absolutely seamless, with no interruption to transactions, but offering bulletproof assurances of privacy and security of customer&nbsp;data.”</blockquote><p>The entire Shyft Core and Veriscope team would like to thank all of our exchange partners and the global compliance community for supporting Veriscope’s journey to launch over the last year.

<p>InfoCert, la più grande Certification Authority in Europa, è tra le prime aziende private ad essere stata accredita come Service Provider CIE, confermandosi in prima linea nel processo di digitalizzazione del Paese.</p>



<p>Già protagonista in ambito SPID in qualità sia di Identity che di Service Provider privato, grazie all’accreditamento anche come Service Provider CIE, InfoCert offrirà ai propri clienti e partner commerciali un nuovo importante strumento per l’identificazione e l’autenticazione certificata.</p>



 Cos’è la Carta di Identità Elettronica e come funziona? 



<p>La&nbsp;Carta di Identità Elettronica&nbsp;(CIE) è l’evoluzione della carta di identità in versione cartacea ma, a differenza di quest’ultima, consente anche l’accesso ai&nbsp;servizi online delle Pubbliche Amministrazioni&nbsp;abilitate, così come già avviene con SPID.</p>



<p>La CIE può essere utilizzata per identificarsi sia da PC che da smartphone: nel primo caso occorre installare un software dedicato e avere un lettore compatibile, mentre nel secondo caso è sufficiente scaricare l’App “<a href="https://www.cartaidentita.interno.gov.it/cittadini/entra-con-cie/">CIE ID”</a>, disponibile sia per iOS che per Android.</p>



<p>Grazie alla CIE i cittadini hanno a disposizione uno strumento di identificazione fisica e digitale per accedere ai servizi in rete, pubblici e privati, in Italia e in Europa.</p>



<p>Infatti, con la realizzazione del&nbsp;<a href="https://www.agid.gov.it/it/piattaforme/nodo-eidas-italiano">nodo eIDAS italiano</a>&nbsp;si completa il progetto di&nbsp;cittadinanza digitale europea, che permette ai&nbsp;titolari di una CIE&nbsp;di accedere anche ai&nbsp;servizi online di altri Paesi dell’Unione Europea.</p>



<p>È infine importante sapere che per utilizzare la CIE come strumento di identificazione sui portali online, occorre essere in possesso dei codici PIN&nbsp;(la prima metà rilasciata al momento della richiesta e la seconda al momento della consegna del documento). </p>



 Quali benefici per clienti e Partner InfoCert? 



<p>Con l’accreditamento di InfoCert, gli oltre 27,5 milioni di cittadini in possesso di una CIE potranno ora beneficiare di nuovi potenziali casi d’uso. Potranno interagire potenzialmente con tutte le aziende private con cui dialogano quotidianamente quali banche, assicurazioni, operatori telefonici e altre grandi imprese; d’altro canto, le grandi imprese potranno sfruttare questa vantaggiosa opportunità per i propri clienti attraverso due modalità:</p>



  Identificazione: per tutti i casi d’uso in cui si vuole far sottoscrivere un contratto per l’acquisto di prodotti o servizi, l’azienda – grazie alla partnership con InfoCert – non dovrà effettuare alcuna procedura di accreditamento: è InfoCert infatti, in qualità di Service Provider CIE e al contempo Certification Authority, a servirsi dell’autenticazione CIE per l’identificazione degli utenti online e rilasciare loro un certificato di firma con cui sottoscrivere la richiesta di un prodotto o un servizio, come quelli sopra menzionati.  Autenticazione: laddove l’azienda volesse dotarsi della soluzione “Entra con CIE” per l’accesso ai propri servizi online, potrà affidarsi ad InfoCert come partner tecnologico, senza dover effettuare particolari investimenti nell’integrazione dei servizi di autenticazione.

 Compatibility: Towards a New World of Unified, Trusted&nbsp;Web3 <p>An explosive era of public blockchains is upon us, with EVMs and cross-chain communication gradually becoming the infrastructure to realize the potential of Web3. However, there remain challenges. How to best exploit the underlying support and technical strength to achieve compatibility, unity, and credibility in a Web3 age? How to effectively deal with the challenges of security and efficiency? These are familiar problems that both builders of blockchain infrastructure and Web3 developers continue to&nbsp;face.</p><p>On April 7th, Blocklike held the Blocklike Binance Panel round-table discussion with the theme of, “Compatibility: Towards a New World of Unified, Trusted Web3”, and invited Cabin VC, Ontology, Unifi, Rocki, and other institutions to discuss the path to implementation of a Web3 decentralized system. The event was viewed by nearly 20,000 people. Below are some excerpts from the highlights of the panelists' speeches during the round-table discussion.</p><p>1. We are in the era of the explosion of public chains. There is much competition in solutions about chain expansion, cross-chain and lower gas fees. Users have more choices for dApps which reflect the chain they belong to. EVM, as an important environment for developers, has deployed a large number of mainstream projects on it. So, what makes the public chains choose EVM? And what impact/influence does the EVM integration have on the projects?</p><p>LI JUN, founder of Ontology: The EVM is an important environment because Ethereum is one of the major platforms, with a lot of dApps and applications based on the EVM and the Solidity programming language. The EVM infrastructure can help developers. They can build a product only once, and it can be used everywhere, deployed everywhere. You can think of public blockchains as being stage 1, but stage 2 will see dApps as the major application. In the future, dApps will be built and deployed across all kinds of platforms. Today, EVM is an important smart contract, maybe in the future other kinds like WasmVM will become more important, but I think EVM-based infrastructure is important for all development teams.</p><p>JULIUN BRABON, Unifi CEO and Co-Founder: In our opinion, EVM acts like a bridge, connecting resources. It allows us to do a lot of things and build them uniformly on multiple chains. Through EVM, we can reduce development costs and improve efficiency, which attracts developers. Users often have many platforms, and we need to develop various tools and apply cutting-edge technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs, the focus of which is to create a decentralized identity. I think this is the start of the boom of the blockchain industry.</p><p>BJORN NICLAS, Rocki CEO &amp; Co-Founder: There are many copyright infringements on music and artwork platforms, which affects the development of the industry and reduces the income space of musicians. For us, this is an important issue for the music industry, we want to confirm the music copyright. By deploying and running EVM, we can facilitate the music distribution business. With NFT, copyright can be assigned to music creators, the identity of the musician can be verified, and users are more interested in purchasing NFT and the copyright behind&nbsp;it.</p><p>GLORIA WU, Chief Ecological Partner of Ontology: At present, many project teams are applying zero-knowledge technology for application development. It emphasizes a method of information disclosure and the inherent right to utilize structural certificates. Developers can build blocks through SDK. chain foundation. By strengthening community awareness, the blockchain infrastructure will be further utilized. In terms of regulation and privacy protection, in the Web3 world, we can use technical models to accurately verify user identities to help people protect their privacy, which requires building a unified decentralized identity&nbsp;system.</p><p>2. At present, the industry has not reached the stage of application explosion yet, but in the future, the application on-chain of Ethereum, a mature ecosystem, is bound to drive the booming of the overall blockchain industry. However, Ethereum isn’t perfect in user experience, especially with too much traffic and inefficient processing. What else needs to be done for the public chains to allow Web3 users to truly enjoy richer on-chain ecosystem services, in addition to EVM integration and interoperability? For the projects or platforms that need to make multi-chain deployment, how to unify the user experience across different platforms in&nbsp;effect?</p><p>LI JUN: Some people think you can develop scenarios and applications of various types on one platform, but it is impossible for all solutions to be built on the same underlying infrastructure, because different platforms support different scenarios. The ideal state of Web3 in the future is that the multi-chain architecture is built under the application layer, and users do not have to care whether the application uses blockchain technology or which blockchain is used, and the user experiences the product itself. I think the development team’s scenarios should depend on different blockchains, not just integrating EVM and building on the same application platform, it can have different versions and still interact.</p><p>HUMPTY CALDERON, Ontology Community Lead: Our focus is on the infrastructure of applications and how applications can be developed within these ecosystems. In addition, we also need to think about how to create a better user experience, attract more users, and provide them with an interconnected ecosystem.</p><p>GLORIA WU: In the future, Web3 will be built on a multi-chain basis. We can have a variety of solutions. Developers can create diverse applications on the platform. Users are not necessarily familiar with cryptocurrencies, but they can enjoy the value of blockchain.</p><p>BJORN NICLAS: For ordinary users of music platforms, user experience is very important. By establishing a unified authentication solution on the chain, users can easily upload music without complicated verification links.</p><p>JULIUN BRABON: Developers can build systems on multiple blockchains, develop adaptive solutions and public-facing APIs for users, and create a decentralized system. At present, people’s understanding of the on-chain solution system is insufficient, and there is still great development potential for the decentralized system in the future, which makes the user experience and operation easier.</p><p>3. In the future, what benefits will the development trend of trusted identity bring to users? Why do some people think that DID is the key technology for realizing Web3 native applications? How does it help the&nbsp;project?</p><p>LI JUN: I think the DID protocol is not only a function, but also a mechanism, especially in the case of network pressure, it will derive different mechanisms based on data identity and privacy management, and can also be used to measure users’ digital assets. credit, education, and almost all decentralized information. So, this use case is not just for wallets or some app plug-ins.</p><p>JULIUN BRABON: In the future, with the development of DID technology and trusted identities, users may no longer need wallets to interact. Anyone can interact without currency, and the data of this financial transaction technology is secure, irreplaceable, immutable, and of great&nbsp;value.</p><p>HUMPTY CALDERON: DID can bring new opportunities, it allows users to control their own identity and reputation. Users can interact with the various networks and ecological applications of the blockchain, and these interactions help users create unique identities. Each identity in the system is unique and can bring new opportunities. In addition, the DID use case also facilitates the active participation of user groups in community governance. Regarding the relationship between DID and NFT, in the on-chain ecosystem, the NFT platform authenticates market users to identify their authenticity in the real world. The platform can verify the user’s identity through DID, check the user’s experience and information in a certain period of time, and thus create a trusted purchase.</p><p>4. Recently, there have been many incidents of code loopholes, system security, and asset theft in cross-chain protocols. How do you view the security issues of cross-chain bridges? Will EVM integration, DID establishment, help solve security problems across the industry?</p><p>LI JUN: I think the key issue is cross-chain. At present, blockchain security problems emerge in an endless stream, including many cases of remote theft. Because the cross-chain bridge is in its infancy and the decentralization is not very good, this is a difficult task for most cross-chain bridges. Therefore, in the next step of technological upgrading, we will face more information processing in the public chain environment.</p><p>However, the industry already has sufficient coping mechanisms. For cross-chain bridges, we still need to collect more effective data to establish a decentralized response mechanism and secure processing process, which is the task of most cross-chain bridges. Another solution is that a centralized service model can be established. For some important organizations, building a strong security technology team is also an effective way. It can also ensure a certain degree of security by controlling cross-chain costs. In short, we should improve our risk response capabilities in different scenarios as soon as possible.</p><p>JULIUN BRABON: The role of cross-chain is often considered to be unreliable, but this is largely related to the application of technology and marketing practices in the industry, because for one network to be interconnected with another network, it must be cross-chain.</p><p>So, “trust” is one of the cross-chain topics, and many people don’t know it. In fact, this is the value of the application ecology of decentralized identity. Excellent smart contract deployment requires developers to try many times, and its value is reflected in the fact that it has not been attacked for many years after deployment, which is different from deploying 350 different smart contracts at one time. Therefore, safety is a very important value.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

Ontology announced a jointly held global online hackathon with DoraHacks on April 1, and provided an incentive of $100,000 for the competition and follow-up project support. At present, the hackathon is in the recruitment stage, and many developers around the world have actively signed up. In order to provide better development support and experience, Ontology recently held two workshops in <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1512067681083703296?s=20&amp;t=Qmq-IXis91ExpgNnTNv9Vw">English</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyCN/status/1512456457450848258?s=20&amp;t=Qmq-IXis91ExpgNnTNv9Vw">Chinese</a> to provide developers with clearer guidance on application development directions and deployment approaches.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Info security — “<a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/half-security-incidents-insiders?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Over Half of Data Security Incidents Caused by Insiders</a>”</p><p>“It found that insider threats caused 59% of incidents impacting sensitive data in the past 12 months. Insider threats are hard to detect because internal users have legitimate access to critical systems, making them invisible to traditional security solutions like firewalls and intrusion detection systems. The lack of visibility into insider threats is creating a significant risk to the security of organization’s data. An effective insider threat detection system needs to be diverse, combining several tools to not only monitor insider behavior, but also filter through the large number of alerts and eliminate false positives.”</p><p>The Ontology DID solution can not only help users to prove their identity, but also can effectively monitor accounts with limited permissions through decentralized technologies, such as distributed ledgers, public-private key pairing, etc. For example, if the account’s public key is handed over to the operator for community management, employees can and only manage community management. Once the employee leaves, the public key can also be replaced in time to ensure account security.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>As one of the founders of KuppingerCole Analysts, I’m also an EIC (European Identity &amp; Cloud Conference) veteran. Looking back to the start in 2007, a lot has changed since then, but the core of EIC is what it has been from the very beginning: A conference that provides both thought leadership and best practices from the field. A conference that brings together end users, vendors, analysts, and other experts, for close interaction and exchange. A conference that, I dare to say (and I’m proud of), is the most relevant gathering on identity topics globally.</p>
<p></p>
 Time to make a change 
<p>When counting the years and the number of editions, you will observe that there is a small mismatch. Without the pandemic, we would already run the 16th edition this year. 2020, we had to cancel due to the Covid restrictions. But we were back last year in September, and in 2022, we are back at our established date in the first half of May. <br><br>One news this year is our location. We are in Berlin, for the first time, after being in the center of Munich (in the “Deutsches Museum”) for the first three years, and then in Munich-Unterschleißheim for another 11 editions. Time to make a change. <br><br>While the 2007 event was fairly small compared to now, it was a great start. Many sponsors and already back then attendees from half of the DAX 30 organizations, amongst many others. The ones that attended the first EIC will remember that our caterer seemed to be overwhelmed by the number of participants. Food was a little short, which never happened to us again.</p>
<p></p>
 700 slides, trailblazers, and total disagreement 
<p>I still remember some interesting sessions from then. Dick Hardt impressed with a presentation with 700 slides. Dave Kearns already talked about the need for adaptive, risk-aware and context-aware authentication. And I needed a moment to contemplate again as Paul Heiden of Bhold responded to my question “Do you agree?” following my intro statement of the closing keynote bluntly with “No, I totally disagree”. The conversation in that closing keynote session, following that moment, was really enlightening. <br><br>Over all these years, I remember all the talks with attendees. Hundreds of great presentations. Many insightful panels. Excellent jokes by Mike Neuenschwander. Fantastic evening events. Winners of the European Identity Award beaming with pride. Being nervous, year by year, ahead of the opening keynote. Being pushed to new limits by my colleague, co-founder, and brain behind the EIC, Jörg Resch, when he came up with his topic suggestions for that opening keynote and I had to deliver.</p>
<p></p>
 Only one month to go 
<p>EIC to me is also the event every year where I learn most. Being a moderator and listening to many sessions, and spending every day from early morning to late evening in talking with attendees, I gain many insights that foster our research. I’m also proud that the foundation for OIDC (OpenID Connect) has been laid at EIC, when some of the industry experts sat together in the hotel lobby and started discussing what became OIDC. <br><br>With EIC 2022, the 15th edition, only being four weeks away, I’m in the process of preparing another opening keynote and some other talks. And I’m looking forward curiously to a new location and the first EIC in Berlin, slowly coming back to normal after two years of pandemic. I’m looking forward meeting you in Berlin.</p>

<p>We are delighted to introduce web3name, a way to create a unique name to represent your digital identity. This name can be linked to your addresses on KILT and across the Polkadot ecosystem. You can also link your SocialKYC credentials such as your GitHub, Twitter, Discord, Twitch and email address to this identity, adding extra layers of verification. Get yours now for&nbsp;free!</p> Your digital identity for the Web3&nbsp;world <p><a href="https://www.kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a decentralized blockchain identity protocol. On KILT, digital identity is built around a decentralized identifier (DID) — a unique string of numbers and letters specific to you — and any credentials you choose to add to this identity. An identifier can also be given to a machine, service, IoT use case, or anything that needs an identity.</p><p>With web3name, you can now replace a DID string like&nbsp;this:</p><p>did:kilt:4s8kEBWV9nwU5znxmfR7DVA31DdBoqYGr49SAiAPzzigwJDm</p><p>with this:</p><p>w3n:ingo</p><p>web3name provides a personal and recognizable way to represent your digital identity, and is another step forward in making Web3 easier to use and more accessible to&nbsp;all.</p> Uniquely yours <p>Once you have your name, it’s yours forever and no one else can claim it (unless you later decide to give it up, returning it to the web3name universe.) There are no added costs or renewal&nbsp;fees.</p><p>This identity can be linked to your KILT address and any or all of your addresses across the Polkadot ecosystem, making it easier for others to reference you. In the future, this will be extended to chains beyond the Polkadot ecosystem, too.</p><p>Using <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-socialkyc-built-on-kilt-65a29a974d07">SocialKYC</a>, an attestation service built on KILT, users can also create credentials confirming ownership of their email address or accounts such as GitHub, Discord, or Twitter, and link them to their DID and web3name, adding an extra trust&nbsp;layer.</p> Collators and Validators <p>Although the web3name is anchored on the KILT blockchain, it can be easily linked to any number of addresses on any blockchain in the Polkadot ecosystem using the KILT Sporran wallet (or via any wallet supporting the polkadot.js extension api).</p><p>This is especially useful for collators and validators in the ecosystem, allowing them to link their web3name to any of their addresses they choose. web3name allows them to be easily recognized, which increases transparency and brand&nbsp;impact:</p><p>Collators and validators may also choose to link their <a href="https://socialkyc.io/">SocialKYC</a> credentials to a service endpoint such as a URL in GitHub or IPFS and make them public. This is a way to provide contact details and more information for nominators and delegators, increasing trust.</p> Enhancing Identity <p>web3name is designed to enhance identity. Therefore it is a supplement to an address rather than a replacement for it. Although web3name may be linked to an address, it is not recommended as a full replacement for an address&nbsp;since:</p>  Any user may decide to give up their web3name, which could then be adopted by another user with a different address,&nbsp;and  One name/identity could be linked to several addresses  <p>While you can only have one web3name per identity, you may create several identities with a different web3name for each, for example your work identity, your collator identity, your gaming identity, etc.</p> DIDsign <p>web3name also adds an extra layer of verification when using <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/announcing-didsign-a-new-application-built-on-kilt-e4896ffffb44">DIDsign</a>, an application built on KILT that provides a decentralized way for users to sign and verify files. Any type of digital file — PDFs, Word, audio, video, software — can be signed directly in your browser, downloaded, and sent by any method that supports zip&nbsp;files.</p><p>In addition to seeing that the file has not been tampered with, the recipient has the extra security of seeing your web3name and any credentials you choose to link with&nbsp;it.</p> Getting Started <p>Claim your name before it&nbsp;goes!</p><p>For the duration of this promotion, creating your on-chain DID and web3name is free. (Normally, it requires a deposit of around 2 KILT Coins and small transaction fees.)</p><p>In order to claim your name, you need a Sporran wallet and a KILT on-chain&nbsp;DID.</p><p>You can use this <a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/How-to-Set-Up-Sporran_22-Nov.pdf">guide to set up your&nbsp;Sporran</a>.</p><p>Then create your free on-chain DID following the instructions <a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/w3n_Promo_On-Chain-DID.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>Once you have your Sporran and on-chain DID, you’re ready to go. Just follow the steps&nbsp;below.</p> Claim your&nbsp;name   Open your Sporran extension  <p>2. Click “Create web3name”</p><p>3. Click and read the Terms. If you agree, check the box “Use web3name Promo and accept Terms”. This will create a signed package that is sent to the web3name promo server for payment and submission to the blockchain.</p><p>4. Click “Next&nbsp;Step”</p><p>5. Enter the name you wish to claim. This must have a minimum of three characters using lowercase letters a-z, numbers 0–9, hyphen ( — ) or underscore ( _ )&nbsp;symbols.</p><p>6. When you have chosen an available name, click “Next&nbsp;Step”</p><p>7. Enter your Sporran password and click “Sign”. This will start the process of anchoring your name on the KILT blockchain.</p><p>The next pop-up will confirm that the name has been&nbsp;created.</p><p>Congratulations, you now have your unique web3name!</p> Link your web3name to your KILT&nbsp;address <p>Once you have your web3name you may also link it via your on-chain DID to your addresses across the Polkadot ecosystem. In this way, people with your address will also be able to see your DID and your web3name and, vice versa, those with your web3name can see your public&nbsp;address.</p><p>Note, don’t link addresses that you don’t want connected to your name! If you want to keep an address private, don’t link&nbsp;it.</p><p>To connect your name to your address, follow the instructions on the <a href="https://web3name-promo.trusted-entity.io/">web3name Promo website</a> or follow the guide&nbsp;<a href="https://www.trusted-entity.io/assets/pdf/How_To_Guide_web3name_Promo.pdf">here</a>.</p> The web3name directory <p>The <a href="http://w3n.id/">web3name directory</a> is a service that provides an easy way to look up KILT DIDs and their associated web3names and credentials. It also allows you to see if your preferred name is still available — just enter it in the search bar. If there is no DID associated with it, it’s all yours to&nbsp;claim!</p><p>The web3name directory, along with the linking website, was built on KILT by B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH (BTE), a subsidiary of BOTLabs GmbH, the initial developer of KILT Protocol. The web3name directory was launched in order to make using web3name&nbsp;easier.</p><p>Users can be searched by DID or web3name&nbsp;by:</p><p>1. Entering the web3name in the search&nbsp;field</p><p>2. Entering the DID in the search&nbsp;field:</p><p>Both ways show the web3name, associated DID, and any credentials publicly linked to&nbsp;it.</p><p>The credentials can be read by clicking “Fetch”, as the data is stored in the service endpoint and not on the blockchain itself.</p> Creating a shareable link <p>To create a URL to make sharing your web3name easier, just enter your web3name or DID in the search bar and copy the URL it generates. This URL can then be shared and will lead directly to your digital identity via the <a href="http://w3n.id/">web3name directory</a> website.</p><p>That’s it!</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a decentralized blockchain identity protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous and verifiable credentials.

<p>Sam Kazemian is the founder of Frax, the fractional-algorithmic stablecoin protocol. After co-founding the decentralized Wikipedia startup Everipedia, Sam set out to pioneer the algorithmic stablecoin space. The FRAX stablecoin now has a market cap of over $2.6 billion, and the protocol’s FXS governance token is up 300% in the last year.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this episode, we explore the Stablecoin Wars, in which different protocols compete for liquidity and composability in DeFi. Sam brings a 1st-person perspective into the developments surrounding UST and the recently launched 4pool on Curve, which consists of stablecoins UST, FRAX, USDT, and USDC.</p> <p>A highlight of this conversation is Sam’s parable of an archetypal central bank, in which he cruises through a number of salient takes on money markets and macroeconomics. There is a lot to learn about this Cambrian explosion of financial technology, and Sam is a great teacher.

  <p>Microsoft’s Azure platform has as many high-tech products as anyone could ever want, including the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/static/">Azure Static Web Apps</a> service. As the name suggests, the platform hosts static web apps that don’t require a back end. Azure supports React, Angular, Vue, Gatsby, and many more, out of the box.</p>

<p>However, you may run into situations where you want some back-end support, such as when you need the backend to run one or two API calls. For this task, Azure offers the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/">Functions</a> platform as well. Functions is a serverless computing platform that supports .NET, Node.js, Python, etc. It takes care of setting up a server, builds logging and exception handling, and provides a high availability environment at a reasonable price.</p>

<p>This tutorial will show you how to create a React application and deploy it to Azure Static Web Apps. The application will be on the Azure free tier, so you will not be able to rely on the built-in authentication providers that connect Azure and Okta to handle the authentication. Therefore, you will use the <code>okta-react</code> package from Okta to secure your single page application (SPA) manually. Once the user authenticates, they’ll be able to upload an image and receive a badge from a serverless Azure function.</p>

<p>This serverless function will handle the work of accepting the input image from the SPA and using a template to create a personalized badge for the user. Since you will be using the free version of Azure Static Web Apps, you will have to deploy the function as a Managed Azure Function.</p>

<p>You will write your application in Visual Studio Code and use the Azure extensions for Functions and Static Web Apps.</p>

 Create your Okta application 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:4280/login/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and accept the default Logout Redirect URI of <code>http://localhost:4280/login</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:4280/login</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/react/create-okta-application/">Create a React App</a> for more information.</p>



 Create your React application 

<p>The next step is to build your React application as a static web app. Begin as you would with most React apps by running <code>npx create-react-app azure-static-app</code>. After a few moments, your application will be ready to run. Once this happens, delete the <code>.gitignore</code> file and the <code>.git</code> folder that <code>create-react-app</code> produced. At this time, there is no way to prevent the task from adding these, but they will conflict with the Azure git files you will add soon.</p>

<p>Start by adding the dependencies you will need. <code>cd azure-static-app</code> into your React directory and run the following commands.</p>

   <code>npm i @okta/okta-auth-js@6.2.0
npm i @okta/okta-react@6.4.3
npm i react-router-dom@5.3.0
npm i bootstrap@5.1.3
</code>   

<p>The <code>@okta/okta-react</code> library is the principal package you will use to log the user in. This package relies on <code>@okta/okta-auth-js</code> to work. <code>react-router-dom</code> will help secure your routes and provide a route for the <code>login/callback</code>. Finally, you will use Bootstrap to style the site.</p>

<p>Next, replace the contents of <code>App.js</code> with the following code.</p>

   <code>import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from "react-router-dom";
import AppWithRouterAccess from "./AppWithRouterAccess";
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";

const App = () =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;Router&gt;
      &lt;AppWithRouterAccess /&gt;
    &lt;/Router&gt;
  );
};

export default App;
</code>   

<p>The code you’ve added makes the following changes:</p>

 
   Imports Bootstrap to style the application 
   prepare the application to use the <code>AppWithRouterAccess</code> method that you’ll soon create 
   Wraps the <code>BrowserRouter</code> component from <code>react-router-dom</code> so you can access the <code>Routes</code> and <code>Route</code> objects in child components 
 

<p>Add the <code>AppWithRouterAccess.jsx</code> file to your <code>src</code> directory and add the following code to it.</p>

   <code>import "./App.css";

import { Route, useHistory } from "react-router-dom";
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from "@okta/okta-auth-js";
import { Security, LoginCallback } from "@okta/okta-react";

import Home from "./Home";

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: "/oauth2/default",
  clientId: "{yourOktaClientId}",
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + "/login/callback",
});

function AppWithRouterAccess() {
  const history = useHistory();

  const restoreOriginalUri = async (_oktaAuth, originalUri) =&gt; {
    history.replace(toRelativeUrl(originalUri || "/", window.location.origin));
  };

  return (
    &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}&gt;
      &lt;Route path="/" component={Home} /&gt;
      &lt;Route path="/login/callback" component={LoginCallback} /&gt;
    &lt;/Security&gt;
  );
}

export default AppWithRouterAccess;
</code>   

<p>This component creates the routes for your <code>Home</code> and <code>LoginCallback</code> components. It also initializes the <code>OktaAuth</code> object, which is passed into the <code>Security</code> component for the children to use. To do this, use the <code>clientId</code> and <code>issuer</code> that the Okta CLI returned when you created your Okta app and replace <code>{yourOktaClientId}</code> and <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code>. If you used a server other than your <code>default</code> authorization server, you will need to change the entire issuer, not just your domain.</p>

<p>Next, add <code>Home.jsx</code> to your <code>src</code> folder and add the following code.</p>

   <code>import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";
import { useState } from "react";

function Home() {
  const { oktaAuth, authState } = useOktaAuth();

  const [image, setImage] = useState();
  const [display, setDisplay] = useState();

  const acceptImage = (e) =&gt; {
    setImage(e.target.files[0]);
  };

  const login = async () =&gt; oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();
  const logout = async () =&gt; oktaAuth.signOut("/");

  const createBadge = async () =&gt; {
    var data = new FormData();
    data.append("file", image);

    // Ideally the Azure Function should call the `/userprofile` endpoint to get  
    // the user name instead of relying on the client to send it since the client
    // could manipulate the data
    data.append("firstLetter", authState.idToken.claims.name[0]);

    const resp = await fetch("api/CreateBadge", {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        "okta-authorization": "Bearer " + authState.accessToken.accessToken,
      },
      body: data,
    });

    const blob = await resp.blob();
    setDisplay(URL.createObjectURL(blob));
  };

  return (
    &lt;div className="App"&gt;
      &lt;main role="main" className="inner cover container"&gt;
        &lt;nav className="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light "&gt;

                  Logout
                &lt;/button&gt;
              )}

              {!authState?.isAuthenticated &amp;&amp; (
                &lt;button className="btn btn-outline-secondary" onClick={login}&gt;

</code>   

<p>This file contains the bulk of your logic. First, it provides Login/Logout functionality using the <code>useOktaAuth</code> hook. With this hook, you can determine the user’s authenticated state. If the user is not authenticated,  prompt them to do so; otherwise, you will allow them to use the badge creator.</p>

<p>The badge creator logic prompts users to upload a photo of themselves for the template. It then posts this to the nebulous <code>api/CreateBadge</code>. This route stands for the <code>CreateBadge</code> function that you will create later in this article. Azure will know how to find that route whether you’re running this application locally on Azure’s emulator or Azure’s infrastructure. It will even be able to route to the appropriate environment on Azure’s servers.</p>

<p>A note here: You might expect to send the <code>accessToken</code> in the <code>Authorization</code> header; however, Azure overwrites the <code>Authorization</code> header with its token by default. You can eliminate this step on the Azure standard pricing model by using the custom providers in the Static Web App and the Function. However, you will need to use this workaround on the free model.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, the client sends the username from the ID token. Ideally, the Azure Function should retrieve the username by making a call to the <code>/userprofile</code> endpoint. By having the Azure Function handle this, you can ensure you get the accurate username without relying on the client to send something potentially inaccurate.</p>

<p>One other note: Environment variables do not work at this time on Static Web Apps. If you attempt to use <code>process.env.{variable}</code> in your code and set it in the application settings, it will not work.</p>

<p>Finally, add <code>StaticWebApp.config.json</code> to your <code>azure-static-app</code> directory and add the code below.</p>

 <code>{
    "navigationFallback": {
      "rewrite": "/index.html"
    }
}
</code> 

<p>This configuration file is necessary for single page apps to handle routing on the client. Specifically, you will need this for the <code>login/callback</code> route.</p>

 Test your React application 

<p>At this point, you can ensure your React application is working and connected to Okta properly. In the root of your React application, add a new file called <code>.env</code> and add the following code to it.</p>

 <code>PORT=4280
</code> 

<p>The Azure emulator will run the application on 4280 by default, so we set up the Okta application to allow that port. However, React usually runs the application on port 3000. Using <code>.env</code> to set the port will enable us to override that behavior and run the app on 4280.<br>
Next, run the <code>npm run start</code> command in your React application’s directory. You should be able to see your home screen and log in to Okta, but you will not be able to use the image feature yet.</p>

 Write your Azure Serverless Function code 

<p>You’ll need that <code>api/CreateBadge</code> endpoint to land somewhere. Open the Azure extension in VS Code, and use the <code>Static Web Apps</code> section to click Create HTTP Function. Select <code>javascript</code> as the language and name the function <code>CreateBadge</code>. The extension will create a new folder called <code>api</code> and another folder called <code>CreateBadge</code> with your Function code.</p>

<p>First, run <code>cd ../api</code> to enter the <code>api</code> folder (assuming you’re still in <code>azure-static-app</code> folder). You can install your dependencies first.</p>

   <code>npm i @okta/jwt-verifier@2.3.0
npm i canvas@2.9.0
npm i parse-multipart-data@1.2.1
</code>   

<p><code>parse-multipart-data</code> will help parse the image from the request body. You will use <code>canvas</code> to modify the image. Finally, <code>@okta/jwt-verifier</code> will verify the token passed in the header to authenticate the user. As I mentioned before, but worth mentioning again, if you are using the standard pricing model, then the authentication can and should be handled in the Azure portal using a custom provider. However, you are stuck doing the work yourself on the free tier.</p>

<p>Open <code>api/CreateBadge/index.js</code> and replace the code there with the following.</p>

   <code>const { createCanvas, loadImage } = require("canvas");
const { rename } = require("fs");
const querystring = require("querystring");

const templateWH = [394, 225];
const profilePictureStart = [22, 48];
const profilePictureWH = [97, 121];
const letterStart = [250, 205];

const multipart = require("parse-multipart-data");

badgeTemplateUrl = "https://i.imgur.com/50dOBYK.png";

const OktaJwtVerifier = require("@okta/jwt-verifier");

const oktaJwtVerifier = new OktaJwtVerifier({
  issuer: "/oauth2/default",
});

const getAuthToken = (req) =&gt; {
  const header = req.headers["okta-authorization"];
  const tokenParts = header.split(" ");
  const token = tokenParts.length &gt; 0 ? tokenParts[1] : "";

  return token;
};

const drawImage = async (req) =&gt; {
  const bodyBuffer = Buffer.from(req.body);
  const boundary = multipart.getBoundary(req.headers["content-type"]);
  const parts = multipart.parse(bodyBuffer, boundary);

  const canvas = createCanvas(templateWH[0], templateWH[1]);
  const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

  // Ideally this Azure Function should call the `/userprofile` endpoint to get  
  // the user name instead of relying on the client to send it
  const firstLetter = parts.filter((r) =&gt; r.name === "firstLetter")[0].data.toString();

  const template = await loadImage(badgeTemplateUrl);
  ctx.drawImage(template, 0, 0, templateWH[0], templateWH[1]);

  ctx.font = "68px Calibri";
  ctx.fillStyle = "#fff";
  ctx.fillText(firstLetter, letterStart[0], letterStart[1]);

  const profileImage = await loadImage(parts[0].data);
  ctx.drawImage(profileImage, profilePictureStart[0], profilePictureStart[1], profilePictureWH[0], profilePictureWH[1]);

  return canvas;
};

module.exports = async function (context, req) {
  const accessToken = getAuthToken(req);
  const jwt = await oktaJwtVerifier.verifyAccessToken(accessToken, "api://default");

  const canvas = await drawImage(req);

  var stream = await canvas.pngStream();
  context.res.setHeader("Content-Type", "image/png");
  context.res.end(canvas.toBuffer("image/png"));
};
</code>   

<p>This file uses the <code>OktaJwtVerifier</code> to verify the token sent from the React front end. It does this by parsing the <code>okta-authorization</code> header. If the token is invalid, it will return a 403.</p>

<p>The other primary function of this code is to take the image uploaded by the user and modify a template image by adding the uploaded image to it. You will also pull the user’s name from the JWT and replace the name on the badge with the first letter of the user’s first name. If your name is “Okta Developers”, you’ll see “Agent O”. Assuming this was all a success, you would return the image to the SPA to display to the user.</p>

 Deploy your application to Azure Static Web Apps and Azure Functions 

<p>Click into the Azure VS Code extension again, and under the <code>Static Web Apps</code> section, click Create Static Web App…. Follow the prompts and add the following information. If you are new to Azure, you’ll first need to create a “Subscription”. Then answer the prompts as shown below:</p>

 
   Azure Subscription Name - “My Azure Subscription” 
   Azure Web App name - <code>azure-static-app</code> 
   GitHub repo - <code>azure-static-app</code> 
   Commit Message - <code>initial commit</code> 
   Region - Select the region closest to you 
   Framework - React 
   Root of your app - <code>azure-static-app</code> 
   Root of your api (if asked) - <code>api</code> 
   Build - leave this blank 
 

<p>Everything will need a few moments to build. This process creates a new git repo on your GitHub account, configures the CI/CD for Azure Static Web Apps using GitHub Actions, creates your Azure Static Web App, and deploys your function and SPA code. Once it’s complete, you should be able to navigate to your newly created site.</p>

 Edit your Okta application 

<p>You will need to configure your Okta application for your newly deployed application. You used your <code>localhost</code> settings when you first configured your app. Now you need to add your Azure settings as well.</p>

<p>Edit your application and under the Login section, add your Azure domain with the <code>/login/callback</code> endpoint to the Sign-in redirect URIs section. Next, add the domain’s home page to your Sign-out redirect URIs section.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, navigate to Security &gt; API and click Trusted Origins. Add your Azure domain to this list.</p>

<p></p>

 Run your application 

<p>Finally, navigate back to your Azure domain and log in using Okta. Select an image you want to use for your profile picture and click Upload. After a moment, your function should return your new badge.</p>

<p></p>

 Use the Azure emulator 

<p>If you’ve run into an error deploying and need to debug your project locally, you can use the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/local-development">Azure Static Web App emulator</a> to tie your full product together. You’ll need to install some npm packages to run both the web app and the API functions.</p>

<p>In the terminal, run the following commands to install the necessary packages:</p>

   <code>npm install -g @azure/static-web-apps-cli azure-functions-core-tools
npm install -g azure-functions-core-tools@3 --unsafe-perm true
</code>   

<p>Navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command to start the Static Web App emulator, run the web app in dev mode, and also run the API function:</p>

   <code>swa start http://localhost:4280 --app-location azure-static-app --run="npm start" --api-location ./api --func-args="--javascript"
</code>   

<p>It’s possible to run this app from the build directory, but you will lose the benefits of hot-reloading as you make changes.</p>

 Wrap up 

<p>In this tutorial, you learned how to create a React app and deploy it to Azure as a Static Web App. You also learned how to build a Function in Azure and call it from your Static Web App. Finally, you learned how to secure both the Function and the Static Web App using Okta.

 Growing the Community 

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/www.blockchaincommons.com/master/images/2022-Q1-community.png">
    
</a></p>

<p>The first goal of Blockchain Commons is to create a community: an actual commons. We saw notable advancement on that objective this quarter, a positive sign that the commons is truly gelling.</p>

<p>New Patrons. We want to offer a welcome to our newest sustaining patrons, <a href="https://www.crossbar-inc.com/">CrossBar</a> and <a href="https://www.proxy.com/">Proxy</a>. Each of them brings exciting new opportunities to the commons: CrossBar with silicon solutions and Proxy with a long-time focus on identity. Continued thanks also to our existing sustaining sponsors such as <a href="https://bitmark.com/">Bitmark</a>, <a href="https://github.com/blockchainbird/bird">Blockchainbird</a>, <a href="https://foundationdevices.com/">Foundation Devices</a>, and <a href="https://unchained.com/">Unchained Capital</a> and to our <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">other supporters on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>New Possibilities. The variety of expertises within the commons is creating synergy for all of our patrons and other participants, as Blockchain Commons is able to introduce members to each other and work with everyone to develop use cases and specifications that meet all of their needs. In particular, as a result of CrossBar joining our community we’ve been hosting dialogues about the future of secure silicon: what features it can support, and what other possibilities the future holds. We’ll be expanding on that in the near future with a virtual salon.</p>

<p>New Contributions. Q1 also saw an entirely independent software contribution. <a href="https://github.com/Sjlver">Jonas Wagner</a> created <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool.info">seedtool.info</a>, a version of our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/seedtool-cli">seedtool-cli</a> that is accessible <a href="http://seedtool.info/">via the web</a> and built using WebAssembly (as opposed to less secure JavaScript implementations). We appreciate the contribution and how it improves the accessibility of seed usage, but even more we appreciate Jonas’ interest in becoming part of our open-source community. (Thanks Jonas!) We look forward to more contributions of this sort.</p>

 Developing Specifications 

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/www.blockchaincommons.com/master/images/2022-Q1-vectors.png">
    
</a></p>

<p>By working with the commons community, we’re able to not just discover the needs of our members, but also develop specifications that both serve those needs and help our members to interoperate.</p>

<p>New Specifications. We have begun work on two new specifications. <code>crypto-msg</code> is a simple encoding of ciphertext that we’ve specced out in a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2022-001-secure-message.md">first draft</a>. We’ll be seeking CBOR registration via IANA for it once we’ve finalized. <code>crypto-envelope</code> is a more complex specification that can contain <code>crypto-msgs</code>, decryption methodologies, and more; it’s still being sketched out based on community needs.</p>

<p>Test Vectors. Of course creating specification is just the first step. We also create reference libraries and reference apps that demonstrate their use — and ultimately test vectors, so that our community can test their own code. Our <code>crypto-request</code>/<code>crypto-responses</code> communication specification is now mature enough that the community needs test vectors, so we created <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/Docs/crypto-request-test-vectors.md">more than a dozen</a>, allowing for easy testing of requests and responses.</p>

 Progressing on Reference Apps 

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/master/images/st-listing.jpeg">
    
</a></p>

<p>Reference apps are where specifications interface with the real-world, as we demonstrate their actual usage.</p>

<p>Gordian Seed Tool v1.4. Gordian Seed Tool, our iOS and MacOS seed vault, continues to be our prime reference app for demonstrating the <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles">Gordian Principles</a> and for exemplifying best practices of seed management. Our new <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSeedTool-iOS/releases/tag/releases%2Funiversal%2F1.4">v1.4</a> features usability and data display improvements, but its biggest advancements were in I/O.</p>

<p>Seed Tool can now write to MicroSD cards, supporting a safe and secure way of exporting seeds without going to a network. This release also supports the <code>ur:</code> scheme for the native camera app and for reading NFCs cards. Our open test-flight beta also includes proof of concept of writing URs to NFCs if you want to experiment. (Beware: this functionality might change!)</p>

<p>Altough you can compile Gordian Seed Tool from code, it’s also available through the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gordian-seed-tool/id1545088229">Apple App Store</a>.</p>

<p>Spotbit. <a href="https://spotbit.info/spotbit/">Spotbit</a>, our tor-gapped currency pricing lookup tool, was one of our biggest successes from our 2020 intern program, but we’ve long wanted to improve its stability to make it usable not just as a reference but also as a real service. Work on refactoring has just begun, courtesy of one of our former interns (which also demonstrates another of our goals: increasing the number of designers and developers in our industry).</p>

 Releasing Services 

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/www.blockchaincommons.com/master/images/2022-Q1-esplora.png">
    
</a></p>

<p>Though one of the largest goals of Blockchain Commons is working with developers to craft the open, interoperable, secure, and compassionate digital infrastructure of the future, we’ve also constructed a bit of that infrastructure ourself by providing public services.</p>

<p>Esplora. We now have our own copy of Esplora, the blockchain explorer, available at <a href="http://esplora.blockchaincommons.com/">esplora.blockchaincommons.com</a> or <a href="http://pf4awrbzt3ohrtukpq6xx6y73gxqlnon4zh35ik7ald3kwfb5iedogad.onion/">http://pf4awrbzt3ohrtukpq6xx6y73gxqlnon4zh35ik7ald3kwfb5iedogad.onion/ on Tor</a>. This is meant to be a stable, publicly accessible blockchain explorer, so that Blockstream’s <a href="https://blockstream.info/">original esplora</a> isn’t a single-point-of-failure for blockchain explorations of that sort. We’d love for more people to run their own Esplora services as well, to offer distributed sources of blockchain truth.</p>

 Advocating for Smart Custody 

<p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/master/Images/smartcustody-overview.jpg">
    
</a></p>

<p>One of Blockchain Commons’ first projects was advocating for the Smart Custody of digital assets by outlining best practices that could equally be adopted by individuals or incorporated by developers into their works. This quarter has seen some large advances in our smart custody work.</p>

<p>Smart Custody for Multisigs. When we designed our original <a href="https://bit.ly/SmartCustodyBookV101">Smart Custody scenario</a>, we were already thinking about multisigs, but the technology wasn’t yet accessible to anyone but the most sophisticated user. So, our original scenario focused on cold storage. Fortunately, three years later, multisig is much more easily available through a number of transaction coordinators, some of them self-sovereign, such as <a href="https://sparrowwallet.com/">Sparrow Wallet</a>. We’ve thus been thrilled to put together a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Scenario-Multisig.md">raw draft</a> of a complete scenario focused on using a multisig to protect your digital assets. It allows for control of digital assets that’s less prone to failure, less prone to compromise, and easier to use: everything that a SmartCustody scenario requires. The draft is still undergoing review, so this is just a preview. We expect to release it fully in the coming quarter.</p>

<p>Smart Custody Case Studies. We’ve also been thrilled to see an increasing number of hardware and software releases that embody Smart Custody best practices. To discuss them, we’ve begun producing case studies that talk about how each fulfills the Gordian Principles and battles against Smart Custody adversaries; in the process, we’re also coming to better understand the needs of our community members. Our initial case studies cover <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Study-Passport.md">the Foundation Devices Passport</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Study-Sparrow.md">Sparrow Wallet</a>. We also published discussions of how our own <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Case-Study-SeedTool.md">Gordian Seed Tool</a> acts as a reference for Gordian principles. We’ve got  one more case study in process for the Keystone Pro wallet. If you’d like us to consider other products, or even better if you want to draft a case study yourself, please contact us at <a href="mailto:team@blockchaincommons.com">team@blockchaincommons.com</a>.</p>

<p>Proof of Personhood Support. Smart Custody, and its adversaries, goes beyond just the ownership of cryptocurrency. We recently hosted a discussion with the proof-of-personhood community, who we’ve long worked with at <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web of Trust</a>, and came up with one new adversary, a <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustodyBook/blob/master/TODO.md#identity-adversaries">boundary breaker</a>, which can likely be applied to #SmartCustody proper. There are no easy answers to the problem of proving whether an entity is a real person, but we think the problem is solvable, and we look forward to working more with this community.</p>

 Looking Forward 

<p>Looking torward the future, there’s lots more on the horizon.</p>

<p>Rebooting the Web of Trust. We are thrilled to see the return of the <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/">Rebooting the Web Design Workshops</a> this Fall, after a break of three years due to the COVID pandemic! They’ve recently announced a <a href="https://www.weboftrust.info/next-event-page.html">save-the-date for September 26-30</a>, when the next workshop is planned for The Hague in Netherlands. RWOT was in many ways the foundation of Blockchain Commons, so we’re looking forward to returning this year to learn more about everyone’s current interests and needs.</p>

<p>Self-Sovereign Identity. Working with governments to support self-sovereign identity has long been a goal at Blockchain Commons, with much of our focus on Wyoming. However, the ideas are spreading far and wide. Recently we talked with the <a href="https://twitter.com/christophera/status/1510123736342491138?s=21&amp;t=tGStayJVFkXc-NkOEo6Esg">Buenos Aires Mayor’s office</a> about creating identities that benefit the people, not corporations. This is part of a real effort, as they’ve already produced a <a href="https://github.com/gcba/Identidad-digital/blob/main/Whitepaper%20Tango.md">white paper</a> on the topic, which is available <a href="https://github-com.translate.goog/gcba/Identidad-digital/blob/main/Whitepaper%20Tango.md?_x_tr_sl=es&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp#whitepaper-tango1">in translation</a>.</p>

<p>Ethereum &amp; NFTs. At this point we’ve written three different unpublished documents on creating Smart Custody for Ethereum, for NFTs, and for treasuries. We’re still deciding how to advance this work, as it’s a big job that would require serious support, but if any our patrons want to see our initial notes, please contact us.</p>

<p>2022 Interns. Blockchain Commons has announced its <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions/74">2022 intern program</a>, to run this summer from May 23, 2022 to August 15, 2022. We’ve also produced a list of <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions/76">potential projects</a> that includes many of our own ideas. If you’re interested in dedicating 40 hours of work this summer as an intern, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions/74">please apply</a>! The deadline is April 22nd. Even if you don’t want to become an intern, take a look at our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions/76">projects list</a>, as we’d be happy to work with independent open-source developers on anything there.</p>

<p>The Silicon Salon. This May we’ll be working with <a href="https://www.crossbar-inc.com/">CrossBar</a> to host The Silicon Salon, a 90-minute virtual discussion on the future of secure silicon. We’ll be talking about the possibility for support of <code>secp256k1</code> and other curves as well as what other features could be included in silicon designs, from hashes and key derivations to ideas about more advanced functionality. Watch <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockchainComns">@BlockchainComns</a> for our official announcement.</p>

<p>What’s Coming Up? We’ve got lots of big plans for things that we’d love to advance in the new year, but which will ultimately depend on the needs of the community (and our own resources).</p>

<p>Our future educational work includes expansion of our two biggest projects in that category. <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line">Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line</a> should be updated for <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/technical/bitcoin-taproot-explainer">Taproot and Schnorr</a>, and we’re looking even more forward with <a href="https://github.com/jonasnick/bips/blob/musig2/bip-musig2.mediawiki">MuSig</a> and both the benefits and challenges it’ll bring. We’d similarly like to bring our Smart Custody work to the next level, not just incorporating our last year’s work on <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Multisig.md">multisigs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/SSKR-Sharing.md">SSKR</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Timelocks.md">timelocks</a> (as well as our <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustody/blob/master/Docs/Scenario-Multisig.md">new scenario</a>), but also expanding Smart Custody to support Ethereum, Tezos, and other blockchains.</p>

<p>Beyond our educational work, we’ve also been considering the design of a Gordian Recovery reference app and need to finalize our work on new specifications such as <code>crypto-msg</code> and <code>crypto-envelope</code>. Of course, we expect the year to be further defined by the needs of the blockchain community! So, there’s plenty to look forward to!</p>

<p>As always, if you are interested in the work of Blockchain Commons and want to see it continue forward, the three best things you can do are <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">become a sponsor</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Airgapped-Wallet-Community/discussions">become a community member</a>, and offer your own contributions as Issues, PRs, or even entirely new projects.</p>

<p>Thank you for your support!</p>

   As companies shift to cloud-native applications, the complexity of a microservices framework can be daunting. When applications are built in a cloud-native stack, authorization is also infinitely more complex. Crucially, Open Policy Agent (OPA) decouples policy from code, enabling the release, analysis, and review of policies without impacting availability or performance.

<p>Creating and issuing verifiable credentials is fast becoming the norm for many SMEs and large organizations. Dock Certs was released for beta testing in early February 2022 as a no-code solution to creating and issuing verifiable credentials. Thanks to user feedback, we’ve created a better user interface and experience through continuous updates and upgrades. One of our most recent updates was the introduction of bulk issuance. </p><p>Bulk Issuance supports high customer volumes by bulk issuing verifiable credentials in batches of 100+. Simply import a CSV file and issue verifiable credentials within minutes, averaging 1 credential being issued every second. </p><p>Head to <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Dock Certs</a> and test out this feature. There’s even a sample CSV file you can use.</p><p>You’ll need a DID to create a verifiable credential. When creating a DID, there are a few key types to choose from. Key types are cryptographic keys that will be used to sign the credentials you create, the key type of sr25519 is the default choice.</p><p>Step 1</p><p>Head back to the dashboard and click ‘Create Verifiable Credentials’. This will lead to a screen where you can choose between issuing a basic credential or a university degree credential. On the right-hand side, you’ll be able to see a mock-up design of the credential you are issuing. After selecting the issuer, click continue where you’ll be prompted to import a CSV file.</p><p>Step 2</p><p>This CSV file requires 3 fields: the recipient's name, their unique identifier (like a DID or email address for example), and the date of issuance. Simply assign attributes to each field and finish importing.</p><p>Once all credential holders are listed, it’s time to define the terms of your credentials; opting for persistent credentials, allowing revoking of these credentials, and anchoring the credentials. </p><p>Persistent credentials can be accessed with a URL for the holder and verifier, its contents are encrypted and stored with Dock until you decide to delete them. This also allows credentials to be scanned with a QR code for verification. By opting to issue persistent credentials, a password is needed to store and retrieve the credentials. This password should be shared with the holder so that they can retrieve the contents. </p><p>Opting to revoke the credentials means you, the issuer, can revoke/un-revoke the credentials in the future. And finally, anchoring the credentials will publish a hash on the Dock blockchain which can be referenced in the future to verify when and who created it.</p><p>The design mock-up of the credentials remains embedded on the right side of your screen.</p><p>Step 3</p><p>After accessing the attributes match and the terms are defined, it’s time to issue your credentials. A pop-up will appear as your credentials are being issued and will notify you when the process is complete. </p><p>Now, issuers have the option to download the credentials that have just been issued. A file containing a PDF format and JSON file of each credential (just as the holders will receive) will be downloaded for issuers to store and reference. </p><p>On the Credentials page in Dock Certs, a full list of issued credentials are available to view. Under status, you’ll see an option to ‘View the credential’ of each holder, ‘revoke the credential’ (providing this option was selected earlier in the terms) and delete the metadata. </p><p>Trial the Dock Certs Bulk Issuance Feature</p><p>Issue verifiable credentials to 100+ recipients in minutes with the new bulk issuance feature on Dock Certs. Save time from manually creating and sending credentials the old-fashioned way and introduce verifiable credentials into your workflows. </p><p>With Dock Certs, anyone can take advantage of the many benefits of verifiable credentials without the need for coding or complex integrations. Sign up and make use of your 50 free transactions.</p>

 Announcing decentralization roadmap, AUTH token and inviting Guardians to join the incentivized testnet <p>For years, we have been eliminating seed phrases and replacing them with user-friendly wallets and authentication tools powered by multi-party computation (MPC) and threshold-key cryptography. Today, Web3Auth powers over 400 dapps and wallets, and secures more than 9 million users worldwide. It’s grown to become one of the most trusted authentication suites in Web3, and has become a favorite of developers seeking to onboard users in a familiar yet secure and non-custodial way.</p><p>In January, we rebranded our authentication SDK, formerly known as Torus, to Web3Auth. Today, we’re excited to share that we’re formally rebranding the Torus Network, the MPC infrastructure that powers Web3Auth, to The Auth Network. After today, the Torus brand will cease to exist; instead, our developer tooling and the network that powers it will live on under the Auth&nbsp;brand.</p><p>In addition to re-branding, we’ve been busy developing an ambitious new roadmap for the Auth Network. We’re excited to share that today, and more — the complete vision for the Auth Network, its near-term roadmap, and a new token that will power it all. Collectively, the contents below represent our current ambitions and the path we see to onboard a billion people into&nbsp;Web3.</p> Auth Network: The Future of Web3 Authentication <p>In crypto there is a saying that goes, ”Not your keys, not your crypto.’ This phrase, more than most, exemplifies the importance of self-custodial software, — However, as important as self-custodial software has become, it’s still far from mainstream. We have yet to hit the inflection point where self-custody applications are the default. This is both the problem and the opportunity we seek to address with Web3Auth.</p><p>The Auth Network today is a permissioned network that consists of 9 nodes run by some of the most trusted and credible companies and projects in crypto, including Binance, ENS, Etherscan, Zilliqa and <a href="https://docs.web3auth.io/overview/key-management">others</a>. However, in order to build an infrastructure worthy of the trust of developers and billions of users, we recognize that the Auth Network must be fully decentralized. And so, the first step in our plan is to transition the network from being permissioned to permissionless, which will allow anyone to participate as a Network Guardian.</p><p>In addition to improving network integrity and trustworthiness, decentralization will also help the network scale. Right now, the Auth Network scales to comfortably support around 200 million users. The next iteration will be built off Parity Substrate’s scaffolding, payment channels and various TSS/MPC schemes in preparation for the next wave of crypto users coming online — be that billions of&nbsp;users.</p><p>Decentralization also improves load times. Right now, depending on where you are in the world, it can take up to two seconds to authenticate and login to an application. That’s far too long. Decentralizing the network will enable us to improve geo-latency and hopefully reduce loading times into the milliseconds. Similarly, all of the network’s metadata is currently stored on a mixture of cached servers and IPFS. In the process of decentralizing, we plan to create a new incentivized data availability layer that will also help accelerate load&nbsp;times.</p><p>The Auth Network will only succeed if it’s the most decentralized and performant authentication network in the world. These values are baked deeply into our roadmap, and, as we begin our decentralization process, we invite the community to join us on this journey and comment on our&nbsp;plans.</p> The Decentralization Roadmap <p>Decentralization is a spectrum, but our path is clear. We have exciting milestones approaching, including testnets and feature upgrades that the Auth Network will enable. Below is our decentralization sequence, starting with the launch of the Guardian Program, which kicks off&nbsp;today.</p> The Auth&nbsp;Token <p>In the process of decentralizing the Auth Network we’ll be introducing a new token — the AUTH token — to help coordinate the MPC that enables keys to be stored in a distributed, self-custodial fashion and reconstructed on demand with a series of shards. The token will be used to coordinate Network Guardians, incentivize network participation and uptime, and secure the integrity of the&nbsp;keybase.</p><p>Much like the network itself, the tokenomics for AUTH token will be unique and be used to incentivize and distribute resources across the different stakeholders in the network. It will enable wallets, apps and their users to leverage on the security of the node providers as well as guarantee consensus of the&nbsp;network.</p><p>We will announce more details about the token and the economics of the Auth Network in a future post. In the meantime, we plan to expand our Guardian base set through a new membership program and incentivized testnet.</p> Join The Guardian&nbsp;Program <p>The Guardian Partner Program is an incentivized testnet program. It is most suitable for&nbsp;:</p><p>- Wallets and applications already using&nbsp;Web3Auth</p><p>- Affiliate or distribution partners who are keen on the Auth&nbsp;Network</p><p>- Large entities in the crypto ecosystem</p><p>Guardians are network participants who commit to running a full node in the Auth Network testnet and mainnet.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Nitish Deshpande</a></p><p>DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are no longer top of mind; however, today DDoS attacks are an even bigger threat than ever before.</p>
<p>The pandemic has accelerated digital transformation due to growth in digital services. The ever-increasing number of devices being exposed to the internet, the ever-growing dependency of organizations on these digital services as a virtual interface to customers, consumers, and citizens, the shift to remote work/work from home and the growth in importance of cryptocurrencies. All these factors have led to a continuous increase in the number and sophistication of cyber-attacks. According to <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-ddos-protection-2021-q3-and-q4-ddos-attack-trends/">Microsoft</a>’s report, one of the main threats to organizations in 2021 was the rise in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.</p>
<p>Unlike a DoS attack where a single source is used to target a system, a DDoS attack floods the organization’s servers with thousands of requests from multiple sources through botnets. These attacks are also used as a decoy for infiltrating with ransomware or phishing for corporate disruption. Moreover, it is not possible to defend against a DDoS attack by blocking a single identified attack source.&nbsp; While the attackers are overloading the victim’s systems with illegitimate requests using botnets, their system such as VPN, websites, VoIP services, etc. can at times fail to fulfill the legitimate requests. This impacts on the organization’s activities.</p>
 Factors responsible for rise in DDoS attacks 
<p>The recent rise in DDoS attacks can be explained by the following factors:</p>
 
 Online services dependency: Organizations are undergoing digital transformation and since the pandemic there has been a shift towards working from home. This has created a higher risk of the remote working devices becoming infected with malware and being available for use in the botnets used for DDoS attacks. There are several examples over the last 2 years where work from home devices were infected resulting in an impact on the organization which lasted for days and even weeks. At the same time almost, every organization is moving its services online. As more businesses make their way online, the potential number of victims for the cyber criminals increase 
 Political instability: Political tensions between geographical regions have resulted in an increase in state sponsored cyber-attacks on critical infrastructure. Every country now needs to defend against these attacks.&nbsp; DDoS attacks have become a way for countries to engage in cyber warfare. &nbsp;Potential targets for this include defense and aeronautics companies as well to civil infrastructure to disrupt crucial public services. 
 Cryptocurrency: Recently the crypto currency market has seen exponential growth with a large number of investors engaging in crypto financial activities. Cyber attackers have now shifted focus to target blockchain miners and cryptocurrency trade platforms using DDoS attacks. At the same time crypto currencies have equipped the cyber attackers with a way to receive ransom payments anonymously. As this industry continues to grow, we can expect to see a growth in the cyber-attacks in this space. 
 
 Recommendations to mitigate DDoS attacks 
<p>DDoS attacks cannot be avoided but specialized cybersecurity companies and Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) can bring down botnets.&nbsp; Organizations can use advanced analytics to track and assess the risk of attacks. Organization can take a few straightforward measures to control the disruption to their critical business services. Following are examples of some of these:</p>
 
 Content Delivery Networks (CDN): In the past users have been unable to access websites simply due to an increase in traffic overloading the centralized systems. &nbsp;CDN provides a &nbsp;globally distributed server network that can help the business to maintain its services during peak load as well as to mitigate the effect of DDoS. A CDN allows you to isolate the affected services from a DDoS attack and keep the business functioning. 
 Outsourcing to Cloud services: Running business services in the large cloud services has the benefit of the countermeasures that these providers take against DDoS as well as the additional anti-DDoS services that they provide. &nbsp;They also provide massive scalability making it harder to bring down their service by DDoS attacks. 
 Monitoring network traffic: DDoS attacks increase network traffic to overload your service. &nbsp;Monitoring your network to identify the normal traffic patterns is important to help you to spot when something unusual is occurring.&nbsp; However, well-planned attacks often start without any warning. Thus, monitoring is important for detecting attacks rather than for mitigating their effects.&nbsp; Another approach is rate limiting, this helps to limit attempted DDoS attacks by restricting the number of specific types of requests accepted. 
 Using Professional tools: There are many trusted DDoS prevention tools in the market. Leveraging these is a straightforward way to protect against and mitigate the effects of these attack 
 
<p>DDoS attacks have not gone away but in fact are increasing. DDoS attacks cannot be avoided but law enforcement and the large cyber security organizations are working to identify and disable them. KuppingerCole recommends that organizations take action to protect against these attacks by using the right tools.

<p>This blog article is part of our blog series “Pushing fintech regulation forward”.</p>



<p>Fintechs have brought many changes to the financial services industry. The rapid introduction of new technology and increasing competition have improved services and customer experience in many ways. However, increasing regulation goes along with this rise in innovation.</p>



<p>As fintechs expand the services they offer and the licenses they need, they can quickly become exposed to increased regulation. This is especially challenging as it can include new technology areas where regulation is not well established. </p>



<p>Fintechs also need to be aware of regulatory differences between countries where they operate.</p>



<p>There has been much discussion in the industry about the challenges of regulation keeping pace with fintech’s speed of innovation. As one example, UK-based <a href="https://www.cityam.com/exclusive-fintech-bosses-call-on-government-to-ramp-up-efforts-to-overhaul-regulation/">City AM reported in February 2022</a> that many leading UK fintechs have called on the government to overhaul the regulation of fintechs. This is needed to keep pace with innovation and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/regulatory-risks-fintechs/">allow fintechs to continue to grow while keeping the market safe</a>.</p>



<p>Whatever the changes are going forward, KYC and AML will remain key amongst the regulations. Fintechs are subject to the same well-defined requirements to protect themselves, customers, and the wider financial markets from financial crime as other financial institutions. In Europe, this includes the AMLD and eIDAS regulations.</p>



 Fintech regulation and Artificial Intelligence  



<p>An eKYC solution, such as&nbsp;AI-driven ID verification is one way fintechs can ensure they are mitigating regulatory risks&nbsp;at almost any stage of their growth plans. Automation offers faster and more accurate verification and customer onboarding. </p>



<p>Done right, it can improve overall customer experience and conversion. Regulators are increasingly supporting AI technologies for automated identity verification. As long as fintechs stay aware of regulatory changes, there is plenty of potential for growth and service improvement.</p>



 What is RegTech within financial services? 



<p>RegTech refers to regulatory compliance management with the help of technical innovations. It is a subset of the fintech market, which refers to the wider idea of using technology (regulatory technology) within the financial services industry.</p>



<p>The RegTech sector is growing rapidly. According to <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/regtech-market-63447434.html">Markets and Markets</a>, its market size is set to grow to $16 billion by 2025 (from $6.3 billion in 2020).</p>



<p>RegTech utilizes many different technologies to meet the growing challenge of compliance. This includes cloud computing, live video, predictive analytics, and voice recognition. </p>



<p>The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is key among these technologies. It can support the vital AML and KYC regulations in place in almost all countries with automated identity verification, biometric verification, and transaction monitoring.</p>



<blockquote><p>Artificial Intelligence and machine learning techniques have been well adopted by fintechs and RegTechs in improving KYC and AML. </p>Francisco Martins, Senior Identity Consultant, Financial Sector UK/I at IDnow</blockquote>



 Automated Identity Verification for fintech and RegTech companies 



<p>Fintechs leverage artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies in many different ways. They allow for automated information processing, unlimited monitoring of transactions, trend analysis, and fraud identification.</p>



<p>Applications include loan processing and credit evaluation, credit card fraud detection, and even algorithm-based trading.</p>



<p>Automated identity verification has risen to be one of the most important uses of AI, bringing huge benefits in safety, cost, and customer experience. </p>



<p>As more customer interaction has moved online in recent years, the need and possibilities for this have exploded. </p>



<p>More and more people are accessing services online, replacing traditional branch interactions and even ATM use (one of the first fintech growth areas in the 1980s).</p>



<p>The COVID pandemic has seen this trend accelerate even faster – <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever">a study by consultancy McKinsey</a> suggests that companies are up to seven years ahead in digital transformation. And with increasing acceptance from regulators, the trend is well set for the continued expansion of automated identity verification.</p>







 How is Artificial Intelligence (AI) used in Identity Verification? 



<p>AI has changed the identity verification and onboarding processes for financial institutions. Not long ago, these were entirely manual processes. Customers would visit a branch to verify physical identity documents. This is time-consuming, costly, and frustrating for customers.</p>



<p>Artificial intelligence is the technical simulation of human intelligence by computers. AI is trained using data sets to think and draw conclusions like a human (this process is referred to as machine learning).</p>



<p>This has obvious applications in automated verification, and AI solutions are now well advanced in this area. </p>



<p>For example, Artificial Intelligence can be used in several ways:</p>



  Checking identity document authenticity. AI can automatically detect and verify security features contained in identity documents.  Live video biometrics. Personal identity can be checked using live photos or videos and comparing biometrics with identity photographs. With training data and human oversight, machine learning algorithms can be trained (and continually improved) in detecting matches.  Transaction monitoring. KYC and AML are not just one-off checks that need to be carried out when onboarding a customer. Ongoing monitoring of customer states and transactions is required. AI can assist here as well.  



 







 The benefits of using Artificial Intelligence for Identity Verification 



<p>AI is transforming KYC procedures, customer onboarding, and identity verification. </p>



 



<p>When implemented right, AI brings many advantages for fintechs, financial institutions, and their customers, such as the following:</p>



 



 
 
<p>Fast results.</p>
 



 
<p>Automated processes are, as you would expect, much faster. AI-based verification can check documents and identity within minutes. Even if manual intervention is needed, this can be built-in and handled quickly.</p>
 
 



 
 
<p>Lower cost.</p>
 



 
<p>Manual KYC verification has high costs – in both time and money. Expensive third-party services are often used, staff are involved in repeated manual tasks, and delays and backlogs can lose customers.</p>
 
 



 
 
<p>Improved accuracy. </p>
 



 
<p>Part of the reasoning for increasing regulatory acceptance is the realization that automated AI verification is safer in many ways. Automated processing limits the possibility of human error or oversight. AI is also trained on datasets, and accuracy improves as more data is created.</p>
 
 



 
 
<p>Meets regulatory requirements.</p>
 



 
<p>Staying compliant is vital in the heavily regulated financial services sector. AI is permitted by many regulators (including in the UK and parts of the EU), and its acceptance is increasing. Non-compliance can be very expensive. You just have to look at some huge fines handed out to banks to see this – including £102 million for Standard Chartered in the UK in 2019.</p>
 
 



 
 
<p>Allows for true ongoing monitoring.</p>
 



 
<p>AI can monitor activity and transactions continuously and in real time. This would be a vast effort to achieve manually without the use of AI.</p>
 
 



 
 
<p>Improved customer experience. </p>
 



 
<p>Customers want to know their interactions are secure, while also having a fast and friction free experience.</p>
 
 



 
 
<p>Increased conversion rates. </p>
 



 
<p>Customer conversion rates are critical in online financial services. This is improved with faster onboarding and verification, with customers less likely to abandon the process.</p>
 
 



 
 
<p>Allows for global expansion. </p>
 



 
<p>Having an automated solution that meets appropriate regulatory requirements makes it simpler to expand service into other countries. More and more countries are accepting automated AI solutions as part of KYC.</p>
 
 



 The challenges of integrating AI into KYC procedures 



<p>There are also challenges and difficulties with the implementation of AI and machine learning. For a fuller discussion of these, see <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/challenges-fintechs-ai-kyc-id-verification/">IDnow’s blog on the challenges of fintech AI integration</a>.</p>



<p>When AI is used as part of customer onboarding, adopters need to consider customer expectations and experience. Users need to feel that interactions are secure. They also want fast results without errors or delays – this will become more pronounced as AI use expands.</p>



<p>As well as these KYC issues, fintechs need to be aware of standard problems with AI techniques. This includes having access to sufficient data for training. </p>



<p>AI and machine learning algorithms rely on data for training, and this should be complete, thorough, and representative. Sufficient human input and oversight are needed and should be managed to avoid introducing hard-to-detect bias.</p>



 Increasing global acceptance by regulators 



<p>Of course, any technology used in the financial services sector needs to comply with strict regulations. This is sometimes a challenge in the fintech sector, where technology use often advances faster than regulations.</p>



<p>KYC and AML regulations in most countries do not directly discuss technical implementation details. </p>



<p>Nevertheless, more and more national regulators are permitting the full use of AI techniques. These include the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Belgium, and Finland. </p>



<p>Other European countries permit video-based KYC. Germany is a tightly regulated market, and it now accepts an element of automation combined with a manual review.</p>



<p>The trend is set for the acceptance of full AI to increase, and this is giving fintechs and financial institutions the confidence to adopt AI for expansion.</p>



 Final thoughts 



<p>Regulation of fintechs is a complex area and one that is still developing. As fintechs and their technology use continue to advance, regulations and oversight ensure its safe long-term growth.</p>



<p>There have been big improvements, and many areas are now well regulated. The use of AI and automated identity verification is certainly one of these. </p>



<p>Regulation is now well established for the use of AI with KYC and AML. This can lead the way for fintechs to comfortably adopt new technologies that are faster, cheaper, and safer, and help them grow.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the right implementation provides a much-improved user experience. </p>



<p>Going forward, more users in more locations will come to expect a reliable, safe, and fast onboarding experience. With the right technology in use, fintechs can easily offer this.</p>

  Delivering effective IAM is not always easy, and around half of IAM projects run into difficulties and stall. While opting for IAM that is delivered as a service is a potential solution, not all offerings are equal. Finding a service with the right combination of well-integrated capabilities is crucial to success.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Raj Hegde</a></p><p>The decentralized identity paradigm disrupts traditional identity and access management ecosystems and requires a more democratic collaboration and competition among several identity and credential issuers.&nbsp;Dr. Michele Nati from&nbsp;IOTA Foundation will elaborate on this challenge in his Combined Session&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5081/1">Making SSI accessible: IOTA technology, solutions and projects</a> on Thursday, May 12, at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2022</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Michele some questions about his presentation.</p>
<p> </p>
 How important is SSI in healthcare? 
<p>First of all, just a very quick intro to SSI, SSI is Self-Sovereign Identity. So this means that people are the owner of their own identity, so they can create their identity, which is basically an identifier. And they can control where these identities share. So but identity in itself is not enough, identity is meaning when to our identity, we attach attributes and these attributes come from so-called credential issuance. And so those that can issue this attribute in form of verified information, information that can be verified. Again, is this done in a self-sovereign way means that the user, that the subject can control who gets access to this account with these credentials. Especially in healthcare, this is very important because healthcare is now a collection of information spread everywhere, to my doctor, my GP, my dentist, the emergency room, when I have to go to the hospital, and so on and so forth. All of this is very, very difficult to recombine together. So they need a unique identity that represents me that can be the aggregator of all of this information. All of these pieces of information are basically different attributes, a different credential that belongs to my identity. So with the SSI, we really have now the power to make a much more coherent story. This story is about the health of a person, about different kinds of pieces of information about a person and access to them. Access that is controlled by the individual. And this is not only in my country because if I move and I go to another country, and the identity comes with me, it's self-sovereign. I don't need to register again with another health system in another country. That country, with my self-sovereign identity, can find this information about my GP, my dentist, and so on and so forth. So there are two advantages, much more and better-controlled flow of information that I always oversee as a patient, but as a user of health systems in different ways and forms, and of course saving of cost and better care for me because when it's possible to give you the right service for the right information about my health, all of it would be beneficial for me and also saving for whoever I have to provide this is health service that doesn't need to have the step of every time to go and finding the information to provide you the better service. So all of this will change very much and bring a lot of new, let's say, ways of delivering health care in different countries and across countries.</p>
<p></p>
 Do we need SSI only for patients or also for medical devices? What are the challenges in both cases? 
<p>Well, that's a very good point. So yeah, there are two dimensions. One, it's again, like you said, my information, information about me with the subject health information. And that's very well controlled and defined with self-sovereign identity. But it's true that most of the information comes also from the device that I'm wearing, either for medical prescription or for pleasure. So if I wear a smart garment that can collect additional information about my health, lifestyle, how healthy and how much physical activity I do, this can be also information that will be useful to link as additional, maybe nonqualified credential. But still, credentials come from a trusted source like the provider of the service, of the monitoring device that can be solved by this device with an identity that then this linked in a unique way to me and to my identity and all the information again that's linked as a part of my profile, that would be beneficial. But there are also other devices like I am prescribed by the doctor to wear some insulin pump or so on and so forth for my condition and all of these devices need to be traced in that supply chain. So I need to be sure that I get the right device. I get the device that it's not creating a threat for me because these devices now are all connected, devices that can be also the target of some threat, some attack. So every device that all along the supply chain, has one identity, and this identity is used to collect information about how good is this device, how much this firmware is updated, how much that manufacturer gives me assurance that what I'm wearing, it's certified and a safety device so this doesn't endanger my health but improve and give me more information and give me a safe way to manage my health so all of this will be needed. So that's one of the reasons to stop all this sort of criticism that we see that is told about an IoT device. So an IoT device that is well-identified along the supply chain with a self-sovereign identity that the user at some point when they register to get the device, can control it, can collect all the information that the device carries with it, and then share and then verify. That's also the value in the health ecosystem for self-sovereign identity.</p>
<p></p>
 What about GDPR compliance? What projects are you working on this topic? 
<p>GDPR compliance is very important. The major topic to consider when you talk about self-sovereign identity. On the one side, self-sovereign identity, it's probably the best expression of GDPR and data protection where the user is empowered to control and protect his own data. But GDPR and SSI have also a few other things that have to align because as SSI if you want to go back very quickly to the technology behind SSI, it's only possible thanks to blockchain so the concept emerged in the blockchain. So and the idea of having a blockchain where people or manufacturers for the use of a health care device in this context that they produce, store a unique identity on the ledger. This allowed to basically when presented information that this identity collects in terms of verifiable credential attributes either for me or my device for a third party or line party. This information can be verified immediately. So there is no need to complex integration that requires a centralized setup there where information is stored about the device, about the patient, and so on and so forth, which can also bring at least an attack from a GDPR point of view this information can be accessed. It can be stolen and can create a single point of failure denial of service attack. So when we remove all of this with blockchain, it is possible then to verify this information immediately because the identity is written in the ledger, and by verifying the identity, basically by issuing that credential from the ledger, I can verify the authenticity of this convention, this attribute about me or my device. But we need to be careful that the only information is on the ledger is an identity. So because otherwise, with the GDPR we'll face issues about personal data being on the ledger, being stored on a blockchain, and this will conflict with, let's say, GDPR, let's say, rights like that could be forgotten. Need to guarantee that user that his data can be updated, erased, and so on and so forth. We'll conflict with that. This system can be the sign-in that GDPR compliant way where credentials sit off-chain, sits in that user wallet, a wallet the user control maybe as running on his mobile phone, stored on his mobile phone with his credentials that can automatically be presented when a party requests and verified using the blockchain. So this is the way we have to implement GDPR compliance in SSI systems, putting a lot of emphasis on where the information would actually store beyond the identity identifier and create a secure, and from a user experience point of view as well, easy to use wallet for storing credentials.</p>
<p></p>
 &nbsp; 
 What is the relevance of EU work and the digital wallet initiative? 
<p>Probably coming back quickly to the previous question. We are doing this actually, all of this, thinking and all of these designing GDPR compliant SSI solutions for people, identities and attributes, and their device in the medical sector, is part of our product. We are currently involved as part of the work we do with the IOTA foundation at the European level, which is called Second. And we are actually targeting working with the health institutions, research and medical device companies, and so on and so forth. Part of this large project that started this year, will run for the next three years with a pilot in a different domain for, let's say, safe assistance of people in case of emergency. So ambulance will know information about you immediately by accessing information from your digital wallet without delay, or any further assistance to you. So these are a few of the projects we are discussing and will work on with European partners. But we are not the only one on that, this is specific to the target innovation that the European Commission is funding and supporting. But of course, the European Commission is going further, establishing guidelines and requirements on how this crucial element of SSI and managing of identity, GDPR compliant, need to be developed, which is the European Digital Identity Wallet. So that's at the European level, we are also looking at, we are also trying to create a digital wallet that every user will have, will be issued by the Member States or an appointed issuer of the digital identity wallet by the Member States, and they will have to comply to different requirements. The original requirement in terms of security of the credentials stored on their mobile phone device, so that every person has its own identity and attributes within every time, everywhere it goes can present to [...] services how these can be securely stored. How can these securely be presented to a third party that can be first authenticated before we share information? All of this, it's part of what we follow very closely and for which we are also working with the IOTA foundation and other academic partners and experts in security that are helping us to design a wallet that will be new compliant thoughts in that domain. So are these are the two things that we are doing in different public projects.</p>

<p>Cybercrimes have become a much more significant threat than real-life crimes throughout the last few years, as they are so frequent nowadays. Stealing data from mobile phones and computers has become an enormously profitable business — robbing people of their identities, money, and personal information.</p><p>But luckily, one term flipped on the Internet over a decade ago — VPN. The first VPN (then named PPTP) dates back to&nbsp;1996.</p><p>This technology has let people control their online privacy and enjoy browsing without worrying about someone trying to use their data without permission.</p><p>What is VPN, how does it help people, and which are the best VPN deals today? Let’s find out in the&nbsp;article.</p> WHAT IS A&nbsp;VPN? <p>No one wants their data to be tracked. Whether it’s for ad purposes or malicious attacks, people prefer their searches to be encrypted.</p><p>A virtual private network (VPN in short) creates a private network across a public network and lets you send and securely receive data. It makes sure that your internet communication is safe from prying eyes and&nbsp;hackers.</p><p>A VPN also creates a “tunnel” between your computer and the remote servers, and it helps you use the Internet without restrictions or limitations.</p><p>In other words, the VPN is a “mask” that encrypts your information before you log it&nbsp;online.</p><p>Also another trend is Mobile VPNs. They allow businesses to extend their private network and private applications across public networks — by connecting a device or computer to a private network. They can gain access to a secure, high-speed, encrypted tunnel to move data securely between the two networks.</p><p>Across multiple devices and platforms, corporations can ensure that their employees have secure connections between their devices and their remote offices without sacrificing performance. And how big of a role VPNs played when the pandemic has hit and cyber crimes&nbsp;spiked!</p> HOW DO YOU PICK THE BEST VPN PROVIDER? <p>No matter what kind of software customers pick, they are always looking for an exclusive deal they can get from reputable VPN providers. But which are the criteria for identifying the best VPN deal you can make. Let’s&nbsp;see.</p> PRICE <p>If you’re tempted to find the cheapest VPN services or go for something “free,” you should know that nothing comes for free. If you go for the most affordable option available, you’ll sacrifice bandwidth speed and get bombarded with ads. And that’s a minor evil. Some unreliable VPN providers can even sell your data. Does it make sense to protect your data from person A to see it used by person&nbsp;B?</p> SECURITY <p>With the growing demand for VPN services, it’s no wonder that new companies are popping up left and right. Many of these have been started by individuals who might not have any experience in internet security. Before committing to a long-term subscription with a VPN provider, make sure the other side is secure&nbsp;enough.</p> REPUTATION <p>When looking for a VPN, it’s essential to do your research. There are countless VPN comparisons and reviews available on the web. Some of them are paid advertisements, and others are independent analyses. It can be extremely challenging to tell the difference between the two, so make sure you trust quality sources before purchasing. The “best deals” might be wannabes with bought&nbsp;reviews.</p> CHECK THE HOME COUNTRY OF YOUR&nbsp;PROVIDER <p>VPN providers must follow the laws of their home country. Although these laws can be confusing and are constantly changing, it is crucial to know where your VPN is from. Before you decide, check where your provider is located and the right to be served a warrant by authorities.</p><p>Unlimited data, unlimited devices, and all that sounds great — but if it is at the expense of data leaks, is it worth it? Try to find providers based in countries that are more liberal, and the governments won’t force them to spy on&nbsp;you.</p> ENSURE YOU HAVE READ THE PRIVACY&nbsp;POLICY <p>Many users tend to “check” everything without reading the blueprint. And that’s a&nbsp;mistake.</p><p>If you want to prevent your personal information from being shared with third parties, it’s crucial to look at the privacy policy and know what your VPN provider is sharing. Some providers may share customer data with third parties to track user trends and preferences or profit from their audience. Always research VPNs to ensure reliability before committing to a VPN subscription..</p> TOP VPN DEALS&nbsp;TODAY <p>Good VPN services offer a lot of value for your money. Let’s see some of the big names&nbsp;here.</p> NORDVPN <p>NordVPN is the first name that comes to our mind when we mention VPN. And rightfully so. Over the years, it has consistently delivered good results on all types of devices — mobile phones and computers.</p><p>With its presence in 59 countries and over 5400 servers, NordVPN is one of the best options for a VPN if you’re looking to access geo-restricted content. Because of its good speeds, it’s also great for streaming in HD. Best yet, NordVPN is highly secure thanks to military-grade encryption and an automatic kill switch that blocks all data in the event of a dropped connection.</p><p>It isn’t the fastest provider on the market, though. Some servers are running at 1GBps, but NordVPN is rapidly advancing, and soon all of their servers will have 10GBps capacity.</p><p>One huge update for NordVPN is that the company is heavily investing in its servers rather than renting, so it’s even a better situation now. On top of that, the company resides in Panama. As a result, NordVPN isn’t obliged to track and share your&nbsp;data.</p><p>NordVPN can work on Windows computers, Macs, iOS, and Android, meaning you can access it from any device. Speaking of gadgets, one account can access up to 6 devices simultaneously, which is a pretty fair deal for such a big name in the industry.</p><p>Unfortunately, there isn’t a free version, but the paid ones are not expensive at&nbsp;all.</p><p>Let’s see the pricing&nbsp;plans:</p>  €10.49 is their monthly cost if you pay month by&nbsp;month.  €10.49/month is the annual plan, too. However, for the first year, you can get it for €52.68 or €4.39/month.  The best deal is the biennial one which you can get for €69.36 or €2.89 per&nbsp;month!  <p>The interface is user-friendly and easy to navigate, its Windows client is pretty good, and all of its mobile apps are great for their ease of use. Its expansive network of servers provides users with unmatched flexibility. And did we mention that it comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee?</p><p>It’s worth giving it a shot. There is nothing to lose at the end of the&nbsp;day.</p><p><a href="https://www.monetha.io/rewards/nordvpn-25/">https://www.monetha.io/rewards/nordvpn-25/</a></p><p>Get up to 320 Monetha points per euro you spend on NordVPN with the Monetha&nbsp;app.</p> PUREVPN <p>PureVPN has been a leading provider of online security and privacy since 2007. To date, it’s built over 6,500 servers around the world (78 countries) — one of the most extensive server networks on the market. The company also has a very wide range of features: 256-bit encryption with OpenVPN and IKEv2/IPSec, DNS and IPv6 leak protection, no logs policy, an automatic kill switch, and port forwarding to bypass firewalls.</p><p>It used to cover more than 100 countries in 2021. However, the company policy changed to select only servers with higher speeds and security standards. Many servers are switching from 10GBps to 20GBps, which is a lovely sign for&nbsp;users.</p><p>On top of that, you can use PureVPN on all types of devices — it runs on Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. It also supports Android TV, as well as Amazon Fire&nbsp;TV.</p><p>PureVPN can be used on up to 10 devices simultaneously, which is excellent news. It also moved from Hong Kong to the British Virgin Islands and now passed the strict no-logging policy&nbsp;test.</p><p>As for the price, it comes with three&nbsp;plans:</p>  The standard monthly plan costs $10.95 with a 31-day money-back guarantee  The annual plan is $3.24 per month with a 31-day money-back guarantee  A two-year plan costs $1.99 per month and then $4.49 per month. You also get 3 months free of&nbsp;charge.  <p><a href="https://www.monetha.io/rewards/purevpn-55/">https://www.monetha.io/rewards/purevpn-55/</a></p><p>Get up to 320 Monetha points per euro you spend on PureVPN with the Monetha&nbsp;app.</p> PRIVATE INTERNET ACCESS&nbsp;VPN <p>Private Internet access (or PIA in short) is a top-notch VPN provider. Currently, the company that owns ExpressVPN and ZenMate (Kape) is at the helm, so that’s good&nbsp;news.</p><p>It has over 35,000 servers in more than 80 countries worldwide, which is a staggering number! However, some slow 1GBps servers are gradually replaced with NextGen 10GBps serves and better RAM management hardware is in place to ensure sensitive information won’t get into the wrong hands if the servers lose&nbsp;power.</p><p>Private Internet Access VPN is available across all types of devices on all major operating systems — Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Android TV. You can link up to 10&nbsp;devices.</p><p>PIA excels at bypassing VPN detection software, making it an excellent deal for accessing streaming services like Amazon Prime Video, Netflix,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>Let’s see how it performs price-wise:</p>  The monthly plan is €9.29, which is not a bad deal, as typically, these plans are more expensive.  The annual plan is €37.19 per year or €3.10 per&nbsp;month.  The best deal is €70 for 3 years which equals less than €2 a month&nbsp;(€1.79).  <p>It is undoubtedly a very well-priced option and what we liked is that you can ask for a refund more than&nbsp;once.</p><p><a href="https://www.monetha.io/rewards/private-internet-access-vpn-105/">https://www.monetha.io/rewards/private-internet-access-vpn-105/</a></p><p>Get up to 480 Monetha points per euro you spend on Private Internet Access VPN with the Monetha&nbsp;app.</p> ATLAS VPN <p>Atlas VPN is a competent VPN provider that offers a decent all-around service for some of the lowest prices. It has support for WireGuard, for instance. You get iOS, Mac, Windows, and Android apps, a “kill switch” to protect you if the VPN drops, and a SafeSwap feature if you need to swap IP addresses while connected to a server. There are also ad and malware blocking and data breach monitoring alerts.</p><p>When it comes to servers, Atlas can’t be proud of what it offers — 750 servers across 48 locations, predominantly in Europe and USA, so it’s not a viable solution for global users but more than a good one for Europeans and North Americans. It was recently bought by Nord (the company that owns NordVPN), so it will benefit from development, and we can see progress in that direction.</p><p>Atlas VPN offers the essentials of privacy protection with AES-256 encryption. Atlas comes with a private DNS system to help keep your information safe.</p><p>But what sets this VPN among the best VPN services are the extras: like rotating IP addresses to help you avoid government tracking and the ad and tracker blocking system. I think any privacy concern is solved on this&nbsp;app.</p><p>Let’s see how this app does in terms of&nbsp;pricing.</p>  Free plan available — though it is capped at 400MB data consumption/day, it is still a decent&nbsp;option.  The monthly subscription is €9.69 per&nbsp;month.  The annual subscription is €2.90 per month for the first&nbsp;year.  For only €63.04, you can use AtlasVPN for 36 months(or €1.75/month). It’s one of the cheapest VPN deals on the market right&nbsp;now.  <p><a href="https://www.monetha.io/rewards/atlas-vpn-180/">https://www.monetha.io/rewards/atlas-vpn-180/</a></p><p>Get up to 480 Monetha points per euro you spend on Atlas VPN with the Monetha&nbsp;app.</p> BLUFVPN <p>BlufVPN is a new, simple VPN service provider established in 2020. It’s interesting to see how young it is and how well its functionality is working. Feature-wise, it has a lot of similarities with other VPNs; let’s take a closer&nbsp;look.</p><p>Firstly, it does perform exceptionally well on Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS, which is quite good. The servers are over 500 (which isn’t much by any means) in more than 70 locations. It allows 5 simultaneous connections — a bit underwhelming.</p><p>BlufVPN offers 256-bit AES encryption to operate your data and hide it from any hacker. They offer various tunneling protocols, including IKEv2, UDP, TCP, and OpenVPN. The Windows client automatically uses OpenVPN, whereas the Android app defaults to IKEv2. You’re free to change the protocol as you&nbsp;wish.</p><p>It can successfully stream Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and HBO Max and has an autorun option which means it will launch immediately after you turn on your&nbsp;PC.</p><p>Let’s see the pricing plans or&nbsp;BlufVPN.</p>  €9.99 is the monthly price if you pay month by&nbsp;month  €3.49/month is what you will pay if you subscribe yearly (€41.88).  The best deal is €2.00/month or a total of €72.00 for three&nbsp;years.  <p><a href="https://www.monetha.io/rewards/blufvpn-79/">https://www.monetha.io/rewards/blufvpn-79/</a></p><p>Get up to 240 Monetha points per euro you spend on BlufVPN with the Monetha&nbsp;app.</p> VUZEVPN <p>VuzeVPN is a fairly new VPN service. Its name might ring a bell with torrent maniacs because it’s related to the popular Vuze BitTorrent. However, this VPN service has the potential to be a strong competitor in the&nbsp;market.</p><p>There’s a zero-log policy, but the servers available are just over&nbsp;200.</p><p>It didn’t use to support devices other than Windows, but now we can see it’s much better now. You can access it on a Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Android &amp; Android TV, and other smart TVs. It supports up to 5 streaming devices simultaneously, which isn’t that much, but it compensates with a “kill switch” feature that’s a must-have to protect your online&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>VuzeVPN operates in US territory, which means citizens might have their online activity spied on because of the “Fourteen Eyes” intelligence-sharing program.</p><p>But how good is VuzeVPN when it comes to&nbsp;pricing?</p>  €10.99 is the monthly plan which is a bit expensive.  €7.99 is the 6-month plan which also isn’t that&nbsp;great.  €4.99 is the price if you get the annual subscription.  <p><a href="https://www.monetha.io/rewards/vuze-vpn-109/">https://www.monetha.io/rewards/vuze-vpn-109/</a></p><p>Get up to 400 Monetha points per every euro you spend on VuzeVPN with the Monetha&nbsp;app.</p><p>Download the Monetha app on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.monetha.identity&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=direct">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.monetha.identity&amp;utm_source=website&amp;utm_medium=direct">Android</a>, build your profile, earn rewards and make the most out of your&nbsp;data.</p><p>Originally published at <a href="https://www.monetha.io/best-vpn-deals/">https://www.monetha.io</a>. on April 11,&nbsp;2022.</p>

<p>Anyone who has tried to type a password using a television remote can tell you what a pain it is. Not only will you be frustrated with the keyboard, but it’s not secure; everyone else in the room can see what you are typing. Fortunately, the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant gives you an easier way to sign in. The name is a mouthful, but if you have ever logged in to a TV by scanning a QR code or typing a short code, you’ve already used this flow.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>The great thing about this authentication flow is that it isn’t just for televisions. It works with any "input restricted" internet-connected device, including alarm clocks, <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/build-user-signup-counter-with-arduino-part2/">Arduinos</a>, and even command-line tools.</p>
 
 
<p>In this post, I’ll walk through how the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant works and build a basic Java console application!</p>
 
 
<p>If you want to skip the text and jump directly into the example code, you can find it on <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-device-grant-java-example">our GitHub repo</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>An Okta organization - (Sign up for free using your <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">browser</a>, or the <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a>)</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://adoptium.net/">Java 11+</a> (Tested with 11, 17, &amp; 18)</p>

 How does the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant work? 
 
 
<p>At a high level, the flow works like this:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>A device or application initiates the flow <code>POST /v1/device/authorize</code></p>
 
 
<p>The IdP responds with a "device code", "user code", and a URL.</p>
 
 
<p>The user is instructed to visit the URL,  enter the "user code", and authenticate.</p>
 
 
<p>The application polls the IdP using the "device code" until the user has logged in.</p>
 
 
<p>The IdP responds with an access token.</p>
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 






This example will work the same with any Identity Provider (IdP) that supports the flow, but you may need to tweak the URLs.



 
 
 
 
 OAuth 2.0 from the command line 
 
 
<p>You might not think of your terminal as an "input restricted device", but that doesn’t mean you should type a website’s passwords into your console. There are a few problems to be aware of related to this:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>You should ONLY enter a password into the website it was created for.</p>
 
 
<p>Your terminal doesn’t support the same factors your browser does.</p>
 
 
<p>You may be ssh’d into another computer.</p>
 
 
 
 






The Authorization Device Grant requires a user. If you are trying to call APIs from an automated process or other server-to-server communication, check out the <a>OAuth 2.0 Client Credential Flow</a>.



 
 
 
 
 Set up Okta 
 
 
<p>First, you need to create an Okta application that supports the Device Grant.</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>In Applications→Applications, click Create App Integration. In the pop-up, choose OIDC - OpenID Connect, then Native Application. The Device Grant is only available for Native Applications.</p>
 
 

 
 
 
 
<p>In the next step, check Device Authorization in the Grant type section.</p>
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Make a note of the Client ID, you will need it below.</p>
 
 
<p>If you are using an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-servers/#available-authorization-server-types">Okta Authorization Server</a>, you also need to enable the grant type in the authorization server’s policy interface:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Go to Security→API.</p>
 
 
<p>Select the authorization server you want to use (for example, "default").</p>
 
 
<p>Click the Access Policies tab, and edit the rule for your policy. Make sure to select the Device Authorization check box.</p>
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>Make note of your Issuer URI. If you are using an Okta Custom Authorization Server, it will look something like this (updating the hostname to match your Okta Org):</p>
 
 
 
 <code>https://dev-133337.okta.com/api/v1/authorizationServers/default</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Otherwise, it will be the same as your Okta URL:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>https://dev-133337.okta.com</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Create a Java application 
 
 
<p>On to the fun part, writing some code!</p>
 
 
<p>Create a new project in your favorite IDE. (I’m a fan of <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a>.) The code below uses the <code>java.net.http.HttpClient</code>, make sure our target Java is set to at least <code>11</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>The <code>HttpClient</code> API is much easier to use than its predecessor <code>URLConnection</code>, but Java is still no way to parse JSON out of the box. Add a dependency on <a href="https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind">Jackson Databind</a> to fix that.</p>
 
 
<p>To keep things all contained in a single <code>java</code> file, I’ll use <a href="https://www.jbang.dev">JBang</a>. If you haven’t used JBang before, here’s the TL;DR: JBang makes it easy to create Java…​ scripts. It’s a scripting tool that  lets you run Java application with minimal setup. Your project dependencies get added to the top of the <code>java</code> file.</p>
 
 
<p>Create a new <code>DeviceGrant.java</code> and add <code>jackson-databind</code> as a dependency:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>//DEPS com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.13.2 (1)

import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper; (2)

import java.awt.*; (3)
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.UncheckedIOException;
import java.net.URI;
import java.net.URLEncoder;
import java.net.http.HttpClient;
import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
import java.net.http.HttpResponse;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.time.Duration;
import java.util.Map;

import static java.util.stream.Collectors.joining;

public class DeviceGrant {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Make sure there is no space between the <code>//</code> and <code>DEPS</code>.


2
Add the following imports, they will be used below.


3
AWT? Yes, keep reading I’ll get to that 😉


 
 
 
 
<p>Execute the application from the command line using:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jbang DeviceGrant.java</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This application doesn’t do anything yet. We can fix the in the next few steps!</p>
 
 
 A little more boilerplate 
 
<p>The fluent <code>HttpClient</code> is handy, but along with not having JSON support, it also doesn’t have direct support for form-encoded requests. Fortunately, both issues are easy to fix by adding a couple of helper methods.</p>
 
 
<p>In <code>DeviceGrant.java</code> add the following two methods:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>// Convert a map into a encoded form body
private static HttpRequest.BodyPublisher formBody(Map&lt;String, String&gt; params) {
    // Wrap an encoded String in a BodyPublisher
    return HttpRequest.BodyPublishers.ofString(
        // url encode &lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;&amp;
        params.entrySet().stream()
            .map(entry -&gt; URLEncoder.encode(entry.getKey(), UTF_8)
                          + "="
                          + URLEncoder.encode(entry.getValue(), UTF_8))
            .collect(joining("&amp;")));
}

// parse a response body using Jackson
public static &lt;W&gt; HttpResponse.BodySubscriber&lt;W&gt; parseJson(Class&lt;W&gt; targetType) {
    return HttpResponse.BodySubscribers.mapping(
        HttpResponse.BodySubscribers.ofByteArray(),
        (byte[] bytes) -&gt; {
            try {
                ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();
                return objectMapper.readValue(bytes, targetType);
            } catch (IOException e) {
                throw new UncheckedIOException(e);
            }
        });
}</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Initiate the authorization request 
 
 
<p>From the above <a>Set up Okta</a> section you have a public "client id" and "issuer" URI. For the sake of convenience, set those as <code>String</code> variables:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

    String clientId = "your-client-id-here" ;
    String issuer = "https://dev-l33337.okta.com/oauth2/default";</code> 
 
 
 






These values are public, meaning they are safe to bundle in your application.



 
 
 
 <code>// Create a client
HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();

// List of scopes requested by your application (oauth scopes are space separated)
String scopes = String.join(" ", "openid", "profile", "offline_access");

// HTTP POST form arguments
Map&lt;String, String&gt; authArgs = Map.of(
        "client_id", clientId,
        "scope", scopes); // the arg name IS the singular form of scope</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Using the fluent API, create a post request to <code>${issuer}/v1/device/authorize</code>, including the client ID and scopes.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
        .uri(URI.create(issuer + "/v1/device/authorize"))
        .POST(formBody(authArgs))
        .header("Accept", "application/json")
        .header("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded")
        .build();

// execute the request
HttpResponse&lt;Map&gt; httpResponse = client.send(request, rs -&gt; parseJson(Map.class));

// Fail on anything except a 200 response
if (httpResponse.statusCode() != 200) {
    System.err.println("Error: " + httpResponse);
    throw new RuntimeException("Failed to initialize device grant authorization, likely " +
                               "caused by an invalid IdP configuration");
}

Map authorizationResponse = httpResponse.body();

String deviceCode = (String) authorizationResponse.get("device_code");
String verificationUri = (String) authorizationResponse.get("verification_uri");
String userCode = (String) authorizationResponse.get("user_code");
String verificationUriComplete = (String) authorizationResponse.get("verification_uri_complete");
Duration interval = Duration.ofSeconds((int) authorizationResponse.get("interval"));
Duration expiresIn = Duration.ofSeconds((int) authorizationResponse.get("expires_in"));</code> 
 
 
 






To keep the steps minimal in this post, I’m parsing the JSON to a map, but you could create a typed object to avoid any of the above casting.



 
 
<p>Assuming all went well, the response returned from the IdP will be a JSON block (parsed into the above values) that looks like this:</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>{
  "device_code": "a-random-device-code", (1)
  "user_code": "ABCD1234", (2)
  "verification_uri": "https:/dev-l33337.okta.com/activate", (3)
  "verification_uri_complete": "https:/dev-l33337.okta.com/activate?user_code=ABCD1234", (4)
  "expires_in": 600, (5)
  "interval": 5 (6)
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
<code>device_code</code> - A secret known by the device/application, it will be used in the following steps.


2
<code>user_code</code> - Shown to the user, and ties a different browser session to this device/application.


3
<code>verification_uri</code>- URL the user needs to visit and type enter the <code>user_code</code> before logging in.


4
<code>verification_uri_complete</code> - A URL combining the <code>verification_uri</code> and <code>user_code</code> which can be shown directly to the user (if they can copy and paste) or rendered as a QR code (on a TV).


5
<code>expires_in</code> - Number of seconds the user has to finish the flow before the codes expire.


6
<code>interval</code> - Minimum frequency in seconds the application should wait while polling the server to see if the user has been authorized.


 
 
 
 
 User login via a browser 
 
<p>The end user needs to open a browser to log in, how they do that is up to your application. For the best user experience, you may want to open a browser automatically. However, that might not be possible, so always fall back to showing the URL and code.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>// check if a browser can be opened
if (!GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless() &amp;&amp; Desktop.getDesktop().isSupported(Desktop.Action.BROWSE)) {
    System.out.println("Opening browser to: " + verificationUriComplete);
    Desktop.getDesktop().browse(URI.create(verificationUriComplete));
} else {
    System.out.println("Open a browser and go to: " + verificationUri +
                       "  enter the code: "+ userCode);
}</code> 
 
 
 






The Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) is Java’s original platform-independent UI framework. If you are building a JavaFX application, you may want to avoid mixing AWT and use the <a href="https://openjfx.io/javadoc/17/javafx.graphics/javafx/application/HostServices.html#showDocument(java.lang.String)">JavaFX <code>HostServices</code></a> instead.



 
 
<p>If you are building an application for a television, you may want to render the value of <code>verificationUriComplete</code> as a QR code, so the user can scan it with a mobile device.</p>
 
 
<p>Whichever method you choose, the user will need to confirm the activation code before authenticating.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 Get an access token 
 
<p>While the user is logging in, the application will continue making requests to the IdP, checking if the user has authorized the application.</p>
 
 
<p>Using the <code>device_code</code> from the initial request, continue to poll the IdP for the authorization status until the code expires.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <code>long pollUntilMillis = System.currentTimeMillis() + expiresIn.toMillis();
while (System.currentTimeMillis() &lt; pollUntilMillis) {

    // first sleep, give the user time to log in!
    System.out.println("Sleeping for " + interval.getSeconds() + " seconds");
    Thread.sleep(interval.toMillis()); (1)

    Map&lt;String, String&gt; tokenArgs = Map.of("client_id", clientId,
            "grant_type","urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code", (2)
            "device_code", deviceCode);

    HttpRequest tokenRequest = HttpRequest.newBuilder() (3)
            .uri(URI.create(issuer + "/v1/token"))
            .POST(formBody(tokenArgs))
            .header("Accept", "application/json")
            .header("Content-Type", "application/x-www-form-urlencoded")
            .build();

    HttpResponse&lt;Map&gt; tokenResponse =
            client.send(tokenRequest, rs -&gt; parseJson(Map.class));

    if (tokenResponse.statusCode() == 200) { (4)
            // Do something with the tokens
            System.out.println("Authorization complete!");
            System.out.println(tokenResponse.body());
            break;
    } else {
            // error, keep polling until timeout
            System.out.println("Error: " + tokenResponse.body());
            System.out.println(tokenResponse);
        }
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 


1
Wait for the interval to avoid spamming the server, it’s going to take a bit for the user to log in anyway.


2
Set the <code>grant_type</code> to the URN for the device grant.


3
Make a request to <code>/v1/token</code> to check the authorization status.


4
If the response is a <code>200</code> inspect the body for an access token, otherwise continue the polling loop.


 
 
 
 
<p>If the user has not yet logged in, an error is returned with the <code>authorization_pending</code> message:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>{
  "error": "authorization_pending",
  "error_description": "The device authorization is pending. Please try again later."
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Otherwise, if the user has already logged in, a response containing an access token will be returned:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "access_token": "...",
  "scope": "openid profile offline_access",
  "id_token": "..."
}</code> 
 
 
 






This access token would be used to make application-specific REST requests on behalf of the user, typically by setting the <code>Authorization</code> header in an HTTP request. For example:



 
 
 
 <code>HttpRequest.newBuilder()
        .header("Authorization", "Bearer " + accessToken)</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Putting it all together 
 
 
<p>If you haven’t already skipped ahead to run the finished application, run it now:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jbang DeviceGrant.java</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This will open a browser and display a code. Make sure this code matches what is displayed in your terminal, and continue logging in.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Learn more about OAuth 
 
 
<p>How you authenticate and authorize a user changes based on the capabilities of your application. This post has shown how to build a command-line Java application that authenticates a user with two simple HTTP requests, while allowing them to authenticate using the device and browser of their choice.</p>

Below are brief explanations about them. Each yellow-colored arrow indicates that the standard on the terminal end makes use of the preceding one. Each gray-colored arrow indicates that the standard was updated from the previous one. Three lines indicate that the standards are pretty much equivalent.</p> Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) #7: Cryptographic Message Syntax&nbsp;(CMS) <p>This standard is the forefather of all. It describes the general syntax of data to which encryption may be applied. It also allows arbitrary attributes, such as signing time, to be authenticated along with the content of a message, and provides for other attributes such as countersignatures to be associated with a signature.</p> RFC 3161: Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol&nbsp;(TSP) <p>This is the main standard for PKI-based timestamping. It describes the format of a request sent to a TSA and of the response that is returned. It also specifies some security-related requirements for TSA operations regarding the processing of requests to generate responses.</p><p>An identifier for a timestamping certificate has to be included in each timestamp. How it is computed (ESSCertID) was previously stipulated in RFC 2634: Enhanced Security Services for S/MIME, and currently RFC 5816, which contains an ESSCertIDv2 update for RFC&nbsp;3161.</p><p>(In the EU, RFC 3161 is adopted and constrained through <a href="https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/workprogram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=39366">ETSI EN 319&nbsp;421</a>.)</p> ETSI EN 319 1X2: Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI) <p>The use of electronic signatures combined with PKI-based timestamps by means of a CMS container is standardized by RFC 5126, which is then adopted by ETSI and modified for containers in other data formats, namely PDF, XML, and recently&nbsp;JSON.</p>  CAdES (CMS Advanced Electronic Signatures) is a set of extensions to Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) signed data making it suitable for advanced electronic signatures.  PAdES (PDF Advanced Electronic Signatures) is a set of restrictions and extensions to PDF and ISO 32000–1 making it suitable for advanced electronic signatures.  XAdES (XML Advanced Electronic Signatures) is a set of extensions to XML-DSig recommendation making it suitable for advanced electronic signatures.  JAdES (JSON Advanced Electronic Signatures) is based on JSON Web Signature and contains the features already defined in the related ETSI standards for AdES (advanced electronic signature/seal) applied to other data formats including XML, PDF, and&nbsp;binary.  <p>Whether PKI-based timestamps are used, and in what way, is differentiated into profiles, from basic (no timestamps) to long-term archival (with extra data embedded for long-term verifiability).</p> RFC 4998: Evidence Record Syntax&nbsp;(ERS) <p>This standard helps with long-term verifiability of timestamps by means of linked tokens. It specifies the syntax and processing of an evidence record, a structure designed to support long-term non-repudiation of existence of data. ERS extends and generalizes this approach to all formats of data to meet the needs of long-term archiving services.</p> RFC 3628: Policy Requirements for Time-Stamping Authorities <p>Similar to CAs, TSAs should establish its policy and practice statement, declaring what requirements it meets in order to operate in a way that users can trust. This standard defines the basic time stamp policy requirements of a TSA that issues timestamp tokens backed by public key certificates with an accuracy of 1 second or&nbsp;greater.</p><p>(In the EU, the equivalent of RFC 3628 is <a href="https://portal.etsi.org/webapp/workprogram/Report_WorkItem.asp?WKI_ID=39370">ETSI EN 319&nbsp;422</a>.)</p> ISO/IEC 18014: Information technology — Security techniques — Time-stamping <p>The ISO/IEC 18014 is divided into four parts. The first two parts talks about the overall process and indepedent timestamp tokens comparable to RFC 3161. The third part is about linked tokens comparable to RFC 4998. Lastly, the fourth part talks about the traceability of time sources for the TSA and how the TAA comes to play a role in continuously monitoring TSAs.</p>  Part 1: Framework  Part 2: Mechanisms producing independent tokens  Part 3: Mechanisms producing linked&nbsp;tokens  Part 4: Traceability of time&nbsp;sources  <p>Currently, only Japan’s JIS X standards about timestamping implement ISO/IEC 18014. Japan is known for its efforts in accurate timestamping. The use of independent tokens is standardized in JIS X 5063–1, whereas time source assessment is found in JIS X 5094. Information in ISO/IEC 18014 is used in JIS X with modifications, which are in turn also adopted by ISO/IEC 18014 in later revisions.</p><p>In the EU, Parts 3 and 4 are not comparable to any ETSI standards.</p><p>There are many standards about timestamping from around the world. Common ones are as mentioned in this blog article. Some standards are applicable across many different countries, and some become models for more countries to follow. Although there are no absolute standards or rules to determine how timestamping should be done (e.g. whether it should be PKI-based), it is always better to comply your timestamp implementation of choice with some international standards.</p><p>In conclusion, there is no standalone standard. Hence, there are always connections between different sets of standards. Timestamping standards also rely on cross-interactions between different standard bodies and communities from different countries, many of which contribute to the international standards of timestamping we have nowadays.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/trusted-timestamping-part-3-family-of-standards-f0c89a5e97ab">Trusted Timestamping Part 3: Family of Standards</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/finema">Finema</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Entities involved in timestamping <p>Listed here are entities involved in the provision of timestamping services. All of them may not be present in actual implementation. It is up to each country to pick and choose what’s suitable for their assurance requirements.</p>  Timestamping Authority (TSA): a third party trusted to issue a timestamp  Time Assessment Authority (TAA): an entity which audits the ‘time’ aspect of timestamping services and may also disseminate time to the&nbsp;TSA  Timing Centre (TC): an organization with a means to disseminate the ‘UTC(k)’ time to a TSA with the required&nbsp;accuracy  Certification Body (CB): an entity which makes sure the TSA complies with standards and issues certificates as evidence of&nbsp;that  Accreditation Body (AB): an entity which designates certification bodies  Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS): a general term describing any satellite constellation that provides positioning, navigation, and timing services on a global or regional&nbsp;basis  Certificate Authority (CA): an entity which issues a certificate to attest to the TSA’s ownership of the public key associated with a PKI-based timestamp   Briefly about&nbsp;UTC(k) <p>UTC(k) is an approximation of UTC given by a time laboratory k that contributes to the precision of UTC itself, which the BIPM (the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures) maintains. The BIPM regularly publishes the difference between UTC(k) and UTC (so that a precise UTC value for any moment can be known retroactively).</p><p>What’s important here is that the role of a timing centre, if the issuance of timestamps is to comply to ISO/IEC 18014–4, can only be taken by those time laboratories in coordination with the BIPM. The list of them can be found in, for example, the <a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/time-ftp/circular-t">Circular T</a>. In case of Thailand, k is the National Institute of Metrology only.</p> Process: How timestamping works   The client computes a hash digest of the document to be timestamped and sends it as part of the request to the&nbsp;TSA.  The TSA adds a date and time to the hash digest, electronically signs* the combination, and sends back that timestamp to the requester.  After the client receives the signed timestamp, it can be recorded with/within the corresponding document, data, or&nbsp;code.  <p>(* Because an electronic signature is involved, the timestamp is PKI-based.)</p><p>The picture above showed the flow of a timestamp being requested and then processed for the client. Below is a more detailed picture of how a trusted timestamp is composed and how to verify&nbsp;one.</p>Getting a PKI-based timestamp from a trusted third&nbsp;partyChecking the correctness of a timestamp Timestamps and electronic signatures <p>For high-profile online transactions, even slight risks of data breaches are rather not overlooked. Aside from the risk that your account information might get hacked by unauthorized people over the internet, document integrity is also a major concern. Advancement in technology makes modifications to documents, photos, and videos more difficult to detect, and their authencity impossible to verify. PKI-based timestamping can elongate the verifiability of a document’s electronic signature and affirms the document’s integrity as long as the timestamp’s electronic signature remains verifiable.</p><p>Using digital signatures for both the timestamp and associated document is part of what makes Advanced Electronic Signature (AdES), specified by ETSI standards, robust. AdES not only uniquely links the signature and time of signing to the signatory, but also provides for long-term validation and archival. Users can create an ETSI-standardized container to sign AdES for PDF, XML, and documents in other formats. Other advantages of AdES are that they are accepted as legally valid and enforceable in many countries, are proven fast and efficient, and reduce the production and consumption of paper documents.</p> Safeguards: How timestamping is ensured to be trustworthy General overview of timestamping oversight<p>Above is a diagram illustrating a general overview of how to ensure that a TSA can be trusted. The solid gray-colored lines indicate that the respective parts are mandatory, while the dashed lines indicate that the respective parts are optional (with at least one route selected). The blue-colored lines are about the dissemination of time. The green-colored lines are about&nbsp;audits.</p>European Union model for timestamping oversight<p>The European Union uses the eIDAS Regulation to establish trust-service standards in each member state. The AB (typically referred to as a national accreditation body) is responsible for designating entities competent as CBs (called ‘conformity assessment bodies’ in the EU). Upon passing certifications and audits, TSAs are put in a national trust list, which is established, maintained, and published by a supervisory body (which could be the same agency as the AB or a different one). Note that the EU model is not compliant with ISO/IEC 18014–4, as there are no TAAs to continuously monitor the&nbsp;TSAs.</p><p>Below is a diagram illustrating how Italy implements the EU model for timestamping oversight.</p>Entities involved in the quality assurance of timestamping services in Italy. The list of CBs are <a href="https://www.agid.gov.it/it/piattaforme/firma-elettronica-qualificata/organismi-valutazione-accreditati">here</a>. The list of Italian organizations capable of disseminating UTC(k) can be found in <a href="https://www.bipm.org/en/time-ftp/circular-t">BIPM’s Circular&nbsp;T</a>.<p>In contrast, below is a diagram illustrating Japan’s model for timestamping oversight.</p>Japan’s model for timestamping oversight<p><a href="https://www.nict.go.jp/en">NICT</a> offers information about GPS common-view measurements and UTC. <a href="https://www.dekyo.or.jp/tb/contents/english">JADAC</a> (the name written in Japanese on the top right) is the AB which operates, maintains, and manages the overall accreditation program, while also certifies TSAs. JADAC cooperates with NICT and members from private industries, academia, and the government in overseeing the timestamping services. Like the TSAs, the TAAs are also from the private and business&nbsp;sectors.</p><p>From physical to digital, timestamping provides document security and helps keep track of the creation and modification times of a document. It acts as protection which could also be used as proof in some contexts. The difference between a timestamp and a trusted timestamp is that the latter implements a data structure called timestamp token, issued by a trusted third party acting as a&nbsp;TSA.</p><p>Now that we understand how PKI-based timestamps are issued, and how to ensure TSAs can be trusted. Let’s go into more detail as to existing standards in <a href="https://medium.com/finema/trusted-timestamping-part-3-family-of-standards-f0c89a5e97ab">Timestamping Part 3: Family of Standards</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/trusted-timestamping-part-2-process-and-safeguards-f75286a0c370">Trusted Timestamping Part 2: Process and Safeguards</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/finema">Finema</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>About Episode</p>
 
 
 
 One of the desired outcomes of using standards-driven open source code projects is to avoid vendor lock-in. If your digital identity is a public good, then you shouldn’t be locked in to one specific company. If a company goes out of business, I may lose my identity data. If I find a better alternative, I’m unable to port my identity. Therefore, interoperability is a vital aspect of being able to provide sovereignty to individuals but also to governments. 
 
 
 
<p>Some of the key questions answered during this episode with Joachim are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 
 
 
 What are the different lenses of Interoperability outside of simply technological ones? 
 
 
 What is happening inside the EU’s digital identity governance frameworks? 
 
 
 How to go about preventing vendor/network lock-ins from the wallet perspective? 
 
 
 Does ID proofing impact the ability to achieve permissionless SSI models? 
 
 
 What is exciting about the intersection of SSI and web3, and are innovations in this area moving quicker than other areas? 
 
 
 Despite the misuse of NFTs for identity-related use cases, are they still helping advance decentralized identity thinking? 
 
 
 What learnings can SSI wallet providers gain from crypto wallet providers (e.g., security, key management, UX)? 
 
 
 Will intelligent agent providers need to make their algorithms open sourced? 
 
 
 Where do portable digital identities fit within the existent and ever changing digital identity landscape (e.g., e-sign, biometrics, IAM, etc.)? 
 
 
 
 And more!

 Martedì 12 Aprile 2022 dalle ore 17:00 alle ore 18:00 – segui l’evento in streaming 



<p>È già possibile intravedere il futuro delle piattaforme di gestione dei consensi e sarà abbastanza differente rispetto a quello che ci hanno abituato a vivere le big tech, come Facebook e Google. L’alternativa è affidarsi a piattaforme disegnate per consentire l’empowerment giuridico dell’interessato, semplificando l’esercizio diretto dei diritti, attraverso una modalità di dialogo più ampia e flessibile con il titolare, che invece avrà dalla sua parte la possibilità di una gestione multi-livellare delle proprie funzioni.</p>



 Perché Yesnology 



<p>Non una semplice piattaforma di gestione dei consensi, come quelle di Facebook e Google, ma un servizio più ampio e più flessibile di interazione diretta tra interessato e titolare (dunque anche esercizio del diritto di opposizione, per esempio, o di consultazione di informative nella loro successione storica). Il punto decisivo è che si tratta di un servizio multi-titolare. L’idea, e in questo è visionaria, di YN è quella di creare uno one-stop-shop per l’interessato, che gli faciliti enormemente (anche in termini di tempo) il controllo sui suoi dati personali, rispetto cioè a più titolari. L’aspetto significativo è che non viene realizzato un trattamento accentrato, che sarebbe pericoloso, o un incrocio di dati, ma i vari titolari sono segregati tra loro.</p>



 L’evento, patrocinato da ANORC, sarà in diretta su DIGEAT PLUS

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alejandro Leal</a></p> Managing business in today's geopolitical context 
<p>In the face of a geopolitical crisis, concerns are growing about the threat of cyber-attacks to global supply chains and private organizations, which are already in a precarious state due to the Covid-19 pandemic. When a crisis occurs, business continuity and corporate resilience are essential. Both require a company-wide response. In this context, geopolitical risk assessments are integral to a secure IT environment.</p>
<p>With the advent of cyberspace, state and non-state actors have been willing to challenge the political and economic order by using both conventional and unconventional means. Through the use of unconventional methods, in particular cyber-attacks, state-sponsored actors and hacktivists can achieve relative geopolitical and economic gains without the use of force. Data breaches, espionage, sabotage, misinformation, supply-chain disruptions, and cyber-attacks are some examples of unconventional means used by attackers. If cyberspace enables a new sphere for state and non-state actors to engage, are cyber-attacks the continuation of politics with other means?</p>
 Countering politically motivated cybercrime 
<p>Politically motivated cyber-attacks, however, are not easy to detect because the emergence of a “grey zone” makes it difficult to distinguish between a non-intentional failure or a malfunction from a cyber-attack. The emergence of private actors in cyberspace further complicates this issue because it is unclear if an attack on a private entity constitutes an attack against a state. If a mechanical failure or denial or service occurs during a period of geopolitical tension, the possibility of escalation and conflict could arise.</p>
<p>In addition, politically motivated hacktivists may pose a threat to corporate reputation by using social media to harm an organization and spread misinformation. Because of hacktivists' high visibility, organizations must increase their efforts in crisis communication and internal response. Although hacktivists do not have the same level of sophistication as nation-states, they are usually less concerned about hiding their online tracks and tend to be much more vocal.</p>
 A Shared Responsibility: Public/Private partnership in cyberspace 
<p>Given the current geopolitical climate, every organization must act with extreme urgency to secure its information technology infrastructures. As rogue nations continue to foster an environment for cybercriminals and ransomware attackers to thrive, organizations need to be prepared and build a strong security foundation while encouraging public-private sector cooperation regarding cyber threats.</p>
<p>To improve cybersecurity in key industries and critical infrastructure, organizations in the private sector need to be prepared for an unprecedented level of malicious cyber activities and work together with the public sector to protect critical assets. As we clearly saw in the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/understanding_solarwinds">SolarWind case</a>, a breach can result in a national security crisis regardless of how small the company is.</p>

			<p>Asset tokenization is the process to dematerialize financial instruments on blockchain, and many institutions have already taken actions: <a href="https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2021-141-european-investment-bank-eib-issues-its-first-ever-digital-bond-on-a-public-blockchain">The European Investment Bank</a> and <a href="https://www.societegenerale.com/en/news/press-release/first-structured-product-public-blockchain">Société Générale</a> have tokenized 100 million euro bonds respectively in 2021; <a href="https://www.swift.com/news-events/news/exploring-tokenised-assets-collaborative-innovation-action">SWIFT</a> announced plans to explore tokenized assets this year. HSBC predicted that the market <a href="https://www.gbm.hsbc.com/-/media/gbm/insights/attachments/potential-of-tokenisation.pdf">could reach 24 trillion USD by 2027</a>. Not long ago, <a href="https://www.ashurst.com/en/news-and-insights/legal-updates/the-luxembourg-stock-exchanges-admits-distributed-ledger-financial-instruments-on-its-sol">Luxembourg Stock Exchange</a> admitted security tokens listing.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the institutional adoption of tokenized securities has begun. Decision-makers must act quickly to avoid losing market share. Suitable and secure tokenization platforms will be the catalyst for further growth of the adoption, as both compliance and security come down to coding on the blockchain.</p>
 Huge potential to save costs and improve liquidity 
<p>Traditional capital markets are underpinned by many fragmented and siloed networks with barely any interoperability between them. This leads to an industry that is slow, inaccurate, and costly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the past few years, most financial institutions have studied how tokenization can change this by using shared and distributed ledgers to create a fully digitized experience for investors, reduce compliance and administrative costs for themselves, and improve the liquidity of assets.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rolandberger.com/en/Insights/Publications/Tokenization-The-future-of-financial-markets.html">Roland Berger’s study</a> projects that tokenized equity could reduce €4.6 billion on the trading costs by 2030. It accounted for only one asset class, when all other asset classes are taken into account, the cost savings will be much higher.</p>
 The technology gap needs to be bridged 
<p>While financial professionals have a greater understanding of blockchain technology and its benefits, one question remains: how can they technically tokenize new or already existing securities and still comply with regulations?</p>
<p>As compliance rules are encoded into security tokens, eventually, it becomes a technical matter. Institutions can choose to build their own tokenization platforms, which will take years to develop; or decide instead to find a technology partner, who provides a complete infrastructure with user-friendly interfaces designed for non-blockchain users. The latter option may be preferable since institutions can benefit from the protection of the technical shields provided by experts, freeing financial actors to focus on what they do best: provide high-quality assets and services to investors.</p>
<p>Regardless of their choices, it is essential to ensure compliance rules are well written into security tokens and enforced throughout the lifecycle of asset-backed tokens, as securities regulatory rules must be followed. This can only be achieved by issuing assets as permissioned tokens to set rules and linking them to the digital identities of asset owners.</p>
 Code compliance rules through permissioned tokens&nbsp; 
<p>Permissioned tokens act as automated compliance validators, transactions can only be triggered when pre-written eligibility conditions are met. For example, <a href="https://tokeny.com/erc3643">ERC-3643</a>, an official smart contract standard for permissioned tokens, allows issuers to encode investor rules and offering rules into tokens. This assures that token transfers only occur when all conditions have been satisfied in both the primary market and the secondary market.</p>

		 
	 
      
	 
		 
			 Guarantee ownership of tokenized assets with digital identities&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>While all the rules are well encoded into the permissioned tokens, the key to ensuring compliance is the digital representation of identity on the blockchain. There are many solutions in the market that whitelist wallets for compliance checks. However, a wallet is like a browser for blockchain, whoever knows the private key can access it, so who owns the assets in a wallet?</p>
<p>Furthermore, identifying wallet owners is a regulatory obligation for issuers, therefore, linking security tokens to holders’ identities is the solution to this legal requirement. An onchain identity is like a blockchain account for investors, and they can connect as many wallets as they want to it.</p>
 Complexity beyond using standard smart contracts 
<p>When an issuer creates a simple ERC-20 token, the smart contract is the key element because there is no lifecycle management per se. We can see some features, such as “burn in your own wallet” features used by Binance, or “address blacklisting” features in Tether, but that is mostly it.</p>
<p>However, when an issuer represents a financial instrument on the blockchain, all securities rules need to be followed to ensure compliance, requiring the issuer to be able to manage asset-based tokens at any time. Managing complex smart contracts functions, one-by-one or in batch, with blockchain addresses can quickly become a nightmare for users. Errors will keep popping up and the learning curve will be very difficult for the operational teams. Software, which scans the blockchain in real time, reconciles blockchain and investors’ data, and helps to prepare complex blockchain-based operations via user-friendly interfaces, is mandatory to truly benefit from this shared infrastructure.</p>
<p>Here are some highlighted functions a complete tokenization platform should provide:</p>
 
 Smart contract management: There are hundreds of functions in permissioned token smart contracts, the platform needs to ensure every action triggered by issuers in the system by simply clicking buttons or filling in human-readable information translates well into code and executes on the blockchain. 
 Useful data aggregation: The system needs to aggregate relevant data from blockchain to present them in an insightful format (e.g. real-time cap tables) for both issuers and investors. 
 Security: Security of the system is critical, but most importantly, extra security measures such as multi-sign or custody solutions should be integrated as the owner of smart contracts has full control over permissioned tokens. 
 Recoverability: Issuers have obligations to return tokenized assets to their owner in the event of wallet loss, a recovery process must be provided. 
 Permission delegation: Issuers need to delegate specific permissions to their trusted agents to improve efficiency or comply with regulations, therefore, a permissioned system is needed. (e.g., grant token recovery function to a custodian). 
 Confidentiality: As required by law (e.g., GDPR), investors’ privacy needs to be protected while compliance is enforced. 
 Cost and speed of transactions: The system must provide solutions to solve the gas fee issue to ensure low-cost and high-speed transfers of tokenized securities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
 
 Cross-chain capability: As asset tokenization is becoming popular, the interoperability of tokenized assets needs to be provided to make sure assets are not locked in one single blockchain forever, paving the way for further improvements of asset liquidity. 
 …<br>
 
 
 Leave technical complexity to the expert and thrive in prosperity 
<p>The function list goes on, resulting in many technical obstacles. The speed of adoption, therefore, relies on the development of resilient and secure solutions that can provide all functions required while ensuring compliance. Fortunately, after years of development, mature technology platforms have emerged and are used by many asset issuers, such as <a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/">T-REX Platform</a>.</p>
<p>To stay competitive, institutions that want to modernize their assets using blockchain technology should work with existing reputational technology providers to quickly and securely provide cheaper, faster, and better financial services through tokenization to their existing and new clients, gaining a larger market share.</p>

 New innovations create new opportunities to make a&nbsp;profit <p>Exciting times — Ocean V4 is here and it’s bringing a whole host of new possibilities. We’re absolutely delighted to deliver this huge upgrade — we hope you’re as excited as we are! Now if you’re wondering about how you can profit from some of these innovations — you’re in the right place — in this article we will be looking at how the community can monetize various parts of the recent V4 developments.</p><p>Let’s face it, new innovative ways of making money is one of the most impressive things about all the advances in blockchain technology over recent years. You’ll be pleased to hear that Ocean V4 is no different — we’re delivering even more ways for you to monetise your&nbsp;data!</p> What’s New? <p>Broadly speaking, there are already three ways to generate income with&nbsp;Ocean:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/477b3decad51#bb75">Publishing &amp; Selling&nbsp;Data</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/477b3decad51#fe64">Providing Liquidity For Datatoken Pools</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/477b3decad51#692b">Running Your Own Data Marketplace</a>  <p>Each of these has received an upgrade in V4 for more revenue upside, and more flexibility in setting&nbsp;fees.</p><p>In addition, we have introduced a fourth way to make money with&nbsp;Ocean:</p><p>4. <a href="https://medium.com/p/477b3decad51#7922">Running Your Own&nbsp;Provider</a></p><p>In this article, we will briefly cover (1) and (2), then go into more detail on (3) and (4) as the fee structure has seen a big shake-up. Finally, we take a look at how the wider Ocean community benefits from all of&nbsp;this.</p><p>If you would like to know more details about the fees, we recommend reading the Ocean Developer documentation that lists the detailed fee schedule, <a href="http://documentation%20link">here</a>.</p> Publishing &amp; Selling&nbsp;Data <p>As always, the first question to ask when you’re thinking about making money through Ocean is — do you have data that you can monetise?</p><p>Ocean V3 introduced the new crypto primitives of “data on-ramp” and “data off-ramp” via datatokens. The publisher creates ERC20 datatokens for a dataset (on-ramp). Then, anyone can access that dataset by acquiring and sending datatokens to the publisher via Ocean handshaking (data off-ramp). Being useful assets, datatokens typically get priced via pools. As a publisher, it’s in your best interest to create and publish useful data — datasets that people want to consume — because the more they consume the more you can earn. This is the heart of Ocean utility: connecting data publishers with data consumers.</p><p>The datasets can take one of many shapes. For AI use cases, they may be raw datasets, cleaned-up datasets, feature-engineered data, AI models, AI model predictions, or otherwise. (They can even be other forms of copyright-style IP such as photos, videos, or music!) Algorithms themselves may be sold as part of Ocean’s Compute-to-Data feature.</p><p>Ocean V4 introduces data NFTs, which open up new opportunities. To get started, we recommend reading our article on d<a href="https://medium.com/p/5804a2d88671">ata NFTs</a> and all of the possibilities that they&nbsp;bring.</p><p>The first opportunity of data NFTs is the potential to sell the base intellectual property (IP) as an exclusive license to others. This is akin to EMI selling the Beatles’ master tapes to Universal Music: whoever owns the masters has the right to create records, CDs, and digital sub-licences. It’s the same for data: as the data NFT owner you have the exclusive right to create ERC20 datatoken sub-licenses. With Ocean V4, this right is now transferable as a data NFT. You can sell these data NFTs in OpenSea and other NFT marketplaces.</p><p>Data NFTs also open up new approaches for fractional ownership of your data asset’s base IP. Fractional ownership means that you can now sell “shards” of your data IP to investors or collaborators. This is especially suited to data DAOs (data unions,&nbsp;etc).</p><p>If you’re part of an established organization or a growing startup, you’ll also love the new role structure that comes with data NFTs. For example, you can specify a different address to collect revenue compared to the address that owns the NFT. It’s now possible to fully administer your project through these&nbsp;roles.</p><p>In short, if you have data to sell, then Ocean V4 gives you superpowers to scale up and manage your data project. We hope this enables you to bring your data to new audiences and increase your&nbsp;profits.</p> Providing Liquidity for Datatoken Pools <p>The second well-established way to profit from Ocean is by providing liquidity to datatoken pools (datapools). We introduced datapools as part of the dynamic pricing feature within Ocean V3. In providing liquidity, you get a cut of the swap fees for that pool. The more swaps there are and the more liquidity you’ve provided, the more fees you earn. You can try to predict which datasets will have the most trades via your own assessment of the dataset’s quality, and allocate your liquidity accordingly.</p><p>Pools were an instant hit, but we quickly realized there was room for improvement. One of the issues we noticed was how the pools were very susceptible to rug-pull attacks, which is obviously very concerning to anyone trying to make a&nbsp;profit.</p><p>Ocean V4 introduces one-sided staking to solve the issue of rug pulls from the Publisher (or any other whale in the pool). We’ve created a one-sided bot that matches your incoming OCEAN stake by minting datatokens into the pool. Similarly, when you un-stake OCEAN, it burns datatokens. Therefore, the ratio of basetokens (e.g. Ocean tokens) to datatokens is kept constant during staking or unstaking. It sounds like a simple solution but it works really well. The possibility of a rug-pull from a whale is completely removed.</p><p>We’re really proud of how we’ve managed to make staking in pools so much safer. If you’re interested in learning more about how it all works, we recommend reading our recent blog post on<a href="http://AddLink"> safer&nbsp;staking</a>.</p> Running Your Own Data Marketplace. <p>Next up is the big one — all the new fees that can be implemented when you run your own marketplace. We have always been super encouraging of anyone who wishes to fork Ocean Market and make their own data marketplace. With the latest V4 release, we have taken this to the next level and introduced more opportunities for upside, and even more fee customisation options.</p><p>Upside opportunity: The main new upside opportunity is, unlike in Ocean V3, the marketplace owner can take a cut of swaps (in addition to a cut of consume). V3 showed 10x-100x or more swap volume than consume volume, so this could lead to a significant revenue bump for V4-powered marketplaces.</p><p>Another new upside opportunity is using your own ERC20 token in your marketplace, where it’s used as the unit-of-exchange and for staking in the datatoken pools. This is fully supported and can be a great way to ensure the sustainability of your&nbsp;project.</p><p>Fee customization options: In V4, the marketplace fees are now far more flexible and you have more options at your disposal. The fees can be split up based on the action within the marketplace that generates the fee: consuming, swapping, and publishing. Let’s explore each of&nbsp;them!</p> Consume Fees <p>Whenever anyone consumes an asset on any Ocean market it will generate fees. In Ocean V4 we have also opened up the possibility that you can make money from assets sold on another market if it was published on yours. The following fees apply to the consumption of data&nbsp;assets:</p><p>Consume Market Consumption Fee: This is simple enough — whenever someone buys a data asset they pay a fee to the marketplace where they consume the asset. The fee is set as an absolute value, so it will be the same for every purchase. This fee already existed in Ocean V3 but now we’re giving you complete flexibility to set your fees at any level and in the currency you prefer to receive them&nbsp;in.</p><p>Publisher Market Consumption Fee: This is a new way of making money from any asset published on your marketplace. No matter where the asset is consumed — via another marketplace or even directly via the smart contracts and ocean libraries — you will always receive this fee. This is pretty cool but to make it even better, you get to choose which token the fee is paid in. So if you’re if you want to receive your fees in USDC, consumers will have to send USDC to you even if they’re consuming the asset in a market that doesn’t use USDC. This fee is set as an absolute&nbsp;value.</p><p>Provider Consumption Fees: This is another new one for Ocean V4. On any consumption, a fee will now have to be paid to the provider that the asset is using to encrypt the&nbsp;URL.</p><p>Ocean Community: As before, we also have an Ocean community fee in place. This is here to fund projects that promote the long term growth of Ocean. For the moment, the fee has been set to zero but it can be increased in&nbsp;future.</p> Swap Fees <p>Swap fees are collected whenever someone swaps a datatoken for basetoken (e.g. OCEAN) or basetoken for datatoken. The swap could be inside a pool (using an automated market maker), or in a fixed-rate exchange. As with consume fees, swap fees can be charged by both the marketplace where the swap takes place and the marketplace where the asset was originally published. These are the fees that are applied whenever a user does a&nbsp;swap:</p><p>Publisher Market swap fee: The owner of the marketplace will define both the fee amount and the address where the fees should be sent. These fees can be applied to assets with dynamic pricing (sold via a pool) and assets with fixed pricing. For assets sold via a pool, the fee amount is set when the pool is created and cannot be changed later, while for fixed priced assets the fee amount can be changed. In both cases, you can update and change the address where the fees are sent at any&nbsp;point.</p><p>Consumer Market swap fee: The owner of the marketplace where the swap is taking place can define a swap fee for any swap that happens inside a pool. It is different, however, for swaps of fixed-priced assets — in this case, only assets that are using the Enterprise ERC20 template can apply swap fees in the consumer market. There are no consumer market swap fees for Datatokens that use the standard template. The Enterprise ERC20 token template isn’t only for use in enterprise marketplaces, it is also used within Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p><p>Liquidity Provider Fees: As with V3, we also have a fee that is shared among the liquidity providers. This revenue stream acts as an incentive for liquidity providers to join the pool and add liquidity. This fee is set by the pool creator when they create the pricing for the asset, the default fee is 0.1%. The pool creator may wish to increase this fee to incentivise more people to provide liquidity to the pool. The amount of liquidity in the pool is a useful indication of which assets the community considers to be the most valuable.</p><p>Ocean Community Fee: There is also a community fee applied to swaps. These fees are reinvested in community projects via Ocean DAO and other initiatives. It’s always important to consider how we ensure the long term sustainability of Ocean — funding community projects is one way for us to achieve that. This fee has been set to 0.1% (as long as either Ocean or H20 are used as the base token in the market), however, if you are using any other token as your base token (e.g. Ether or any other ERC20 etc) then a community fee of 0.2% is applied to all&nbsp;swaps.</p> Publish Fees <p>For the moment no fees are charged to a publisher when they publish an asset, so that’s nice and simple. However, we have left the potential for you to implement publisher fees in your own marketplace if you wish — you would have to add an extra transaction in the publish&nbsp;flow.</p><p>In many ways, it is better to leave publisher fees at zero to encourage as many people as possible to publish in your market. However, we recognise that every marketplace serves a completely different audience and publisher fees may be appropriate in your&nbsp;case.</p> Run Your Own&nbsp;Provider <p>Now this is a completely brand new opportunity to start generating revenue — running your own <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/provider">provider</a>. We have been aware for a while now that many of you haven’t taken up the opportunity to run your own provider, and the reason seems obvious — there aren’t strong enough incentives to do&nbsp;so.</p><p>For those that aren’t aware, Ocean Provider is the proxy service that’s responsible for encrypting/ decrypting the data and streaming it to the consumer. It also validates if the user is allowed to access a particular data asset or service. It’s a crucial component in Ocean’s architecture.</p><p>Now, as mentioned above, fees are now paid to the individual or organization running the provider whenever a user downloads a data asset. The fees for downloading an asset are set as a cost per MB. In addition, there is also a provider fee which is paid whenever a compute job is run, which is set as a price per&nbsp;minute.</p><p>The download and compute fees can both be set to any absolute amount and you can also decide which token you want to receive the fees in — they don’t have to be in the same currency used in the consuming market. So for example, the provider fee could be a fixed rate of 5 USDT per 1000 mb of data downloaded, and this fee remains fixed in USDT even if the marketplace is using a completely different currency. It also doesn’t matter if the pricing of the asset is fixed-rate, set dynamically, or free — the provider fee will still&nbsp;apply.</p><p>Additionally, provider fees are not limited to data consumption and swaps — they can also be used to charge for compute resources. So, for example, this means a provider can charge a fixed fee of 15 DAI to reserve compute resources for 1 hour. This has a huge upside for both the user and the provider host. From the user’s perspective, this means that they can now reserve the suitable amount of compute resources according to what they require. For the host of the provider, this presents another great opportunity to create an&nbsp;income.</p> Benefits to the Ocean Community <p>We’re always looking to give back to the Ocean community and collecting fees is an important part of that. As mentioned above, the Ocean Protocol Foundation retains the ability to implement community fees on both data consumption and datatoken swaps. The tokens that we receive will either be burned or invested in the community via projects that they are building. These investments will take place either through Ocean DAO, Ocean Shipyard, or Ocean Ventures.</p><p>Additionally, we will also be placing an additional 0.1% fee on projects that aren’t using either the Ocean token or H2O. We want to support marketplaces that use other tokens but we also recognise that they don’t bring the same wider benefit to the Ocean community, so we feel this small additional fee is proportionate. This fee is set at the contract level so you can be sure that it won’t increase in future. It will apply to any pool and the fee is taken in the basetoken of the&nbsp;pool.</p> Profitable &amp; Self-Sufficient Projects <p>Our intentions with all of these updates are to ensure that your project is able to become self-sufficient and profitable in the long run (if that’s your aim). We love projects that are built on top of Ocean and we want to ensure that you are able to generate enough income to keep your project running well into the&nbsp;future.</p><p>With this in mind, we have aimed to deliver improvements for you irrespective of the type of project you are&nbsp;running:</p>  If you’re selling data you can benefit from Data NFTs. This means you can sell your IP (or part of it) and benefit from all the new roles when managing your project with&nbsp;others.  If you’re contributing liquidity to datapools, you will benefit from the new and much improved safer staking. No more stress about rug-pulls!  If you’re running your own data marketplace you now have so many more options on how to raise revenue and charge your customers. And the fees can still apply if the asset is bought in a marketplace other than your&nbsp;own!  For the first time, you can now also create profit for yourself by running your own provider. This also means that you can charge for compute resources  <p>We also recommend reading about <a href="https://medium.com/p/5804a2d88671/">what data NFTs are and the benefits they bring</a> and all the details on our new <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v4-one-sided-staking-93988f65e378">safer staking in&nbsp;pools</a>.</p><p>As always, if you’ve got any questions or want to give us feedback, don’t hesitate to head over to <a href="https://discord.gg/TnXjkR5">discord</a> or <a href="https://t.me/OceanProtocol_Community">Telegram</a>.

 What is a Foreign Function Interface? 

<p>A foreign function interface is the ability to call functions or routines written in one programming language from another programming language. This is generally used to access native functions or programs on the host OS written in low-level languages like C. Most languages provide some form of this feature out of the box. The term originated from common LISP, but it’s known by different names in different languages. Most languages use the C/C++ calling conventions for FFI and natively support calling C/C++ functions.</p>

 Why is Foreign Function Interface needed? 

<p>Most of the use cases for FFI are around interacting with legacy apps and accessing host OS features or native libraries. But the recent surge in machine learning and advanced arithmetics make FFI even more necessary. These days we use foreign functions for an array of use cases, some of which are:</p>

 
   Interacting with legacy apps 
   Accessing features not available in the language 
   Using native libraries 
   Accessing functions or programs on the host OS 
   Multi-precision arithmetic, Matrix multiplications 
   GPU and CPU offloading (Cuda, OpenCL, OpenGL, Vulcan, DirectX, and so on) 
   Deep learning (Tensorflow, cuDNN, Blas, and so on) 
   OpenSSL, V8, and many more 
 

 A brief history of FFI in Java 

<p>Before we dwell on the current state of FFI in Java, let’s look at a brief history of FFI in Java.</p>

 Java Native Interface (JNI) 

<p>For a long time, the standard for FFI in Java has been Java Native Interface (JNI), and it is notorious for being slow and insecure. If you are used to other languages like Rust, Go, or Python, you probably know how easy and intuitive it is to use FFI in them and that leaves something to be desired in Java. Even to do a small native call using JNI, you have to do a considerable amount of work, and it could still go wrong and end up being a security issue for the app.</p>

<p>The main issues with JNI are its complexity to use and the need to write C bridge code manually. These issues can lead to unsafe code and security risks. This can also cause performance overhead in some situations.
The performance and memory safety of the JNI code depends on the developer, and hence reliability will vary.</p>

<p>Pros</p>

 
   Native interface access for C/C++/Assembly 
   Fastest solution in Java 
 

<p>Cons</p>

 
   Complicated to use and brittle 
   Not very secure and could cause memory safety issues 
   Overhead and performance loss is possible 
   Difficult to debug 
   Depends on Java developers to write safe C binding code manually 
   You need to compile and ship the C code for each target platform 
 

 Java Native Access (JNA) 

<p>The complexity of JNI has given rise to some community-driven libraries that make it simpler to do FFI in Java. <a href="https://github.com/java-native-access/jna">Java Native Access (JNA)</a> is one of them. It’s built on top of JNI and at least makes FFI easier to use, especially as it removes the need to write any C binding code manually and reduces the chances of memory safety issues. Still, it has some of the disadvantages of being JNI-based and is slightly slower than JNI in many cases. However, JNA is widely used and battle-tested, so definitely a better option than using JNI directly.</p>

<p>Pros</p>

 
   Native interface access for C/C++/Assembly 
   Simpler to use compared to JNI 
   Dynamic binding, no need to write any C binding code manually 
   Widely used and mature library 
   Better cross-platform support 
 

<p>Cons</p>

 
   Uses reflection 
   Built on top of JNI 
   Has performance overhead and can be slower than JNI 
   Difficult to debug 
 

 Java Native Runtime (JNR) 

<p>Another popular option is <a href="https://github.com/jnr/jnr-ffi">Java Native Runtime (JNR)</a>. Though not as widely used or mature as JNA, it’s much more modern and has better performance than JNA for most use cases. However, there are some cases where JNA might perform better.</p>

<p>Pros</p>

 
   Native interface access for C/C++/Assembly 
   Easy to use 
   Dynamic binding, no need to write any C binding code manually 
   Modern API 
   Comparable performance to JNI 
   Better cross-platform support 
 

<p>Cons</p>

 
   Built on top of JNI 
   Difficult to debug 
 

 Enter Project Panama 

<p>Project Panama is the latest Java project aiming to simplify and improve FFI in Java, and as part of this, many proposals are currently being incubated. Let’s take a look at some of the active proposals and how they will work, and let’s see if we finally get proper native FFI in Java.</p>

 Foreign-Memory Access API 

<p>The first piece of the puzzle is the foreign-memory access API. It was first incubated in JDK 14, and after three incubations, a new <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/412">JEP</a> combined it into the Foreign Function &amp; Memory API.</p>

 
   API to safely and efficiently access foreign memory outside of the Java heap
     
       Consistent API for different types of memory 
       Does not compromise JVM memory safety 
       Explicit memory deallocation 
       Interacts with different memory resources, including off-heap or native memory 
     
   
   <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/370">JEP-370</a> - First incubator in JDK 14 
   <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/383">JEP-383</a> - Second incubator in JDK 15 
   <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/393">JEP-393</a> - Third incubator in JDK 16 
 

 Foreign Linker API 

<p>Another essential part that makes FFI possible is Foreign Linker API. This was first incubated in JDK 16 and was combined into Foreign Function &amp; Memory API in the next revision.</p>

 
   API for statically-typed, pure-Java access to native code
     
       Focuses on ease of use, flexibility, and performance 
       Initial support for C interop 
       Calls native code in a <code>.dll</code>, <code>.so</code>, or <code>.dylib</code> 
       Creates a native function pointer to a Java method that can be passed to code in a native library 
     
   
   <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/389">JEP-389</a> - First incubator in JDK 16 
 

 Vector API 

<p>Next is the vector API, which is crucial for FFI, especially in machine learning and advanced computations.</p>

 
   API for reliable and performant vector computations
     
       Platform agnostic 
       Clear and concise API 
       Reliable runtime compilation and performance 
       Graceful degradations 
     
   
   <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/338">JEP-338</a> - First incubator in JDK 16 
   <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/414">JEP-414</a> - Second incubator in JDK 17 
   <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/417">JEP-417</a> - Third incubator in JDK 18 
 

 Foreign Function &amp; Memory API 

<p>Finally, the Foreign Linker API &amp; Foreign-Memory Access API has evolved together to become the Foreign Function &amp; Memory API. It was first incubated in JDK 17.</p>

 
   Evolution of the Foreign-Memory Access API and the Foreign Linker API
     
       Same goals and features as the original two (ease of use, safety, performance, generality) 
     
   
   <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/412">JEP-412</a> - First incubator in JDK 17 
   <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/419">JEP-419</a> - Second incubator in JDK 18 
   <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/424">JEP-424</a> - First preview expected in JDK 19 
 

 jextract 

<p>And finally, there is the fantastic jextract tool. While it’s not an API or part of the JDK itself, it is an essential tool for Project Panama.</p>

 
   A simple command-line tool 
   Generates a Java API from one or more native C headers 
   Ships with OpenJDK Panama builds at the moment and will be part of the JDK in the future 
   Makes working with large C headers a cakewalk 
 

<p>For example, to generate a Java API for OpenGL with jextract, you could simply run the following on a Unix like OS:</p>

   <code>jextract --source -t org.opengl -I /usr/include /usr/include/GL/glut.h
</code>   

 JNI vs. Panama 

<p>Since JNI is the current standard and Panama aims to replace that, it makes sense to compare the two. Let’s take a simple example of calling the <code>getpid</code> function from the standard C <code>unistd</code> header.</p>

 JNI 

<p></p>

<p>As you can see here, there are precisely six steps to make this simple native call using JNI. You start by writing a Java class that declares the native method. Then you use <code>javac</code> to generate a header file and a C class for this. These are the native bindings. Next, you will implement the C class. Remember, these are Java developers writing C code. This means you must write memory-safe C code, which has access to the entire JVM via the <code>JNIEnv</code> variable passed to the C class.  In many scenarios, the developer may not have much experience in C. So that will be fun… or more like a security nightmare. Next, you will compile the C code into a platform-specific dynamic library and determine where to place that binary. Pray, if you must, that all this works without exposing the app to a security vulnerability. Then, you will load this into the Java class and compile and run the class, and hopefully, it works.</p>

<p>Ooof! This was just a simple <code>getpid</code> call; imagine writing something like an OpenGL interface or GPU offloading program using JNI.</p>

 Panama 

<p></p>

<p>Using the new Panama APIs, you can do the same thing in two different ways, either by manually looking up and loading the native function or using the jextract tool.</p>

<p>In the first case, you just write some Java code using CLinker API. You look up the native method and invoke it; it’s as simple as that. You can also do more complex stuff like working with native memory, etc. With this approach, you are using the Foreign Linker API and Foreign Memory API directly to do native calls and manage native memory. This is not the most efficient way, as this requires you to write a lot of boilerplate code and is not very scalable when working with large C headers.</p>

<p>The second option is to use jextract. With jextract, the entire process above can be turned into one line of code. With jextract you get a pure Java API for the native program, and you won’t have to write any native code or touch any header files. jextract generates everything using the Foreign Linker and Foreign Memory API. Isn’t that awesome! This is the kind of FFI experience you get in languages like Go and Rust.</p>

<p>For simple native calls, you can use the first approach, but for complex ones, the second approach is much better and scalable.</p>

 Benchmark 

<p>Let’s run some <a href="https://github.com/openjdk/jmh">Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH)</a> benchmarks to compare the performance of JNI and Panama API. We will use the <code>getpid</code> function from the standard C <code>unistd</code> header for the comparison. We will call the API using JNI and Panama APIs and compare the performance. I’m running the benchmark on Linux with OpenJDK 19 early access build for Panama (<code>openjdk 19-panama 2022-09-20</code>).</p>

<p>Here is the code for JNI, which uses the prebuilt <a href="https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp">JavaCPP</a> library to call the <code>getpid</code> function. We don’t have to write all the manual C binding code and rituals as the JavaCPP library already does it.</p>

   <code>@Benchmark
public int JNILinux() {
    return org.bytedeco.javacpp.linux.getpid();
}


@Benchmark
public int JNIMac() {
    return org.bytedeco.javacpp.macosx.getpid();
}
</code>   

<p>Here is the code for Panama, which uses the Foreign Linker API to call the <code>getpid</code> function manually.</p>

   <code>// get System linker
private static final CLinker linker = CLinker.systemCLinker();
// predefine symbols and method handle info
private static final NativeSymbol nativeSymbol = linker.lookup("getpid").get();
private static final MethodHandle getPidMH = linker.downcallHandle(
        nativeSymbol,
        FunctionDescriptor.of(ValueLayout.OfInt.JAVA_INT));

@Benchmark
public int panamaDowncall() throws Throwable {
    return (int) getPidMH.invokeExact();
}
</code>   

<p>With jextract, you can further simplify it by generating a Java API for the header file with the below command:</p>

   <code># Linux
export C_INCLUDE=/usr/include
# macOS
export C_INCLUDE=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/usr/include

jextract --source -d generated/src/main/java -t org.unix -I $C_INCLUDE $C_INCLUDE/unistd.h
</code>   

<p>And here is the code for calling the API generated by jextract:</p>

   <code>@Benchmark
public int panamaJExtract() {
    return org.unix.unistd_h.getpid();
}
</code>   

<p>This is a sample result.</p>

   <code>Benchmark                    Mode  Cnt   Score   Error  Units
FFIBenchmark.JNI             avgt   40  50.221 ± 0.512  ns/op
FFIBenchmark.panamaDowncall  avgt   40  49.382 ± 0.701  ns/op
FFIBenchmark.panamaJExtract  avgt   40  49.946 ± 0.721  ns/op
</code>   

<p>It seems like using Panama API is slightly faster than JNI, which is at the incubator stage, so I’m expecting this to become better when stable.</p>

<p>If you would like to run the benchmarks yourself, follow the instructions in the readme file on <a href="https://github.com/deepu105/Java-FFI-benchmarks">the source repository</a></p>

 So, are we there yet? 

<p>The current state of Project Panama, as of JDK 18, is as follows.</p>

 
   Still incubating 
   Can already work with languages that have C interop like C/C++, Fortran, Rust, etc. 
   Performance on par or better than JNI. Hopefully, this will be improved further. 
   jextract makes it really easy to use native libs. 
   Memory safe and less brittle than JNI 
   Native/off-heap memory access 
   Documentation needs huge improvement. It’s an incubator feature, so expect this to improve.

<p>UK positions itself to become the Web3 leader for the world’s digital&nbsp;commerce</p>Image a composition of photos by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@johnangelnyc?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">John Angel</a> and <a href="https://unsplash.com/@rsture?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Reinaldo Sture</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/uk-flag?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a><p>Several weeks ago, the second most senior judge in England and Wales, Master of the Rolls Sir Geoffrey Vos, made one of the most bullish speeches on the <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/announcements/the-chancellor-of-the-high-court-sir-geoffrey-vos-launches-legal-statement-on-the-status-of-cryptoassets-and-smart-contracts/">inevitability of blockchain as a tool of global commerce and the necessity for the UK</a> (and more specifically England and Wales) to become the jurisdiction of choice in this bold new future. And on Monday 4 April, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury John Glen MP, standing in for the Chancellor, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/keynote-speech-by-john-glen-economic-secretary-to-the-treasury-at-the-innovate-finance-global-summit">announced a raft of measures</a> that many anticipate will make Britain a global fintech Web3 and blockchain leader.</p><p>The pioneer of much of this work is the UK Jurisdiction Taskforce (UKJT), which was convened under the watchful eye of Sir Geoffrey and is supported in its work by <a href="https://technation.io/lawtechukpanel/">Lawtech UK</a>. Last year, it published the new <a href="https://35z8e83m1ih83drye280o9d1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Lawtech_DDRR_Final.pdf">Digital Dispute Resolution Rules (DDRR)</a> which are an invaluable legislative tool for companies and individuals engaging in Web3 trade. They create a clear, transparent and relevant framework for dealing with disputes with regard to digitally represented assets (including <a href="https://resources.lawtechuk.io/files/digital_representation_ownership_physical_assets.pdf">physical assets represented by digital receipts</a> such as&nbsp;NFTs).</p><p>Mattereum was delighted to see the new Rules published: in our view, they go a long way toward enabling vital global commerce in the Web3 setting. In terms of improving fairness and equity, they level the playing field by ensuring affordable access to justice for smaller players including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and more specialised companies in the circular economy space. Lawtech UK’s conference on <a href="https://lawtechuk.io/programmes/smarter-contracts">smart contracts</a> featured keynote speeches by <a href="https://twitter.com/lawtech_uk/status/1501148236802895874?s=21&amp;t=DtlycCMUnk9ehNFBDOEhsQ">Sir Geoffrey</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/technation/status/1499344827804180482?s=21&amp;t=DtlycCMUnk9ehNFBDOEhsQ">industry leaders</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=91&amp;v=kC7ZpltDwHU&amp;feature=emb_logo">a presentation by Vinay&nbsp;Gupta</a>.</p><p>Mattereum is one of the most mature companies in the Web3&nbsp;space.</p><blockquote>Since 2017, Mattereum has been at the cutting edge of technical and legal innovation concerned with the impact of Web3 technologies on national and international trade in physical&nbsp;goods.</blockquote><p>In 2021, Mattereum was the first company to incorporate the UKJT’s <a href="https://resources.lawtechuk.io/files/report_smarter_contracts.pdf">new Digital Dispute Resolution Rules into our smart contracts</a> [1], because we believe that Mattereum’s customers ought to benefit from the most advanced legal instruments in the world when it comes to ensuring that their commercial interests are protected.</p><p>This is important to us because we know that the rule of law and access to justice should not be reserved for the largest companies or the wealthiest individuals. The right to effective remedy enshrined in international treaties should be accessible to everyone and it is the responsible thing to ensure that this is true for our customers. For example, a smallholder producing coffee in Kenya should have as much recourse to justice as a tech company in the USA, a computer hardware manufacturer in India, a fashion house in Italy or a furniture maker in Brazil. Mattereum’s ecosystem, drawing on the best of international law, treats all of those actors&nbsp;equally.</p><p>Britain is not alone in working towards better recognition of Web3 technologies. President Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/03/09/fact-sheet-president-biden-to-sign-executive-order-on-ensuring-responsible-innovation-in-digital-assets/">Executive Order issued in March of this year (2022)</a> sought to recognise the benefits of crypto assets whilst also leaning on perceived downsides. It was broadly welcomed: most blockchain businesses look forward to being regulated and having a clear, fair and transparent framework within which to operate. When it comes to public policy, acknowledgement can often be the first or the most significant step towards mainstreaming a new way of doing things. And as far as governments are concerned, acceptance of new technologies or processes means regulation — and hopefully regulation that is fair to both businesses and consumers.</p><p>Nonetheless, when it comes to leading OECD countries, the sharpest minds in the British government and the judiciary are several steps ahead of the US and some others. They recognise the direction of travel in global markets, and they are adamant that Britain must lead and not be left behind. Master of the Rolls Sir Geoffrey Vos has said: “We should not allow the tail, however waggy, to wag the huge dispute resolution dog.” As we often observe, British judges are some of the most intelligent public servants in the world with vast analytical skills. Sir Geoffrey can see very clearly the way the future will develop; he and his team are doing all they can to ensure that UK jurisdictions continue to lead when it comes to global commercial dispute resolution — be it around the bricks and mortar of a skyscraper in the City of London; an NFT acting as a digital receipt for a 100g gold bar <a href="https://lohkowallet.com/">owned by one of Matteruem’s customers</a>, or a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-sets-out-plan-to-make-uk-a-global-cryptoasset-technology-hub">commemorative coin produced by the Royal Mint on the Chancellor’s instruction</a>.</p><p>Matterum’s vision and capabilities go further. Mattereum Asset Passports, attached to every asset which enters our ecosystem, have the capacity to add value and accountability by enhancing the record of that asset’s provenance, its utility, its composition and even data such as its carbon footprint or the labour conditions in which it was produced. Mattereum ensures that those seeking to own, collect, trade or invest in assets are able to access information that is fully accurate and transparent — and ensures that an asset’s veracity is legally enforceable in over 160 jurisdictions worldwide.</p><p>At Mattereum we are at the forefront of building and implementing these tools, alongside <a href="https://unn.finance/">our</a> <a href="https://opensea.io/">partners</a>. We want to see frictionless global commerce for players of all sizes, and in as many jurisdictions as possible. We want to ensure that access to justice and to the principles which underpin it (such as effective remedy) is universal and accessible to everyone — including independent traders, social enterprises working to enable the circular economy, and global conglomerates. Transparency, accountability, due process, fairness and procedural justice are great enablers of a functional system of commerce, and a functional society focused on improving outcomes, wealth and success for all citizens.</p><p>Speaking on behalf of The UK Government, Economy Minister John Glen MP said that “…part of the way we become that pre-eminent financial centre that [the Chancellor] describes is by having the technology here to do things better”. Mattereum is enabling the ecosystem to realise that&nbsp;vision.</p><p>Can the UK become the Web3 leader for the world’s digital commerce? With the appropriate legislation, legal framework — and with the right leadership among civil servants, judges, lawyers and business leaders — unequivocally yes. Mattereum is proud to be part of that journey and building that&nbsp;future.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://passport.mattereum.com/Alexander_Screenprint_Warhol_01/">https://passport.mattereum.com/Alexander_Screenprint_Warhol_01/</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity/global-britain-bullish-on-blockchain-a29899bc325b">Global Britain Bullish on Blockchain</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/humanizing-the-singularity">Mattereum - Humanizing the Singularity</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="http://finicity.com/open-banking">Open banking and now open finance</a> are trading headlines when it comes to fintech, innovation and what the future holds. Differentiating the two isn’t always simple, but in the end, they’re both about empowering consumers and small and mid-size businesses (SMBs) to use their financial data to their benefit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the geographic region, you are likely to get a nuanced answer for both terms’ meanings. In many respects, banking is finance and finance is banking. When it comes to consumer-permissioned data, it’s a distinction without a difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is Open Banking? 
<p>Open banking empowers the consumer by allowing them to link or permission their financial data from bank accounts to trusted third parties for specific purposes. In some regions like the United Kingdom, European Union, Australia and Brazil, open banking is governed by very specific regulations. In others like the United States and Canada, it’s more broadly defined by the simple act of permissioning financial data to be shared with a third party. This is where it starts to blend with open finance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What is Open Finance? 
<p>Open finance also utilizes consumer-permissioned data, but from financial accounts rather than typical bank deposit accounts. Examples include investment accounts, small business accounts, crypto wallets or fintech apps. This introduces new data types and new data uses because of how much more expansive the available data is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key is that it’s still permissioned data for a specific purpose. It’s typically something that benefits the consumer that they wouldn’t receive without sharing that data. In the U.S., what’s commonly referred to as open banking encompasses where the E.U. is heading with its open finance regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumers were permissioning their data for use in fintech apps and other solutions long before the terms “open banking” or “open finance” were coined. These sharing and permissioning actions encompass the data currently covered by open banking and open finance in the E.U. It didn’t start solely with the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/payment-services-psd-2-directive-eu-2015-2366_en">Second Payment Services Directive (PSD2)</a> and other open banking regulations. Consumers in the U.S. have been using the same data in apps dating back to the early 2000s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In some markets, open banking and open finance are associated specifically with account data being connected via an application programming interface (API) with tokenized access. However other markets, including the U.S., often use both terms to describe the broader permissioned data sharing experience. It includes both next-gen connections via APIs with tokenized access and legacy technologies. Whatever the case, when a consumer wants to put their data to use, they can permission it in a few simple steps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Open Finance Powers New Innovations 
<p>A lot of early use cases for consumer-permissioned data revolved around payments and personal financial management (PFM) apps. The next generation of solutions include innovations on the traditional payment and PFM experiences as well as new capabilities made possible through connections to more types of accounts, more data fields and a more expansive set of tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="http://finicity.com/lend">Lending</a> – Whether consumers are looking for a new credit card, personal loan or mortgage, open banking and open finance can help them qualify in a few steps. And small businesses can demonstrate their qualifications for needed capital through cash flow, business cards, other timely loan payments or a quick overview of their transaction history. Fairer representation of an individual’s creditworthiness can extend access to the digital economy to millions of people.&nbsp; 
 <a href="http://finicity.com/pay">Next-gen digital payments</a> – Moving money from account to account was one of the things early open banking regulations in the U.K. set out to solve. Next-generation payment innovation is improving the payment experience from account setup through payments. It’s solving real-world challenges; offering more ways to pay with greater speed, convenience and confidence. Payments can flow and be optimized across any type of account, from paying simple monthly subscriptions to automating the flow of income from a single deposit account across a variety of connected accounts.&nbsp; 
 <a href="http://finicity.com/manage">Personal financial management</a> – Open finance allows for the broadening of PFM from simple budget apps that track transactions to a view of investments, health savings accounts, crypto wallets or any other app. This new data provides more utility and a better understanding of financial health. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Benefits of Open Banking and Open Finance 
<p>Open banking empowers consumers and small businesses by creating a simple platform for accessing, controlling and permissioning their data so they can benefit from it. With connected accounts across the financial services spectrum, consumers and small businesses can put their data to work, whether it’s for one specific purpose or across multiple apps and services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open banking plays a central role in the financial ecosystem as a secure data exchange. Keeping the data flowing between accounts and apps securely and efficiently will continue to fuel innovation and provide benefits across the industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Where Open Banking and Open Finance are Headed 
<p>As an industry, data stewards and recipients are moving away from credential-based access and screen scraping to direct APIs for consumer-permissioned data sharing. APIs remove credential-sharing from the market and enhance access to quality data. Some markets define open banking and open finance as only full API access. Others view open banking and open finance as being about consumer empowerment to permission the use of their data via legacy and API access. Wherever a particular market is in the evolution of open banking and open finance, it is widely agreed that direct API access is superior and markets are moving toward this technology implementation. At the same time, we don’t want to lose ground in innovation by not allowing consumers to have continued access to their financial data as they did with legacy technologies. Like any technology transition, there is a need for “backward” compatibility for a period of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open banking is a technological shift that is still very much in its early stages. As it emerges and matures, policymakers play a meaningful role in the direction and pace of this transformation. Providing clarity on data protection expectations, data privacy requirements and consumer data rights will help shape a more secure, diverse and inclusive financial market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As we transition technologies and enable more seamless digital experiences, we, as an industry, alongside regulators, must ensure that consumers have data continuity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is data continuity? It’s the data consumers have used from their bank statements, paper checks and online banking apps. It’s the data that they’ve used widely for their financial lives and to get financial services up until now. It needs to follow them into the digital realm—in other words, open banking and open finance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Open Finance and Open Banking are All About Empowering Consumers 
<p>As market dynamics continue to fuel the growth of data exchanges and identity markets, participation is pivotal to expanding new platform opportunities, such as open finance, that expand payment choice, improve financial literacy and extend financial inclusion to the underserved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking">Consumer demand is already showing</a> that these capabilities are long-awaited in the market and the desired outcomes are already being delivered. Whether you say “open banking” or “open finance,” or you use one for the other, it’s all about empowering consumers to use and benefit from their data. Either way, they will continue to make the next generation of consumer fintech apps and services more powerful and easier to use.</p>

<p>Fatturazione Elettronica obbligatoria per partite IVA in regime forfettario e regime dei minimi, ci siamo. È ormai ufficiale la notizia di una nuova imminente misura, volta a mettere a segno gli obiettivi di politica fiscale, in particolare sul fronte dell’abbattimento dell’evasione, che il Governo Italiano sta per mettere in campo. Gli addetti ai lavori prevedono che la norma potrebbe entrare in vigore a partire dal secondo semestre del 2022, rendendo di fatto obbligatorio per 1,5 milioni di imprenditori e professionisti, l’utilizzo della fatturazione elettronica.</p>

 Obbligo di fatturazione Elettronica per i forfettari da quando? 



<p>Nonostante non ci sia ancora una data certa, la richiesta del Governo di rendere obbligatoria la fatturazione elettronica anche per i soggetti con regime forfettario è stata accolta dall’Unione Europea. La roadmap ipotetica trapelata fino ad ora prefigura una situazione “a tappe”, la data di partenza della nuova normativa dovrebbe coincidere con luglio 2022, a partire dal quale si potrebbe aprire una finestra di 6 mesi nei quali i soggetti interessati potranno strutturarsi e mettersi in regola, mentre per quanto riguarda le possibili sanzioni legate all’inadempimento, esse potrebbero scattare a partire dal 2023.</p>

 What Is a Data&nbsp;NFT?  Data NFTs have arrived — what role do they have in Ocean&nbsp;V4? <p>Ocean V4 is here and one of the major upgrades are data NFTs. We all know NFTs are awesome, right? Or have we all just got caught up in the hype around them? In this article, we will be taking a look at what Data NFTs are and the role they play in the Ocean Protocol’s V4 release. Spoiler alert… It’s not just hype. So if you’re wondering why we have decided to upgrade our smart contracts to create data NFTs — you’re in the right&nbsp;place.</p> Sections<br>1. <a href="https://medium.com/p/5804a2d88671#bf12">What Are NFTs?</a> <br>2. <a href="https://medium.com/p/5804a2d88671#49f4">So What’s a Data NFT?</a><br>3. <a href="https://medium.com/p/5804a2d88671#cb19">Data NFTs Open Up New Possibilities</a><br>4. <a href="https://medium.com/p/5804a2d88671#9959">How Are Data NFTs Implemented?</a><br>5. <a href="https://medium.com/p/5804a2d88671#9cec">What About Fractional Ownership?</a><br>6. <a href="https://medium.com/p/5804a2d88671#7fab">What Roles Can The Data NFT Owner Assign?</a><br>7. <a href="https://medium.com/p/5804a2d88671#8974">Data NFTs Are Awesome</a>  What Are&nbsp;NFTs? <p>First up — let’s remind ourselves what NFTs are. You probably already know what the acronym stands for, non-fungible token, but what does that mean? A fungible currency or token is one that can be exchanged for another identical token or unit of currency (Dollar, Pound, Bitcoin, Ether etc). So the fact that NFTs are non-fungible means that there is nothing identical to exchange them for — they are unique! They are the equivalent of marked dollar bills. The “mark” is usually a hash stored in the NFT smart contract.</p><p>This uniqueness is the reason for all the buzz around NFTs — they are ideal for representing other unique assets on the blockchain. Over the last 18 months, we’ve seen an explosion in the number of NFTs created, representing all kinds of digital assets from GIFs to&nbsp;Tweets.</p><p>By far the most exciting application of NFTs is the potential for them to represent intellectual property (IP) on-chain. Regular readers of our blog will be well-aware of how interested we are in the application of NFTs representing IP. If you would like to gain a more detailed understanding of the background on this topic, we recommend reading:</p>  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-1-practical-connections-of-erc721-with-intellectual-property-dc216aaf005d">NFTs &amp; IP 1: Practical Connections of ERC721 with&nbsp;IP</a>  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-2-leveraging-erc20-fungibility-bcee162290e3">NFTs &amp; IP 2: Leveraging ERC20 Fungibility</a>  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-3-combining-erc721-erc20-b69ea659115e">NFTs &amp; IP 3: Combining ERC721 &amp;&nbsp;ERC20</a>   So What’s a Data&nbsp;NFT? <p>A data NFT represents the copyright (or exclusive license against copyright) for a data asset on the blockchain — we call this the “base IP”. When a user publishes a dataset in Ocean V4, they create a new NFT as part of the process. This data NFT is proof of your claim of base IP. Assuming a valid claim, you are entitled to the revenue from that asset, just like a title deed gives you the right to receive&nbsp;rent.</p><p>The data NFT smart contract holds metadata about the data asset, stores roles like “who can mint datatokens” or “who controls fees”, and an open-ended key-value store to enable custom&nbsp;fields.</p><p>If you have the private key that controls the NFT, you are the owner of that NFT. The owner has the claim on the base IP and is the default recipient of any revenue. They can also assign another account to receive revenue. This enables the publisher to sell their base IP and the revenues that come with it. When the Data NFT is transferred to another user, all the information about roles and where the revenue should be sent is reset. The default recipient of the revenue is the new owner of the data&nbsp;NFT.</p> Data NFTs Open Up New Possibilities <p>With data NFTs, you are able to take advantage of the wider NFT ecosystem and all the tools and possibilities that come with it. As a first example, many leading crypto wallets have first-class support for NFTs, allowing you to manage data NFTs from those wallets. Or, you can post your data NFT for sale on a popular NFT marketplace like <a href="https://www.opensea.io">OpenSea</a> or <a href="https://www.rarible.com">Rarible</a>. As a final example, we’re excited to see d<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/05/19/2232106/0/en/WISeKey-partners-with-Ocean-Protocol-to-launch-TrustedNFT-io-a-decentralized-marketplace-for-objects-of-value-designed-to-empower-artists-creators-and-collectors-with-a-unique-solu.html">ata NFTs linked to physical items via WiseKey&nbsp;chips</a>.</p> How Are Data NFTs Implemented? <p>We have implemented data NFTs using the <a href="https://erc721.org/">ERC721 standard</a>. Our implementation has been built on top of the battle-tested <a href="https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721">OpenZeppelin contract library</a>. However, there are a bunch of interesting parts of our implementation that go a bit beyond an out-of-the-box NFT.</p><p>We released Ocean V3 in late 2020. In V3, there was a single ERC20 datatoken contract template and every datatoken had to follow that implementation. Over the last year, we’ve seen large growth in the variety of projects that are now building on top of Ocean. With this in mind, a key goal for V4 has been to introduce as much flexibility as possible. In particular, V4 has flexibility on data NFT templates, data NFT key-value storage, and datatoken templates. Let’s explore each in&nbsp;detail.</p><p>Ocean V4’s data NFT factory can deploy different types of data NFTs based on a variety of templates. Some templates could be tuned for data unions, others for DeFi, and others yet for enterprise use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>Something else that we’re super excited about in our data NFTs is a cutting-edge standard called <a href="https://github.com/ERC725Alliance/erc725/blob/main/docs/ERC-725.md">ERC725</a> being driven by our friends <a href="https://lukso.network/about">at Lukso</a>. The ERC725y feature enables the NFT owner (or a user with the “store updater” role) to input and update information in a key-value store. These values can be viewed externally by&nbsp;anyone.</p><p>ERC725y is incredibly flexible and can be used to store any string; you could use it for anything from additional metadata to encrypted values. This helps future-proof the data NFTs and ensure that they are suitable for a wide range of projects that have not been launched yet. As you can imagine, the inclusion of ERC725y has huge potential and we look forward to seeing the different ways people end up using it. If you’re interested in using this, take a look at&nbsp;<a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-725#erc725y">EIP725</a>.</p><p>Continuing the theme of flexibility, for a given data NFT, you can have an ERC20 datatoken contract. Here’s the main idea: 1.0 datatokens allows you to consume the corresponding dataset. Put another way, it’s a sub-license from the base IP to be able to use the dataset according to the license terms (when you send it to the publisher). License terms can be set from a “good default”, or by the Data NFT owner. ERC20 fungible token standard is a natural choice for datatokens, because licenses themselves are fungible: one license can be exchanged 1:1 another. Using the ERC20 standard enables interoperability of datatokens with ERC20-based wallets, DEXes, DAOs, and more. Datatokens can be given (simply transferred), purchased on a marketplace / exchange, airdropped, etc.</p><p>You can publish a data NFT initially with no ERC20 datatoken contracts. This means you simply aren’t ready to grant access to your data asset yet (sub-license it). Then, you can publish one or more ERC20 datatoken contracts against the data NFT. One datatoken contract might grant consume rights for 1 day, another for 1 week, etc. Each different datatoken contract is for different license&nbsp;terms.</p><p>Ocean provides convenient methods to list ERC20 datatokens for sale, with fixed-price (atomic swap), or automatic pricing via an automated market maker pool (a friendly fork of <a href="https://balancer.fi/">Balancer</a>). Like any ERC20 token, datatokens may be listed in many decentralised exchanges (DEXes), centralised exchanges (CEXes), over-the-counter, or otherwise.</p> What About Fractional Ownership? <p>Fractional ownership is an exciting sub-niche of Web3, at the intersection of NFTs and DeFi. IT allows co-ownership of data&nbsp;IP.</p><p>Ocean provides two approaches to fractional ownership:</p>  Sharded holding of ERC20 datatokens, where each ERC20 holder has the usual datatoken rights as described above, e.g. 1.0 datatokens to consume an asset. This comes out-of-the-box with&nbsp;Ocean.  Sharding ERC721 data NFT, where each co-holder has right to some earnings against base IP, and co-controls the data NFT. For example, there’s a DAO with the sole purpose to hold the data NFT; this DAO has its own ERC20 token; DAO members vote with tokens to update data NFT roles or deploy ERC20 datatokens against the&nbsp;ERC721.  <p>Note: For (2), one might consider doing sharding with something like Niftex. But then there are questions: what rights do the shard-holders get exactly? It could be zero; for example, Amazon shareholders don’t have the right to walk the hallways of the Amazon offices just because they hold shares. Secondly, how do the shard-holders control the data NFT? These questions get resolved by using a tokenized DAO, as described above.</p><p>Data DAOs are a cool use case whenever you have a group of people that wish to co-manage data, or bundle up data for larger collective bargaining power. The DAO may be a union, co-op, or&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Consider the following mobile app example. You install the app; it has a built-in crypto wallet; you give the app permission to see your location data; the app gets the DAO to sell your (anonymized) location data on your behalf; the DAO sells your data bundled along with thousands of other DAO members; as a DAO member you get a cut of the&nbsp;profits.</p><p>This has several variants. Each member’s data feed could be its own data NFT with associated datatokens. Or, there’s simply one data NFT aggregating datafeeds across all members into a single feed, and the feed is fractionalized by sharded holding of ERC20 tokens (1 above) or sharding the ERC721 data NFT (2 above). If you’re interested in starting a data union then we recommend getting in touch with our friends at <a href="https://www.dataunion.app/">Data&nbsp;Union</a>.</p> What Roles Can The Data NFT Owner&nbsp;Assign? <p>As we’ve described above, the data NFT is the base IP for the asset and all the datatokens are therefore linked to the data NFT smart contract — this has enabled us to do a bunch of cool new things around role administration. We’ve introduced a host of useful roles which give you flexibility in how you manage your project. This can be a big help for enterprises and startups who are ready to scale up and introduce a level of administration.</p> NFT Owner <p>The NFT owner is the owner of the base-IP and is therefore at the highest level. The NFT owner can perform any action or assign any role but crucially, the NFT owner is only one who can assign the manager role. Upon deployment or transfer of the data NFT, the NFT owner is automatically added as a manager. The NFT owner is also the only role that can’t be assigned to multiple users — the only way to share this role is via multi-sig or a&nbsp;DAO.</p> Manager <p>The manager can assign or revoke three main roles (deployer, metadata updater, store updater). The manager is also able to interact with the ERC725&nbsp;data.</p> ERC20 Deployer <p>The Deployer has a bunch of privileges at the ERC20 datatoken level. They can deploy new datatokens and create new pools with vesting and staking, fixed price exchange, or free pricing. They can also update the ERC725Y key-value store and assign roles the ERC20&nbsp;level.</p> Metadata Updater <p>There is also a specific role for updating the metadata. The Metadata updater has the ability to update the information about the data asset (title, description, sample data etc) that is displayed to the user on the asset detail page within the&nbsp;market.</p> Store Updater <p>The store updater can store, remove or update any arbitrary key value using the ERC725Y implementation (at the ERC721 level). The use case for this role depends a lot on what data is being stored in the ERC725Y key-value pair — as mentioned above, this is highly flexible.</p> Minter <p>The Minter has the ability to mint new datatokens, provided the limit has not been exceeded. In most cases, this role will not be used as the alternative is for the datatokens to be minted by the side-staking bot which has many advantages. We highly recommend taking a read of <a href="http://[link%20to%20Trent's%20Blog%20post]">this article</a> if you’re interested in learning more about safer staking and one-sided staking.</p> Fee Manager <p>Finally, we also have a fee manager which has the ability to set a new fee collector — this is the account that will receive the datatokens when a data asset is consumed. If no fee collector account has been set, the datatokens will be sent by default to the NFT Owner. The applicable fees (market and community fees) are automatically deducted from the datatokens that are received.</p> Data NFTs Are&nbsp;Awesome <p>Nice one — you read through to the end — we’re glad you’re as excited by data NFTs as we are! The conclusion of this article is quite simply that data NFTs are awesome. Here are our top reasons why data NFTs are so&nbsp;cool:</p>  The base IP is now tokenized, on-chain. This means you can sell it, trade it or transfer it from your existing crypto&nbsp;wallet.  Data NFTs make it easy for you — the owner — to earn by owning them, by creating and selling datatokens (licenses of the base IP). This means that data NFTs are more than just speculative assets, they bring tangible revenue potential with&nbsp;them.  The whole NFT ecosystem of tools is available to you because we’ve used the common ERC721 standard to ensure compatibility. In addition, you get super-flexible key-value storage (ERC725) and DeFi / ERC20 ecosystem tools (datatokens as&nbsp;ERC20).  Ownership of the data can now be divided up and shared via fractional ownership. This is especially fitting for data DAO, for a group of people to co-manage data, or bundle up data for stronger collective bargaining.  Data NFT owners have a huge amount of flexibility in how they manage their organization through the many different roles that they can assign to others. This is perfect for an enterprise or any startup trying to scale&nbsp;up.  <p>Data NFTs are just one part of a whole range of upgrades we’ve introduced in Ocean V4.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Over the past 16 months, Software Supply Chain Risks have risen to a top concern of CISOs, caused by several software supply chain attacks as well as major risks induced by vulnerabilities in extensively used standard software components, specifically Log4j/Log4shell. Understanding and mitigating software (supply chain) risks as well as protecting the own DevOps pipeline is a must for organizations. This is not a one-time exercise but requires continuous re-evaluation based on standardized methodology. Risks are continuously changing, be it by newly detected vulnerabilities or by external events such as the recent <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/announcement-additions-covered-list">addition of Kaspersky Lab to the FCC covered list</a> in the U.S. and the preceding <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/DE/Service-Navi/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/Presse2022/220315_Kaspersky-Warnung.html">warning of the German BSI</a> of using Kaspersky anti-malware solutions.</p>
<p>The FCC covered list contains communication equipment and services “deemed to pose an unacceptable risk to the national security of the United States or the security and safety of United States persons”. The BSI warning is based on the combination of extensive system-level entitlements of the software and a lack of control about which actions might be taken to systems by the software. These actions have been preceded by a directive issued in 2017 by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, mandating civilian federal government agencies to remove Kaspersky software.</p>
<p>Assessing the risks of software requires a methodology, a structured approach. The recommended approach here is to start with a set of criteria for measuring the risk (as probability x impact). The eight areas to look at are</p>
 
 Criticality of affected assets: How critical are the assets that could be affected by risks related to a certain software? 
 Number of affected assets: How many assets are affected by risks related to a certain software? 
 Containment: To which extent can software risks be contained, in contrast to spreading across the enterprise? 
 Insight &amp; control: Which level of insight into what happens in a software or cloud service and communication of the software to external servers is provided? What is the level of control about this? 
 Information &amp; Patch approach: How good, open, current, and proactive is the communication and the patch management approach of the supplier? 
 Applicability of mitigations: Is it possible to apply mitigations for concrete risks? This aspect is of specific interest when evaluating changes in risk. 
 Liability: Which liability issues need to be considered? 
 External impact: Are there external drivers to the risk, such as warnings and bans? 
 
<p>Such rating then can be done for software categories, as shown in the spider chart, or for specific software. It, e.g., can be used for first defining a baseline and then comparing different vendor’s solutions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For EPDR (Endpoint Protection, Detection &amp; Response), which serves as the example in the spider chart, there is an obvious inherent risk. EPDR protects endpoints, which also means that software risks in EPDR affect endpoints, making them vulnerable and potential entry points for attacks. The number of affected assets is significant. Containment of risks is difficult, because endpoints are everywhere across the organization. Insight &amp; control is, across the range of EPDR solutions, mediocre, with a lot of automation based on cloud services, both changing the endpoint software &amp; configuration (such as updates on signatures of malware, to take a classical example), and gathering information. Information about risks and patch management approaches of vendors commonly are good, imposing little risk. The applicability of mitigations is fairly limited and primarily is about either using multiple tools per endpoint, or replacing EPDR solutions, both being complex and costly mitigation approaches. Liability for damages caused by attacks is reduced by proper use of EPDR solutions. Finally, there is no significant external impact on the risk in common scenarios.</p>
<p>However, this standard, baseline evaluation then must be adapted to the concrete software in use. And if, such as with the above-mentioned warnings and bans of a software, external impact changes, there also needs to be a re-evaluation. In the concrete case, the risk rating for</p>
 
 External impact 
 Liability 
 
<p>are increasing massively, to the top-level of the rating. Also, the risk rating for Information &amp; patch approach, and for Insight &amp; Control must become revisited. Also, the rating for Applicability of mitigations changes: Is it practical to just add some more controls based on other vendor’s solutions, or is the only consequence to switch to another vendor’s solution? Based on the changes in risk rating, decisions must be made, and consequences must be taken.</p>
<p>For comparing the Risk/Benefit ratio or the Risk/Feasibility ratio of software, matrixes are a proven tool for graphical representation. In a Risk/Benefit ratio, the risk of software would be measured again the benefit it provides. In such ratio, different solutions or different types of software can be compared. It, e.g., can serve for comparing the Risk/Benefit ratio of various security solutions, to better understand where to spend the (always limited) budget for. The matrix also can be used for re-evaluating the risk of software.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The sample indicates how a certain software rated compared to the baseline, and how the re-assessment based on external factors impacts this rating. The matrix has four quadrants, with low risk/high benefit being in the upper right, indicating what organizations definitely should do. EPDR is in the upper left quadrant, with some inherent risk, but a huge benefit. Which technologies are used here must be very carefully considered, due to the inherent risk, but implementing, in this sample, EPDR, is a must-do. However, the dotted line indicates where we shift from something that must be done to something that requires an alternative.</p>
<p>As the example illustrates, the rating between baseline and concrete software solutions can differ. If it moves towards the right, applying a technical solution remains a must do, but the concrete solution must be re-evaluated, specifically if the gap in risk towards the baseline rating becomes that big, and a solution shifts from “must do” to “must do differently” (or “must be done differently”).</p>
<p>The lower left quadrant would contain solution with limited benefit and high risk. These shouldn’t be used. The lower right quadrant is about low risk/low benefit, i.e., the nice-to-have solutions.</p>
<p>An important aspect in these ratings is the factor of “applicability of mitigations”. If you can mitigate risks for a software or service by additional measures, some or all of the other factors will change to the positive, i.e., a lower risk. If you can only mitigate by replacement, it is about comparing the current solution with the alternatives that, in the example would score closer to the EPDR baseline rating. Unless you want to take the risk…</p>
<p>The recommendation is to always take structured approaches and use defined methodologies ahead of making decisions. This helps in clarifying the real risk and the changes in risk as well as potential mitigations, and thus backs the decisions that must be made. Sometimes, the decisions to be made then become obvious.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Raj Hegde</a></p><p>Decentralized identity is an incredibly flexible technology that solves fundamental problems in the way we manage digital communication. But this capacity to do more than one thing at once can be a source of confusion. Heather Dahl from Indicio will elaborate on this challenge in her Combined Session&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/4999/3">How to use the framework of a Trusted Data Ecosystem to simplify building decentralized identity solutions</a> on Wednesday, May 11, at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2022</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Heather some questions about her presentation.</p>
<p> </p>
 What is decentralized identity? 
<p>I think it's important to answer this question to really break it down into two parts. And typically we define identity in association with an individual, their name, their address, their date of birth, and so on. And while that's the bulk of the work thus far in the sector, the true value, of decentralized identity technology comes when we realize identity is nothing more than a single data point. And it's associated with the data subject. The data point can be quite literally anything, and the data subject actually need not be a person, but it can be a corporation, a device the government, a physical object, and all the things that you use to describe that entity constitute its data. So with that in mind, decentralization is about giving the data subject control to the data associated with it, rather than having to rely on a single or even small group of authorities to attest to the fact that any given identity to a data point belongs to it. So if you think of SSO providers or even a single government entity, that's the sole source of proving something rather than a collection of sources that we used in the pre-digital age. So another way to think of decentralization is really like the analog world where some proof of data points like birth date or professional license that was given to you, and then you share it with someone who requested it. And while it seems like we can do that now online, the problem is this: The analog world of paper and seals and lamination had a means of determining whether the proof was trustworthy. It was slow, it was tedious, and it was full of friction. But physical things could be trusted in a way that JPEGs, PDFs, and email attachments can't be trusted online. So decentralized identity now gives us the trust of the analog worlds with the efficiency of the digital world and the ability to collect data points that we rightfully own and use the tech to prove the data's source. Its authenticity and its integrity and the fact it hasn't been tampered with or changed in transit.</p>
<p></p>
 Could you describe a solution built on decentralized identity? 
<p>So a decentralized identity solution is about the trusted exchange of information between the issuer of the data point, the holder or owner of a data, which is basically the data subject, and the receiver, which is a verifier. And when you look at it from this bottom-up perspective, you can identify a pain point where you need to be able to verify and trust some digital information that's critical to the business process. So at that point, it's easy to see some solutions pop up. What we're going to talk about actually at the conference is an example that was provided by SITA. And in this case, SITA, which provides technology to the global aviation industry, needed to be able to prove trust in medical data in order for a traveler to fly. And they worked with the government of Aruba. And through this decentralized identity solution, a traveler was able to obtain their medical information from a state health information exchange in the United States. They were able to provide either that proof of vaccination or test to the government of Aruba prior to checking in and receiving approval from that government and using the self-serve or app on the airline's app to check-in while also conveying the government's approval for their arrival. And in this case, you had the issuer that was both the Health Information Exchange and the government, the holder, which was the traveler, and then the verifier, which was also the government or the airline in this case. So you had a situation where you created a decentralized identity solution. But here's the key. The exchange of the data was done without any direct integrations. And so that created the decentralized methodology in which I talk about and it ultimately created what we call a trusted digital ecosystem.</p>
<p></p>
 What should you consider when implementing this solution? 
<p>Our experience has been the simpler it is, the better to start, because once you understand the power of decentralized identity, it's easy to see all the ways to exchange authentic trusted data and make a business process better. So the good news is even the smallest implementation of decentralized identity can bring massive value, even in a closed-loop environment where a single business is the issuer and the verifier, think like a bank issuing, an account holder credential that can deliver massive value to the organization, reduce fraud and save money. So when you consider building a trusted digital ecosystem, decentralized identity solution, think about starting small. Use it to bring value. And then that value when it's demonstrated internally or to a business partner, it has and will prove to attract others who want to participate with you. And in this way, policy, compliance, governance, and the tech can evolve naturally. Rather than building this massive round peg and then you're trying to fit it into a dozen square holes.</p>
<p></p>
 &nbsp; 
 How do Trusted Digital Ecosystems change the way business is done? 
<p>Creating trusted digital ecosystems, provide companies with the software and the infrastructure that they can use to issue, share and verify the authenticity and integrity of any kind of data, especially where you need data repeatedly and efficiently. And you can do that without the high expense or risk of direct integration. That's really the decentralized model here. And so when we think about the framework of a trusted digital ecosystem, think about how you can use decentralized identifiers, software agents, verifiable credentials, and supporting infrastructure to verify data without having to integrate with or even communicate with the source of the data. Most importantly, what we find is that trusted digital ecosystems allow any entity to exchange information and verify it. And here is the key. It's immediately actionable at that point. And so when you have that immediately actionable information that allows you to build upon itself and create that aha moment for your organization, or your partners, then you are really driving that vision of giving individuals ownership over their digital identity in a privacy-preserving way. And then you can provide the products or solutions where others can adopt your verifiable credentials and bring those into markets and workflows and really prove the future of digital trust for all businesses and individuals.</p>

<p>Terra is exploding. Do Kwon and the Terra ecosystem are turning Bitcoin into their collateral asset of choice to backstop LUNA and the UST stablecoin. Over the last several weeks, the Luna Foundation Guard (LFG) have bought over 30,000 BTC... and they don't plan to stop there.</p> <p>As the LFG climbs the ranks of bitcoin holders, Do Kwon has started playing empire games—claiming victory over the Curve Wars with the 4pool (which contains UST, Frax, USDC, and USDT), calling for the end of DAI, and attempting to build out the Terra ecosystem as the ultimate power in the universe.</p> <p>Is Terra (UST) the future of crypto money? Or is it a ticking time bomb waiting to explode? Perhaps the truth is somewhere in the middle, so we're going to debate it.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Mike Small</a></p> Is your Digital Supply Chain your weakest Link? 
<p>In the 1950’s the Lyons restaurant chain in the UK built their own computer and wrote all the applications that they needed to manage and optimize their operations. This was called <a href="https://www.leo-computers.org.uk/">LEO</a> – Lyons’ Electronic Office.&nbsp; Today, this would be impractical, and all organizations now rely on IT software and services delivered from external suppliers. The creates a supply chain that is very attractive to cyber adversaries because of the leverage it provides.&nbsp; One compromised component is delivered to many potential victims.</p>
<p>How can you protect your organisation against these risks?</p>
<p></p>
 Supply Chain Threats 
<p>Supply chain integrity is a problem for all industries.&nbsp; High value fashion brands suffer from fake products that eat into their profit and whose poor quality can cause support problems as well as brand damage. In the world of IT services, a compromised supply chain can have a catastrophic impact on your business.</p>
<p>Recent events such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/security-advisories/cve-2021-35211">SolarWinds</a>, <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-30116">Kaseya</a> and <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html">Log4j</a> compromises by malicious actors have demonstrated the need to focus on software supply chain security. &nbsp;According to a <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/threat-landscape-for-supply-chain-attacks">report from ENISA</a>, supply chain attacks are increasing, with 66% of attacks focusing on source code and 62% exploiting customer trust in suppliers. This is a risk that organizations can’t afford to ignore.</p>
<p>All organisations now depend upon vendor and partner-supplied products and services to function in today’s interconnected world.  This interdependence introduces new risks that attacks on suppliers can spread rapidly across all their customers.  This is a major challenge that CISOs must address.</p>
<p></p>
 IT Service Iceberg 
<p>The software that supports today’s organizations is large and complex comprising many interrelated software components that come from diverse sources. This makes sense because it is more efficient to reuse rather than to recreate common, extensively used functions every time they are needed.</p>
<p>IT Service Iceberg</p>
<p>Some of these components may be developed internally – so there is an internal supply chain. &nbsp;Others may be from external sources such as software vendors or be part of standard infrastructure like operating systems and libraries.&nbsp; An increasing challenge is the number of Open-Source components are now widely incorporated in externally provided applications but are not visible.&nbsp; All of these components may contain hidden vulnerabilities, and these can pose a risk to your business.</p>
<p></p>
 Supply Chain Risk 
<p>At a business level there are three major risks from the technical vulnerabilities introduced in the supply chain:</p>
 
 Loss of business continuity – the increased dependency of organization on software systems and applications means that any interruption to these systems can have a severe impact.&nbsp; There are many <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/transform/hackers-hit-norsk-hydro-ransomware-company-responded-transparency/">documented reports</a> of the impact of Ransomware attacks. 
 Loss of intellectual property and fraud – illegitimate access to organizational data can result in the loss of trade secrets and intellectual property as well as provide the <a href="https://www.ledger.com/addressing-the-july-2020-e-commerce-and-marketing-data-breach">potential for financial fraud</a>. 
 Compliance failure – most organizations must comply with regulations on how they use and protect data they hold – especially in the areas of personal privacy and financial services.&nbsp; Since this data is mostly held in IT systems compromising these systems can lead to compliance failure. 
 
 Supply Chain Cyber Security Management 
<p></p>
<p>Business Risks from the Supply Chain</p>
<p>Managing supply chain security is an essential element of the “Identify” and “Protect” phases in an organization’s security processes.&nbsp; The intent of supply chain security management / assurance is to prevent vulnerabilities and cyber threats from being introduced into IT systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This makes it part of the vulnerability management processes to prevent vulnerabilities from entering the IT systems, and to detect and remove vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.&nbsp; Where software is externally supplied it is also part of the procurement processes which include vendor assurance.</p>
<p></p>
 Prepare, Prevent and Protect 
<p>The responsibilities for security are shared between your suppliers and your organization.</p>
 
 Make sure that you understand and document how these responsibilities are shared. 
 Ensure that you meet your responsibilities. Identify sensitivity and risk and use this to specify the appropriate security requirements.&nbsp; Use Secure SDLC methodologies for software you develop.&nbsp; Catalogue all software components that your applications depend upon. Implement secure configurations and manage other technical vulnerabilities. 
 Assure that your suppliers meet theirs.&nbsp; Audit vendor claims, require independent certification, identify supplier dependencies and clarify contractual clauses. 
 
<p></p>
<p>Prepare, Prevent and Protect</p>
<p></p>
 Conclusion 
<p>The digital supply chain means that the security failures of your vendors impact on your organisation’s security. Today’s services depend upon complex stack of interdependent components, many of which are invisible to the end customer. &nbsp;Vulnerabilities in any of these components have the potential to impact on your business continuity and compliance.</p>
<p>Organizations need to prepare for attacks on their digital supply chain.&nbsp; Take steps to prevent these attacks through their processes for the acquisition of digital assets and to protect against these attacks through technical vulnerability management.</p>

<p></p><p>Cozy Cloud with its CLISK project is taking part in the Data Portability &amp; Services Incubator (DAPSI), a 3-year EU funded project that empowers internet innovators to develop new solutions in the data portability field. </p> What is DAPSI? <p>The Data Portability and Services Incubator (DAPSI) is a EU funded project, under the European Commission’s Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative, to empower top internet innovators to develop human-centric solutions, addressing the challenge of personal data portability on the internet, as foreseen under the GDPR and make it significantly easier for citizens to have any data which is stored with one service provider transmitted directly to another provider.</p><p>DAPSI supports top-notch projects through a 9-month incubation programme where experts in diverse fields provide a successful working methodology, access to top infrastructure, training in business and data related topics, coaching, mentoring, and a vibrant ecosystem. On top of that, each DAPSI project can receive up to €150k equity-free funding.</p> CLISK, CLIent-Side Konnectors <p>Cozy Cloud is taking part in DAPSI to go beyond the portability right by developing an open-source personal robot system, to get your data, on your request, from your device. We call this concept CLISK, for CLIent-Side Konnectors. A konnector2 is a piece of software that mimic user interaction on a website to get her own data, on her behalf. Typically, an Amazon konnector retrieves all the bills stored in the user account, while a Facebook konnector will get photos with annotations, etc. You can see below the onboarding of connexion of the mobile application. </p><p></p><p> &nbsp;<br> <br>We propose to implement the possibility to run konnectors from the client-side, i.e. directly on the user device, under her consent, without any server support. This way, all requests are legitimate and avoid common robot issues such as IP blocking, scraping protection, etc. This is no longer a third-party the user mandates to exercise her portability right, this is a local “user agent” run by the user herself, to enforce her data sovereignty.</p><p> <br>This service must be dynamic, i.e. it should be regularly run in order to retrieve the latest data, and it should be as smooth as possible for the user, without compromising her security. Our solution includes the integration with a password manager, to end-to-end encrypt user credentials and eventually, the data itself. &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br>Finally, transparency will &nbsp;be enforced by implementing an &nbsp;access control dashboard, to let the &nbsp;user know about data transfers occurring on her behalf, with the possibility to revoke them at any time.</p> How does it work? <p>In this two-phase supporting programme, the projects will develop advanced solutions in the Data Portability field. In the first phase (Kick-Start phase) the teams will have around 5 months to develop a solution related to a specific use case. After an assessment made by a panel of qualified experts, and based on milestones and results achieved, the teams will be invited into phase 2 (Booster phase). The use cases will then be fostered for 4 more months, to evolve into solid projects, to gain enough traction for deployment and get ready for the market.</p><p>Follow our journey through dapsi!</p><p>Take a look at the <a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu/hall-of-fame/">DAPSI innovators portfolio</a> to see more information about the selected projects.</p><p>To read more about DAPSI, please visit the website: <a href="https://dapsi.ngi.eu/">dapsi.ngi.eu</a></p>

<p>We’ve kicked off 2022 with a bang from launching <a href="https://grants.dock.io/?_ga=2.142782517.1859672317.1649094892-1117515565.1641480136">Dock’s grant program</a>, Dock staking becoming available on Binance with up to 37.27% APY, making the staking rewards payout after each era automatic, and launching <a href="https://certs.dock.io/">Dock Certs</a>.</p><p>We’re excited to announce our new and updated roadmap taking us through to the end of the year. Starting with Q2 of 2022, you can expect to see:</p><p>Q2</p><p><a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/react-native-sdk">Dock Wallet SDK</a> enables other platforms to integrate their mobile apps with Dock. The complete source code for Dock’s Wallet SDK is available on <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/react-native-sdk">GitHub</a> allowing for organizations to send, receive, and manage DOCK tokens. The entire functionality of Dock’s Mobile Wallet App is available on Dock’s Wallet SDK source code, allowing organizations to integrate their existing React Native Apps with Dock. </p><p>Sticking with the topic of <a href="https://linktr.ee/DockWallet">Dock’s Wallet App</a>, Version 2 of this will be available in Q2. This version will have enhanced functionalities to support credential storage. With this update, a holder can be in control of their credentials and have them stored on their mobile device within their Dock Wallet. Now when a verifiable credential is issued using Dock Certs, the holder can import the credential via a JSON file or QR code to their Dock Mobile App. Any Dock or W3C-compliant credential can be imported on the Dock Mobile Wallet App. (We’ll be issuing credentials to those who attend our future webinars!)</p><p>Next on the list of releases in Q2 is Traceable Credentials, this feature will be added to the Blockchain SDK. To explain this, let’s start with anonymous credentials; they provide privacy allowing the owner of a credential to disclose selected parts of a credential rather than the entirety of it. The issue here is that the holder is anonymous and anonymity can lead to bad behavior. Traceable credentials provide the privacy of anonymous credentials but make it so that the anonymity can be unwound and bad actors can be identified if need be.</p><p>Ending Q2 on a high and staying with Dock’s Blockchain SDK, the Dock team is working on a Bridge with the <a href="https://blog.dock.io/ethereum-and-erc-20-tokens-are-coming-soon-on-dock-with-dock-bridge/">Ethereum blockchain</a>. This bridge will allow users on the Dock network to interop with Ethereum, swiftly migrating Ethereum assets to Dock’s low-cost, highly scalable platform and vice versa. With this bridge, the issuers and DApp builders on Dock will be able to create DIDs and anchor verifiable credentials on Dock while verifying it on Ethereum. It will also open a new gateway for the enormous number of organizations and DAOs built on Ethereum to issue VCs and DIDs on Dock that will be verifiable on Ethereum. We see this Ethereum bridge opening many opportunities, growing Dock’s community, and increasing collaborations. </p><p>Q3</p><p>Back to Dock’s Mobile Wallet, version 3 will be available at the start of Q3 in 2022. This version will encompass enhanced functionalities to support credential verification flow. Let’s take a manual-labor job for context; a worker will show up to a construction site and have his qualification credentials stored on his mobile device within a wallet. The job site will be able to ‘scan’ the credential and instantly verify its authenticity. </p><p>Within Q3, we plan to complete a Ledger Live App Submission. The keyword here is submission! Recently, Dock had their Ledger Wallet App approved and into the Ledger marketplace so users can now interact with Dock on Ledger and store DOCK tokens on their Ledger hardware. This was a 13-month long journey for Dock waiting for security audits and more to come to an end. The next step is Ledger Live desktop/web app, creating a better user experience when interacting with DOCK tokens and doesn’t require any communication with <a href="http://fe.dock.io/">fe.dock.io</a>. This will be a great addition for the crypto community having access to live support via Ledger. This source code integration will be ready for submission to Ledger Live by Q3.</p><p>Now, something we know our Dock crypto community has long awaited for - Dock’s Mobile Wallet App, Version 4, where Staking will become available. Currently, staking is only available via <a href="http://fe.dock.io/">fe.dock.io</a> on the Polkadot extension or with Binance and other staking providers, the Dock Mobile Wallet App allows token holders to send, receive and manage their DOCK tokens. In Q3, Dock Mobile Wallet users will have the ability to stake DOCK tokens at their fingertips. </p><p>Keeping our team busy working towards a future in which we envision organizations to move into, we’ll be releasing a Relay Service. This relay service is essentially the magic that allows us to communicate between wallet and Dock Certs/API, allowing for offline communication between the issuer, holder, and verifier. </p><p>Ending Q3, integration with Circom will become available. Integration with this scripting language will allow expressing arbitrary constraints on credential attributes. Currently, the expressiveness of our anonymous credentials is limited to proving possession of credentials, equality of attributes across credentials, verifiable encryption of attributes and range proofs. But we cannot support more arbitrary expressions like proving your average monthly income is less than a certain value or your total assets are more than your liabilities. Supporting Circom will allow application developers to define their own constraints before a user can access their site or download an application. </p><p>Q4</p><p>Flying through to October 2022 is the launch of our Web Wallet. This will encompass all the functionality of Dock’s Mobile Wallet App, from storing, sending, receiving, and managing DOCK tokens to owning and storing verifiable credentials, on a Web Wallet. Dock’s Web Wallet will allow users to manage their DOCK tokens and verifiable credentials on an easy-to-use web interface.</p><p>To end the year, we plan to make substantial improvements and additions to Dock Certs. On the list are anonymous credentials and traceable credentials. Anonymous credentials will allow an organization to issue credentials permitting the holder to prove certain credentials exist without disclosing the credential itself. </p><p>As outlined earlier in this blog, anonymous credential holders can behave maliciously and traceable credentials allow for official regulators to identify these malicious users. For context, if traceable credentials were used for a purchase and official regulators such as the police needed to know who the buyer was, they could use traceable credentials to unwind and find the credential details. </p> Watch the full video here: <p>Dock is on a mission to enable organizations and individuals to create and share verifiable data, empowering lives by giving back control of identity to the owner. With our 2022 roadmap, we will make huge leaps in the verifiable credentials and identity space. </p><p>For more information and to stay up to date on Dock’s milestone progression, follow us on <a href="https://linktr.ee/DockNetwork">social media</a> or join Dock’s official <a href="https://t.me/DockAnnounce">Telegram Announcement Channel</a>.</p>

 The token mechanics of how V4 addresses rug pulls and&nbsp;slippage  1. Introduction <p>Ocean V3 introduced datatokens (DTs) for tokenized data access. It also introduced OCEAN-datatoken pools that people could stake to (add liquidity) and get a cut of swap fees. A V3 publisher gets all DTs on publishing their data asset — they are datatoken whales. Alas, these could be used to “rug pull” stakers in&nbsp;pools.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v4-overview-1ccd4a7ce150">Ocean V4</a> introduces one-sided staking (1SS), so publishers are no longer datatoken whales. This solves rug pulls, and mitigates slippage&nbsp;too.</p><p>The rest of this article is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 describe how 1SS addresses rug pulls and slippage. Section 4 describes another feature — vesting — to help ensure sufficient incentive for publishers. Section 5 discusses fees, and section 6 some caveats. Section 7 concludes. The appendix describes Token Engineering work that led to the 1SS and vesting mechanics.</p> 2. Solving Rug&nbsp;Pulls  2.1 Rug pulls &amp; Ocean&nbsp;V3 <p>Rug pulls are when a whale pulls out of their large position in a pool, hurting other&nbsp;stakers.</p><p>Rug pulls happen in Ocean V3 when Publishers use their position as datatoken (DT) whales to grab OCEAN from a&nbsp;pool.</p><p>Let’s elaborate how via an&nbsp;example.</p><p>Mallory publishes a data asset. She gets the full initial supply of 1M datatokens (DTs), becoming a DT whale. She then creates a pool with equal weights, and adds 100 OCEAN and 1000 DT liquidity. The pool mints 100.0 BPTs (pool tokens), and Mallory gets them&nbsp;all.</p><p>Along comes Alice. She stakes 1000 OCEAN in the pool. The pool mints 228.9 more BPTs and sends it to her. Now the pool has 1000 DT and 1100&nbsp;OCEAN.</p><p>Now, Mallory does a rug pull: she withdraws all her stake (100.0 BPTs) in return for 564.1 OCEAN. This leaves 535.8 OCEAN left in the pool, for Alice. So Mallory has gained 564.1-100.0=464.1 OCEAN, and Alice has lost 1000.0–535.8=464.2 OCEAN.</p><p>Alternatively, Mallory could have done an indirect rug pull: swap her remaining 990K DTs on the pool, receiving ≈all the OCEAN in the pool&nbsp;(!).</p> 2.2 Rug pulls &amp; Ocean&nbsp;V4 <p>Ocean V4 solves rug pulls, because publishers get no initial datatokens (DTs). Instead, the 1SS bot gets them, and it uses them to automatically regulate the pool’s supply of&nbsp;DTs.</p><p>Whenever someone stakes OCEAN into a pool, the 1SS bot adds enough DTs to keep datatoken price stable, i.e. maintain a constant ratio of DT:OCEAN ratio. Similarly, whenever OCEAN is unstaked, the 1SS bot takes them back. (Conceptually, it’s the same as “minting” and “burning” DTs on the fly since this all happens by robot smart contracts.)</p><p>In Ocean V4, people can still swap OCEAN ↔ DT as usual for an&nbsp;AMM.</p> 3. Mitigating Slippage <p>Here’s how slippage happens in Ocean&nbsp;V3.</p>  Staking OCEAN into a datatoken pool. Here’s what happens under-the-hood when this is initiated from V3 Ocean Market. First, half the OCEAN input is immediately swapped for DTs&nbsp;. This changes the ratio of OCEAN:DT, driving up DT price. Then, the OCEAN and DT are exchanged for pool tokens (BPTs). The staker holds the BPTs. The more OCEAN staked compared to the OCEAN already in the pool, the more the DT price rises and the more slippage there is. Slippage of &gt;10% was commonly observed.  Unstaking from a datatoken pool. Here’s what happens when someone initiates this from V3 Ocean Market. First, the user’s tokens for that pool (BPTs) are exchanged for OCEAN and DT. Then, the DT is swapped for OCEAN&nbsp;. This changes the ratio of OCEAN:DT, driving down DT price. Finally, OCEAN is sent to the user. The more OCEAN removed compared to the OCEAN remaining in the pool, the more the DT price reduces and the more slippage there is. Slippage of &gt;10% was commonly observed.  <p>In Ocean V4, slippage is solved when staking / unstaking, and mitigated in&nbsp;swaps.</p>  When staking / unstaking. In V4, whenever someone stakes OCEAN into a pool, datatokens get minted to maintain a constant DT:OCEAN ratio. Therefore there is no price change, therefore no slippage. Similarly for unstaking: ratio stays constant, and there’s no&nbsp;slippage  Swaps. When someone buys DT with OCEAN, or sells DT for OCEAN, then the ratio of OCEAN changes like it does in any AMM. If For stakers in Ocean pools, one must consider potential gains from pool swap fees and from DF rewards, against IL&nbsp;risk.   4. Vesting <p>In pure one-sided staking (1SS), the bot gets control of all the DTs. This solves rug pulls but introduces another potential challenge: is there enough of an incentive for publishers to&nbsp;publish?</p><p>Let’s examine how token projects approach this. In Bitcoin, Zcash and a few more, the founders got no tokens up-front. Rather, then the founders had to earn by creating value in the ecosystem (e.g. run a mining node). In some cases that can be enough. We can also ask: how do you further increase the incentive for founders? A small pre-mine is a useful tool here. Then, to prevent exit scam, the pre-mine is vested to founders over time (e.g. one&nbsp;year).</p><p>Ocean V4 offers the same. Publishers are incentivized to earn datatokens by getting the dataset consumed. And, Ocean V4 has the option of vesting, e.g. 10% of the datatokens vesting to the publisher over one year. This increases the incentive to publishers, while preventing exit&nbsp;scam.</p><p>Ocean V4 smart contracts and drivers support vesting. Ocean Market will have vesting in a future&nbsp;release.</p> 5. On&nbsp;fees <p>Whatever OCEAN you stake in, you get out, minus fees to liquidity providers.</p><p>The fee value is the swap fee for LPs, and is set by the publisher, typically 0.1% to&nbsp;2%.</p>  If you stake 1 OCEAN, then immediately unstake, you’ll get back 1 OCEAN minus fees you pay (about 0.01*2=0.02 OCEAN if 1%&nbsp;fee).  If you stake 1 OCEAN, then others stake another 100 OCEAN, you’ll get back 1 OCEAN minus fees you pay (about 0.02 OCEAN), plus the fees that others pay (0.01*100=1 OCEAN).   6. Caveats <p>Ocean V4 solves the Ocean V3 problem where publishers may rug pull as datatoken whales. However, since it’s a free market, there may be other shenanigans on Ocean V4, including:</p>  Classic pump &amp; dump: any actor buys many DTs cheap, pumps it, sees others buy in, then&nbsp;dumps.  Publisher exit scam: publisher gets 10% of DTs vested over a year, sees others buy DTs during that time, them dumps and disappears  Publisher pre-buy scam: publisher creates a pool with a low DT price (high ratio of DT:OCEAN), immediately buys many DTs until the price is more sane, sees others buy in, then&nbsp;dumps  <p>There are more possibilities yet. Overall, the blockchain world has seen scammy ERC20s; and datatokens have no magic powers to make them immune to such scams. Users of Ocean Market should expect that bad actors will try to find ways to prey on them, and accordingly, should stay vigilant on this. To help, users can leverage signals shown in Ocean Market (or on-chain), such as % of a pool owned by the publisher.</p> 7. Conclusion <p>This article described how Ocean V4 solves rug pulls and mitigates slippage, via one-sided staking and vesting. Section 4 described how vesting ensures sufficient incentives to publishers. Section 5 described the TE process that led to the final&nbsp;design.</p> Appendix: Token Engineering <p>This section describes the Token Engineering (TE) work that led to using one-sided staking and vesting. We follow the process in section 4.3 of “Towards a Practice of Token Engineering” [<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/towards-a-practice-of-token-engineering-b02feeeff7ca">link</a>], as used <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/token-engineering-case-studies-b44267e68f4">here</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/taqanu/tokenengineering-meetup-2-lookback-1f3b49ac8df">here</a>.</p><p>The steps are: (1) formulate the problem, (2) try an existing design against the problem formulation, and (3) try new designs until problem is&nbsp;solved.</p><p>The table below shows the result of this process. The far left column describes the problem (step 1), with each row a different goal (objective or constraint). The next column to the right is the existing pattern which is Ocean V3 (step 2). Each subsequent column to the right tries other designs until an acceptable design was found (step&nbsp;3).</p><p>Here are details on the designs considered.</p>  Design: LPB (<a href="https://docs.balancer.fi/v/v1/smart-contracts/smart-pools/liquidity-bootstrapping-faq">Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool</a>). Use as a token launch mechanism, where initially OCEAN has huge weight and DT small weight, DTs are being sold, and the weight gets more balanced over a week or two. It’s simple enough because you can set up a Balancer pool this way. But it doesn’t help&nbsp;much.  Design: 1SS (one-sided staking). This is the mechanic described in section 2. It helps a lot, though there’s reduced incentive to&nbsp;publish.  Design: LBP + 1SS. Doesn’t help beyond simply&nbsp;LBP.  Design: 1SS + Dutch:Pub. In this configuration, there’s a Dutch auction of e.g. 10% of DTs with proceeds going to publisher. This fixes the remaining problem of “1SS” design, but adds complexity.  Design: 1SS + Dutch:Pool. This configuration has a Dutch auction too, but proceeds add liquidity to the pool itself. It’s less complex but doesn’t help publisher incentives.  Design: 1SS + Dutch:Pool + Vesting. This configuration adds vesting of DTs to the publisher, as described in section 4. Yet so many mechanisms has complexity.  Design: 1SS + Vesting. This takes the previous design and removes one component (Dutch:Pool), which simplifies it while meeting the other goals. This is the design that was&nbsp;chosen.  <p>For more detail yet, please see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDG53PTbqhQ&amp;ab_channel=TokenEngineering">this video</a>, from the 55 minute mark (10&nbsp;min).</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a><a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community"> Telegram</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/"> LinkedIn</a>,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/"> Reddit</a>,<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol"> GitHub</a> &amp;<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/"> Newsletter</a> for project announcements.

			<p>Product Focus</p>
 Introducing LEGO-like onboarding solutions for digital asset investors 
<p>We have upgraded our onboarding solution with new Qualification and Subscription modules for platform owners (e.g. security token and stablecoin issuers, marketplace operators, distributors…) to tailor their onboarding processes to fit into nearly any scenario.</p>

		 
	 
                     <p>This content is taken from the monthly Product Focus newsletter in March 2022.</p>   
	 
		 
			<p>We are excited to announce that we have upgraded our onboarding solution with new Qualification&nbsp;and&nbsp;Subscription&nbsp;modules for platform owners (e.g. security token and stablecoin issuers, marketplace operators, distributors…) to onboard investors in an easier, faster and more flexible way.</p>
<p>The two modules make our solution more modular and customizable, allowing platform owners to tailor their onboarding processes to fit into nearly any scenario.</p>
 What are the Qualification &amp; Subscription modules?&nbsp; 
 
 Qualification: It enables platform owners to set up a customized website with smart workflows to check the eligibility of investors. Key features include: 
 
 
 
 
 Manage workflows depending on the investor types and countries; 
 Collect investors’ information and wallet address; 
 Conduct KYC/AML checks; 
 Qualify eligible applicants. 
 
 
 

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 
 Subscription:&nbsp;It allows qualified investors to purchase tokens. Key features include: 
 
 
 
 
 Choose payment methods (fiats, stablecoins, or/and cryptocurrencies); 
 Calculate fees for intended subscription; 
 Sign subscription documents electronically; 
 Reconcile payments and validate exchange rates; 
 Mint tokens to investors’ wallets. 
 
 
 

		 
	 
     
	 
		 
			 What are the use cases enabled by these two upgraded modules?&nbsp; 
<p>Platform owners can use both Qualification and Subscription modules, or only one of them to keep their existing processes, offering flexibility for a range of use cases. Here are some examples below:</p>
 
 For&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/marketplace/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--_RyazhG0PQ8EhDdxWXRzLB3-brEmvnXSnq9BmdIf9zzcQRkNYZoN0y6F6r08Scnv7F5IH">Marketplace</a>&nbsp;owners:&nbsp;They can qualify their users at the marketplace level, and then leverage this Qualification to accelerate the subscription for the available offerings. 
 For&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-billboard/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--_RyazhG0PQ8EhDdxWXRzLB3-brEmvnXSnq9BmdIf9zzcQRkNYZoN0y6F6r08Scnv7F5IH">Billboard</a>&nbsp;owners:&nbsp;They only need to set up Qualification for investors wishing to access the distribution network. 
 For&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-platform/?utm_campaign=Product%20Focus&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--_RyazhG0PQ8EhDdxWXRzLB3-brEmvnXSnq9BmdIf9zzcQRkNYZoN0y6F6r08Scnv7F5IH">T-REX Platform</a>&nbsp;owners:&nbsp;Especially for multi-asset and open-end securities issuers. Existing qualified investors can subscribe for tokens directly, while new investors must go through both qualification and subscription procedures. 
 
<p>Increasingly, we are enabling our partners to customize a LEGO-like and plug-and-play platform to meet their needs and explore new business opportunities with a modular infrastructure.</p>

<p>The MyData Operator Award recognises personal data companies that have shown leadership by empowering individuals to control their personal data. As promoted by the European Commission, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_6428">putting people in the centre of digital transformations is needed for a safe and sustainable digital future</a>. Further, <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_6428">boosting data sharing and ensuring its trustworthiness</a> is critical to reaping the benefits of our digitised lives. </p><p>Organizations awarded with the MyData Operator Award are vital enablers for such a vision, providing value for companies and individuals alike.</p> <br>The change of data paradigm is on  <p>Today, 33 service providers across 15 countries were awarded the status of MyData Operator 2022. A total of 41 companies and organisations have been awarded to date. The award symbolises best practice that reassures individuals, governments, investors, and other companies and organisations alike. The MyData Operator 2022 award was created by the internationally recognised nonprofit <a href="https://mydata.org">MyData Global.</a></p><p>Whilst congratulating the Awardees, Teemu Ropponen, General Manager of MyData Global, said: “We believe that empowering people with real choices over their data is rapidly becoming the norm for digital services. Innovative digital services make use of personal data extensively. Today, we celebrate those leading organisations from around the world that create tools that put people first and allow people to have a better understanding, control and agency over their data.”</p> Acknowledging best practice <p>The MyData Operator Award, launched in 2020, reflects the rising demand for a more ethical and human-centric approach to personal data. The Award process gives companies and organisations the opportunity to transparently communicate their business practices and service offering, raising trust in their operations. Further, companies must clarify how they ensure that individuals remain primary beneficiaries of their services. The awardees’ applications are made <a href="https://mydata-global.org/awarded-operators">publicly available</a>.</p><p></p><blockquote><p>A major paradigm shift is on its way.

<p>The reality for the public is that personal data management seems remote, technical, and at times incomprehensible. They are not alone. As more organisations ingest, use, store, and share personal data, concerns about data protection have increased. MyData Operator Awards emphasise the best of both worlds – promoting how privacy and data protection can be ensured, whilst outlining how companies can empower individuals regarding their data. Individual empowerment means helping individuals access, share and get insights from their digital footprints to make informed decisions and get better services. This is achieved by connecting their data, such as health, travel, or financial, with other personal data to build a comprehensive overview of their life.</p><p>MyData Operators are <a href="https://mydata.org/2021/10/28/mydata-and-the-european-unions-latest-data-developments/">examples of what the recent EU Data Governance Act</a> calls “data intermediaries”. They are set to play a critical role in the provision of the EU’s vision for data spaces. But this is not all theory and vision. Dozens of organisations are already active in the market.</p><p>MyData Vice-Chair Antti “Jogi” Poikola, commenting on the Awards and the newly published update to the “Understanding MyData Operators” white paper, noted: “The operator self-descriptions from three years of awards and associated workshops have provided rich content that was previously unavailable. &nbsp;Awarded companies have helped validate the reference model for operator services and guide actions towards interoperability. This is highly important to unlock data sharing across ecosystems and ensure it's done securely and ethically.”</p> More information <p>See the organisations awarded the MyData Operator 2022 status: <a href="https://mydata.org/award">mydata.org/award</a>.</p><p>“Understanding MyData Operators” white paper is available at <a href="https://mydata.org/mydata-operators/">mydata.org/operators</a>.</p> About MyData Global <p>MyData Global is an award-winning international nonprofit.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Welcome to a new episode of Let’s Talk About Digital Identity. And as you know pretty well, from experience and hearing from others, mobile phones are super important for identity, already they are having a leading role into that. So that’s what we’re going to discuss today.</p>
<p>And our guest today is Keiron Dalton. He’s currently UK Country Manager, and VP for International Market Development at Prove. Prior to Prove, Keiron has had roles within the GSMA’s Mobile Connect programme, BT’s mobile identity division, and has successfully helped to establish the UK mobile identity ecosystem as it stands today.</p>
<p>Hello, Keiron. Welcome.</p>
<p>Keiron Dalton: Hi, thanks for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s a pleasure talking with you, Keiron. Definitely, it’s going to be a super interesting conversation. And of course, we first would like to hear more about you, our guest today, and how you came to this world of digital identity.</p>
<p>Keiron: Yeah, sure. So, it’s probably been about a 10-year journey now. So prior to that I was kind of in a product management role working in a number of different areas. But then I joined a start-up that was based in the north of the UK. And what we did was we recognised the opportunity around mobile, when it comes to identity, authentication, and fundamentally verifying who the user is. And what we did was we accessed, at that time, data from mobile networks to establish account takeovers, things like that.</p>
<p>So that was, like I say, probably about 10 years ago. So over the last 10 years, it’s been really a focus of mine to get that concept to be kind of recognised more legitimately. So working with a number of the, in particular, banks, working with telcos and that’s globally. And that led me to joining, for example, the GSMA, working with their Mobile Connect programme, helping BT with their mobile identity proposition.</p>
<p>And then now I’m in Prove, where really, it’s taking that kind of 10 years of insight and 10 years of kind of understanding of value, and helping Prove bring that to market, both in the UK and anywhere really outside of the US. So it’s been an interesting ride. But yeah, I think it’s probably, in terms of momentum, it’s probably as fast paced as it’s ever been. So yeah, it’s quite an exciting time.</p>
<p>Oscar: Excellent. So if you can tell us very shortly what Prove does, if it’s more into the mobile authentication or to identity verification, what would you say?</p>
<p>Keiron: And so we have a very kind of short sentence to explain what we do, which is it’s phone-centric identity. So what we do is, if you think of it as being – and obviously, it can get more complicated than this – but it’s basic as leveraging the phone number as a mechanism to understand if you can trust the device, the number, the person, et cetera at the other end. So that helps with authentication, but also things like onboarding and general identity verification as well.</p>
<p>Oscar: I understand, so the key here is the mobile subscription, of course, and mobile subscription of a person, and that enables several services that tackle different problems. So thinking of this mobile-centric identity, what does mobile-centric identity offer the user that other types of identity cannot do?</p>
<p>Keiron: So the first thing I would say is its relevance. So the ubiquitous nature of mobile, and I hate saying this term, but like they– the whole digital transformation that’s particularly occurred during the whole COVID era. What we’ve done is because we centre on mobile, and we centre on creating the most frictionless journey possible but with rigor and security at the heart of it, it ensures that, like I say, there’s a relevant proposition there for anybody that has mobile as part of their offering.</p>
<p>But also, if you think of, it wasn’t that long ago that – using the banks again, as an example, they were offering tokens and people had to use hardware tokens to login, and things like that. Well, we’re using the mobile as a possession factor. And suddenly that opens up a world of opportunity around understanding whether somebody is in possession of a device, without using tokens, or even using things like SMS OTP, which is another kind of legacy technology that we’re currently in the process of reducing the reliance on.</p>
<p>So yeah, relevance is probably the key element, but also, it’s the opportunity from that relevance going forward as well, which is meaning it’s kind of resonating.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, relevance, because it’s widely used, of course, the mobile phones. I don’t know exactly what the statistic if you have statistics today, but it’s billions of people.</p>
<p>Keiron: Some crazy numbers out there. Yeah. I mean, the way I look at it is if you look at the UK as a prime example, I think there’s 90 plus million numbers now that are active. When you consider that– and this is another thing that’s critical for our proposition that any individual typically will get access to a mobile ahead of a bank account or any other kind of digital service. The average, based on current trend, is you get your first mobile when you’re 11.</p>
<p>So if you think there’s 90 plus million mobiles out there with a history and a behavioural pattern, and various other things, and a tenure fundamentally, that starts from age 11. It means you can start to get a picture of what somebody is, who somebody is, the risk associated to somebody, at a very early age. Whereas before, it was always difficult, because, you know, fundamentally, at the age of say, 16, 17, 18, it’s highly unlikely these days that you’ll have a house or utility bills or other methods of kind of confirming identity, if you like.</p>
<p>So again, it comes back to that relevance element, obviously, as you’re saying, kind of the ubiquity of mobile. And let’s face it, I think I lose track, there’s some hideous number of mobiles out there – 6 billion, or whatever it is, 7 billion, but it’s– yeah, it’s clearly obviously the most relevant kind of future-proofed method of verification as far as we’re concerned.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, no doubt. And how this translates to the benefits for things, especially from the perspective of organisations, benefits for organisations that are offering some type of mobile identification.</p>
<p>Keiron: Yeah. So if you look at that, again, I’m going to centre on the UK because I’m sat in the middle of London. We’re currently live and operational within a couple of tier one banks. And a lot of what we’re focusing on is, let’s call it kind of digital onboarding. So it’s the idea of registering for mobile app, or re-registering, but in a way that’s frictionless and secure.</p>
<p>So we’ve deployed for example, our technology, within those arenas, because those are heavy requirement for SMS OTP as a step up, which was leading to in particular fraud losses, but also friction and challenges for the end user. Because you’re constantly copying and pasting OTPs across and things like that.</p>
<p>But the second thing is just purely that frictionless element of being able to remove all barriers. And so if you look at some of the numbers, and this is where, in some instances, you’ve got a bit of a kind of unicorn, as it’s called, in terms of, from a customer experience side, we’re seeing an uplift of a minimum of 25% on day one, in terms of registrations, because of the friction being reduced.</p>
<p>And then from a fraud standing, some of the banks that we’re working, where they’re telling us that they’re saving anywhere from £100,000 to £150,000 per month, purely because you’ve got a scenario where we’re taking out the challenges of things like social engineering and scams wherever possible, and ultimately, just trying to make it as straightforward as possible, with as few clicks as possible to register for these things.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, like the account takeover protection, features like that.</p>
<p>Keiron: Yeah. So, if you think of it as being– and the last thing I want to do is go into a sales pitch. So, but if you think of it, it’s kind of two-fold in most of the use cases that we’re involved in. So first and foremost, determining the possession of the mobile number has always been done typically with an SMS OTP, where you’re asking the end user to confirm, “OK, it is me.” The problem with that is that those texts can be compromised, man in the middle attacks, social engineering, those types of things.</p>
<p>So number one, we removed the SMS OTP from the equation, and we’ve got another method, which is leveraging the network itself. But then the second element is actually getting an understanding of that number. So what is the tenure of relationship with the end user and the number? Has there been a recent SIM swap? It could even be something along the lines of, is the number a voice over IP number, or is it a mobile? And obviously, all of these things will generate different trust and risk profiles.</p>
<p>But the fundamental thing, and this has been my thought process for a long time, and thankfully, it aligns exactly with what Prove do. It’s focused on the good. So it’s focused on how can we establish trust around this number, rather than just going, “Right, something looks bad. Don’t let them through.” Because the last thing we want to do is generate tons of false positives and create that friction.</p>
<p>So the idea is that wherever we can glean confidence to give the enterprise the opportunity to let somebody register, or onboard, or whatever it may be, you know, that’s the critical element for us. And that’s the focus.</p>
<p>Oscar: And you mentioned, for instance, banks or financial institutions, you’re helping this type of organisations and still focus on organisations. What other type of organisations are benefiting most with this type of identity?</p>
<p>Keiron: Really good question. So I often get slightly fixated on the usage of the term bank. So just on a wider note. So if you look, I’d say probably the highest growth area for us at the moment is still associated to financial services, but it’s around crypto, and helping to try and provide more confidence and trust around fundamentally what’s going on in that kind of decentralised world. So that’s a high growth area that we’re seeing globally.</p>
<p>Outside of that, something that we’re seeing more and more particularly in the UK, and this actually touches on another topic that’s close to my heart around kind of vulnerability and affordability, but the whole kind of gaming gambling space. So where you’ve got individuals that are, OK, that can be onboarded, because you know, they may have a bank card that can be registered and they’ve got a name and address that is fine, and their credit history might be OK, if the gambling operator, for example, wants to, you can check that.</p>
<p>But what we’re doing at the moment is we’re– it’s kind of two-fold. It’s one, we don’t want to create any friction, as per usual, so we’re helping slicken processes up. But we’re doing that in a way with a very kind of ethical, social kind of conscious, if you like. So this is where, touching on, if you look at kind of mobile identity or digital identity, we obviously centre on that number, as I said before.</p>
<p>But actually, that number then leads us to getting an understanding of OK, who owns that number? And then from who owns that number to leveraging things like open banking, and then using open banking, then to understand vulnerability, affordability, and all of that can all be encompassed into a very straightforward process that starts very simply with a mobile phone number. But it gives the opportunity then, to get a bit more context, which is obviously something that we’re keen to do, because we don’t want to– as much as you want to slicken processes up, we don’t want to do it inappropriately, shall we say.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. And what do you say there are the key challenges with that now, OK, this type of mobile identity where we have just heard the benefits. But what are the challenges that still are today?</p>
<p>Keiron: So I’m going to go back to GSMA days. And anyone who doesn’t know the GSMA – think of them as being kind of the UN of the mobile operators, it’s pretty much where I saw them.</p>
<p>So one of their key drivers is around driving standards, consistency. And if you look at, for example, some of the things that we’re doing in the UK, or even the US or Canada, Spain, France, you know, you pick any country, it doesn’t necessarily mean that we can replicate them like for like in Mozambique, or Ghana, or Chile, I mean, just picking three random countries off the top of my head. And so, I’d look at it more the challenge is, it’s not the opportunity, it’s not the value it drives, it’s more around that global ecosystem, where it relies on the Telcos to kind of support it. Some Telcos operate at different speeds, some are interested in this, some aren’t.</p>
<p>And so, if you look at Prove as a set of capabilities, just as an example, we will enable the key capabilities that we can wherever we can. Where we can’t do that we’re always having to look at, OK, what’s the fallback? What other technologies can we leverage? What’s appropriate in a particular region? And so, it’s difficult to kind of do this cookie cutter approach and just go, “OK, we’ve done this in this country, let’s do exactly the same in another one.” Because actually, it’s relevant in some but not in all. So that’s typically the issue.</p>
<p>But I mean, one thing I would say just on the challenges side of things, one thing that any entity that’s in this space has to be really cognizant of the fact that when it comes to the operating systems as well, clearly different features, different security measures, et cetera, are being implemented on operating systems on mobiles all the time. We and I are very conscious of the fact that it’s critical that you don’t rely on too much on the device. So it’s more around the connectivity, and the fact that if you’re using a smartphone or a feature phone, the reality is it shouldn’t matter.</p>
<p>Obviously, there are certain things you need an app for, but ignoring that there should still be a route to understanding the trust of a number without having a presence on the device itself. And I think there are other vendors and other you know, there’s other entities that do very similar things. But, you know, that’s a critical thing to make sure that that ubiquity is there. At least there’s some ubiquity.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. That’s correct. That’s often one aspect that is not mentioned, because most of the newer, more modern standards and products are more focused on the high end, or the newest mobile phones, because of course, there are still the feature phones. I’m sure there are millions of those. Yeah, and…</p>
<p>Keiron: Oh, yeah. Well, you look at some of the– and we might touch on this in a second. But some of the projects that we’re working on at the moment, it’s kind of fascinating to see, even from a mobile network standpoint, that things like 2G and 3G are still leveraged for phone calls. So that it frees up, for example, the whole 5G elements so that it can focus on you know, changing the world and you know, high data throughput and things like that.</p>
<p>So it’s always a– &nbsp;kind of when the GSM standard came in, that were – we’ll say the ’90s or whatever, but if you look at that foundational element, yeah, there have been some changes and tweaks in things but you know, at its core level, whether you’re using a Nokia from 20 years ago, or you’re using the latest Samsung, the reality is, is that you’re connecting to a network in very similar ways. So it’s just all the things have been added on top, if you like, layered on.</p>
<p>Oscar: And what about the challenge, particularly when it comes to vulnerable people?</p>
<p>Keiron: Yeah, funnily enough, I’ve had an experience around this very recently with my parents. So they’re very much class as they’re the kind of critically vulnerable and they were dealing with a bank that they both use. And they were trying to do very simple things. One was getting a new card delivered, the other was adding a mobile phone number so they could receive a one-time pass code for PSD2 SCA.</p>
<p>The thing that struck me was, you know, the reality is, is not everyone has a mobile, for example, or not everyone has a digital account, online account, whatever you want to call it. But what I would say is that there is enough understanding of who the customer is, their patterns of behaviour and how they fundamentally interact with a bank or any other enterprise for that matter, they should lead to a service that is relevant for that individual.</p>
<p>And so, very kind of brief example, but when I was in BT, we were doing a lot of work– or not we, I mean, I wasn’t doing a lot of work, but BT were around vulnerable and what we can do around connected devices. And the fact is, is that if you look at BT, they’re aware or they’re connected to over 50% of UK households.</p>
<p>They know the mobile signal that somebody has like all the other Telcos do, they know whether they’ve got broadband or speed of broadband, they know, you know, all of these things are contextual insights that should be, “Well, if an individual doesn’t have a mobile and doesn’t have broadband, why are we trying to force them to do online banking, because that’s physically and fundamentally impossible?”</p>
<p>So yeah, for me, it’s one, understanding the user more and getting more context around it. But then secondly, and I’d touch again, on this older technology stuff, it’s making sure that you know, even if you can’t do everything, at least a portion of what you do, can still be done on older technology, and that you’re not leaving people behind, because it shouldn’t need an upgrade of a phone to be able to access a certain service that’s a foundational element of banking, for example.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes. So you work with– with organisations you work, you somehow help in different ways, of course, there are different scenarios, as you mentioned, to mitigate all these challenges, particularly, let’s say, vulnerable people?</p>
<p>Keiron: Yeah, it’s– what I would say is that, it’s still– how do I describe it? It’s probably embryonic in terms of some of the thoughts and the practices that are still, you know, being worked on and being introduced. Because the reality is, is that the overriding thought of any organisation is basically get people to operate digitally, save costs, et cetera, et cetera. What I would say that we’re doing more and more of is, it’s trying to help understand those that may be more vulnerable, or maybe need additional support, or different journeys, and what those journeys can look like. That doesn’t make it kind of cumbersome. And just being aware of kind of one size doesn’t fit all.</p>
<p>Another random example, but in a previous life when I was working in a different vendor, we used to deliver a phone call, which would ask the end user to enter a PIN number. We determined at some point, and it was a bank that told us that there was 80,000 customers of that bank that were hard of hearing. So they couldn’t play the process. So we had to look at other ways of authenticating.</p>
<p>So it’s that granular insight that can help you deliver a better experience or a more relevant experience. So yeah, it’s very much work in progress. But it’s something that I find quite fascinating, because it just kind of changes the thought process a little bit more.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, and it is super relevant to talk about this. I mean, because sometimes people ignore that, in all these cases, that as you mentioned, how many people have hearing problems is much bigger than one might think. So it’s important to talk about this, and keep in mind in every new project, and also, of course, in existing projects that need to be improved.</p>
<p>Keiron: Exactly. It’s an ongoing process, I think is fair to say. One thing I think that has helped as well, you know, there’s more and more kind of testing and innovation and kind of this approach around labs. We’re getting a cross section of a demographic of customers to try certain things to see how it performs and how it works. You know, I think these things are invaluable, because, you know, you can sit in a room and then theorise over a lot of things, but the reality often can be quite different. And so, yeah, that kind of testing and trying and seeing, you know, where the value is, is particularly important.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. And mobile operators are, let’s say– if you see like a GSMA, like OC and like many operators across the world, who are this category of companies who are in many countries have this role of identity providers, they are doing these roles, you are working a lot on that role as the mobile operators have this big responsibility, of course, to provide the identity.</p>
<p>And as you have mentioned also in one of the cases, it’s even providing some of these identification services, so this complementary identification services to the banks who are the other group of companies who also provide, in some countries, of course, also digital identity. So it is very important role of the mobile operators to be always, of course, very trustable, secure. So what would you say in the implications for there is a definitely a rise in scams, social engineering… So what would you say on this aspect?</p>
<p>Keiron: Yeah, really good point. So, the way I look at this is that I think a lot of kind of identity services that are out there focus on determining for example, “OK, is this the same device? Is this the same user? et cetera, et cetera.” The reality is, when it comes to social engineering, in the scam side of things, those two boxes are ticked, because it is the same user, it is the relevant person who is using the same device, et cetera, et cetera, they’ve entered the password and all that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>But obviously, there is somebody on the kind of periphery, then that’s phoning or calling or texting or whatever, to try and encourage somebody to say make a payment or make a kind of high-risk change. What we’re doing more and more of, I think fits in two buckets. So, I think there’s a huge opportunity around behavioural biometrics. We’ve acquired a company fairly recently, but just generally, there’s an opportunity there around understanding, OK, the way somebody is interacting, has there been an obvious change whether it’s been triggered by emotion or, you know, fundamentally kind of panic or whatever? Obviously, that kind of frantic tapping of buttons and things should highlight that something’s not quite right.</p>
<p>Something that we’re doing on the Telco side is we’re currently active in a project that we’re loosely calling kind of scam signals. So we’re looking at are there behaviours around a number associated to things like high-risk transactions and high-risk individuals that flag something that doesn’t seem to be right? So it could be anything from how somebody received a phone call recently, with a withheld number. Is there a phone call currently active whilst the payment is occurring? How many– have there been a number of text messages delivered to a particular number prior to a transaction?</p>
<p>There’s a whole heap of kind of data and understanding and data science that’s going on at the moment to establish, OK, what can we determine from a network level that can help a bank, or it could be pay another, you know, anybody that fundamentally, you know, can be socially engineered? You know, we want to see if we can come up with ways of mitigating that without just relying on the education element, which is what everyone has relied on up until this point.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah, that’s correct. Exactly. Mostly, we’ve been taught that education, training and awareness is mostly the only one. But of course, that’s super interesting, the approaches you just described, both on the mobile phone on the application or on the client side, and also on the operator side.</p>
<p>Keiron: Yeah. And it touches on the point you made earlier as well. I look at this in exactly the same way that the two kind of identity providers, probably too grand a term, but if you look at a bank, and you look at a Telco, between those two entities, you should have as good an understanding of somebody as literally anybody could physically have. There’s all the transactional information, there’s the tenure of associations of different brands. And then when you come over to the Telco side, you’ve obviously then got more patterns. And it could even be movement, or don’t use location as an example, because we don’t want to go anywhere near location.</p>
<p>But just understanding you know, if somebody suddenly is not in the country that’s trying to perform a transaction, without delving into where they are, that in itself is a signal that, you know, is powerful. So, between that and the bank’s understanding of where people transact and stay, I mean, it’s really a no brainer. And that’s what I mean I often coin the term that you’ve got open banking, I look at the mobile side now that it’s not quite open banking levels, but it’s almost Open Mobile, as in APIs are being created in a way that are compliant, palatable, as in you know, we’re not delving into deep secrets of anybody. The reality is, it’s questions and answers. It’s highly secure, it would mean nothing to anybody else who got access to those APIs. Similar to the banking world, but it enables us then to start verifying things that you know, potentially before we couldn’t. So yeah, it’s exciting.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, definitely. It is. It is and I could – after hearing all this conversation, I can see of course, I mean in any country, for instance, in UK, that you’re actively working, but in any country, where there is not, for instance, bank authentication or something, identity provider, very strong, yeah, mobile is definitely sounds like a great solution for that.</p>
<p>Keiron: And just to touch on that very, very quickly and conscious that I do over elaborate on the answers. If you look at it, so for example, we’re working with some customers at the moment, they have certain countries where they can’t get an understanding of risk. So maybe, for example, the credit reference agency ecosystem isn’t quite as mature as say, the UK or US or wherever else. But what we can do is we can turn around and at least give some indication of well this individual’s had this mobile for this length of time, and we’re looking at the signals that we’ve managed to establish, it looks trustworthy. So it becomes an opportunity like a new revenue stream as opposed to just being checks and balances.</p>
<p>The second thing very quickly is when you come out of banking, and you get into, or even, you know, could even be in banking, but if you’re applying for a product or a service, and you’re 17, 18 with a thin credit file, this again provides an opportunity of other ways of measuring risk and whether you should fundamentally allow it to happen or not.</p>
<p>So you’ve got people like Telefonica, you know, they do things like micro loans in Spain, and they base it on, you know, your Telco presence, as opposed to, you know, your credit history. So, you know, you could argue it’s probably more relevant, you know, if you’ve paid an iPhone bill for the last three years with the same brand, and you’ve never missed a payment and all the rest. Then, OK, I think you’re pretty good for 1000 pounds worth of a loan. So yeah, just wanted to touch on a couple of examples.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. Yeah. Thank you for that. Final question for you, for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Keiron: So I want to emphasise here that the opportunity around this, I think we very much only scratched the surface, something that I try and advocate in every speaking engagement that I ever have is carving out the opportunity to try and test and assess and look at the value and fundamentally take it from being a – or hypothetically, this could make a real difference to actually, can we test it on a subset customers? Can we do offline studies? Can we get data science teams together and look and see if there are any kind of– I love to use the term silver bullets, but sometimes there may be silver bullets, but are there indications within what we know from an identity perspective, in a world that’s largely untapped, that can enable new services or make things easier for people?</p>
<p>And so, the emphasis for me is it’s not difficult to start to look and test these things. And that can be globally as well incidentally. Because sometimes it’s interesting just saying, “Well, OK, we’ve never considered Mozambique. But it turns out you’ve got 1000 customers there, let’s try and make life easier for them. And let’s do it in a way that it’s security first and all those kinds of things, but fundamentally by doing as opposed to talking.”</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. I couldn’t agree more of course, doing things, testing as you said some services and still talking and hearing of course. Well, thanks a lot for this very interesting conversation. Keiron. Please let us know how people can follow you, get in touch with you.</p>
<p>Keiron: Yeah. I think in terms of social media, if you look for Keiron that’s K-E-I-R-O-N, Dalton on LinkedIn, more than happy to connect to anyone and everyone and have a conversation, so there’s that. If you go to prove.com, it touches on some of our solutions, plus it gives you an insight into what we’re doing globally as well. But I’d be more than happy to follow up and have conversations with anybody. Yeah. And I’m always willing to learn as well. So that’s, that’s another thing I want to make sure to throw in there.</p>
<p>Oscar: Fantastic. Again, it was a pleasure talking with you Keiron, and all the best.</p>
<p>Keiron: Thank you. Thanks very much for the opportunity.</p>

<p>Like most governments, the Scottish Government is currently going through the difficult process of deciding how to spend a shrinking amount of money on a growing list of problems. Given its “tight budgetary envelope”, says the Government’s <a href="https://www.gov.scot/publications/investing-scotlands-future-resource-spending-review-framework/">Investing in Scotland’s Future</a> paper “it is imperative that public spending is deployed as efficiently and effectively as possible” via policy interventions that help “maintain the affordability of public services over the medium to long-term”.</p><p>Within this context it is seeking to prioritise three&nbsp;things:</p>  To support progress towards meeting poverty&nbsp;targets  To address climate&nbsp;change  To secure a stronger, fairer, greener&nbsp;economy  <p>Now, we would say it wouldn’t we? But it’s true (and it applies to almost any Government you can think of, not just Scotland). On every issue identified — whether it’s efficiency savings in public spending, maintaining the affordability of public services, tackling child poverty, addressing climate change, or securing a stronger, fairer, greener economy — one, single action could help address them all: building a personal data logistics infrastructure that empowers citizens and enables the safe, efficient sharing of the data citizens and service providers need to access and provide public services.</p> Guiding principles <p>The Scottish Government says its approach to these challenges will be “heavily informed” by the principles of the Christie commission’s report on the future of public services, which says the Government should:</p>  Empower individuals and communities  Integrate service provision  Prevent negative outcomes from&nbsp;arising  Become more efficient by reducing duplication and sharing&nbsp;services  <p>Providing each individual with their own personal data store, which they can use to safely collect and store data about themselves, and share it under their control, would do all these. By enabling the right data to get to and from the right people and organisations at the right times, this citizen-empowering data infrastructure could radically reduce transaction costs for both citizens and service providers. It would both cut costs and enable service improvement.</p><p>Let’s give a quick run through those key headline priorities.</p> Improving service efficiencies <p>In work previously done by Mydex CIC for the Scottish Government we showed how a system by which public service providers deposit ‘verified attributes’ (cryptographically secure tokens confirming facts about people) in their personal data stores and that enables citizens to share this data as and when needed, could strip out huge amounts of friction, effort, risk and cost for both citizens and public services.</p><p>In particular, it would help eliminate endemic duplication of effort (e.g. recreating or checking data that has already been generated and confirmed, or simply rekeying data that already exists) and errors caused by inaccurate or out of date data (including the cost of rectifying those&nbsp;errors).</p><p>This system works like&nbsp;this.</p>  Services holding different types of data about an individual deposit verified copies of this data in the individual’s personal data&nbsp;store.  This data remains under the individual’s control in their PDS, and kept up to date and accurate via secure API&nbsp;link.  <p>3. When the citizen needs to provide some of these data points to a different service provider they simply say ‘Yes’, and the data can flow accordingly — enabling them to bring their data with them to new service relationships, without having to fill in&nbsp;forms.</p><p>Scottish Government has already formally recognised the power of this approach by deciding to establish its new Scottish Attribute Provider Service, which is based on these principles. Yet from what we can see, the potential of this new service is being overlooked, remaining unmentioned in the Government’s spending&nbsp;review.</p><p>This needs to change. This is something that is entirely within the gift of the Scottish Government, and has already been agreed. Now all that needs to be done is for it to be implemented.</p> Tackling child&nbsp;poverty <p>Current approaches to help families in poverty are grossly inefficient. Much attention has been paid to the ‘poverty premium’ where those in poverty have to pay more for basics such as energy because they cannot fit into organisations’ preferred administrative systems — e.g. paying by meter rather than by direct&nbsp;debit.</p><p>But hardly any attention is paid to the ‘poverty punishment’ — the fact that people in poverty are burdened with significant amounts of extra friction, effort, cost and stress in their lives because, to access the support they need, they need to jump through multiple hoops finding out about and seeking to access sources of support, finding and proving the information needed to prove eligibility, and repeating the same basic processes (including providing basically the same information again and again) each time they wish to apply for a new service. As a result, many people do not apply — or do not complete applications — for services they are entitled to. Which means they are punished if they do (taking on extra time, effort and stress) or if they don’t (missing out on services that they are entitled&nbsp;to).</p><p>This is compounded by the fact that, as Scottish Government reports have emphasised, poverty is complex and multifaceted. People in poverty face multiple challenges, not just one challenge. They are quite likely to have issues relating to employment, mobility (e.g. the difficulty of getting to work without a car), childcare, housing, physical and mental health etc — and every single one of the services addressing these issues operates as a separate silo, which means the situation faced by the family is never addressed in a joined up&nbsp;way.</p><p>Using the infrastructure we’ve just talked about, the Scottish Government could provide those wrestling with poverty with the means to easily and quickly find out about available sources of support, access and provide the information they need to prove eligibility for benefits and services while cutting service providers’ administration and service delivery costs. It enables poverty to be addressed as a whole, in a joined up way, efficiently and effectively.</p><p>This is something that it is within the power of the Scottish Government to do, now. And it is something that would quickly and noticeably improve peoples’ lives whilst making services more efficient. Why not do it,&nbsp;now?</p> Addressing climate&nbsp;change <p>We’ve talked about the crucial role of data in helping to tackle climate change <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/data-hidden-key-to-carbon-reduction-d5872032fc7d">here</a>. The key point is that, as well as helping to reduce paper use, providing much better data logistics — getting the right information to and from the right people and organisations — is the organising tip of a huge iceberg of physical logistics, because it is data that is used to organise the delivery of physical services. The more efficiently data is used, the bigger the multiplier effect on physical, carbon-emitting activities.</p><p>Amory Lovins, the veteran energy campaigner, notes that while attention naturally focuses on renewable energy replacements for fossil fuels (which of course are essential), the biggest immediate carbon emission reductions could come from re-designing the ways in which existing systems and services&nbsp;work.</p><p>For example, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/26/amory-lovins-energy-efficiency-interview-cheapest-safest-cleanest-crisis">he explains</a>, far less energy is needed to pump heat or cold through fat, straight pipes than skinny, long and crooked ones, because there is less friction. “In our house we save 97% of the pumping energy by properly laying out some pipes. Well, if everyone in the world did that to their pipes and ducts, you would save about a fifth of the world’s electricity, or half the coal-fired electricity.”</p><p>Using better data logistics to cut waste from decision making and implementation is a key part of the system redesign we now need. It is just waiting to be&nbsp;done.</p> Securing a stronger, fairer&nbsp;economy <p>The same personal data store-based data logistics infrastructure is also key to the creation of a stronger fairer&nbsp;economy.</p>  Stronger This infrastructure enables individuals to amass rich new sets of data about themselves in their personal data stores; data assets that simply weren’t possible to create when individuals’ data was dispersed across multiple separate organisations’ data silos. The infrastructure enables individuals to bring these rich new data assets with them to their relationships with service providers — data that will inform research and innovation in ways that were simply not possible&nbsp;before.  Fairer The same infrastructure pre-distributes power of data, by enabling individuals to build their own personal data assets independently of the organisations that have traditionally collected data about them. Instead of concentrating data power primarily into the hands of large private corporations, personal data stores build citizen-inclusion and empowerment into how a data-driven economy&nbsp;works.   Conclusion <p>In its Review the Government says;</p><p>“We will identify where there may be shared interest, duplication or overlap in intended policy outcomes over multiple portfolios. Where there is, we will look to develop a more effective and efficient cross-government solution.”</p><p>The personal data infrastructure we have described helps exactly&nbsp;that.</p><p>It also&nbsp;says:</p><p>“As well as challenging portfolios, we will also examine discrete opportunities for longer-term, large-scale public service reform and transformation that leads to both beneficial outcomes for our citizens and the realisation of more fiscally sustainable delivery mechanisms.”</p><p>In her recent speech to the National Economic Forum, Scottish Finance and Economy Secretary Kate Forbes said&nbsp;that:</p>  Scotland needs to be “a country that boosts productivity”,  “We need everybody to be empowered to participate, and everybody to share in the successes that we&nbsp;have”,  “We need to ensure we redesign services from the perspective of their users and whilst big talk about delivery might not capture the headlines, it is the delivery that is absolutely critical”,  <p>What more can we say? The citizen empowering data logistics infrastructure we are talking about fits all these goals and criteria&nbsp;exactly.</p><p>We would say it, and we are saying it. Whichever way we turn on the Scottish Government’s public spending review or national economic strategy, there is one, single, simple, low cost thing it can do to make progress on all fronts at the same time: invest in the infrastructure we’ve been talking&nbsp;about.</p><p>The Scottish Government has already recognised this infrastructure’s potential, with its decision to go ahead with SAPS, as discussed above. All it needs to do now is recognise how strategically important this move is — and to build it into its spending and investment priorities for the years&nbsp;ahead.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/public-spending-one-way-to-solve-many-problems-3ac394e46a9e">Public Spending: One Way to Solve Many Problems</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Learn where we have been and where we are going across Veriscope, the Shyft Network DAO, and upcoming deployments such as Shyft Staking, Dashboard, and Ambassador Program. <p>As we head into the start of Q2 of 2022, it’s time to update the Shyft Network community on where we’ve been over the last three months — and where we’re going. From the long-awaited formation of the Shyft DAO to the mainnet launch of Veriscope, our FATF Travel Rule solution, there’s been a great deal of activity across our core products and community, with lots more on the&nbsp;horizon.</p><p>Read below for what’s happening (and coming up) across Veriscope, the Shyft DAO, Shyft Staking, a forthcoming Ambassador program and Shyft ID Manager Dashboard.</p><p>As global regulation grows and lawmakers tighten their grasp on crypto across jurisdictions, there’s never been a more crucial time for Shyft Network to exist. Below, you will learn more about what we’ve been building for the future of compliance, identity, and privacy across our different technologies and industry-ready solutions.</p> Veriscope Launch <p>What: Veriscope officially launched on the Shyft Network mainnet, allowing the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges and liquidity providers to run billions of dollars worth of transactions in a way that is fully compliant with the FATF (Financial Action Task Force)’s Travel Rule and still protects their tens of millions of customers’ privacy.</p><p>The team has started deploying Veriscope smart contracts to mainnet so that our VASP partners can make public attestations on the Shyft Federated blockchain versus testing in isolation.</p><blockquote>Read: <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-core-team-open-sources-veriscope-makes-travel-rule-compliance-open-free-and-adb4a8b6945e">Shyft Network Core Team Open Sources Veriscope, prepares to enable cross solution discovery to Make Travel Rule Compliance Open, Free, and Simpler than&nbsp;Ever</a></blockquote><p>Partners’ transactions are fully on-chain, and their attestations have the option to be posted from the anniversary date of all crypto withdrawals from their platform to the present day. This solves what has become known as the “Sunrise Issue,” whereby regulated VASPs can experience roadblocks when requiring customer details from VASPs who operate in jurisdictions where the Travel Rule has yet to be implemented. Veriscope permits historic lookbacks on any transaction broadcasted to Veriscope.</p><p>VASPs can post information requests (aka attestations) whether their counterparty VASP is integrated or not into Veriscope, and VASPs can respond to information requests for transactions that occurred before they integrated with Veriscope. This unique approach to travel rule solves the Sunrise Issue by allowing for on-chain transaction broadcasts, which provide an open, permanent audit trail.

The Shyft DAO aims to facilitate perpetual advancement of the Shyft protocol, to enable institutional blockchain adoption in compliance with local and global regulation without sacrificing user data privacy or sovereignty.</p><blockquote>Read: <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/introducing-the-shyft-network-dao-a6c63b9dd18e">Introducing the Shyft Network&nbsp;DAO</a></blockquote><p>The Shyft DAO will enable community governance over Shyft DAO assets by allowing community members to make proposals regarding the operation of the Shyft Network, as well as voting on proposals made by other community members, and participating in the deployment of various network economic systems such as the Shyft staking pool, AMM &amp; Yield Wrap&nbsp;Rewards.</p><p>As you can read in the <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-shyft-dao-month-one-recap-52705ad5ef72">Shyft DAO Month One Recap blog</a>, the first month of the DAO was primarily focused around the initial formation and the election of the seven key signers, including three from the Shyft Community, two from the Shyft Federation, and two from the Shyft Core team: BlockUnity and&nbsp;PayCase.</p><p>Future action and proposals regarding the Shyft DAO include the formation of the six DAO committees (Treasury &amp; Economics, Operations, Governance &amp; Oversight, Technology, Ecosystem, Business Development &amp; Partnerships, and Marketing and Community) and proposals to deploy future initiatives like Shyft Staking and the forthcoming Shyft Ambassador program, which you can read more about&nbsp;below.</p><p>When: Ongoing. We expect proposals on Shyft Staking and the Ambassador program to go live on the forum in Q2 of&nbsp;2022.</p><p>Keep up with all DAO-related updates on <a href="https://discord.gg/JGac8fqk">Discord</a>, <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/">Medium</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork">Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork">Telegram</a>. All you need to join the DAO is to hold Shyft (SHFT). We’d love to have&nbsp;you!</p> Shyft Staking <p>What: Shyft Staking gives the Shyft DAO the ability to regulate different types of distribution capabilities of the SHFT token. This modular system allows the community to determine how to best regulate this system (and inflation) from a policy and economic perspective.</p><p>Staking will distribute inflation into three different categories: nodes, DAO, and <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network-media/shyft-network-initiates-a-phased-mainnet-rollout-and-announces-byfrost-its-revolutionary-bridging-d0c1c827c379">Byfrost</a>, a bridging technology and infrastructure that enables creation and routing of synthetic assets across multiple blockchains as well as on-chain asset custody and management</p><blockquote>Read: <a href="https://medium.com/shyft-network-media/shyft-network-initiates-a-phased-mainnet-rollout-and-announces-byfrost-its-revolutionary-bridging-d0c1c827c379">Shyft Network initiates a phased mainnet rollout and announces Byfrost, its revolutionary bridging technology</a></blockquote><p>When: A primary goal of deploying Shyft Staking is to secure the Byfrost Bridge infrastructure, which was first initiated in April of 2019. There is expected to be an upgrade to the Byfrost Bridge infrastructure that will be run by the DAO to secure the chain bridge through a proof-of-stake mechanism.</p><p>To make this possible, the Shyft Network DAO is expected to roll out Shyft Staking, which will commence following April 4th’s hard fork. This generalized staking infrastructure would then be deployed on top of the Shyft&nbsp;Network.</p><p>The long-term goal of the system is that the more stake that has been added, the more secure the system that it supports&nbsp;is.</p> Shyft Dashboard <p>What: The Shyft Dashboard is an attestation and consent manager that is expected to live on the Shyft Network <a href="https://www.shyft.network/">website</a>. The interface will gradually aggregate and organize your user data and asset ownership across multiple blockchains.</p><p>At launch, the Dashboard is expected to include a currency watch list and will integrate your NFT wallet (MetaMask-enabled) to allow you to track data pertaining to compliance, KYC, and AML. You would be able to view all the cryptocurrency tokens in your wallet, including price activity and other key data. Once Shyft Staking is fully deployed, you would have the ability to to stake SHFT through the dashboard.</p><p>When: Expected in Q2, 2022 (tentative), for the&nbsp;v1.0.</p> Shyft Ambassador Program <p>What: We are excited to share that the Shyft DAO will soon be launching an Ambassador Program. This program aims to further decentralize the protocol, involve the community, and delegate responsibilities to grow the Shyft ecosystem. The Ambassador roles and responsibilities will grow and evolve pending the needs of the Shyft DAO and the ambassador contributions. The first Ambassador track is for Community Leaders.</p><p>This Ambassador proposal will seek to gain consensus among the Shyft community around what a Shyft community leader should represent and how they will interact with the rest of the DAO. Additionally, the proposal seeks to identify and select candidates for the position.</p><p>Ambassadors will be elected for a predefined period of three months with the option to be reinstated pending performance and the community vote.</p><p>Stay tuned for a formal blog and community announcement regarding the launch of the Ambassador program, including key info on how to&nbsp;apply.</p><p>When: Expected in Q2,&nbsp;2022.</p><p>Thanks for reading our Q1-Q2 roadmap! We are excited to continue sharing more news of future deployments and watching many of these critical projects unfold for the betterment of the global crypto industry.

Given the security risks and inconvenience of using passwords, many organizations are looking to completely eliminate and replace passwords with more secure authentication methods. As credential theft and ransomware attacks continue to rise, the logical step is to move away from passwords. Done right, it increases both security and convenience. However, with the device becoming a central factor in secure passwordless authentication, device trust is essential and must be incorporated into the security posture of any organization. Only then will passwordless authentication deliver to the expectation and become a cornerstone of zero trust approaches.

<p>We’re thrilled to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/globalid-and-anchainai-unveil-first-technical-framework-for-regulatory-compliance-when-interacting-with-non-custodial-wallets-301517660.html?tc=eml_cleartime">announce the publication</a> of the PRIVATE white&nbsp;paper.</p><p>PRIVATE is a new technical framework developed in collaboration with AnChain.AI that carves out a path toward regulatory compliance for non-custodial wallets while preserving user privacy. (PRIVATE stands for Privacy Preservation through Resolution of Identity via Verification and Attestation for Travel Rule CompliancE)</p><p>Until now, efforts around regulatory compliance in the digital asset space have focused on centralized, custodial solutions. That includes Coinbase’s recently announced <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/introducing-the-travel-rule-universal-solution-technology-trust-232774d76674">TRUST platform</a>, a coalition that also includes industry heavyweights such as Fidelity, Circle, and&nbsp;Gemini.</p><p>That’s a great&nbsp;start.</p><p>The explosion of mainstream and institutional interest in digital assets, fueled in part by the rapid rise of DeFi and NFTs last year, has shone a bright spotlight on what is still a nascent space. But in order for these innovative new ecosystems to make a long-term, positive impact for end users, they’ll need to comply with existing and upcoming regulations.</p><p>SEC Chief Gary Gensler argued last summer that developments in decentralized finance likely <a href="https://decrypt.co/78933/sec-chair-gary-gensler-wants-to-regulate-defi">fall under the scope of his agency’s oversight</a>.</p><p>That begins with addressing regulations for custodial services such as exchanges, but it also requires answering the question of non-custodial wallets, which, today, serve as the primary portal into the web3 universe.</p> Why non-custodial wallets&nbsp;matter <p>Non-custodial wallets rest at the heart of how blockchain technology works. They’re software applications — or in some cases, hardware devices — that allow you to directly interact with their corresponding blockchain. You can hold funds, receive tokens, or initiate transactions.</p><p>In essence, it’s a digital wallet where you, the user, directly control your digital assets. It’s not so different from having cash in your wallet or assets stored away in a safe in your&nbsp;house.</p><p>Contrast that with custodial wallets, which act more like your typical bank account. A service provider, such as a crypto exchange like Coinbase, manages your funds for you. Because these services mirror things we’re already used to, the path toward regulatory compliance is also more straightforward. A service provider that is already managing user funds has direct touchpoints for also managing a user’s identity and&nbsp;trust.</p><p>The same cannot be said for non-custodial wallets, which represent a unique framework for how we understand the management of digital value and as such, require a specialized approach to regulatory compliance while preserving the very tenets of privacy and self-sovereignty which DeFI services are based&nbsp;around.</p><p>That requirement became all the more pressing last October, when the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) updated their recommendations, which encompassed everything from DeFi to stablecoins to wire transfers. Specifically, recommendation 179c updated their guidance on non-custodial wallets.</p><p>The updated guidance requires that customer information be collected for virtual asset transfers in order to enforce anti-money laundering rules like sanction screening and transaction monitoring.</p><p>That’s where PRIVATE comes&nbsp;in.</p> Enter PRIVATE <p>The PRIVATE framework’s secret sauce is decentralized identity. Perhaps unsurprisingly, decentralized identity and decentralized finance are a natural&nbsp;fit.</p><p>The first benefit is privacy. Identity verification can be achieved without revealing a wallet’s true owner. As such, PRIVATE allows for regulatory compliance while fully preserving user&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>The second benefit is control. Rather than relying on a corporation or government agency, users own their corresponding digital identity just as they own their non-custodial wallet. You might call it a non-custodial identity, preserving the decentralized spirit of non-custodial wallets and web3 offerings in&nbsp;general.</p><p>Moreover, PRIVATE is not designed to replace custodial solutions and corresponding compliance platforms such as TRUST. Instead, PRIVATE complements these existing approaches by allowing custodians to seamlessly and compliantly interact with the web3&nbsp;world.</p> What’s next <p>Here’s the reality. Regulations are&nbsp;coming.</p><p>On March 31st, the European Union Parliament <a href="https://blockworks.co/eu-parliament-committees-vote-to-crack-down-on-crypto-transfers/">passed measures</a> to end anonymous crypto transactions. The proposal requires crypto service providers to collect and share information about all parties involved during asset transfers. This is one of the first major attempts at establishing formal requirements for crypto exchanges, and it certainly will not be the&nbsp;last.</p><p>As such, providing solutions that simultaneously satisfy DeFi stakeholders who prioritize decentralization, and regulatory entities who prioritize oversight is going to play a critical role in the development of&nbsp;web3.</p><p>GlobaliD and AnChain.AI have begun development of an end-to-end solution around the PRIVATE technical framework. This is no small task and we look forward to collaborating with anyone who shares our commitment toward preserving individual autonomy and privacy while abiding by the rules of the&nbsp;road.</p><p>If you’re interested in contributing to the development of PRIVATE, please reach out: privateframework@global.id</p>  <a href="https://privateframework.com/">Download the PRIVATE white&nbsp;paper</a>  <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/globalid-and-anchainai-unveil-first-technical-framework-for-regulatory-compliance-when-interacting-with-non-custodial-wallets-301517660.html?tc=eml_cleartime">Press release</a>  <p>See also:</p>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/defi-enabled-xdc-network-integrates-globalid-8eddac93fbc">DeFi-enabled XDC Network integrates GlobaliD</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/trusted-airdrops-with-globalid-cf7cd6b51797">Trusted Airdrops with&nbsp;GlobaliD</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-kevin-boehm-head-of-product-27e1f21cf580">Meet the Team — Kevin Boehm, Head of&nbsp;Product</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/introducing-private-65fce62c6a8e">Introducing PRIVATE</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Earlier today, Germany’s&nbsp;Central Office for Combating Cybercrime (ZIT) and the Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA)&nbsp;announced the take-down of the Russian-language darknet market Hydra. Elliptic’s analysis shows that the platform – which was the largest such market operating on the dark web – has facilitated over $5 billion in Bitcoin transactions since beginning operations in December 2015.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Furthermore, as part of its efforts to counter the threat of ransomware, the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today announced new sanctions against Hydra Market and an Estonian crypto exchange called Garantex. It also included more than 100 crypto addresses on the OFAC sanctions list as part of the action.</p>

<p>The first blockchain technology use case into eco-friendly electric car energy ecosystem</p><p>Metadium joined the EMC consortium with technology partner Coinplug and three more specialized companies in each field. They are all in MYKEEPiN Alliance (DID alliance operated by Coinplug) and this news will be one of representative business projects. There are introductions of each company and assigned roles in this project as&nbsp;below.</p><p>MAIV</p><p>A manufacturer specializing in EV mobility, which manufactures eco-friendly ultra-small electric vehicles ‘MAIV’. They promoted various projects including Gangneung Smart City Challenge project, Hadong-gun smart tourism city, and many kinds of related technology-based vehicle rental business.</p><p>DRIMAES</p><p>​​DRIMAES develops solutions which can give authentic experience in the mobility area. Since existing cars have evolved into smart cars, IVI(In-Vehicle Infotainment) has become an essential part of in-vehicle experiences. DRIMAES efforts to provide authentic experiences to users through connection between IVI and everything. Through this project, they provide development and services in the entire vertical area from energy charging facilities to mass-produced electric vehicles to blockchain network communication.</p><p>Gridwiz</p><p>It is a clean energy company that solves the energy concerns of about 1,000 industrial customers through data-based clean energy services and leads the new energy industry. They recently launched smart charger ‘dotori’, and plans to build a smart charging infrastructure and support connectivity to energy services.</p><p>Coinplug and&nbsp;Metadium</p><p>They have developed many eco-friendly projects such as blockchain-based Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) transaction platform and wind power operational security solution for KOSPO. And they applied the DID technology to the order/delivery O2O project recently, through that it will support the integration of DID into electric vehicles and charging infrastructure.</p><p>Through this project, Metadium will use DID technology to solve the problems of identification/ authentication issues related to people and devices. And will cooperate with coinplug for point charging/ payment based FT utility token technology and coupon/voucher usage with NFT technology in the worldwide business.</p><p>Blockchain DID technology can solve various issues related to privacy information such as sensitive inter-country data transmission, facial recognition data and so on. We hope to make more synergy through previous projects that have been done with coinplug in this&nbsp;project.</p><p>Please look forward to more activities of the EMC consortium.</p><p>If you have any questions then please do not hesitate, feel free to contact&nbsp;us.</p><p>Metadium team</p><p>Join our community</p><p>Website | <a href="https://metadium.com/">https://metadium.com</a></p><p>Telegram(EN) | <a href="http://t.me/metadiumofficial?fbclid=IwAR3MeXsYSQbBpKEuxTMdtNKMBDGnBpniwKrmLAoNCvGL80qVdXjpS65O0t0">http://t.me/metadiumofficial</a></p><p>Kakaotalkopenchat | <a href="https://open.kakao.com/o/g5uZ296c">https://open.kakao.com/o/g5uZ296c</a></p><p>Facebook | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Metadium">https://www.facebook.com/Metadium</a></p><p>Twitter | <a href="https://twitter.com/MetadiumK">https://twitter.com/MetadiumK</a></p><p>Medium | <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">https://medium.com/metadium</a></p><p>Brunch | <a href="https://brunch.co.kr/@metadium">https://brunch.co.kr/@metadium</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/medium-joined-in-emc-energy-mobility-cluster-consortium-2b4874b2d473">Medium joined in EMC(Energy Mobility Cluster) Consortium</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Metadium</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Opacity hurts. I was in a <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin IoT</a> call when I heard the phrase “juicy telemetry.” A digital twins product leader was bemoaning all the really good data held back by the manufacturers of equipment. Data they needed to properly model their twins, to keep them current, to validate their assumptions. For good and bad reasons, the makers of wind turbines and cars and ship engines and weather sensors choose to hide data. </p>



 
 <blockquote><p>Juicy Telemetry: The device data held back by a manufacturer from the device's users and owners. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IoT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IoT</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IIoT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IIoT</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SSI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SSI</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DataScience?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DataScience</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DigitalTwin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DigitalTwin</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JuicyTelemetry?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#JuicyTelemetry</a></p>— Phil Wolff 狼爱马 (@evanwolf) <a href="https://twitter.com/evanwolf/status/1507068886352482313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 24, 2022</a></blockquote> 
 



<p>Some of it is raw sensor data, like an unprocessed image that’s turned into a human pulse rate. When you’re combining data from diverse manufacturers and generations of equipment (like just about everybody), you know that understanding how raw data is collected, how it’s processed, how it’s interpreted means everything to the consistency and semantic meaning of your aggregate data set.  </p>



<p>Other times it is metadata about the device itself, like versions of the operating system and apps running on the device, useful in calibrating data sets against data quality. In the 2018 version, ocean temperatures were calibrated to standard X but those made after 2023 we’re tuned to standard Y. </p>



<p>And it is increasingly useful to understand the robots inside our robots, the components that have their own information systems that affect data quality and provenance. Nested dolls in conversation. </p>



<p>Another dimension of device opacity is less juicy and more accountable. Things are windows or portals through cyberspace to other parties. Do you have any idea how hard it is to get clarity from a system about who owns it? Who it talks to? Where its data goes? Who regulates it? Hard.</p>



<p>Digital twin operators and others who consume data from devices spend vast amounts of time wrangling data into shape. This is common in data science too. I’ve heard 80 percent of effort in passing, from several folks. </p>



<p>But manufacturers have become a data bottleneck. By choice, sometimes. </p>



<p>For expediency, like trying to preserve device battery life or conserve data consumption. </p>



<p>Sometimes out of fear. That a rival might copycat them. That a whistleblower might point out errors. That a lawyer might seek discovery. </p>



<p>Occasionally out of greed, hoping to extract fees for premium data or premium analysis in the future. Or to secure service revenue by obscuring information needed to repair. Off a device already paid for by a customer.</p>



<p>So what can product managers do about this? </p>



<p>No, really! What can someone who wants to address this issue do at the earliest stages in product conception and design to make this better? </p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Andrea Beskers</a></p><p>A poor user experience is increasingly becoming a no-go for customers, even to the point of them not buying a product. So a good user experience is a must, but how can you achieve that without neglecting security?&nbsp;Candace Worley from Ping Identity will elaborate on this challenge in her Keynote <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5057">Human-Centric Identity</a> on Thursday, May 12, at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2022</a>.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked Candace some questions about her presentation.</p>
<p> </p>
 What is Human-Centric Identity? 
<p>So human-centric identity is taking an intentional approach to personalizing how users interact with the solutions that I.T. administrators create. For me, it's based on the notion that there must be a balance between identity as an experience and identity as a security function. So a line of business owners knows that their users have lots of choices in the market and that those users have become intolerant of bad experiences. They have a bad experience with your app, but they have a bad experience with your website. They will simply find someone else. I had a colleague of mine share an example with me the other day, he says, talking with my teenage daughter and we were talking about where to go for dinner, and I recommended a restaurant and her response shocked me. It was that I don't like that restaurant. Their app is terrible. We've now come to a time where digital experience is more important than ever. A teenager granted, but a teenager will decide whether or not they like a restaurant, not based on the food or the atmosphere or the service but on whether or not their digital app was a good experience for them. Now, companies are knowing nowadays that the more that they can offer a great identity experience for someone who's engaging with them. And frankly, whether they're an employee or a user, but especially a customer, the more likely they are to retain that customer for the long term. Now, this is equally important for employees, right? We want our employees to be productive. And I would imagine that all of us have had the experience of trying to get logged into an app, trying to get logged into the website, trying to get logged into our PC. Something goes wrong with identity, and now we're late for a meeting. We're not getting a document done. We can't get our focal review done because we can't get logged into the app. So building those user experiences that make it easy and seamless for an employee or a user to access the resources that they need to be productive or get to their health care portal to get their lab results or whatever that might be is critically important. And a human-centric identity kind of means that businesses work toward delivering an environment where integration is actually built into the digital ecosystem through drag and drop interfaces and workflow automation. That requirement of writing thousands of lines of code to integrate applications has got to go away. And it's got to be replaced with things like orchestration, where it's facilitating a great user experience through delivering journey-based flows. And finally, what that does is it's making it easier for the administrator, easier for the developer to create experiences that resonate with both employees and their customers.</p>
<p></p>
 What is driving the need for Human-Centric Identity?  
<p>So leading vendors that are focused on great service and user experience are changing the game and the perception of what's possible and what's accepted. It's no longer tolerated to prioritize the needs of the company over the needs of the user. They have to be treated as equals going forward, if not, users are just going to leave and find some of the companies to do business with. Today's approach to identity adds friction to the end-user experience, both at work and for users who are engaging with your organization not as employees, but as customers. Now, identity has been very focused on security rather than user experience, and there's good reason for that, right? You need both security and user experience. I'm not saying you should trade one-off for the other, but certainly, I think we need to come to some balance in that tradeoff that we've been making. No user, whether an employee or a customer, actually wants to deal with an identity process. They just want to get access to what they need to do their job or make an acquisition of products or whatever that might be. In both of those scenarios, both user and customer, identity processes get in the way of them doing what they need to do. You know, that could be, like I said, accessing their Confluence app. It could be getting on to their favorite retail site to send a gift to their mother for their birthday, whatever that may be, the identity process is just something they have to go through. It's not something they want to go through and we haven't exactly made it easy either at the vendor level or I'd say at the corporate level for them to have a really seamless experience. Now, the downstream impact of not delivering a great experience for the organization is, They're slower to react to market changes and customer feedback results in loss of potential loss of their customers, decreased revenues, lower engagement rates with customers, etc. And these trade-offs have limited organizations as they attempt to kind of design a secure and seamless experience for their users.</p>
<p></p>
 How will Human-Centric Identity change the way IT professionals design systems and solutions? 
<p>Yeah. So the focus is going to change. The focus will be on delivering seamless and secure experiences and that's really going to be where people or organizations make their investment. Enterprises need the ability to implement great user experiences easily and have the ability to make changes rapidly based on user behavior and user feedback. So for the administrator, it's really going to be moving from manual integrations and writing code to integrate multiple apps to a low-code, no-code orchestration that easily integrates with other applications and makes it possible to create user journeys that extend across multiple capabilities regardless of the vendor. The simplification of integrations, menu style libraries, and the ability to do things like AB testing on the fly for four flows before implementation will allow them to deliver seamless user experiences they'll also allow them to make very rapid changes as they get feedback. Because if you're now having to change hundreds of lines of code, you can make changes very very quickly. AB test them if it's not right, etc.. So it really facilitates the creation of great user experiences. I think the other thing is for kind of employees creating a better experience where perhaps you know, you're using more password-less or organizations are moving in the direction of using adaptive technology so that when a user comes to the site, whether that be an employee or a customer, that adaptive technology maybe knows a little bit about them. It's looking at what device they're using, it's looking at what may be the location they're coming in from. And based on that, the system can make some assumptions about whether or not this is a known entity what may be we already know enough about them that we can let them through without authentication. So really looking at how can we leverage technology in our identity process, in our identity stack to streamline the experience for the end-user.</p>
<p></p>
 Where would you recommend IT professionals start? 
<p>First, There's no such thing as a single identity vendor that can deliver everything that a company needs, either from a technical or an experience perspective. So vendors must understand and accept that they are part of a broader ecosystem today and they need to deliver capabilities that support that they need to continue to build to open standards. But beyond that, they need to deliver platforms that are vendor agnostic, that allow companies to use their platform and the native applications that were built on top of it, but also allow for integration of third parties into that platform, so they become part of a seamless user journey. Second, they need to leverage orchestration capabilities to deliver identity experiences built through a series of flows that can sell identity and security services. And finally, we need to be thinking about personal identity as a part of a process, you know, personal identity is evolving. And as we think about, you know, where we want to go as kind of an identity industry, but also where end users want us to go. Today, they worry about their identity and their privacy. And we are entering an age where technology is going to allow individuals to take control of their identity and in turn, their privacy. So there is a time ahead where we as individuals will become the administrators of our own identity. And so from an administrator perspective, they're going to be looking at a different set of tools, a different approach. But over time, we as individuals will have control of the identity artifacts or attribute that organizations need to validate that we are who we say we are. And I think that we are on the precipice of that time.</p>

The aim is to support Web3 innovation on Ontology, particularly in privacy and decentralized identity, and provide long term support to those driving change. A $100K USD developer prize pool will also be available.</p><p>All participating projects at the hackathon will receive technical and strategic support from the Ontology team. Half the $100,000 USD prize pool will be given out based on judges’ voting. The other half will be made available through quadratic funding, a democratic way of matching funding based on a group’s perspective of something’s value, to assign the money to new hackathons and grant projects.</p><p>The <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a> blockchain is a high speed, low cost public blockchain.

<p>On the 31st of March, MetaMUI held an AMA session with GemMouse Capital which is one of the largest Vietnamese Blockchain community, and has over 110,000 Telegram community members, and 13,000 Twitter followers.</p><p>In this AMA, Phantom Seokgu Yun, CEO of Sovereign Wallet Network &amp; Project Lead of MMUI, and Cizar Bachir Brahim, CSO of Sovereign Wallet Network &amp; MMUI, mainly talked about the problems that the current public blockchains are now facing and how MetaMUI has overcome those issues by implementing various new features inside the MetaMUI Blockchain.</p><p>If you missed this event and would like to know what MetaMUI is all about, you can find a recap of the interview here.</p><p>Question 1: Could you introduce project&nbsp;MetaMUI?</p><p>Phantom: MetaMUI is a mainnet blockchain jointly developed by SovereignWallet Network, SWN Global, and the University of Southern California. USC Viterbi School of Engineering school as our Research partner led by Prof. Neuman and Prof. Krishnamachari. We have a multinational and highly talented team of Blockchain engineers, Architects, marketers, and advisors. We are already present in 7 countries, 3 continents, dispatched between the USA, Korea, Singapore, Sweden, India, and Uzbekistan.</p><p>There are three leading blockchain research universities including MIT, Cornell and USC in USA. Silvio Micali, Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, founded Algorand, and Emin Gun, Associate Professor of Computer Science at Cornell University, founded AVA Labs, known as the blockchain development lab for Avalanche. We, Sovereign Wallet Network, have worked together with USC since 2019 and have been successful in redesigning Blockchain technology and developed MetaMUI, the 1st identity-based Blockchain, which is considered the 4th generation Meta blockchain, capable of generating independent blockchains inside the main blockchain. It gives users the possibility to publish various kinds of Meta-Coins on our MetaMUI platform.</p><p>Our MetaMUI’s Meta-Coin has strong advantages when compared to Ethereum’s ERC20 token. Meta-Coin does not require any complex smart contract programming for minting. MetaMUI is the first blockchain to achieve the decentralization of smart contract operations. MetaMUI’s chain code (smart contract) can run on the edge of the blockchain, which means the user’s device such as a smartphone, and can apply the user’s information on the edge. Additionally, one can generate Meta-NFT(Non-Fungible Token)s without programming smart contracts so basically, any user can publish NFTs, tokenized assets, digital stocks instantly.</p><p>Question 2: what makes MetaMUI different from others and what are the strengths of your project compared to other projects?</p><p>Phantom: There are many differences between the current public blockchains (such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Solana) and MetaMUI. There are many unique features of MetaMUI, but I will mention only three of them&nbsp;here.</p><p>Firstly, MetaMUI is the only blockchain that can run multiple blockchains inside the MetaMUI Blockchain. MetaMUI is providing complete interoperability between ledgers, and it allows every blockchain to have its own ledger. For example, if the Central Bank of Vietnam wants to issue its own CBDC(Central Bank Digital Currency), we support a dynamic minting system which means the Central Bank of Vietnam can issue the Vietnamese CBDC without any programming but with just a single click of a button. Once the Central Bank of Vietnam succeeds to issue the CBDC, it can be transferable to other CBDCs like Indonesian, Cambodian, and other southeast Asian countries’ CBDC and even other continents’ CBDC. So in this case, MetaMUI is supporting not only every country to have their own CBDC on their own mainnet ledger, but also the atomic swap between CBDCs and other digital assets are possible. (This is a much bigger and better version of&nbsp;Uniswap)</p><p>Secondly, MetaMUI is the only blockchain that implemented DPKI(Decentralized Public Key Infrastructure) and Identity Blockchain in the blockchain structure. There are many banks and institutes still using a centralized PKI system, and it causes lots of problems like possible hacking of personal data because of a single point of failure and other critical issues that have brought huge damages continuously. In MetaMUI, every ownership of assets is bound to the users’ identity and the personal data is securely stored in the device. Everyone in the crypto space is exposed to the circumstance that private keys might be stolen by hackers or lost forever because of carelessness in private key management. To prevent this, MetaMUI enables linking the ownership of the asset not to private key but to users’ identity and which means crypto investors no longer need to worry about losing private keys because private keys can be replaced after verifying the user’s identity to its blockchain system. MetaMUI Blockchain is the only blockchain that is supporting this feature in the blockchain industry, and this function will bring mass adoption of blockchain technology to real-world applications.</p><p>Lastly, MetaMUI supports more than 1 million transactions per second. MetaMUI has improved the transaction speed and scalability through hybrid architecture. MetaMUI combines its blockchain technology with NetCheque and NetCash, invented by Clifford Neuman, Associate Research Professor of USC. This hybrid architecture allows MetaMUI to execute two kinds of transactions at the same time. For microtransactions, MetaMUI uses the P2P cash protocol, so millions and billions of microtransactions are possible in a second with parallel node connections. For higher volume payments and transactions like remitting money overseas and cross-border payments, we use decentralized architecture to achieve high security and decentralization. Thanks to its hybrid architecture, unlimited scalability is possible and this enables a true Peer to peer payment this will bring a new era of digital currency to solve the technical problems that many countries are now facing with their CBDC development.</p><p>Question 3: Can you please provide some information about your Roadmap and how is MetaMUI progressing so&nbsp;far?</p><p>Cizar: MetaMUI platform is the first-ever identity-based blockchain that utilizes a hybrid payment architecture for maximum efficiency and solves the Central Bank Digital Currency ‘CBDC’ design trilemma. To publish the meta-tokens on MetaMUI, Central Bank Node should stake a certain amount of MetaMUI and guarantee all transaction fees related to token transfers. MetaMUI is becoming very popular as a Central Bank Digital Currency ‘CBDC’ publication platform among many nations in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. (Vietnam Central Bank included) In this case, the government or national central bank will use the MetaMUI Network to run their CBDC projects, and this will become a project fund and will be reserved in the MetaMUI treasury to control the circulating volumes of&nbsp;MetaMUI.</p><p>At the beginning of this year, we have successfully launched our MetaMUI SSID App for the National ID system, e-Government, and CBDC. We have also concluded a CBDC pilot project with an indigenous nation in Northwestern Australia.</p><p>In addition to CBDC publication, MetaMUI has more utilities such as Digital Stock Exchange, Asset Tokenization, User-generated NFTs. Throughout the process, the amount of MetaMUI needed to be paid to MetaMUI node will increase. This will vaporize the number of MetaMUIs in circulation. Holders of MetaMUI can have the chance to run a mobile node to participate in the consensus protocol and received incentives based on the proof of contribution. In short, you can make money by running the MetaMUI node on your smartphone.</p><p>We are aiming to build an entire ecosystem to support MetaMUI network. To do so we are seeking collaborations and partnerships with different blockchain communities and associations, around the world to join this&nbsp;network.</p><p>MetaMUI has concluded important partnerships during the past 15 months. A strategic partnership with OMFIF: Official monetary and financial institutions forum, OMFIF is one of the well-known financial thinktank based in London. Most of the Central Banks and international financial institutions/organizations have been active members within OMFIF where accelerated dynamic and lots of research around digital currencies has been conducted.</p><p>We are also a pioneer member of the Blockchain Research Institute (BRI) and an active contributor to multiple BRI research projects initiated by Don Tapscott (the Blockchain pioneer and author of many best-selling books)</p><p>MetaMUI is an institutional member of the DEA (Digital Euro Association), and an active member in different DEA Working Groups around CBDC and Stablecoins. We have joined as the research partner, and we will introduce our MetaMUI CBDC solution to the DEA under the Digital Euro Initiative launched by the European Central Bank ‘ECB’, our focus is to build a Synthetic CBDC solution for European countries, and will contribute to solving the design trilemma of what current Euro is facing. We also have partnerships with the NBA (Nordic Blockchain Association) and the DEA (Digital Euro Association). We have been in talks with well-known payment companies all over the world to introduce our blockchain-based payment system, and we are planning to build a consortium alongside banks, payment companies, consulting firms, and blockchain networks of experts in&nbsp;Europe.</p><p>Question 4: A lot of projects are always talking about their strengths, but most of them are having a problem with the mass adoption and sustainability of the projects. As one of the leaders of MetaMUI, would you dare say the difficulties that MetaMUI is facing, and how long it will take to overcome&nbsp;it?</p><p>Phantom: From the inception of the MetaMUI development, I have focused on the real-world applicability of the technology. The first target was the CBDC (Central Bank Digital Currency). To successfully apply blockchain technology to CBDC, we need to solve the CBDC design trilemma, meaning identity, privacy, and programmability can not achieve at the same time. To satisfy legal compliance such as KYC(Know Your Customer), AML (Anti-Money Laundering), it is required to have an identity mechanism. However, if we have the identity mechanism, there’s worry about the privacy. To solve this problem, MetaMUI combined the decentralized identity with decentralized token technology and invented an identity-based token blockchain. Since it is identity-based, it satisfies legal compliance. At the same time, since it is a “decentralized” identity, it has better privacy protection compared to pseudonymous (not anonymous) designs such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. In short, MetaMUI blockchain technology can be used in both real-world financial applications and digital-world crypto applications. Having this flexibility increase the possibility of mass adoption.</p><p>Another component of the trilemma is programmability. As it is well-known, Bitcoin and many cryptocurrencies are notoriously slow in the confirmation of the transaction. If we are to implement the programmability, it further slows down and this makes it impossible to use in the real-world application. The fundamental reason why previous blockchain technology is slow is that the consensus mechanism only allows the processing of the transactions in a serial fashion. They can process the transaction one by one. It can not process the transaction in parallel, at the same time. What this means is that someone is buying a Lua coffee in Hanoi, other people in Seoul and other cities have to wait in line for the transaction to be processed until the Hanoi transaction is finished.</p><p>This is a fundamental protocol problem. So far, no blockchain technology has solved this problem except MetaMUI. MetaMUI allows the transaction to be processed in parallel, at the same time. Therefore, we can process transactions in Hanoi, Seoul, and New York independently at the same time. This new protocol design makes it possible to have a globally scalable payment system with unlimited scalability. In the era of the Internet of Things and Machine to Machine commerce, we would need millions of transactions per second. MetaMUI can support these M2M transactions.</p><p>One of the pre-condition to using cryptocurrency is that the user needs to have a smartphone and Internet access. This is one of the main reasons that hinders the mass adoption of Bitcoin and other blockchain technology. To solve this problem, we need to implement “offline” payment. However, because of the consensus process that requires a network connection, no blockchain technology can allow offline payment. To allow offline payment, we need to implement peer to peer payment protocol. You may puzzle that isn’t Bitcoin a P2P payment? The truth is that Bitcoin is NOT a peer-to-peer payment system. It does eliminate the centralized mediators such as the Bank. However, it introduced lots of decentralized mediators such as miners. Since it still has mediators, it is not a peer-to-peer protocol. Therefore we can not implement a “cash-like” P2P payment protocol with current blockchain technology.</p><p>Finally, MetaMUI has solved this problem and invented a true Peer to Peer payment protocol first in human history. Since it is a true Peer to Peer payment protocol that doesn’t require a centralized mediator or decentralized mediator, MetaMUI can allow more than millions of transactions per second. With this true P2P payment protocol, people can now enjoy cash-equivalent, true cash-like digital currency. This will accelerate the adoption of digital currency systems worldwide.</p><p>As proof of what I said so far, a sovereign nation inside Australia called Yidindji used the MetaMUI platform to publish its own CBDC, national identity and E-government system. We have already started the mass adoption and digital revolution.</p> About MetaMUI <p>MetaMUI is the world’s 1st Identity-based blockchain to truly enable regulated Peer_to_Peer (P2P) transactions. It can be used as the cornerstone for most financial offerings, with its high versatility and support for custom-developed use cases that enable Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) implementation and issuance easily on the MetaMUI CBDC platform.<br>MetaMUI is built around Self-Sovereign Identity (SSID) technology. By combining the SSID and blockchain token mechanism, MetaMUI was able to create a new identity-based CBDC system that can protect user’s privacy while providing an identity-based transfer system that can satisfy travel rules and other regulatory requirements such as Know your customer (KYC), Anti-money laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT).</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a>/<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a>/<a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a>/<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p>Traditional IAM implementations commonly are mature, but not flexible enough to serve the needs of organizations in the Digital Age. There are more identity types to serve, modern analytics are helping in managing access, there is a need for delivering APIs so that digital services can consume IAM capabilities, and there is a need for delivering IAM in a modern form, as-a-service. IDaaS (Identity as a Service), while delivered as a service, still requires expertise. A one-stop-shop for service and implementation can deliver significant benefits. This whitepaper describes how Evidian meets the needs of organizations in the digital age, and how these organizations should gradually modernize the existing IAM legacy. Atos Evidian also provides an IDaaS solution enabling this journey.

<p>This week feels like a lively one for the hApp development ecosystem. I’ve discovered a fun little project that only took a few nights to build (spoiler alert: decentralised Zoom), read a very encouraging update from Flux (formerly Junto) about their progress, and been pleased to see the folks in the DEV.HC discord continue to build useful little modules. In addition to that, Holo’s admin team is hosting a developer-focused AMA soon, and of course there’s a Holochain release. Lastly, we’re inviting all developers to give us their feedback on the weird groovy biology-based language we use.</p> Holochain 0.0.132: Unidirectional arcs <p><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/big-performance-boosts/#a-second-note-about-breaking-changes">Breaking changes</a>: network protocol<br>HDK version compatibility: 0.0.125, 0.0.126, 0.0.127</p><p>We’ve merged more work on the next iteration of rrDHT (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1283">#1283</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1288">#1288</a>), which will eventually feature a more efficient syncing algorithm between nodes in a network. If you’re familiar with <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/how-rrdht-works-a-tech-deep-dive/">the way rrDHT works</a>, you’ll know that a node’s ‘neighbourhood’ (their region of responsibility in the DHT’s address space) radiates out from their own agent address like an umbrella. This change moves their neighbourhood to their right, so it starts at their agent address.</p><p>From what I understand, this simplifies gossip somewhat, because there’s no question about who should be initiating a syncing session with whom. If a node is to your right, you initiate. If it’s to your left, you let it initiate (in fact, you probably don’t know about it until it does initiate).</p><p>Finally, there have been more improvements to our automation process (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1307">#1307</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1312">#1312</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1315">#1315</a>).</p><p><a href="http://v">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Holo AMA 50: Developer Focused <p>The next AMA is on April 4th at 16:00 UTC. I’m bringing this up in the Dev Pulse because the hosts are inviting all development-related questions — <a href="https://holochain.typeform.com/to/RFsluzvz?utm_source=email-body&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=HC-newsletter-mar&amp;__s=xxxxxxx">submit your questions here</a>!</p> Doom, a decentralised Zoom <p>A few weeks ago a developer named <a href="https://github.com/felri">Felipe</a> joined the <a href="https://discord.gg/GsSxDvq9wW">DEV.HC Discord</a>, where devs get together to mentor each other and build hApps. I was amazed when, in the course of just one week, he managed to put together a proof-of-concept for a peer-to-peer video chat hApp!</p><p>He’s calling it Doom (no, not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)">that</a> Doom, but ‘decentralised Zoom’), and you can check out the source code at the <a href="https://github.com/felri/doom">felri/doom GitHub repository</a>.</p><p>Doom mashes together two peer-to-peer technologies. Holochain handles the ‘signalling’, or the ‘making the connection’ part. If Doom were the phone system, signalling would involve me pulling a phone book off my wall, looking your number up, dialing your number, and letting the phone network connect my phone to yours. But while the phone network is semi-centralised, Holochain is <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/its-aliiiiiive/#elemental-chat-on-holoports-passing-real-world-tests-with-flying-colours">almost</a> entirely P2P.</p><p>The other P2P component is called <a href="https://webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a>, and your computer already supports it — it’s built right into your browser. So once Holochain handles signalling and makes the introduction between my computer and yours, our web browsers take over and stream our video directly to each other.</p><blockquote>What really excited me is that he put this together in only four evenings’ worth of work!</blockquote><p>It is just a proof-of-concept, and will likely take more work to develop into a production-level product if Felipe chooses to do that, but it opened my eyes to how quickly a developer can put together a fully P2P application.</p><p>Here’s Felipe’s feedback on the development process:</p><blockquote>80% of the time was in the frontend, the holochain part was pretty easy with a bunch of examples you guys sent me<br><br>everything took 4 nights of work<br><br>yeah, holochain is absurdly easy to play</blockquote><p>And finally, here’s a demo video showing Felipe meeting with himself over a local network :)</p> Wednesday Workshop: Gluing modules together <p>This week’s workshop demonstrated the advantage of the <a href="https://holochain-open-dev.github.io/reusable-modules/">modularity philosophy</a> that many hApp devs have embraced. Participants (members of the <a href="https://discord.gg/GsSxDvq9wW">DEV.HC</a> Discord community) created a <a href="https://github.com/matthme/hc-wednesday-workshop-posts">‘posts’ hApp</a>, composed almost completely of existing modules from the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev">holochain-open-dev</a> GitHub org.</p>Wednesday Workshop session video for 30 March 2022<blockquote>The UI is pretty basic, but that’s not the point. The point is, they rebuilt Medium on Holochain in less than an hour and a half! That’s the power of modularity for you.</blockquote><p>Modularity lets you get started faster on the thing you actually want to build, because you can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_reuse">reuse</a> other people’s code to get you the functionality that isn’t unique to your application. And third-party libraries are often more robust, better maintained, and less buggy, thanks to the contributions of many developers.</p><p>From what I’ve seen of the community-created reusable zome modules, they only provide the bare minimum of functionality. This is good, because they don’t make assumptions about how you want to do things. The <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/threaded-comments">threaded-comments</a> module, for instance, doesn’t specify that your app’s comments need to be in plain text or HTML or Markdown. For all it cares, your comments could be photos or music! It just defines the data schema that lets you link things together.</p><p>I see a lot of Holochain-based initiatives embracing modularity:</p>  <a href="https://neighbourhoods.network">Neighbourhoods</a> is entirely based around a marketplace of small, generic modules that <a href="https://docs.neighbourhoods.network/community-activators">community activators</a> can glue together into an application that fits their community’s specific culture.  <a href="https://ad4m.dev">AD4M</a> is a technology-agnostic framework and approach to software design, letting you glue individual <a href="https://github.com/perspect3vism/ad4m/blob/main/README.md#wait-what">languages</a> together into a view on the world that suits you best. (In AD4M-speak, a ‘language’ is the capacity to express things in a certain way with a certain technology — for instance, messages-via-Holochain, transactions-via-Ethereum, photos-via-IPFS, tweets-via-Twitter.)  Flux, as one of the first AD4M-based apps, demonstrates the power of modularity for serving communities of end-users. (Read more about Flux below!)   Flux update: pivoting to community tools <p>This morning I found an <a href="https://medium.com/@sunyatax/introducing-flux-a-social-toolkit-for-the-new-internet-7194dae3c8e9">update</a> from Eric, one of the co-founders of <a href="https://www.fluxsocial.io/">Flux</a> (formerly Junto). I mentioned Flux <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-pulse-112-new-releases-everywhere/#flux-0216">last month</a>, and for those of you with keen eyes who were part of the Junto alpha testing a few years ago, you’ll notice that the new Flux looks nothing like the old Junto.</p><p>This is because the Flux team gained a key insight from the alpha programme: most people didn’t want yet another global social space; they wanted digital tools to support the building of strong, vibrant, healthy communities.</p><p>This reminds me of the idea of ‘membranes’ that we often talk about at Holochain — that organisms of any sort (biological, social, etc) need distinct membranes to keep themselves from disintegrating. For a social organism, that could look like community rules or membership-by-invitation. Fortunately Holochain understands that concept at the basic level; your hApp can include a ‘membrane proof’ validation rule that verifies that a person has the right credentials (e.g., that they’ve read and agree to the rules, or that a verified member has invited them).</p><p>Currently the Flux app supports three different types of ‘channel’ for your community: messaging, knowledge base (AKA wiki), and long-form (AKA blogging). I’m quite impressed; it already feels like a ‘community in a box’ that supports all sorts of different ways of expressing things. And they appear to have even more channel types planned for the future, along with the ability to support community-created channel types.</p><p>So <a href="https://medium.com/@sunyatax/introducing-flux-a-social-toolkit-for-the-new-internet-7194dae3c8e9">check out Eric’s most recent update</a>. It tells the story of how they got to where they are now, why they made the decision to change course, and where they’re heading now. I found it quite an interesting story.</p><p>And of course you can <a href="https://github.com/fluxsocial/flux/releases">try Flux for yourself</a>! It's purely peer-to-peer now, with a back-end built entirely on Holochain using the <a href="https://github.com/perspect3vism/ad4m">AD4M framework</a>. (macOS and Linux only; Windows support coming soon.) If you don’t have a community to try it with, you can join the public testing community with the link <code>neighbourhood://QmXfPUjgF3NCxGYp7SvFueVPSavLWe3DdaS3sw314mBSUU</code></p>Demo of Flux app from March 2022 Call for feedback on Holochain terms <p>Over the years, lots of developers have taken an interest in Holochain. As they’ve started reading our literature, they’ve had one of two reactions: either “why are they using all this weird biological language; this is confusing” or “these biological metaphors are helping me understand it better”.</p><p>Both reactions are valid. The problem is, we don’t know which reaction is more common. And we rarely hear from the developers who were turned off because they found our language inaccessible.</p><p>So we’ve put together a small survey to help us gauge whether our language is generally helpful or harmful. If you’re a developer, CTO, or product designer, we’d love you to take this very short survey. I’m especially interested in feedback from those who didn’t stick around — if you know someone in tech who looked into Holochain and decided against it, reach out to them and ask them to take this survey. Thanks!</p><blockquote><a href="https://holochain.typeform.com/to/phHo0Fen">Take the survey</a></blockquote> DWeb webinar on decentralised identity and data privacy <p>This Thursday DWeb, the Internet Archive, the NY Library Council, and Library Futures are hosting another webinar. The topic of this one is ‘How decentralised identity drives data privacy’. It will feature two speakers who are veterans in the decentralised identity and sovereign data fields, Kaliya Young (AKA <a href="https://identitywoman.net/">Identity Woman</a>) and Joachim Lohkamp of <a href="https://jolocom.io/">Jolocom</a>.</p><blockquote><p>THIS THURS 3/31: Join leaders in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/digitalidentity?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#digitalidentity</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/IdentityWoman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@IdentityWoman</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/GETJolocom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GETJolocom</a> at an introduction to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/decentralized?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#decentralized</a> identity.

<p>While Holochain isn’t directly involved with any of these people and organisations, many of us team members are acquainted with them and our vision aligns very closely with theirs. If you’re a hApp developer, you’re likely already thinking about privacy and data sovereignty, so I’m sure this workshop will be relevant. Both Kaliya and Joachim a lot of insight and experience with them, so it should be both thought-provoking and practical.</p><p>I should also mention a couple <a href="https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=8036267">papers</a> on Holochain and privacy that I co-wrote with professors Kirsten Wahlstrom, Anwaar Ul-Haq, Oliver Burmeister, and Anisha Fernando.

<p>Every day, to a larger and larger portion of consumers, the pre-digital era of account opening becomes smaller in the rearview mirror. Among the growing millennial and Generation Z consumer demographics, the idea of visiting a physical location to open a financial service account might almost sound vintage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But just how many consumers are we talking about? To find out more about what’s driving people to establish and maintain the financial foundations of their day-to-day digital lives, Finicity teamed up with <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/">PYMNTS</a> to publish <a href="https://www.finicity.com/digital-account-opening-report/">Account Opening and Loan Servicing in the Digital Environment</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drawn from a survey of over 2,300 U.S. consumers in December 2021, this report illustrates the rising number of consumers opening accounts digitally, their levels of comfort in managing their finances on a screen and the distinct role that digital plays between account types.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Account Opening 
<p>The numbers show that consumers are rapidly adopting online banking services in lieu of taking trips to brick-and-mortar branches. About 151 million adults in the U.S. opened a new financial account in the past 12 months, and more than three-quarters of them did so digitally.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Banking has gone mobile in a big way as well. More consumers than ever are opting to bank from anywhere: according to <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/connectedeconomy/2021/how-170-million-us-consumers-define-the-super-app/">prior PYMNTS research</a>, 69% of all consumers opt to bank from their couch, the sidewalk, restaurants—wherever they feel like it—with their financial institutions’ mobile applications. Within the past year, 76% of all new financial accounts were opened via digital means.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, almost eight-in-ten Gen-Z consumers reported feeling “very” or “extremely” comfortable opening a financial account with a mobile app. That’s an entire generational cohort for whom mobile banking is simply the norm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A significant portion of consumers—36%—said that they believed opening an account digitally was more secure than through traditional means, and younger cohorts were most likely to say that they felt more secure providing financial data such as proof of income and employment via open-banking channels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Loan Servicing 
<p>Loan servicing is going digital as well. Most consumers have at least one outstanding loan account open, and most of them also manage those loans digitally whether on a desktop or mobile environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A large generational divide exists in our data regarding loan management—older consumers form a larger portion of those with loans to manage, and older consumers also express less comfort with digital finances overall. Concerns with data security are the top reason consumers gave as to why they wouldn’t elect to manage a loan digitally.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the flip side, the portion of consumers who are “more” or “much more” likely to use a digital financial account to manage loans grew 54% over the past two years, and consumers indicate that they feel much more comfortable with the idea of opening a new account online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumers also indicate an interest in one of the main benefits of open banking—convenience. Half of consumers say that they’d be more likely to open a new account if the required financial information—income and employment verification, for example—were automatically transferred as part of the process. Verification takes time and labor, and open finance solutions allow both consumers and lenders to skip mountains of paperwork at account opening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Learn More 
<p>That’s just the tip of the iceberg. It’s been clear for a long time that the future of <a href="https://www.finicity.com/rise-of-open-banking/">financial management is digital.</a> PYMNTS and Finicity have brought you the data showing just how quickly things are accelerating in the space.

 V4 Bug Bounties Program, Towards V4 Production  Introduction <p><a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> V4 solves rug pulls, adds data NFTs, and improves community monetization. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v4-overview-1ccd4a7ce150">This post elaborates</a>.</p><p>Here is the status of Ocean&nbsp;V4:</p>  V4 smart contracts are built. Security audits are completed; <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/blob/v4main/docs/Ocean_Protocol_Smart_Contract_Security_Audit_Report_Halborn_Final%20(1).pdf">here’s the&nbsp;report</a>.  V4 Ocean Market frontend is built. Exception: C2D support is in progress.  V4 backend components Provider, Aquarius, ocean.py, and ocean.js, etc are built. V4 docs are&nbsp;written.  Stabilization, refinement, internal testing, and bug fixing is&nbsp;ongoing.  <p>Today, we launch Ocean V4 Public&nbsp;Testing:</p>  <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/tree/v4main">Ocean V4 smart contracts</a> are <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/contracts/blob/v4main/addresses/address.json">deployed</a> to testnets: Rinkeby &amp; Ropsten (Ethereum), Mumbai (Polygon), and Moonbase (Moonbeam/Moonriver).  Backend components are live: <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/docs/tree/v4">Ocean docs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.js/tree/v4main">ocean.js</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean.py/tree/v4main">ocean.py</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/aquarius/tree/v4main">Aquarius</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/provider/tree/v4main">Provider</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/ocean-subgraph/tree/v4main">Subgraph</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge/tree/v4">Barge</a>. Ocean Market V4 is live. However, to start, the testing should emphasize V4 smart contracts; and the bounties reflect&nbsp;that.  There’s a bug bounty program, with $100K for each critical bug found. Details are&nbsp;below.  <p>Here are the milestones to go. They are our key&nbsp;focus.</p>  V4 Public Testing program completed.  V4 Production Release — deployed all components to production.  Migrate assets &amp; liquidity from V3 to V4 — kicks off on the day of production release.  <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/announcing-ocean-data-farming-26c036d12f20">Data Farming</a> will begin after V4 Production Release, and go to scale after migration is&nbsp;done.</p><p>The V4 Public Testing program will be a great opportunity for the Ocean community to start to engage with Ocean V4 and identify potential security issues. The next section elaborates.</p> V4 Public Testing&nbsp;Program <p>The primary aim of this program is to incentivize the Ocean community and security community to identify critical bugs. Critical bugs are typically in smart contracts, which expose user funds to get stolen&nbsp;etc.</p><p>The program also aims to identify non-critical bugs, start to onboard the Ocean community to V4, and to get feedback from the community.</p><p>This program provides bounties for people who find bugs, as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Critical bug — 100,000&nbsp;USD  High — 30,000&nbsp;USD  Medium — 5,000&nbsp;USD  <p>As the V4 components are live, people can start testing. People can report bugs on the <a href="https://immunefi.com/bounty/oceanprotocol/">Immunefi bounty platform</a> starting Mar 31 at 19.00&nbsp;UTC.</p>  Initially, the scope for bounties only applies to smart contracts  Then, the scope will extend to all backend components (incl. Aquarius, Provider, ocean.js, ocean.py; and not Ocean&nbsp;Market)  Then, the scope will extend to Ocean Market (including its C2D&nbsp;aspects)  Then, the program will continue until no critical bugs have been found for 21 days. If any critical bug is found, the OPF core team will fix the bug, and the 21-day timer restarts.  <p>Step 4 — looping until no critical bugs found — is a best practice in the Web3 industry practiced by the Ethereum 2.0, Optimism, Cosmos, Gnosis, and more. (Compare this to the alternative: shipping at a fixed date when there still may be critical&nbsp;bugs.)</p><p>To set expectations on timing: steps 1–3 will take on the order of 21 days to complete steps 1–3. Step 4 will take at least 21 days, but could be longer depending on the number of critical bugs&nbsp;found.</p> Conclusion <p>Ocean V4 solves rug pulls, adds data NFTs, and improves community monetization. We’re on the home stretch.

 Solve rug pulls, data NFTs, community monetization  Summary <p>This post gives an overview of key Ocean V4 features: (1) one-sided staking to solve rug pulls, (2) ERC721 data NFTs for more flexibility in data IP management, and (3) community monetization to help the community create sustainable businesses.</p><p>These features build on previous functionality: ERC20 datatokens for data access control and licensing, automated data pricing, Compute-to-Data to retain privacy &amp; control of data, and Ocean Market dapp to publish, swap, stake, and consume data&nbsp;assets.</p> 1. Introduction <p>Ocean Protocol was <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/from-ai-to-blockchain-to-data-meet-ocean-f210ff460465">conceived</a> in 2017. We drew on our experiences in AI, banking, blockchain, IP and <a href="https://medium.com/@trentmc0/ascribe-for-nft-archaeologists-17ca5481d206">NFTs</a> to envision a data exchange protocol &amp; network powering thousands of data marketplaces side-by-side with a world-scale data commons, all while preserving data owners’ control and privacy. Our <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/tech-whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a> detailed the vision, and our <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/technology/roadmap">roadmap</a> the&nbsp;plans.</p><p>Each major release of Ocean has made that vision to closer to&nbsp;reality:</p>  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/secure-on-chain-access-control-for-ocean-protocol-38dca0af820c">Ocean V1</a> for baseline data exchange protocol.  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/v2-ocean-compute-to-data-guide-9a3491034b64">Ocean V2</a> layered in privacy via Compute-to-Data.  <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-v3-is-now-live-b47c0e73f52a">Ocean V3</a> enabled data as an asset via ERC20 <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-datatokens-from-money-legos-to-data-legos-4f867cec1837">datatokens</a>, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-market-an-open-source-community-marketplace-for-data-4b99bedacdc3">Ocean Market</a>, and data price discovery.  Post-V3 iterations with users led to <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/fine-grained-permissions-now-supported-in-ocean-protocol-4fe434af24b9">fine-grained permissions</a>, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-on-polygon-network-8abad19cbf47">multichain support</a> [<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-binance-smart-chain-6bfe715a492c">1</a>,<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-moonriver-d4f3e26fbc5">2</a>,<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceans-on-energy-web-chain-1343e56d884d">3</a>], and <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/list-purgatory#readme">handling sensitive data &amp; IP violations</a>.  In parallel, the <a href="https://www.oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO</a> ecosystem has grown to &gt;200 teams&nbsp;funded.  <p>Ocean V4 adds the following major features. Sections below elaborate; and blog posts even&nbsp;further.</p>  Solve rug pulls, via one-sided staking.  Data NFTs, for more flexibility in data IP management.  Community monetization, to help the community create sustainable businesses.   2. One-Sided Staking to solve rug&nbsp;pulls <p>Ocean V3 had rug pull issues; Ocean V4 solves them via one-sided staking.</p><p>Rug pulls are when a whale pulls out of their large position in a pool, hurting other&nbsp;stakers.</p><p>Rug pulls happen in Ocean V3. Here’s how. On publishing a data asset, a data publisher would get the full initial supply of datatokens (DTs), becoming a DT whale. Then they would create a pool and add in DT and OCEAN liquidity. Then when someone else stakes in the pool, it adds OCEAN and drives up the price of the DT. Then, a publisher could rug pull by unstaking, getting back more OCEAN than initially put in. This wouldn’t have been too bad, except that others’ staking OCEAN has spiked the DT&nbsp;price.</p><p>Ocean V4 solves rug pulls, because in V4 publishers get no initial datatokens (DTs). Instead, the pool auto-controls DT supply. Whenever someone stakes OCEAN into a pool, the pool mints datatokens. Just enough datatokens are minted to keep datatoken price stable (constant DT:OCEAN ratio). Similarly, whenever OCEAN is unstaked, datatokens are burned. In Ocean V4, people can still swap OCEAN ↔ DT as usual for an&nbsp;AMM.</p><p>This mechanic also eliminates slippage when adding/removing OCEAN liquidity.</p> 3. Data NFTs for flexibility <p>Ocean V3 used ERC20 “datatokens” to represent both base intellectual property (IP) and licenses against that base IP. Ocean V4 adds more flexibility by representing the base IP as ERC721 “data&nbsp;NFTs”.</p><p>In Ocean V3, someone publishes a dataset by deploying an ERC20 “datatoken” contract and related metadata. In doing so they are claiming copyright (or exclusive right) to that base IP. When a person gets 1.0 ERC20 datatokens for that dataset, this is a license to consume that dataset, and they can use Ocean infrastructure to do so (spending the 1.0 datatokens).</p><p>Fungible ERC20 datatokens leverage crypto infrastructure. Crypto wallets become data wallets for data custody, data sharing, and data management more generally. DAOs become data DAOs for data unions, data coops, and data trusts. Datatoken pools enable automated price discovery and incentivize liquidity providers (LPs) to choose high-quality data assets for greater&nbsp;profit.</p><p>But Ocean V3 had limitations in flexibility. It did not support different licenses for the same base IP (e.g. 1-day versus 1-month), or transferring the base IP. Furthermore, the ERC20 datatoken template was hardcoded.</p><p>Ocean V4 addresses these issues by explicitly using ERC721 to represent base IP as an ERC721 “data NFTs”. The data NFT owner can deploy ERC20 “datatoken” contracts against their data NFT, each datatoken contract with its own licensing terms.</p><blockquote><p> — <a href="https://twitter.com/trentmc0/status/1483345290677690375">@trentmc0</a></p></blockquote><p>Ocean data NFTs have the following benefits:</p>  Interoperability with the NFT ecosystem (and DeFi &amp; DAO tools). Examples: (a) transfer base IP via an NFT wallet, (b) data NFTs for sale in OpenSea, (b) DAO-held data&nbsp;NFTs  Data NFTs have flexible metadata key-value pairs (via <a href="https://github.com/ERC725Alliance/erc725/blob/main/docs/ERC-725.md">ERC725y</a> standard), on-chain data availability, and GDPR compliance (via on-chain encryption, decrypted by Ocean Aquarius for rendering in frontends). Caching and retrieval is fast &amp; convenient via Ocean Aquarius / ElasticSearch. With ocean.js &amp; ocean.py drivers, like the rest of&nbsp;Ocean.  When the NFT is transferred, it auto-updates all permissions, e.g. who receives payment, or who can mint derivative ERC20 datatokens.<br>Allows new data NFT &amp; datatoken templates, for flexibility and future-proofing.  Besides base data IP, you can use data NFTs to implement comments &amp; ratings, verifiable claims, identity credentials and social media posts. 🤯 They can point to parent data NFTs, enabling nesting of comments on comments, or replies to tweets. All on-chain, GDPR-compliant, easily searched, with js &amp; py&nbsp;drivers.  <p>The following blog posts have further details: IP * NFTs for <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-1-practical-connections-of-erc721-with-intellectual-property-dc216aaf005d">ERC721</a>, <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-2-leveraging-erc20-fungibility-bcee162290e3">ERC20</a>, and <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/nfts-ip-3-combining-erc721-erc20-b69ea659115e">ERC721 +&nbsp;ERC20</a>.</p> 4. Better monetization for community <p>Ocean V4 provides more upside for marketplace operators, and makes space for a market of third-party Providers.</p><p>Ocean V3 smart contracts enabled marketplace operators to collect a fee in just one place: consume. The value was hardcoded to&nbsp;0.1%.</p><p>This was a good start, but it limited the upside. In particular, we observed there to be 100x more volume on swap (pool-based exchange) than on consume, an upside which marketplace operators were not able to participate in.</p><p>Ocean V4 provides more upside for marketplace operators. First, V4 smart contracts enable marketplace operators to collect a fee not only in consume, but also in fixed-rate exchange, and in pool-based swap (the big win). Second, the marketplace operator sets the fee&nbsp;value.</p><p>Furthermore, Ocean V4 enables third-party Providers to provide compute, for a fee. This enables a marketplace of Providers to emerge. This will work for centralized trusted providers (that the data publisher and consume must trust), but also trustless providers (via decentralization or other privacy-preserving mechanisms).</p> 5. Conclusion <p>Ocean V4 brings these key new features: one-sided staking to solve rug pulls, ERC721 data NFTs for more flexibility in data IP management, and community monetization to help the community create sustainable businesses.</p><p>These features build on previous functionality: ERC20 datatokens for data access control and licensing, automated data pricing, Compute-to-Data to retain privacy &amp; control of data, and Ocean Market dapp to publish, swap, stake, and consume data&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on <a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter,</a> <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">Telegram</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol">GitHub</a> &amp; <a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/">Newsletter</a> for project announcements.

   by Mike Small  Why Backup and Disaster Recover is ever more important 
 In May 2021, the Irish health Service (HSE) was hit by a ransomware attack. According to the BBC this caused substantial cancellations to outpatient services and staff having to resort to paper-based systems. The service was still recovering from this attack four months later and, although it said than 95% of its servers had b

<p>In May 2021, the Irish health Service (HSE) was hit by a ransomware attack. According <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-57184977">to the BBC</a> this caused substantial cancellations to outpatient services and staff having to resort to paper-based systems. The service was <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-58413448">still recovering from this attack four months later</a> and, although it said than 95% of its servers had been recovered it still had an area of its website devoted to giving updates. <br><br>Ransomware has become a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5008/1">rich vein that is being mined by cyber-criminals</a>. Any organization that has money and time critical data is at risk. Even worse the ruthless criminals are double dipping by not only preventing access to your data but also threatening to sell or publicise what they have stolen. According to the UK Government <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/972399/Cyber_Security_Breaches_Survey_2021_Statistical_Release.pdf"> ransomware accounted for up to 14% of reported cyber breaches. <br></a></p>
<p>This makes <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/tracks/886">backup and disaster recovery</a><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/972399/Cyber_Security_Breaches_Survey_2021_Statistical_Release.pdf"> </a>an essential component of your cyber security.</p>
<p></p>
 Digital Transformation adds to the risk 
<p>This risk has been increased as organizations undergo digital transformation.&nbsp; As your organization becomes more dependent upon your IT systems the<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/tracks/897"> potential impact on your business</a> from any disruption increases.&nbsp; If you can’t access your data or your systems, your entire business could be destroyed.&nbsp; For example, the attack on the Norwegian Aluminium smelter Norsk Hydro is<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-48661152"> reported to have cost £45M</a> and disaster was only averted because the retired employees remembered how to operate the plant without IT. <br><br>Many organizations now depend upon cloud services or have moved their data to the cloud and believe that this means that they no longer need to take backups.&nbsp; While some cloud services provide some levels of protection for the data that they hold this cannot be taken for granted.&nbsp; In general terms, the cloud customer is always responsible for the security of their data, and cloud services cannot protect the customers’ data from all threats. <br><br>Check out the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/tracks/875">Hybrid Multi Cloud Track</a> at EIC for more on this.</p>
<p></p>
 Ransomware is not the only Threat 
<p>In addition, other kinds of events could lead to a cloud customer being unable to access their applications and data held in the service.&nbsp; On Wednesday March 10th at 1am in the morning a fire started <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/faits-divers/strasbourg-important-incendie-sur-le-site-de-l-entreprise-ovh-classe-seveso-20210310">that destroyed a major data centre</a> in France that provides cloud services.&nbsp; This led to many businesses being unable to access their data an extended period. <br><br>Cloud customers may delete their data accidentally, their data may be corrupted by application errors, ransomware, or localized failure.&nbsp; While IaaS providers take care to protect the infrastructure that they provide, the customer is responsible for the security of their data.&nbsp; When you delete an S3 Object Storage Bucket the data is gone and cannot be recovered.&nbsp; When you delete Office 365 files these are only retained in the service for 30 days.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/small/business-continuity-and-the-cloud">The cloud customer is responsible</a> for ensuring that their data is protected against these risks by using backup processes.</p>
<p></p>
 Protect your Backup 
<p>The backed-up copies of data are also at risk – smart ransomware attempts to disable your backup processes or to plant malware so that restoring the data from the backup will restore the threat. <br><br>To counter this, backup vendors now provide “immutable” backup capabilities in various ways.&nbsp; These include exploiting the object lock capabilities provided by cloud services, appliance hardening, specialized write once hardware, blockchain techniques, as well as support for an “air gap.”&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>Your backups also need to be physically protected.&nbsp; Traditionally, this would be achieved by moving physical copies to separate secure locations, which also added the risk of loss in transit!&nbsp; Cloud services provide a useful alternative and can be used to store the backed-up data with a high degree of resilience while reducing the delays and the risks involved in the physical transfer of media.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, be careful to ensure that you use the cloud for backup storage in a way that meets your <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5134">compliance obligations.</a></p>
<p></p>
 Disaster Recovery 
<p>Backing up your systems and data is important but is not enough – you need to be able to recover the data and restore the affected services - and you need to be able to do this quickly.&nbsp; Achieving this depends upon how the data was backed up as well as how it can be restored. <br><br>Business applications depend upon a complex technology stack using multiple services across many servers.&nbsp; You will need to rebuild all the Virtual Machines unless the backup contains restorable VM image snapshots.&nbsp; The backups of the multiple elements must be synchronized so that you can restore the business service.&nbsp; A business-critical database may contain terabytes of data and the time needed to copy this data can be a significant factor unless your backup service supports database emulation.&nbsp; This adds to the complexity of the recovery processes that involve teams from across the organization. <br><br>Does your backup solution provide all the capabilities that you need to restore your service - for example: run books, workflows, and process automation?&nbsp; Does it provide full stack restoration capabilities?&nbsp; Does it support a DR environment from where you can quicky restore a working service.?&nbsp; Does it provide these a fully managed service with guaranteed SLAs?</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Andrea Beskers</a></p><p>Are today's identity fundamentals such as single sign-on, multi-factor authentication, passwordless authentication enough for the future of Web 3.0? Asanka from WSO2 will elaborate on his idea of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5053">Creating a Seamless Access Experience with the Digital Double</a>&nbsp;on Thursday, May 12, at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2022</a> to address the next digital era.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked&nbsp;Asanka some questions about his presentation.</p>
<p> </p>
 What do you mean by the digital double in your presentation title? 
<p>Yeah, I think it's a really good question. So we are in an experience economy and an experience economy comes with the digital experience that we are providing for end-users and the differentiators that we generate as an organization comes through the digital experience that we provide. So to create a digital experience, we have to have a digital representation of everything, I would say people, places, and things. So that particular digital representation I call it a digital double data, few parallels to digital double as well, like a digital twin, digital self. But I thought that the best way to explain this digital representation is the digital double. And I coined this term in the 2016 timeframe and we were heavily using it when it comes to the CIAM site and general digital application architecture as well as implementations.</p>
<p></p>
 What advice would you give to someone just getting into identity?  
<p>Yes, I think traditionally security and identities are an afterthought. But my first advice is it's not an afterthought. When you start designing an application and when you are thinking about providing a solution, you should start thinking about security and then securing identity and applying it from design the phase. So that's the first piece of advice I would like to give. The second thing is about having an understanding of the business as well as the technology because don't just build an identity solution by looking at the technology, look at the business requirements. Only then you can identify which principles, that you can apply when it comes to solution building. And then I think from the technical side, you have to get the understanding about the standards, specifications, those types of things. It's a must as a person who's coming to the identity space. Then last but not least, I would say keep an eye on the technology because things are changing fast and because security is always the overhead for the core application. So look at the technology and then try to utilize the latest technologies as well as things that will improve the security as well as the performance impacts coming from your application security.</p>
<p></p>
 How do you see the identity sector evolve over the years? 
<p>Yes, I think it is already evolving. So I will take two aspects. One, internally in an organization as well as in general in the industry. So in an organization, I would say most of the organizations going through this maturity model that they will start with nonexistent, that there will be ad hoc identities and security principles applied. Then they will go to manage identity. In most cases, the organization will create and manage identities for internal and external uses. Then they will advance into more kind of a siloed approach. As an example, based on the different systems of record layers or based on different applications, that they are using, as an individual, each and everyone will have different identities. So you had to use a different username, passwords, different logins to log in. That is basically the siloed state. And then it will go to a connected stage where you will have a seamless identity across all the applications and have a more federated approach. And once you achieve that, you can optimize it by adding more protection, have observability, and then link AI, machine learning those types of additional capabilities into the core identity solution. And then enhance the footprint of the identity and access management. So that is what we see inside the organization and as an industry, I would say, identity is moving out from that centralized nature into a more decentralized manner and it is becoming more developer-focused identity and access management. And so that is one thing that we are now seeing as well as the service-centric approach of identity is changing into more a self-centric nature as well, as those are some of the things that I would say that are happening already. And then it will evolve with time.</p>

				   Accurate labeling, interoperability profiles, and testing are urgently needed to drive interoperability and scale decentralized identity,  says a new white paper from Indicio, as company adopts new interoperability label for its products   
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Helen Garneau</p>
<p>In a new white paper, Trust, Verifiable Credentials, and Interoperability, Indicio’s Trevor Butterworth and Sam Curren make the case for the adoption of interoperability labeling.</p>
<p>While everyone understands that interoperability is the key to scaling decentralized identity, there is currently little clarity in the marketplace as to which solutions will interoperate with each other. As a result “interoperability” is little more than a marketing slogan that could leave customers disappointed and frustrated.</p>
<p>“Whether misleading claims are intentional, due to sunk investments, or simply inadvertent,” the authors write, “misleading claims about interoperability end up hurting the entire marketplace for decentralized identity.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a remedy, they propose a taxonomy for interoperability and a labeling system to both kickstart community debate and provide a way for consumers to evaluate marketing claims and drive development.</p>
<p>In seven aspects of interoperability, they note the technical aspects that must currently align for solutions to interoperate. It is not enough to claim interoperability on the basis of one or two aspects, such as adherence to W3C credential formats; all need to align.</p>
<p>Clear vendor labeling on these aspects of interoperability will not only help customers compare products, it will help customers to identify what they need, and what vendors and the decentralized identity community need to fix. As the authors note:</p>
<p>“There is, perhaps, no better incentive to close the gaps between products by identifying them to consumers.”</p>
<p>Accurate labeling is important and achievable, they write. But it isn’t a complete solution. Interoperability profiles and testing are needed to provide clear development objectives and the evidence that solutions do, in fact, interoperate.</p>
<p>“We wrote this paper not because we have the perfect solution to the labeling problem, but because we wanted to start a conversation in the community to address this issue,” says Sam Curren, Chief Architect and Deputy CTO of Indicio. “We hope the discussion will lead to a better labeling approach.”</p>
<p>In light of the paper’s recommendations, Indicio will follow the labeling model proposed by the authors for all its products.</p>

<p>CasperLabs, a leading enterprise blockchain services company, and Civic have partnered to launch Civic Pass on the Casper blockchain, allowing dApps built on Casper to meet their KYC requirements. One of the first projects to benefit from this partnership is Metacask, a premier marketplace leveraging blockchain and NFT technology to modernize high-end whisky sales.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Metacask has transformed the sale and ownership of whisky casks by delivering transparency in their provenance, possession, and valuation by issuing NFTs to serve as a digital title of deed. The platform, built on the Casper blockchain, is the world’s first NFT marketplace for whisky cask trading and boasts significant operational efficiencies over the prevailing manual processes for whisky sales.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adapt with an eye toward the future</p>



<p>As dApps consider the integration and deployment of mechanisms to help them meet regulatory requirements, the need for easily integrated permissioned solutions will continue to increase. Civic has been leading the charge in providing permissioning solutions to projects that understand the importance of being well prepared for coming regulations in the crypto space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Metacask will use the identity and age verification processes provided by Civic Pass as an input to its compliance program. The marketplace uses Civic Pass to establish which participants meet their requirements for verification. Once the user has completed the Civic Pass screening process, Metacask’s smart contracts will use the results of the screening to allow users to participate within the decentralized marketplace.</p>



<p>Metacask selected CasperLabs as its blockchain partner because of its enterprise scalability, superior performance and security compared favorably against traditional alternatives. Casper’s proof-of-stake (PoS) model especially, has proven to be exceptionally energy efficient, with its annual electricity requirements chalking up to a fraction of the excessive usage required by other enterprise-level decentralized networks. Sustainability at scale is a huge innovation to the world of traditional supply chain ledgers and tokenized assets, and Metacask was quick to recognize this.</p>



<p>Bridging the gap and opening doors</p>



<p>CasperLabs, Civic, and Metacask are helping to bring awareness of the need for permissioning into the crypto industry and show other ecosystem participants how effortlessly these solutions can be integrated into their digital business models.</p>



<p>And, as additional development teams working on the Casper Network see real-world use cases for Civic Pass, like Metacask’s approach to digital whisky ownership, we’ll see more great ideas come to fruition that help grow our industry in exciting new ways.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today we were presenting at the Open Data Institute’s event on Data Sharing and the <a href="https://theodi.org/article/what-are-data-institutions-and-why-are-they-important/">Rise of Data Institutions</a> — a crucially important subject for the years ahead. (You can see the slides of our presentation <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/davidejalexander/mydex-cic-odi-radical-data-institutions-20220330-alan-mitchellpdf">here</a>.)</p><p>Our particular contribution challenged the widespread assumption that because data is currently controlled by (mostly) large organisations, the future of data sharing will revolve around these organisations sharing data with each&nbsp;other.</p><p>It’s a dangerous mistake to make. We showed how, as it scales, a system built on this assumption will quickly and inevitably generate a complexity catastrophe.</p><p>Each time organisations share data with each other, they have to expose their systems to each other, undertake appropriate security tests, check identities, purposes and permissions, achieve technical interoperability, and so on. And each time a new organisation is added to the system, the number of potential connections grows exponentially.</p><p>For example, if 100 organisations were sharing data with each other (which is less than the number of organisations most citizens have data relationships with), 4950 connections would be required for data to be able to flow between all of them. In contrast, as the right hand of the diagram shows, if data flows via an individual’s personal data, we would need just one connection per organisation — and, as we showed, the infrastructure needed to make this happen is already built, operational and available. That’s what we’ve been doing for the last 15&nbsp;years.</p><p>We didn’t have time to go into many of the important details arising — the need to fix the regulator-created mess surrounding <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/we-need-to-talk-about-consent-480f6087a0fe">consent</a>; the strategic importance of <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/can-i-trust-you-6771a6ca0e35">trustworthiness</a>, the foundational importance of <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/unleashing-the-potential-of-verified-attributes-fe001e01b091">verified attributes</a>; the <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-data-valuable-59bd63e1a09f">economic logic of data sharing</a>. There’s also a lot more that needs to be said about what ‘good’ looks like when it comes to new data institutions: their purposes, business models, governance, and so&nbsp;on.</p> Building a new type of institution <p>Institutions crystallise and embody mindsets, purposes and values. They make purposes practical. They turn values into rules and norms of behaviour.</p><p>For example, today’s prevailing ‘Product, Firm, Market, Profit’ mindset — the belief that wealth is created by firms competing in markets to sell products at a profit — has spawned a zoo of institutions. However, most if not all of them are antithetical to the creation of a data sharing ecosystem that is citizen-inclusive and empowering and not focused on trying to extract as much money out of it as possible.</p><p>That is why we are trying to build a new type of institution that&nbsp;is:</p>  financially self-sustaining and self-reliant, able to maintain our independence and therefore our&nbsp;mission  whose purpose is to build and operate neutral, enabling, trustworthy personal data logistics infrastructure  that enables mutually beneficial ‘win-win’ data sharing relationships between people and organisations  in a way that generates positive externalities i.e. benefits society and communities at&nbsp;large  <p>These goals define what we do and how. For&nbsp;example:</p>  We only work with organisations willing to sign our platform terms and conditions, which demand treating individuals data via the principle of Safe By&nbsp;Default.  Our data architecture of individually encrypted PDSs, with each individual holding their own private key, gives us zero knowledge of individual’s data  Our business model (based on subscription fees) is structured to generate zero incentives for data monetisation.  Our business plan spans 15 years of mission building momentum, not three years of commercial opportunity. We are built to last, not for a quick&nbsp;buck.  Our legal structure as a Community Interest Company makes us asset locked so that we cannot be acquired by a data sharks intent on subverting our mission. We are legally required to reinvest two thirds of any profits made back into the furtherance of this&nbsp;mission.  <p>Our future economy and society will be built around what people are now calling ‘data institutions’. The big question is what sort of institution will they be? Exploitative, predatory? Or trustworthy, enabling and empowering? All our work is focused on creating the right&nbsp;answer.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/the-need-for-new-data-institutions-e6b06cd0cbb8">The need for new Data Institutions</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The pilot will see Nuggets’ Verified Self-Sovereign Digital ID Solution integrated with the Global Assured Identity Network (GAIN) — a collaborative force of 150 financial institutions aiming to instil a verifiable, interoperable, reusable global identity standard.</p><p>We are delighted to announce that <a href="https://nuggets.life/">Nuggets</a>, our multi-award-winning self-sovereign identity (SSI) and payment platform — used by LexisNexis Risk Solutions, MyIdentity, LatPay and many others — will begin a pilot of its Verified Self-Sovereign Digital ID Solution with a network of 150 global financial institutions that make up the newly established <a href="https://gainforum.org/">Global Assured Identity Network</a>&nbsp;(GAIN).</p><p>GAIN’s mission is to create a verifiable, interoperable, and reusable global identity standard that satisfies global regulatory compliance for financial services while ensuring user-centric privacy. GAIN is an international group, made up of global financial institutions, developing a cross-border approach to verified digital identity that it plans to launch in late&nbsp;2022.</p><p>“The lack of verified Digital Identity presents an urgent problem and a meaningful opportunity for society. Rising data breaches, privacy concerns, and financial crime — trust online is broken,” states a paper from the Global Assured Identity&nbsp;Network.</p><p>Nuggets’ addresses this with a Verified Self-Sovereign Digital ID which enables each and every transaction to be verified and shared securely, prioritising user-centric privacy. Its ID solution requires both the originator and recipient of each transaction to be verified before the transfer of funds or digital assets can be completed.</p><p>Nuggets achieves this via a combination of open standards including; W3C verifiable credentials, decentralised identifiers (DIDs), zero-knowledge proofs, and the encrypted communication standards of&nbsp;DIDComm.</p><p>When a user makes a transaction on one of GAIN’s member platforms, their identity is established through the creation of a unique Peer Decentralised Identifier, or&nbsp;PeerDID.</p><p>Crucially, the verifiable credentials support selective disclosure, information provided can also remain anonymous through the use of zero-knowledge proofs, enabling users to provide proof they are who they say they are without divulging any&nbsp;PII.</p><p>This ensures that transactions cannot occur if this verification process does not happen. Additionally, with DIDs emerging as a standard for digital identities, Nuggets’ solution becomes interoperable with other solutions and can be used to address other challenges facing web3, especially combatting ID fraud risks in the fledgling metaverse.</p><p>Alastair Johnson, Our Founder and CEO,&nbsp;said:</p><blockquote>“For too long now business has relied on usernames, passwords and devices as the gateway of confidence to ensure authentication, leading to fraud and misuse. While legacy verification methods have been bolstered with KYC onboarding 2FA, SMS, authenticators, securely engaging in the digital economy requires a user-owned and controlled ID solution that cryptographically proves everything from access to services to trusted transactions. It needs to be reusable, verifiable, portable, private and secure. It’s an important recognition that GAIN has ensured that self-sovereign identity will be a part of this moving forward.”</blockquote><p>Nuggets empowers users to secure their verified digital identities and finances in the real world and web3 through verified self-sovereign identity and payment solutions. Using Nuggets, individuals and businesses can create reusable, verifiable digital identities and store personal information and value via an encrypted and non-custodial vault.</p><p>“GAIN and Nuggets share a duty to protect users from financial crime and uphold the law. By leveraging our user-centric and high-trust identity paradigm, financial institutions can satisfy adherence to global regulation while upholding the sanctity of user privacy,” Johnson&nbsp;added.</p><p>“The financial industry faces a choice: Will customers ultimately log in to their bank with a social media ID or will they use their bank to gain access across the internet?&nbsp;… The time for cross-border, cross-sector collaboration is here,” states a paper from the Global Assured Identity&nbsp;Network.</p><p>If you’re a business looking to implement reusable digital identity, and for better ways to protect customer data, you can now enable Nuggets worldwide. <a href="mailto:partners@nuggets.life">Get in touch</a> and find out&nbsp;how.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.nuggets.life/nuggets-pilots-verified-self-sovereign-digital-id-solution-with-150-financial-institutions-127d2d39ae9a">Nuggets Pilots Verified Self-Sovereign Digital ID Solution with 150 Financial Institutions</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.nuggets.life">Nuggets</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence is already embedded in our daily lives, often in ways that we barely notice anymore. In our personal lives, we benefit form <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/5-advantages-recommendation-engines-can-offer-to-businesses-10b663977673">recommendation engines</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2019/09/05/how-ai-is-protecting-against-payments-fraud/?sh=764d8bc34d29">fraud detection for payment transactions</a>, <a href="https://healthitanalytics.com/news/top-5-use-cases-for-artificial-intelligence-in-medical-imaging">image classification of medical imaging</a>, and <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2019/06/03/5-amazing-examples-of-natural-language-processing-nlp-in-practice/?sh=2d7f31841b30">natural language interaction</a> with our smart devices. Organizations are harnessing AI as well, for anomaly detection in customer transactions and in IT security, <a href="https://www.research.ibm.com/blog/icml-predicting-climate-extremes">augmented analytics for business intelligence and data-driven decision making</a>, using AutoML to <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/mc80360/ai-service-clouds/">develop and monitor customized models</a> for their own specific use cases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>AI Is Already Changing the World. It Is Our Duty to Make Sure It Will Be a Better One.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lb80390/assessing-the-maturity-of-core-ai-disciplines/">disciplines that make up AI are many</a> (natural language processing, machine learning, computer vision, and more), it can be difficult to summarize how AI is positively impacting our lives. But overall, it is assisting humans to make decisions where there is an abundance of data. It may partially automate processes or appear to be a sentient decision maker, but AI’s real value is from it’s supporting role; providing data-driven recommendation so that a human decision maker can make the best choice.</p>
 AI’s potential to ruin us 
<p>It is possible to have too much of a good thing…</p>
<p>Ai exists to help humans make wiser decisions… that sounds like a very happy coexistence. But how easy is it for humans just to sit back, and let AI do the heavy lifting? In a word – very.</p>
<p>Our own complacency and complicity in the development of AI has already proven stronger than our desire to make better informed decisions. There are already cases of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html">false arrests</a>, of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight-idUSKCN1MK08G">biased hiring practices</a>, of racially and gender discriminating facial recognition algorithms that perpetuate existing biases and injustices in our analog world into the digital one. Each situation was handled a bit differently, but an overarching trend is that a human decision maker relied on the recommendation of the algorithm without questioning its validity in the situation’s greater context. And when humans willingly hand over their decisions making power to machines, it will be difficult to take it back.</p>
<p>AI’s potential to disrupt just and contextually aware decision making is not the only issue. <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/06/05/105817/we-need-to-talk-about-the-power-of-ai-to-manipulate-humans/">Humans are very susceptible to manipulation</a>, and AI offers endless opportunities for manipulation.<a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/what-is-deepfake"> Deepfakes</a> are looming threat, using ML techniques to generate a believable video that never occurred. These can easily alter an audience’s perception of an individual, event, company, or political leader. But manipulation of people can come from <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/01/08/130983/were-fighting-fake-news-ai-bots-by-using-more-ai-thats-a-mistake/">other sources as well</a>, like algorithms that tend to yield results that users expect or push users towards more extreme opinions. Collective harm from manipulative algorithms is less studied than individual harm, but has the potential for much more disastrous outcomes.</p>
 How to keep AI on a leash 
<p><a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-ai/">Ethical analysis of AI</a> is the short, simplified answer. But unfortunately how to keep AI on a leash so that it benefits our society and business operations cannot be simplified. &nbsp;As an example, here is a list of the high-level metrics that most AI governance frameworks propose using:</p>
 
 Level of human involvement in an algorithm’s decision making 
 Agile involvement in an algorithm’s decision making 
 Ethical treatment of individuals (should not remove access to basic human rights) 
 Technical robustness of AI system 
 Data privacy 
 Accountability 
 Legal legitimacy 
 Social and environmental impact 
 Human-centric 
 Internal risk management 
 
<p>At first glance, this may look like a great list. If all AI systems are technically robust, display accountability, and remain human-centric and treat humans ethically, then there should be no problem, right? <a href="https://en.unesco.org/artificial-intelligence/ethics/cases">But what does it mean to treat humans ethically</a>? Each one of these metrics must be defined at a detailed level in order to be enforced, but who has the authority to define ethical treatment of humans? There will be differences in definition across country and regional lines: of age, gender, individual versus collective wellbeing, health versus capital gain, risk adverse compared to risk-friendly, and more.</p>
<p>What we need is a collective effort to define our ethical needs and priorities as humans, reflective of our diversity. We need the support of technology philosophers to pose questions to us, and we must take the initiative to define what our future will contain.</p>
 Global initiatives to keep AI on track 
<p>There are several global initiatives to govern AI development. They are not legally binding regulations, but are rather statements of best practice and opinions that carry the reputation and influence of the group issuing it.</p>
<p>AI governance initiatives are not just state led. They come from academia, from independent research institutions, advocacy groups, private companies, from country working groups, and international organizations. Some of the noteworthy ones are:</p>
 
 <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/34390353/w6gov-18-LATEX.pdf?sequence=1">Layered Model for AI Governance (2017, Harvard)</a>

 <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1623335154975&amp;uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0206">Proposal for a legal framework for AI (European Commission, April 2021)</a> 
 
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/bailey/ai-regulation-proposed-by-eu-commission">The one with the most teeth</a> is the legal framework for Artificial Intelligence from the European Commission (April 2021). It must still be approved by the Council of the European Union and European Parliament before it is formally adopted, after which will have one and a half years before it comes into full force.</p>
<p>It proposes a tiered categorization of AI applications: those that create unacceptable risk, high risk, low risk, and minimal risk. Based on the level of risk each AI system is assigned, there will be <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/bailey/new-developments-in-european-ai-regulation">different conditions that must be met</a> for use on the European market or as it affects European Union residents.</p>
<p></p>
 Final critique 
<p>If regulations are not in place to keep AI in check, then we have to step in.</p>
<p>We are nowhere near the end of this story. AI technologies are rapidly developing and improving. Our fears around AI are solidifying, and regulation is nowhere near being able to protect us from those fears. This requires individual and corporate initiative to intentionally build a safe future with AI at our side. Organizations that are considering implementing AI in their processes should adopt an AI governance framework that critically assesses how the system improves business – and who it harms. Continually strive for transparency, so that those relying on an algorithm for decision making understand the weaknesses and best practices. And keep a multidisciplinary team on hand to consider the hard questions of ethical implementation.</p>

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: It was the early 1960s when Identity was introduced to the digital world, way before computers became an essential part of our everyday life. Computer scientist, Fernando Corbató, introduced&nbsp;passwords into the computing world as a method to secure access to files. Yes, identity is much older than what we normally think.&nbsp;</p>
<p>David Doret: I think my oldest bibliographic reference in IAM dates back to 1967. That sounds absolutely amazing, no?</p>
<p>Oscar: Indeed! That was David Doret who created Open Measure, a wiki that has built and maintains a dictionary of accurate definitions of Identity and Access Management terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another word that is in everyone’s vocabulary today, the Internet, only appeared in the late 80s.&nbsp;The 90s saw how Internet became commercial and global. The original Internet’s Identity and Access Management infrastructure was based on RADIUS, a protocol that did authentication, authorisation, and accounting.&nbsp; As more and more companies built web applications that allowed access to outside users, companies opted for developing their own identity solutions to handle their own needs. Such in-house solutions were easy at first, (such as a web form plus a SQL database) but later they became complex, and expensive and difficult to maintain. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Later, in the 2000s, a massive number of people got online, reaching the billion mark. However, the world was not yet familiar with the term Identity and Access Management.</p>
<p>What did IAM&nbsp;really mean? What were the business benefits? During those years, Finland was one of the pioneering countries building the IAM that the Internet needed. That’s how Ubisecure was founded in 2002. After years solving problems and developing a mature IAM platform, one thing was noticed: the lack of knowledge and understanding of the key concepts around the Identity and Access Management world. Let’s hear Keith Uber, who experienced those days working for Ubisecure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keith Uber: When I joined the company in 2009 a training system was in place for our partners and for our customers, and we would use that for providing custom training together with the implementation projects on a one-one basis. Around that time, we started to think about productising that training and making it more generic. What we found in the sales process was many of the buyers, or even partners at that stage, were unfamiliar with many of the new concepts in this rapidly changing Identity and Access Management world. A lot of the terms were unfamiliar, a lot of the ideas and concepts were new.</p>
<p>Around that time, the then CEO, Juha Remmes, had the idea to productise the training and create a separate brand around the training called the IAM Academy.&nbsp; With this brand and with this product, we could provide training for groups of individuals, organisations, and provide group training both in a classroom environment but also customise training in a customer’s premises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we provided then training on principles and ideas, best practices that go far beyond our own product and are generic for Identity and Access Management. We created 5 different programmes and the customers and partners could choose different modules of that programme and use that to decide who within the organisation were trained perhaps in a more technical part of the product or in more conceptual or business focused ideas. We also had a specialised course for sales.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oscar: Ubisecure’s IAM Academy was indeed a pioneering training programme on the industry. As time went by, and with the experience gained through several training sessions, Ubisecure IAM Academy grew and perfected itself and the professionals attending left the training room with a deeper understanding of IAM and how it makes our lives easier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keith: My favourite part of the training is the technical hands-on training where we provide each student with a personal environment that they can log into and it’s their job to configure their environment according to an example customer. We have quite a complex customer example where you first can customise the look and feel, the languages, the layout, how the system would work, and then you go through the various steps that would be used in the implementation project to make that environment work to solve the needs of the customer. Examples of this are for example customer registration, password management, access to your own user account, the ability to invite other users to the system, the ability to have a user administrator, who is able to manage other users and help them in the system, and of course overall administrative tasks from a system administrator point of view.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The training had traditionally been done within Finland but we got more and more requests to do training abroad and we have done training in many different countries. Across the Nordic countries, in the UK, for example, in Europe, in Germany and also as far as the Middle East. We’ve had visitors coming to our premises for training from as far as Australia and from South Africa and we realised a need to be able to provide the training also in an online environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;And we are able to provide now the IAM Academy series completely remotely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oscar: We’ve been already talking about IAM Academy. Let’s now hear IAM Academy in action. We’ll bring you now to the classroom where Jesse Kurtto is presenting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jesse Kurtto: As Oscar said I’ve been the Data Protector Officer here at Ubisecure since 2018.&nbsp;Entire books have been written about how data will be the most valuable commodity in the world and it has certainly launched many companies to trillion dollar level revenue – for example Alphabet (the mother company of Google), Microsoft, Facebook, even Twitter… They are all humongous companies, and they all deal with data. And some go even further. That no data is not just the new oil, but data is gold and needs to be horded, just like the California gold rush. So, if we take this that data is the new gold for this century, then personal data must be at least platinum.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The GDPR means that personal data must be collected and processed fairly and transparently, that the personal data should be kept accurate and up to date, be held for the minimum time necessary, and of course, be secured from any unauthorised access.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a good example. This company, Acxiom,&nbsp;and like many others, it is US based, based in the Silicon Valley (California). Consumer analytics provider. And in their own web pages they proudly list their data sources. It includes governmental data bases, data aggregators and de-anonymisers (interesting), mobile apps (surprise, surprise), social media and, perhaps a bit surprisingly, payment industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, what they do is that they aggregate all your purchases together, for example based on your zip code or street address, and sell that information in bulk. In the image here you can see an example of the three thousand attributes and scores that Acxiom provides for their paying customers. And there are quite many interesting attributes here. Purchases made of course, age, gender, education, employment, political views, loans, income, net worth, religion and, of course, one of the nearly 200 ethnic codes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, it goes much deeper than that. This is a famous case, if you take closer look, it was from 2012. And this was before the age of machine learning. How Target, an American supermarket chain figured out that a teen girl was pregnant before she actually told anybody about it. Her hospital visits, the morning sickness pills she bought, the baby clothing she browsed online… That painted clearly a picture that hey this woman is pregnant so let’s start spamming her like crazy about baby-related equipment. And of course, her parents were confused. Why do they suddenly get tens and tens of brochures about baby carriages, new baby health insurance, such things… And it turned out that she had not told everything to her parents yet. And in the end the parents actually apologised Target which they first accused of mis-profiling her.&nbsp;GDPR seeks to change all this.</p>
<p>Tips: how to survive the GDPR ordeal? First of course is to keep in mind that it’s not rocket science. It is basic sense. If data is a valuable asset, then it should be safe guarded, like any other valuable asset. </p>
<p>Many of the issues with the GDPR, like how to ensure that data is accurate, up to date, how to ensure that people can exercise their right to be forgotten, is to simply let the users manage their own data. And in order to do that, one of course thing is to authenticate the user and then authorise them. And surprise, surprise, as somebody working in a CIAM company, CIAM seems to be a perfect job for this. Don’t you agree? </p>
<p>The second point is of course to give any application services, third parties, only the data they absolutely need. For example, using authorisation policies in SSO. They can’t leak what they don’t have, they can’t be hacked for what they don’t have to begin with. </p>
<p>Oscar: Fast forward to 2022, billions of people are enjoying Internet services, playing games, shopping online, trading stocks from a mobile phone, with the security and user experience that IAM has brought. However, on the flip side, the companies and organisations that run these services are facing higher complexity: deploy cloud or hybrid, how to secure an API, how to balance security and user experience? To make things worse, new buzzwords have invaded the language around IAM: zero trust, self-sovereign identity, IDaaS, Web 3.0, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Understanding IAM well is crucial for professionals across companies, not only for the IT folks as it used to be in the beginning of the century. </p>
<p>To hear an opinion about the future of trainings about IAM, we invited Vinay Sawarkar, CEO and Founder of Claidroid in India to share his views.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thinking of today’s Internet services and looking towards the coming years, how important is it for professionals, especially IT professionals, to understand Identity and Access Management?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vinay Sawarkar: In the pre-pandemic days, remote access used to be provisioned by organisations only for select employees through VPN and that too from a few identified highly secure desktops or laptops. The importance of Identity and access management was realised by the organisations during the recent pandemic when practically all interactions of the organisations went online, and several unprepared organisations were cyberattacked. With no identity governance and audit, coupled with misconfigured devices, a large number of incidences of compromised privileged access have been reported, which allowed hackers to gain unrestricted access to critical resources of the organisations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is, therefore, very important for professionals to understand IAM solutions, since Identity and Access Management today is the first cybersecurity mechanism at the perimeter of the organisation to prevent access to unauthorised intruders by authenticating the identity of the individuals. IAM solution provides an enhanced level of security with multi-factor authentication with mechanisms such as one-time passwords or biometrics etc. to ensure that the right resources are accessed by the right users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the organisations have access to sensitive and personally identifiable information of users, it is the responsibility of the organisations to deploy robust and industry-leading IAM solutions to ensure compliance with regulations such as GDPR or its variations across other countries – for example upcoming Data Protection Act in India. A good IAM solution avoids storing such personally identifiable information, using third-party identities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The current trend is that organisations insist on certifications of the professionals and ongoing renewal of these certifications on the relevant platform as a prerequisite qualification for the job or, many times, for executing customer projects. Having a certification also demonstrates the commitment of professionals to continuously enhance their skills, helping professionals to be more efficient on the job.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the area of IAM, for example, the certification ensures that the knowledge of the professionals is upgraded constantly and is in line with the evolving standards in the IAM space. It also gives the confidence to the customer that the professionals are well trained and technically proficient to implement leading IAM solutions for the organisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oscar: Identity and Access Management never stops evolving and creating innovative solutions.&nbsp;That’s how today we already enjoy getting rid of passwords and authenticating with our faces from a mobile phone. Some of us can order a new passport or driving license 100% online and securely.</p>
<p>To make sure all the innovations in IAM become successful Internet services, training is the key to making sure that all the professionals (developers, designers, UX specialists, business owners) are well equipped to provide their customers with the best experience and solutions on the market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Working in law enforcement is getting more dangerous by the day. Enforcing laws, managing safety and public order, and strengthening security are challenging tasks that members handle daily. With international crime on the rise, officers can definitely use a helping hand. Software tools can be that helping hand, aiding officers with identifying individuals and accessing criminal records in no time.</p>
 The demand for law enforcement software is growing:&nbsp; 
 
 During the forecast period of 2021–2025, the global law enforcement software market is expected to grow at a CAGR of <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/law-enforcement-software-market-size-trends-2022-by-global-countries-data-growth-strategies-of-top-players-revenue-and-segmentation-regional-overview-and-forecast-to-2025-2021-11-30">9.58 %</a>, reaching $929.48 million 
 Due to technological developments and better agility and scalability afforded by the Software-as-a-Service approach, Cloud-based solutions are projected to gain traction and see strong demand in the coming years 
 The adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) for public safety and smart city projects are projected to be important growth drivers for the law enforcement software industry 
 
 What Is Law Enforcement Software? 
<p><a href="https://imageware.io/products/imageware-law-enforcement/">Law enforcement software</a> aids police and policymakers by automating activities such as report writing, casework, and police dispatching. Additionally, this agreements enable agencies to manage critical data for analysis, such as crime databases and records – and they can access that data at any time and from any location using innovative software. This software enables officers to work collaboratively while streamlining operations and processes.</p>
<p></p>
 Features of Law Enforcement Software 
<p>The prime objective of this software is to improve task efficiency. There are several features that can help authorities improve efficiency in their investigations, such as:</p>
 Case Management 
<p>Case Management allows personnel to establish workflows that track and handle cases from the beginning to the end of an investigation. Software tools make it simple to maintain case records, such as disposition, court status, criminal charges, and photographs, all in a single place that can be viewed from any device at any time.</p>
 Incident Mapping 
<p>Incident Mapping allows to easily map and track the locations of crimes and incidents. Officials can use this feature to guide public safety personnel, allocate resources, and model risk management.</p>
 Dispatch Management 
<p>Dispatch Management helps record and prioritize incident calls, dispatch responder personnel, determine the position and status of responders, and expedite the appropriate resources to an incident site. This feature helps ensure the right resources are allocated to the right place at the right time.</p>
 Evidence Management 
<p>Evidence Management helps authorities with gathering, documenting, and securing evidence. Evidence management preserves this information on a consolidated platform that investigators and officers can access and share across various databases.</p>
 3 Benefits of Law Enforcement Software 
<p>This software assists agencies in their efforts to keep their communities safe from crime. Investing in high-quality software has numerous advantages, including:</p>
 
 
 Streamlined Data Processing 
 
 
<p>Streamlined data collection and analysis processes are among the major benefits of using this software. Leveraging this software, officers can manage large amounts of data in a single, secure environment.</p>
<p>For greater collaboration and decision making, agencies can easily share information and resources with each other or other departments. With all data centralized in one place, it becomes easier for professionals to successfully manage investigations and operations with less risk of error.</p>
 
 
 Repository Management 
 
 
<p>This software helps create a database of information from previous and ongoing investigations. To aid in new cases and help solve old investigations, and agents can easily access information from a centralized database.</p>
<p>The database can hold a variety of information, including family records, case evidence, criminal histories, fingerprints and <a href="https://imageware.io/digital-identity/">digital identity</a>. When information is available at a glance, officers are also more likely to notice patterns and trends which can help them solve previous crimes and better forecast possible future criminal activities.</p>
 
 
 Cuts Costs 
 
 
<p>This software can help reduce costs because it’s typically easy to use and doesn’t require different officials to handle different processes. The streamlined workflows save man hours across the board. Teams can be trained quickly and up-to-speed in no time. Additionally, the software does not require regular maintenance checks, which can oftentimes be costly.</p>
 How to Select the Right Law Enforcement Software 
<p>Picking the ideal solution can be tricky. Though you need to consider your particular business requirements and goals, here are the most important features you need to consider when choosing a software solution:</p>
 
 
 Security 
 
 
<p>Confidentiality is always a significant priority for agencies. In addition to the data and evidence collected and stored, investigations generate large amounts of data that must be managed and stored securely while keeping it accessible. Security of this sensitive data should be of utmost concern when selecting a&nbsp; software solution.</p>
 
 
 Collaboration 
 
 
<p>Technological advancements have made collaborations—such as those among officers working on an investigation—easy. However, technology has also made it simpler for information to get compromised, preventing accurate, vital data from being shared. In order to break down barriers and bring your agency together, you must have the right software.</p>
 
 
 Availability 
 
 
<p>Any approved device—desktop, laptop, or mobile—should be able to securely access software at all times. A Cloud-based solution allows you to securely access case folders and investigative information from anywhere, ensuring that the investigation doesn’t end when you leave the squad room.</p>

<p>Evidentiary value is an essential component of important transactions. When a transaction is recorded in a printed document, one way to impart evidentiary value is by including date and time. You would already do that for a lot of other reasons. Date and time help you date documents for reference, organize information in a chronological order, and archive records in a way that retrieval is accessible and convenient. But most importantly, in the business context, date and time form part of what makes a contract legally&nbsp;binding.</p><p>And you would want to make sure that their inclusion, i.e. timestamping, is done in a trusted&nbsp;manner.</p>Courtesy of WNEP Web Staff: <a href="http://www.wnep.com">www.wnep.com</a><p>In today’s world, technological advancement influences our lives in many ways, one of which is causing the adoption rate of electronic means of transactions to increase every year. Documents transform from a physical to digital form. For digital documents, the need for evidentiary value remains essential. We timestamp our digital files with date and time from, for example, our digital device’s&nbsp;clock.</p><p>However, it is important to take into consideration that digital documents must have equal value as their physical equivalents. Electronic signatures must be implemented in certain ways for them to be trustworthy. Likewise, simple timestamping may not be enough. Trusted timestamping with a reliable time source is&nbsp;needed.</p> Get to know timestamping <p>An electronic timestamp gives documents digital proof that they have not been modified from the moment of its application. [1] The concept has been around for quite some time and is being used in multiple industries. Timestamping enables organizations to record when a digital item — such as a message, document, transaction or piece of software — was signed.[2]</p><p>In a legal setting, the existence of a timestamp associated with, say, an electronic signature, may not enough. To say that the document was signed when it was actually signed, you have to also prove that the timestamp of the signature is valid. This is where trusted timestamping comes in. Trusted timestamps are generated by a trusted third party that ensures that the they are not subject to manipulation by a local user.&nbsp;[3]</p><p>To be trusted, a timestamp is implemented in the form of so-called timestamp token. Associating a timestamp token with the document provides proof that the time stated is reliable. A timestamp token is a set of data that contains:</p>  A date and&nbsp;time  A hash digest of the document at&nbsp;hand  An identifier of that which produces the timestamp token  <p>Our usage of the phrase ‘trusted timestamp/timestamping’ is taken from the standard ANSI X9.95. More about the process can be found in <a href="https://medium.com/finema/trusted-timestamping-part-2-process-and-safeguards-f75286a0c370">Trusted Timestamping Part 2: Process and Safeguards</a>. But before delving into that, let’s consider a few increasingly complex scenarios.</p> When to timestamp <p>Imagine listing every decision you made each day. That would be impractical and exhausting. Same with timestamping, you don’t need to timestamp every transaction you do online each day. According to GlobalSign, there are two main reasons for including a trusted timestamp when you digitally sign a document — ensuring long-term validation of the signature and adding non-repudiation or confidence around when the signature was actually applied.[3]</p><p>In many cases, timestamping is just a tool for you to keep track or serve as a record of transactions you do online. On the other hand, timestamping would be necessary when making a legal agreement with another organization or an important contract.</p><p>In this article, we will take you through different scenarios, from a physical timestamping use case to a trusted digital one, which will give you ideas of how trusted timestamping could add integrity to your document.</p> Scenario 0: Timestamping the inky&nbsp;way <p>By inserting date and time when a document was created, we can establish the timeline of when what took place. For example, at school, teachers make students write down their names and the date on the exam papers to help track the grading progress. Students write down the date of submission on their homework to indicate that their submissions are not late. It is even legislated in some jurisdictions that official documents shall include a timestamp.</p> Scenario 1: Timestamping the easy&nbsp;way <p>One easiest way someone would do digital timestamping is to have proof of existence with a time source. A convenient way to do this is with pictures. The time source could be anything ranging from a clock on the wall, the time on your computer screen, or a printed publication.</p><p>For example, you have an important meeting today. In order to attend, other attendees need to be sure that you are COVID-free. You want to send proof that your ATK result is obtained at the moment shortly before the meeting. That proof could be a photo of the ATK strip taken with a reliable time source, such as a smartphone, assuming that its time couldn’t or wouldn’t be modified.</p>Photo taken to timestamp the ATK COVID-19 test&nbsp;result<p>Of course, the assumptions hinge upon your technical illiteracy (i.e., you don’t know how to disconnect the phone from the time server) or your honesty. Either way, the timestamping is par for the&nbsp;course.</p> Scenario 2: Timestamping the newsy&nbsp;way <p>Instead of your phone, you could use a newspaper as a time&nbsp;source.</p>Courtesy of <a href="https://unsplash.com/@marckleen">@marcklee</a> and <a href="https://unsplash.com/@anniespratt">@anniespratt</a> on&nbsp;Unsplash<p>This guarantees that something (e.g. the ATK strip in this case) existed or happened at a certain point in time, no later than that point onwards. Why? Because if the newspaper is dated 20 January 2020, presumably it didn’t exist before that. However, you could’ve taken a selfie with it at any later&nbsp;date.</p>The verifier in Scenario 2 could at least believe this much without taking your honesty into&nbsp;account Scenario 3: Timestamping the naive&nbsp;way <p>The above approach wouldn’t be useful if the object being timestamped must be guaranteed to exist before a certain point in time. For example, if you have to sign some agreement no later than a week ago, a photo of the signed document with a newspaper from a week ago couldn’t rule out the possibility that you in fact might have signed it just yesterday.</p><p>Before going further into a new example, let’s look at how electronic signature works.</p>A simplified flow of electronic signature<p>The user uses their private key to cryptographically sign an electronic document. The certificate authority (CA) checks if the user is really who they claim to be, and issues a certificate that cryptographically links them to their public key, thereby assuring the signature was done by the rightful&nbsp;person.</p><p>Note that that the certificate issued by the CA has an expiry date, but it has nothing to do with the signing process. Suppose that the signing date is 15 Mar 2022 and the expiry date is 31 Dec&nbsp;2022.</p>The same flow, with dates&nbsp;added<p>After 31 Dec 2022, there is no possible way to confirm whether or not the signature was signed before the expiry date. The signer could still use their private key to sign the document on, say, 2 Jan 2023 and tamper with the signing device’s clock in such a way that the signature date is recorded as 15 Mar 2022, before certificate expiry.</p>After certificate expiry, the verifier has a hard time trusting the signature.<p>Here’s timestamping the naive way: a trusted third party (TTP) could countersign the document before certificate expiry and add a little message—or, well, stamp—saying their countersignature is given on 15 Mar&nbsp;2022.</p>Scenario 3: using trusted third party to timestamp your signature<p>Now, after 31 Dec 2022, the verifier can believe that the signature was truly given on 15 Mar 2022, assuming that we can trust the&nbsp;TTP.</p>After certificate expiry, the verifier can trust the signature as long as they trust the&nbsp;TTP.<p>Now we can trust the TTP’s date. To what extent can we trust the TTP’s&nbsp;time?</p><p>You are almost done with the basic concepts of timestamping. Still you shouldn’t be too confident with the time proclaimed by the TTP until you are certain that the clock the TTP used to indicate this countersignature time is reliable. The TTP should periodically sync its clock to a trusted time source (‘timing centre’).</p>The TTP makes sure their clock is accurate by keeping it in sync with a timing&nbsp;centre. Scenario 4: Timestamping the proper&nbsp;way <p>How do you make sure the TTP can’t read your signed document?</p><p>So far, the TTP seems to have all access to the information written in the documents since it has to counter-sign them. What happens to privacy? Is there a privacy-preserving approach? To keep your content safe from prying eyes, we could hash the document into a digest. Hashing is simply a process of applying a cryptographic hash function to transform the data of your document into a meaningless string of characters.</p>Instead of countersigning the whole document, the TTP signs just the&nbsp;hash.<p>The TTP is what is known as a timestamp authority (TSA). In practice, there are many schemes where the timing centre and the TSA influences each other. For more information, see <a href="https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/tf/R-REC-TF.1876-0-201004-I!!PDF-E.pdf">ITU-R TF.1876 Standard: Trusted time source for Time Stamp Authority</a>.</p><p>The industry-standard name of the signed digest is a timestamp token, and the final package is basically a timestamped and signed document. Below is a complete overview of the process of creating a signed document with trusted timestamping where each node is labelled with a proper&nbsp;name.</p>An overview of how one timestamps a signed&nbsp;document<p>This scenario features a signed document as an object being timestamped. In general, you can send the hash of any electronic document to the&nbsp;TSA.</p><p>In conclusion, simple timestamping may not be sufficient considering today’s technology and the level of assurance required. You need a package of data structure called a timestamping token provided by a timestamping authority (TSA). Trusted timestamping adds integrity and evidentiary value to the document.</p><p>More on timestamping in <a href="https://medium.com/finema/trusted-timestamping-part-2-process-and-safeguards-f75286a0c370">Trusted Timestamping Part 2: Process and Safeguards</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/finema/trusted-timestamping-part-3-family-of-standards-f0c89a5e97ab">Trusted Timestamping Part 3: Family of Standards</a>.</p><p>[1] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_document">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_document</a></p><p>[2] <a href="https://edicomgroup.com/blog/advantages-of-using-electronic-time-stamps-for-your-documents">https://edicomgroup.com/blog/advantages-of-using-electronic-time-stamps-for-your-documents</a></p><p>[3] <a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/faq/signing-certificates-and-stamping/what-time-stamping">https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/faq/signing-certificates-and-stamping/what-time-stamping</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/trusted-timestamping-part-1-scenarios-9bf4a7cc2364">Trusted Timestamping Part 1: Scenarios</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/finema">Finema</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 The Security of Our Identities 
<p>by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martch/">Christine Martin</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the critical elements of implementing a digital id system is its wide adoption by the general public. Still, from my research in the world of decentralized identity, I see that the general public is hesitant to adopt, which made me want to offer reassurance. I’m deep into digital id, working closely with one of the world’s leading experts. I acknowledge the potential issues, but I also see significant benefits. I’m part of international working groups developing digital id guidelines and frameworks. I know that organizations and people like me are working to protect us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to take to Reddit and ask about digital identity concerns. I’m not a heavy Reddit user; I only joined in January, so I don’t typically get much attention, but I couldn’t have asked for a better reply to my first Reddit post. I knew I could answer it and hopefully ease some concerns.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				<a href="http://www.continuumloop.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/8A212430-36A1-4F76-B051-00C2F0851C6C-e1648591443960.jpg" title=""> </a>
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 If you are worried about the security of your identity, you would want to adopt a digital id; it can also be called self-sovereign or decentralized identity, but I’ll stick with digital id here.<p></p>
<p>The most basic explanation I can offer is that separate packets of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_credentials">verifiable credentials</a>&nbsp;will be encrypted on your device, and these will make up your digital id. It will be like carrying around the entire contents of your physical wallet but securely encrypted. Offering your credentials will be verified via biometrics, similar to how your apple pay wallet works upon each use.</p>
<p>If you’re thinking about backup and recovery, please don’t at this point. Let’s try to understand digital identity first. I will cover the backup and recovery in another post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are keen and don’t want to wait, check out Chapter 9.7 of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/self-sovereign-identity">Self-Sovereign Identity</a>&nbsp;for a detailed overview of Backup and Recovery.</p> 
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				  Your Identity is Compromised 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can download and install an app called&nbsp;<a href="https://revoke.com/">REVOKE</a>, where you enter your email and see how often your data has been subject to breaches. You will likely find out that your information has been subject to a data breach, and you didn’t even know about it. Companies like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/carriers/bell/bell-canada-hacked-data-breach-100-000/#:~:text=Back%20in%20May%202017%2C%20Bell,or%20sensitive%20information%20was%20accessed.">Bell Canada</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/02/11/620_million_hacked_accounts_dark_web/">HauteLook and MyFitnessPal</a>&nbsp;are just a few that were compromised where my personal information was subject to a data breach. These companies can’t guarantee to keep your information safe.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/09/986005820/after-data-breach-exposes-530-million-facebook-says-it-will-not-notify-users">Facebook</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Google_data_breach">Google</a>&nbsp;have been subject to breaches, and every other website where you create a user-id holds your data online somewhere. You don’t own, hold or control your data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need to take back accountability for our data. It’s not up to Facebook or Google; they’re not security companies. These organizations do us a favour by offering backup and recovery options, but we pay the price. Furthermore, they are claiming your data as their asset and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.privacytrust.com/blog/how-facebook-makes-money-from-personal-data.html#:~:text=Targeted%20adverts%20are%20one%20of,adverts%20to%20suit%20your%20situation.">making money</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Government Involvement 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After several&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/digital-id-ontario#:~:text=Ontario%E2%80%99s%20Digital%20ID.-,Our%20progress%20so%20far,-Here%27s%20what%20we%27ve">rounds of consultations</a>, the Ontario government will launch its digital id system this fall. Continuum Loop was heavily involved in these consultations, and we’re happy to see them come to fruition. We believe the Ontario government has been proactive in taking the necessary steps to implement an ethical digital identity system for all Ontarians.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/digital-id-ontario">Let’s look at the Ontario Government program</a>.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				 Notice that “NOT stored in a central database” point. This is good because hackers are more tempted by large lists that they can hit. Imagine getting a list of every Ontario resident – that’s attractive to hackers. Instead, your credentials exist only on your phone, protected by your phone’s security and more. Now a hacker has to attack every phone to get the complete list. That’s hard to scale – and would take forever. More on that below…<p></p>
<p>The government’s involvement in digital id will be issuing verifiable digital credentials of the physical ones we already have. The government issues your Drivers License, Social Insurance Number, Birth Certificate etc. everything is already in their hands. The digital id will allow you to validate your id without sharing unnecessary information, like proving that you are over 18 without showing your actual birthdate. It’s that simple.</p>
<p>Digital id is not about the government taking control of your id or holding your credentials; it’s about taking back control. It’s about offering your data in a verifiable credential format that you will store and manage on your device. The whole concept of digital id revolves around increased security and holder accountability. You get to own, hold, and control your own identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Blockchain Technology and Framework 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can choose to attack an organization for millions of records or do it one by one – which is more challenging? And if I do it one by one, how do I know the credential I crack will hold any value?&nbsp;Watch this short video explaining&nbsp;<a href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/156591609?dnt=1&amp;html5=1&amp;title=1&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;autoplay=0">Distributed Ledger (Blockchain) Technology</a>; I couldn’t explain it better. The very nature of this technology makes them immune to cyber-crimes since all the copies stored across the network would need to be attacked simultaneously for the attack to be successful. A hacker would have to 1. Get into your digital wallet, verify via biometrics and then 2. Crack a random credential and hope it has any value. How does the hacker even choose a valuable target? Blockchain technology makes it not worth it for the hackers anymore.</p>
<p>Steps are being taken all around the globe to implement digital id systems that will work in harmony with each other and be beneficial for all, no matter your geolocation. The&nbsp;<a href="https://id2020.org/manifesto">ID2020</a> alliance is spearheading this effort. They are a global coalition of public and private sectors working to provide an identity platform for all. This identity platform will be based on blockchain technology and allow for secure, verified digital identities. This framework will make it easier for people to travel and do business worldwide and make essential digital services more accessible. These systems are being developed and modelled to meet the eIDAS regulatory framework. This framework seeks to harmonize digital identity and trust services in the European economic area while helping businesses, citizens, and authorities carry out secure and seamless electronic interactions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Take Back Control 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How many times have you scanned and emailed your driver’s license as proof of identification? That is neither convenient nor secure. Where does that copy of your driver’s licence end up within the organization? Did the recipient file it away in a locked cabinet? Was it saved on their computer? Did they need to know everything about you – your license number, height, weight, eye colour, etc. – or did they just need to know you were over a certain age? Digital identity will cut this out. You can instantly prove who you are without scanning or emailing anything. Just tap the “ok” button on your screen. That organization only gets the information they need, nothing else, nothing more. You won’t have to worry about your information being shared within the organization by unauthorized employees or subject to breaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a world where our data is bought and sold without our consent, it’s more important than ever to control our identities. It’s time to take back control while becoming personally accountable for its security and recovery. We can protect our identities from theft and fraud, ensuring that our personal information is safe and secure. With a digital identity, you’ll be able to rest assured that your data is safe and sound.&nbsp;It’s up to you.&nbsp;</p>

 What we will explore? 



<p>To begin with, the article states that digitization has accelerated immensely due to Covid and predicts that this will stay beyond the pandemic. In the first part, a light is being shed on the challenges that this brings, stating that some breaking points can be eased with more digitization rather than less. This is further analysed in the second part, examining how effective digitization can be achieved. Decentralized technology is mentioned as one solution to trust challenges. Next, the article offers an outlook of a sustainable, future-proof solution. Digital identity data is introduced as having a positive impact on Germany’s future as well as Europe’s. Following, benefits of a decentralized identity based on a fully open infrastructure are given.&nbsp; Lastly, the article closes off with naming ten potential use cases, such as digital money, eGovernment or HealthTech.&nbsp;</p>



 Digitization is now more relevant than ever 



<p>‘The spread of COVID-19 and the government measures taken to respond to it have turned our previous lives upside down and revealed where the breaking points are.’</p>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated digitization. That is the consensus among many experts around the globe – including the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/digital/digital-economy-outlook-covid.pdf">OECD</a>, “the world moved online,” <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/how-covid-19-has-pushed-companies-over-the-technology-tipping-point-and-transformed-business-forever">McKinsey</a>, “In just a few months’… the COVID-19 crisis has brought about years of change,” and Deutsche<a href="https://www.telekom.com/en/careers/work-in-action/center-for-strategic-projects/trafo-talk/impact-of-covid-19-corona-as-a-catalyst-for-digitalization-part-3--601542"> Telekom</a>, “the pandemic has developed from an unwanted stress test to an accelerator of digitization in all areas of life.”</p>



<p>The spread of COVID-19 and the government measures taken to respond to it have turned our previous lives upside down and revealed where the breaking points are. Commerce, education, public administration, the health sector, as well as&nbsp;everyday office work – little of this was digitized as effectively as we’ve come to expect in other parts of our lives. This in turn exacerbated the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic to an unnecessary degree, as seen in the fact that sectors or organizations that were more thoroughly digitized were able to react to the pandemic more flexibly. These were the bodies that weathered the new constraints and dynamics more quickly and easily than those where digitization needed to be improved or was just beginning.&nbsp; What’s more, it appears that things will stay this way beyond the pandemic.</p>



<p>Alongside the COVID-19 pandemic and its repercussions on our everyday life, we are starting to see and feel the economic effects and aftermath. If investments can be sourced, then they are most likely to flow into digitization, as noted by the likes of <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2020/09/21/top-10-digital-transformation-trends-for-2021/">Forbes</a>, <a href="https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investment-trends-2021-top-10">Morgan Stanley</a> and <a href="https://finance.swiss/en/news-and-events/sustainability-fintech-and-digitization-among-2021-s-wealth-management-trends/">finance.swiss</a>. Their number one purpose: profiting from the advancement of digitization projects, one of the few sectors of the economy actually thriving within the crisis. Digital identities will be the next linchpin of an inclusive economic growth around the world. “Extending full digital ID coverage could unlock economic value equivalent to 3 to 13 percent of GDP in 2030—in developed economies and will penetrate even faster in emergent nations, says <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/McKinsey%20Digital/Our%20Insights/Digital%20identification%20A%20key%20to%20inclusive%20growth/MGI-Digital-identification-Report.ashx">McKinsey</a> in their Digital Identification report.&nbsp;</p>



 Why are there delays in digitization? 



<a>‘Having shared our data with countless entities online, we have little control over our own data once uploaded.’</a>



<p>Digitization does not solve every problem. Indeed it will also create its own challenges to security and trust within society. However, some of the exposed breaking points can be eased, repaired or even prevented by more digitization rather than less. Digital representations like your driver’s license, passport or vaccination certificate will make everyone’s lives much easier.</p>



 Identifying the problem 



<p>Navigating the Internet requires an exchange of information. As such, various levels of trust and security are desirable and often mandatory. Currently, our online interactions happen through independent platforms that apply their own specific architectures to solve these prerequisites. However, as few people want to rely on a single platform, we end up sharing our data with countless online entities. Having done this, we have little control over our own data once uploaded. What’s more,&nbsp; we now have so many online interactions that it can be impossible to keep track of all these interactions or with whom our data has been shared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Secondly, access and security are extremely poor. No platform can claim to be 100 percent secure against the leaking of users’ private data, be it by accident, security gaps or malicious attacks. The current username/password access to online services is not only a usability nightmare, but also an opportunity for impersonation and fraud. Recently added two factor authentication is a measure to improve the situation, but still far from the standard level of security that should be deemed acceptable.</p>



<p>The third factor is that we remain a mostly analogue world, especially when it comes to documents that earn their trustworthiness&nbsp;through the issuing authority. A passport issued by a country, an educational credential diploma issued by a school or university, a referral issued by a previous employer, and so on. Even payment is still mostly analogue, with online shops requiring you to manually add your credit card information or IBAN.</p>



 What might a sustainable, future-proof solution look like? 



  no single points of failure  individual, fine grain control of data and identity  infrastructure that can not be controlled or dominated by one or a few large players ( e.g. the way the Bitcoin system has evolved, Facebook for social networking, or Google for Ads and everything else)  systems that are trustworthy by virtue of their open, auditable and extensible nature  Systems that model sharing of control and power among the connected users and insitutions  Systems where trust dynamics are transparently defined and collectively understood (unlike e.g. Facebook, where you have no idea how they are monitizing your data or manipulating the information you consume)  Minimal to no costs to participate  



<p>Digital identity data that can be exchanged in a way that’s secure, reliable, scalable and convenient. This would have a positive impact on the economic future of Germany, Europe and the whole world, while at the same time enhancing the privacy of the individual. And to be a success, an ecosystem of verified digital identities must&nbsp;</p>



  be usable by any organization across any sector,&nbsp;  be interoperable, following open standards and schema,  be usable by any individual without exemption,  be secure and privacy preserving,  be human-centric, enabling data sovereignty,  be compliant, applicable to any regulatory environment,  be usable in regulated contexts and recognised by both public and private organizations,  be acceptable worldwide.  



<p>Among the many ways digital identities could be used across a wide range of industries include know your customer and anti money laundering compliance (KYC and AML) requirements for financial institutions, digital payments, single sign-on (SSO), proof of age, loyalty cards, official documents (such as passports and national ID cards), diplomas and more.</p>



<p>Fortunately, over the last few years a small industry working on self-sovereign identity (SSI) has emerged, with a solution that delivers these requirements.</p>



 How do we achieve an effectively digitized future? 



<p>Collectively, we refer to technologies and systems that meet the above criteria as “decentralized”, in that they are not proprietarily controlled or asymmetrically designed to disempower or manipulate some or all of the stakeholders in the system.</p>



<p>‘In the light of this, decentralized technology in general and decentralized identity management in particular have become of utmost importance and interest.’</p>



<p>It is our belief that future-proof technologies can only be developed in partnership. Especially when it comes to Web 3.0 infrastructure and digital identities, a decentralized, open-source approach is essential to secure the Internet as a democratic global infrastructure. Core areas of this global infrastructure should be seen as public services and operated in a way that ensures their accessibility and value for the whole population and economy. Decentralized technologies based on open standards will be essential for enabling cooperation at eye level in the national and, above all, international sphere.</p>



<p>Privacy by design and decentralization are concepts that promise us better solutions, but the pressure of time makes it all too tempting to take the quick and dirty approach. In Germany, for example, the federal government initially decided to store data from the nation’s Corona-Warn app on centralized servers, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-europe-tech/germany-flips-on-smartphone-contact-tracing-backs-apple-and-google-idUSKCN22807J">as reported by Reuters</a> in April 2020. In response, multiple stakeholders like the <a href="https://netzpolitik.org/2020/ccc-warnt-bundesregierung-vor-zentralistischer-corona-app-covid19-contact-tracing-pepppt-dp3t/">Chaos Computer Club (CCC) </a>loudly criticized the plans and the resulting public outcry forced the government to reconsider. The fact that the government heard the criticisms, re-evaluated its proposals and opted for a decentralized version of its Corona app instead – one&nbsp; where data will only be stored on users’ phones instead of centralized government servers – was <a href="https://www.zdf.de/nachrichten/politik/corona-app-launch-100.html">news</a> well received by large parts of society. Talking to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/27/germany-ditches-centralized-approach-to-app-for-covid-19-contacts-tracing/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACI6T0I9iKTWULcDcwSo0dnrkLdJkYXGXg7Q5OzFy9GMu0u-1Wl6Jb41xzKsUM7fMeXkwzNMKX1Dc5lbLBeEvEB2hMOIo404AHZbr1di5ZzZS_g6doyCy_L-qocIKyMMlTaMSRP00_lSg6qpEd6bcwPZfDuUyr2f7bWlNYIiVlpY">TechCrunch, decentralization campaigners of the the DP-3T project</a> said, “DP-3T is very happy to see that Germany is adopting a decentralized approach to contact tracing.”</p>



<p>In the light of this, decentralized technology in general and decentralized identity management in particular have become of utmost importance and interest. The primary assumption is that centralized services create a level of control and insight into a citizens’ life that would significantly violate privacy (hence the need for GDPR) and also fail to provide an adequate level of security. Data leaks, breaches and cloning are just some of the problems faced on a regular basis, as <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/germany-coronavirus-aid-resumes-after-scammers-clone-state-website/a-53168539">this report from Deutsche Welle</a> confirms.&nbsp;</p>



 So what makes a digital identity? 



<p>The range of digital identities is broad. They can be limited to a simple combination of username/password (Web 2.0). They can be public/private keypairs (Web 3.0) with no reference to personal credentials. Or they can be linked to personally identifiable information drawn from official proof, such as an ID document. They can also include more detailed information, such as payment data, health information or evidence of training and employment.</p>



<p>A verifiable digital identity records data that contains the identity and, where applicable, other identity credentials (such as whether the bearer holds a diploma issued by a university and/or has a driver’s licence issued by a national authority) about a natural person or legal entity which have been issued or attested by one or more trusted sources, such as a bank.</p>



<p>Bringing these pieces of information together to paint a comprehensive picture of the respective person or entity requires a high degree of integrity and trust throughout the entire network.</p>



<p>However, the single sign-on authentication schemes offered by tech companies do not currently guarantee that the data entered by the customer is actually correct. In regulated sectors, such as banking or mobile telecommunications, companies are legally obliged to verify their customers’ data. Though they do so conscientiously, legally valid identification can often only be carried out with a break in the media chain (e.g. video identification or the German Post-Ident service.). And, in Germany, the electronic ID (eID) function of national ID cards has not been sufficiently accepted by consumers.&nbsp;</p>

 The benefits of a decentralized identity based on a fully open infrastructure include: 



  users having full control over access to their identity data, through a facility such as an ID wallet on their smartphone,  identity data being transferable via standardized data formats, schemes and protocols,  decentralised data storage protecting against attacks and central system failures,  data of identity subjects being non-correlatable, thus protecting privacy,  Infrastructure based on open standards guaranteeing all citizens equal opportunities, participation, growth and inclusion,  data minimisation, ensuring identity attributes are only transferred if necessary.  



 What are the potential use cases? 



<p>Already, we can identify and address a number of use cases where decentralized identity could accelerate and scale digitization to a level that benefits the most. What’s more, these use cases may also show how decentralized identity provides a significantly higher level of security and trust, not only for citizens but also for the governments and organizations that adopt it.</p>



<p>To paint a better picture, here are some of the use cases that have arisen during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



 1. EduTech becomes essential 



<p>The crisis has been a wake-up call for the education sector. Teachers are still trying to figure out how video conferencing tools can be best used to communicate effectively with their students. Many companies are positioning themselves as the best solution for digital education, but most rely on centralized web technology.</p>



<p>Yet truly secure processes, ranging from registration for schools and universities to participation in exams online or issuance of digital diplomas that require secure authentication, are still rarely in place.</p>



 2. HealthTech makes its big appearance 



<p>The innovation industry should have the right digital products for the health industry already. It should be offering reliable solutions for everything from infection tracking and telemedical calls, to family doctor services, rapid testing and development of vaccines. But it is not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For many reasons, development and approval has been expensive and lengthy, and data protection has put a brake on the research benefits of shared health data in particular. Citizens, insurance companies, doctors, hospitals and governmental authorities are expected to now be more willing to drive digitization in the sector.</p>



<p>Patients could carry their health data with them at all times; including treatment history, x-rays, laboratory results and prescribed medication, as well as insurance data. In turn, doctors would gain instant access to medical records, make speedier diagnoses and be able to verify the health information they’re given about their patients.</p>



A solution to connect



 3. Remote work spreads&nbsp; 



<p>Home working has gained much wider acceptance, with it frequently benefiting both employer and employee. Wherever physical presence is not a necessity, people are currently expected to spend more of their working time from home. For this to be properly effective, it will require innovation for both parties. Employers and employees will need the appropriate digital tools for remote work to access company information and online services seamlessly. This access needs to be fully customizable, adjustable and, of course, secure.</p>



 4. Faster, easier eCommerce for local retailers 



<p>Small businesses can no longer ignore the need for an online presence. The pandemic has accelerated take-up and innovation. Consumers expect to be able to order nearly everything online, be it pasta from the restaurant around the corner, virtual classes in anything from ballet to baking or delivery of pretty much any physical good you can think of. This clearly shows where we are heading. Accordingly, the demand for online shop solutions that anyone can use easily, customer and service provider alike, is vital.</p>



<p>Existing platforms, such as Amazon, are booming, but their monopoly positions are unhealthy and micro transactions rarely viable. Local solutions are required to supply everything a micro retailer needs (eg. order system, payment processing, delivery status messaging service and so on).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When individuals have accounts in the shape of their digital identities that are reusable for the widest range of transactions, both consumers and micro service providers will benefit.</p>



 5. Efficient job placement 



<p>Record unemployment in Europe and the world will shape a new future for job platforms. This is less likely to be in how&nbsp; companies look for skilled workers, more how jobseekers offer their services. Digital tools that help individuals document their diplomas and certificates, as well as attestations from previous employers, will be needed. Conversely, companies will require an efficient way to verify the authenticity of applicants’ documents.</p>



<p>Jobseekers could carry their employment history, qualifications, diplomas and references with them at all times.&nbsp; Potential employers would then be able to instantly access and verify the trusted information of applicants.</p>



 6. Good cyber security is becoming a must 



<p>Cyber attacks have increased worldwide, particularly following the switch to home working. Remote work requires secure authentication to defend against attacks when data flows between the homes of the employees and company clouds, for example. Besides the increasing digitization of existing online services, there will be additional relocation in many areas (trade, education, health, government, etc) to a better decentralized infrastructure which provides improved flexibility and security. Centralized systems are not suitable – they represent honeypots for hackers. Decentralized technology paired with strong encryption, however, can provide the security and trust required.</p>



 7. Digital entertainment explosion 



<p>Immediate winners during the crisis include not only video conferencing and collaboration tools, but also video streaming platforms and chat services. And the great retreat into homes may not be as temporary as first thought. It’s quite possible that digital social interactions will become the 21st Century standard. The focus on small family units will create time at home that needs to be filled, with streaming videos being a case in point with big Internet companies already working to increase the rollout of the next generation gaming and eSports platforms. This will require privacy controls and, to protect minors, the ability to determine age accurately.</p>



 8. More efficient eGovernment 



<p>The performance of many eGovernment solutions remain far from where they could or even should be. There is much room for improvement in digitization within authorities and the public sector as a whole. At present, only a few Baltic and Nordic countries can claim to have such services as the “once-only-principal” in place where citizens and companies only have to provide certain standard information to the authorities and administrations once. However, these are highly centralized and only work because of a pre-existing culture of trust that can’t be assumed elsewhere. Here, again, decentralized technology paired with encryption can create the security and trust required.</p>



 9. Travel Documents that meet all needs 



<p>We exist in a world of constantly changing travel constraints and cross border requirements – who can travel where, tracking where travellers have previously been, proof of vaccination, verifiable test results. With decentralized technology, all travel documents can be verified securely, more quickly and more reliably than with current paper versions or centralized databases.</p>



 10. Digital money for all 



<p>Even before the crisis, hard cash was becoming less welcome in many countries. Now, cashless payment has become the standard in an increasing number of outlets. At the same time, banks’ projects to create central bank-based digital currencies (CBDCs) using blockchain technology are progressing. A test program for a state digital currency started in South Korea in April 2021. The EU has announced the introduction of a digital Euro within the next few years. Decentralized digitization of money will enable cashless transactions for everyone, replacing the expensive and often cumbersome online payment solutions in current use.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>All in all, recent developments underline the trend of digitization in almost all spheres of life, be it public or private. With this in mind, it makes sense to increasingly focus on digital privacy and how to protect and strengthen an individual’s identity online, while also keeping up to date with the fast developing digitization. The continuing Covid crisis, once more, offers an opportunity to implement decentralization in a trustworthy way. This article hopes to have shed a light on the significance of this step, as digital privacy and data sovereignty might quickly become neglected when digitization takes up its speed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finicity, a Mastercard company, and Fiserv, Inc., both leaders in open banking technology, are advancing the future of open finance through secure data sharing. A data access agreement between the companies will allow thousands of Fiserv financial institution clients to enable consumers to provide clear and explicit permission to securely share their account information with apps that use Finicity’s open banking platform.</p>
<p>“This data access agreement complements Mastercard’s longstanding partnership with Fiserv, demonstrated by our aligned missions to empower consumers and organizations to permission the use of their financial data for their benefit,”&nbsp;said Ryan Christiansen, SVP, Data Access Partnerships at Mastercard. “The strong payments connectivity between Mastercard and Fiserv via tokenization, traditional processing and beyond extends across infrastructure, applications and services to the secure and highly reliable API connections we’re enabling through open banking.”</p>
<p>Finicity is a leader in signed data access agreements. Through this partnership with Fiserv, a major core banking solution provider, Mastercard connectivity continues to outpace competitors and further diminishes credential use within the ecosystem.</p>

<p>A conversation with Tamay Aykut, VP of Engineering at Snowcrash, and Dan Kelleher, VP of Engineering at Civic.</p>



<p>Civic</p>



<p>Can you tell us a bit about the Snowcrash platform?</p>



<p>Snowcrash&nbsp;</p>



<p>Absolutely! Snowcrash is a platform for non-fungible digital goods and social tokens, which we all know as NFTs, that is built on the Solana blockchain. We work with major IP holders and brands, artists, generative scientists, and more to create collections of master and or limited editions, streaming rights and digital goods over a broad category of digital assets, which could be visual art, music, movies, sports, anything collectible, basically.</p>



<p>We recently announced the platform’s partnership with Sony Music and Universal Music Group and we like to think of the platform as the nexus of Wall Street, Hollywood, and Silicon Valley.</p>



<p>Our main goal is to offer a safe, intuitive, and frictionless experience to end users who want to own digital collectibles from world-class IP holders.</p>



<p>So, in short, we are a fully integrated premium digital platform, and a creative production studio, providing concepts, state of the art production facilities, marketing, minting, even sales services, with a strong engineering team. And, we’re excited to be partnering with Civic to help make the platform even more user-friendly.</p>



<p>Civic&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s an awesome description. Snowcrash has some really impressive partners.</p>



<p>Snowcrash</p>



<p>We agree! It’s very inspiring for us and we’re incredibly proud of the partnerships we’ve been able to announce thus far. All of this just speaks to the incredible growth of the NFT market and the groundbreaking opportunities it offers to IP holders and artists to establish and control their digital legacy on the blockchain.</p>



<p>In a few years the landscape is going to be very different, and we’re laying the groundwork now because we believe in a bigger, more dynamic future for the NFT market. We’re doing what we can to be stewards to the big players, offering up a safe and intuitive experience for people outside of the crypto ecosystem to come in and realize the potential this new medium holds.</p>



<p>Civic&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you initially started working with Civic, what were you trying to accomplish in relation to identity? What kind of problems were you looking to solve?</p>



<p>Snowcrash&nbsp;</p>



<p>We think an incredibly important component of our platform is going to be good bot protection. Insofar as in the wider NFT marketplace, bots are a big problem for genuine fans and users to engage with platforms because bots undermine the fairness of NFT minting and drops.</p>



<p>Our mission is to bring existing and new IP into the world of NFTs and blockchain, and since we are dealing with very high-level content. It’s our duty to protect those digital assets as much as possible and provide a fair and safe marketplace to our customers – which can be big organization brands, artists, but also those of the users, the fans who want to own the content produced by their favorite artists. So, our search for a solution that is secure, flexible and user friendly led us straight to Civic!</p>



<p>Civic&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s great. After you became acquainted with Civic’s bot protection, what appealed to you about how Civic handles digital identity?</p>



<p>Snowcrash&nbsp;</p>



<p>We would first say that the Civic solution is very user friendly and scalable. We have assessed several solutions and ultimately, we found Civic’s solutions the most elegant. Outside of bot protection depending on the type of drop we also need certain know-your-client functionality. But we want this process to be as frictionless as possible for the end-user. We want to break down the barriers of entry, not make it annoying to get into the world of NFTs. Imagine you have to go through a verification process for every platform, and marketplace you want to engage with. In the worst case, you have to share all your details with different third parties over and over again. And that sounds horrible. Right? So that’s not something you want. That’s where Civic Pass really shines. You do the verification only once and then it’s on-chain. Once verified you have your ID token which is attached to your wallet, you can prove your identity across different marketplaces and platforms like ours. And we emphasize the importance and need of such a scalable solution.</p>



<p>Civic&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that you’ve been working with Civic, what kind of experiences are you building for your users that these identity solutions help provide? Also, what features would you like to see in the near future?</p>



<p>Snowcrash&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having those ID tokens integrated into our system allows us to have a frictionless and user-friendly experience both for the organizations, the artists, and also the consumers. That’s very important for us because some of the content is only meant to be accessed by the owner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This all just helps us to protect these assets from everyone’s perspective all at once. It’s like an elegant Web2 solution for Web3 – this is what we’ve all been imagining when we think about being able to onboard people into the Web3 space.</p>



<p>In the future, we think another nice feature would be on-chain whitelisting with ID tokens. Assuming that we will have our NFT membership tokens and other NFTs, they will have utilities, right? And they may be an entry to exclusive communities or give you access to other limited NFT additions. So, we would like to work on a solution that makes all this happen in an on-chain way.</p>



<p>Civic&nbsp;</p>



<p>You mentioned that the user will only be expected to go through the ID verification process once. That is certainly one aspect where I think that it’s an example of doing things the right way rather than going to every separate organization, every separate portal, and providing the same information that gets transferred around multiple times. One of the other things we talk about is representing identity on-chain and sometimes that’s misunderstood as storing identity on chain, which obviously we don’t do. We store essentially a proxy or an avatar on-chain. And you, as the protocol, don’t need to know anything about the end user – just that they’ve gone through the checks that you require. And our thesis right now is that these checks are common. Nobody’s going around reinventing the wheel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are obviously various multiple versions, but the number of special cases are outweighed by the number of common cases. So, this ties in with the idea that there’s true self-sovereignty in the ecosystem. An end-user shares their information only with the organizations they want to share with, and as few as possible. But then this proxy that you get on-chain is sufficient to unlock various products on-chain, who in principle don’t need to know anything about the user. They just need to know that they meet those requirements. Be those requirements, simple ones like “I am not a bot,” or slightly more complicated like “I am over 21,” or “I’m not living in a certain region.” These are the important things that users must be able to prove. But it’s important that they go through these verification steps as few times as possible. And that’s really the core of what we’re building and that is essentially what we’ve released with the integration of Civic Pass on Snowcrash.</p>



<p>Civic</p>



<p>Let’s talk for a second about Web3 and its founding principles. It offers an ownership layer that essentially, gives power back to the user. What are the values that go into building an NFT platform like this and how are you translating the ethos of Web3 and blockchain, and even rock’n’roll and all of these rebellious ideas into this new technology?</p>



<p>Snowcrash&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lovely question! We think one of the concepts that Web3 enables is the internet of value, right? So, an internet of everything, or anything of value from money to IP, can travel as fast as information itself. So how does it translate into the user experience that we are building? I think I want to cite one of our founders, Walter De Brouwer actually, who summed it up pretty nicely. In three simple terms. It’s collect, exhibit, and belong.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, number one, collect – it all starts with a digital wallet and these wallets will be the browsers of the future, bringing users from Web 2.0 to Web3. And Snowcrash is providing a smooth and user-friendly integration of wallets functioning as frictionless on and off ramps, featuring, of course, a user friendly on-chain verification with Civic Pass to help everything begin!</p>



<p>Number two, exhibit. What you collect is who you are and how you want to represent yourself. This is essential to finding kindred spirits and likeminded people in this digital environment to truly form communities. With Snowcrash, you can display your NFTs on your media profile like one might utilize Twitter, Facebook, Discord, etc. Community building opportunities are limitless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And number three is belong. NFTs will become a social token and have certain utilities. There will be a lot of services coupled to them and adventures will be driven by these clubs, and even some competitions might start. So, the members will be proud to belong as well as allow you to leverage any privileges you have by being involved with these groups.</p>



<p>Civic&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wonderful. Thank you so much, this has been a really fun chat! We are super excited to collaborate with Snowcrash and can’t wait to share more exciting news with our community as we continue down this road together!</p>



<p>Snowcrash</p>



<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Civic’s identity verification technology will be leveraged by Snowcrash to prevent bots from participating in the NFT drops of illustrious musicians and artists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SAN FRANCISCO and LOS ANGELES (March 29, 2022) — Today, <a href="https://www.civic.com/">Civic</a>, a leader in digital identity solutions for Web3, and<a href="https://snowcrash.com/"> Snowcrash</a>, a premier NFT trading platform, announced a strategic partnership to create permissioned access to the Snowcrash platform. Through this partnership, Snowcrash users will be checked for real person liveness and bots will be prevented from participating in the NFT drops of acclaimed musicians, artists, and other creators. Snowcrash recently <a href="https://world.einnews.com/pr_news/564426996/snowcrash-announces-innovative-nft-platform-launch">launched its NFT trading platform</a> with partners Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group with the aim of providing NFT content for cultural icons, including Bob Dylan and Miles Davis.</p>



<p>Bots have flooded NFT mints on the Solana blockchain since the summer of 2021, when the NFT ecosystem proliferated on the chain. The bots have a simple but destructive agenda: to scoop up inventory and flip the NFTs on secondary markets, a practice that is profitable for fraudsters but harmful for nascent NFT artists and communities. Since the recent introduction of the company’s Civic Pass product into the ecosystem, Civic has protected more than 200 mints, helped nearly 100,000 buyers successfully mint NFTs, and blocked a staggering 900,000+ bots from attempting purchases. Snowcrash will leverage Civic Pass, an on-chain solution that both restricts access from bots and protects user privacy at the same time. This will protect the NFT content of the storied musicians and artists of Snowcrash.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jesse Dylan, Founder of Snowcrash, shared, “We are incredibly pleased to partner with Civic to protect our fans, artists, and communities. Through a practice similar to ticket scalping, botting has plagued NFT mints. Civic elegantly resolves this issue for us by identifying human participants and prohibiting bot participation, giving our NFT partners and IP holders like Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group peace of mind.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chris Hart, CEO of Civic, said, “We’re delighted to partner with Snowcrash, a company that shares our core belief that opportunities to participate in Web3 should be accessible to everyone. We’re so excited for high-caliber companies like Snowcrash to up-level the NFT ecosystem and help more people gain access to this cultural moment in time.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Walter De Brouwer, Founder of Snowcrash added, “Partnering with projects like Civic that prioritize the user experience is extremely important as we continue to establish Snowcrash as the premier marketplace for world-class IP holders to launch their treasured properties into the world of NFTs.”</p>



<p>The Civic and Snowcrash partnership offers top-tier brands access to a growing market for their digital collectibles on the Solana blockchain, while helping to define Web3 identity standards in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Anyone who has attended our European Identity &amp; Cloud Conference (EIC) in the past 15 years will know that this is the leading event when it comes to current and future trends in &nbsp;IAM and privacy (not to mention cloud security or cybersecurity). EIC is about the union of analyst thought leadership, the expertise of industry leaders, and best practices from the field.</p>
<p>This year’s EIC continues and strengthens this proud tradition with more than 200 speakers, covering a huge range of topics, which an increased focus on cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Some of the highlights in the “trending topics” area include:</p>
 
 PAM (Privileged Access Management) redefined: With digital transformation and the shift to the cloud, increasing regulatory demands, and the growth of DevOps, &nbsp;PAM offerings are evolving rapidly. We will have a look at this evolution. 
 Getting a grip on entitlements in the cloud: Closely related to this is the emergence of CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management) and the broader concept of DREAM (Dynamic Resource Entitlement and Access Management), the latter unveiled by us at last year’s EIC. 
 Reinventing Identity and Access Governance: Role-based IAM projects tend to stall, and no one likes to do access recertifications. It’s time to rethink, and time for breakthrough innovations addressing the root causes of issues and not just the symptoms. 
 The return of policy-based access management: While being the norm in authentication, we still have a long way to go for mainstream adoption of policy-based access in the authorization. There is also a lot going on in the market, and we will shed a light on this. 
 The rise of decentralized identities: A well-established topic of EIC. We have been tracking and fostering evolution for years, and decentralized identities are now becoming a reality. 
 Really passwordless: It is also not new that “passwords are dead” (and continue to exist). But passwordless authentication has become a real-world option now, not only for consumers but also for the workforce. How to get there? Visit EIC. 
 Fraud, identity, security intelligence &amp; UBA: Zero Trust champions the concept of “always verify” (instead of blindly trusting). Fraud reduction, user behavior analytics, and identity &amp; security intelligence are all ways of mitigating access risks by not only looking at static entitlements but also at actual account behavior. 
 AI for IAM: Finally, AI – more as an “augmenting” than an “artificial” intelligence – in IAM and Cybersecurity will be an important theme. Again, there is a lot going on in the market, and EIC is the place to learn about the newest concepts, as well as to understand what is ready to be put into practice. 
 
<p>This year will finally be the year where we can gather again in a large group, while still engaging with all those joining this fully hybrid event remotely from around the world.</p>
<p>Book your place without further delay for this great opportunity to connect with vendors, industry thought leaders, &nbsp;your peers, and the KuppingerCole analysts, either virtually online or in-person in Berlin.</p>

Oleg’s focus within Dock is on blockchain engineering and inter-blockchain communication while remaining a contributor to many open-source Rust libraries and frameworks.</p><p>Being a part of the crypto world since 2016, Oleg worked as a Senior Software Engineer since 2018 and focused on the zero-knowledge proofs and related verifiable projects since the beginning of 2021. Previous work revolved around being a Senior Software Engineer in Matter Labs and a Technical Lead in an outsourcing company. </p><p>Shortly after Oleg’s appearance, Osinakaya Ifeanyi joined Dock as a Fullstack Developer. Ossy entered the crypto world 3 years ago being lured in by DeFi and GameFi. Previous work circled around being a Mobile Developer for a bank and then a Fullstack Developer for various SaaS products. </p><p>Continuing as a Fullstack Developer with Dock, Ossy went straight to work on Dock’s mobile app. Currently, the mobile app is centered around storing, sending, and receiving DOCK tokens. With Ossy’s expertise, Dock’s mobile app will allow users to accept and hold verifiable credentials on their mobile devices. A later version of the app will include the functionality to stake DOCK tokens. </p><p>The Dock team is growing at a fast pace and we’re excited to bring in new and well-needed talent to help Dock grow. We’re currently hiring for one last specialized role of Head of Business Development, read the full job specification and <a href="https://angel.co/company/docknetwork/jobs">apply here</a>.

<p>We at Dock are thrilled to announce that a bidirectional bridge between Dock and Ethereum is soon going to be live. This bridge will bring a massive boost to the interoperability and liquidity of the Dock Blockchain linking the world’s largest blockchain ecosystem and all the tokens functioning on it directly to Dock’s ecosystem. </p><p>The Dock-Ethereum bridge will allow users to swiftly migrate Ethereum assets to Dock’s low-cost highly scalable platform and vice versa. Users will be able to bridge any ERC-20 token to Dock opening a path for free flow of assets between Dock and Ethereum. &nbsp;These tokens include, but are not limited to:</p>  Ether (ETH)  Stablecoins like USDT, DAI, USDC  ERC-20 Tokens  Wrapped tokens like WETH and WBTC  DeFi tokens like UNI, AAVE, and SUSHI  CEX tokens like HT, KCS  <p>It doesn’t end here. Talking about the opposite side of migrations, users will be able to transfer Dock tokens to Ethereum Blockchain and use them in any Ethereum-based DeFi platforms, NFT platforms, DEXs, and more. <br></p><p>Now, the most important part!</p><p>Dock is building the primitive layer of Web 3, a PoS blockchain that allows organizations and individuals to issue variable credentials (VCs) and decentralized identities (DIDs). With this bridge, the issuers and DApp builders on Dock will be able to create DiDs and anchor verifiable credentials on Dock and verify it on Ethereum. This bridge will also open a new gateway for the enormous number of organizations and DAOs built on Ethereum to issue VCs and DiDs on Dock that will be verifiable on Ethereum. </p><p>This bridge was in our team’s plan right from the first day we migrated to our own layer-1 Substrate-based Dock Blockchain. As the largest developer ecosystem ever built on Blockchain exists on Ethereum with the use-cases and sectors including metaverses, gaming, healthcare, supply chain, finance, and IoT, our team saw Decentralized Identities pervading across all these sectors. For any business or a stream of operations to build on blockchain, it will require a digital Id to exist on the same Blockchain. Dock provides an open-source, trustless, and decentralized platform to create and issue these digital IDs.</p><p>Our team understands the need for scalability of such an enormous requirement that is gradually going to rise as the adoption of Blockchain tech and Web 3 increases in the future. This is why we decided to build a bridge that directly connects Ethereum’s vibrant developer ecosystem to Dock’s highly cost-effective, scalable, and developer-friendly blockchain.</p> What are Blockchain Bridges? <p>Two blockchains are separated by a variety of factors like their consensus mechanisms, underlying infrastructure, programming language, and smart contracts architecture, to name a few. Blockchain bridges enable connectivity and interoperability between two sovereign blockchains. In essence, bridges allow 2 unique blockchains to interact with each other and share smart contract instructions, tokens, data, and other resources. </p> Advantages of Blockchain Bridges <p>As an iPhone user, imagine you could only call other iPhone users and not Androids or Blackberrys. Isn’t that a limitation to you as a phone user? The same things apply to removing the separations between 2 differentiated blockchains. Blockchain bridges bring a host of advantages with them.</p>  2-in-1 - Users will be able to take the advantage of the boons of both the blockchains by building their dpps only on one.  Users can transfer their assets from a congested and more expensive blockchain to a cheaper and scalable one, and vice-versa  Bridges connect two developer and community ecosystems offering growth and collaborations opportunities to high synergy cutting-edge products  Scalability of high-congested blockchain like Ethereum increases multifold.  <p>Cross-chain bridges have been increasingly becoming an integral tool in the infrastructure that enables developers, DeFi entrepreneurs, yield farmers, lenders and buyers, and investors to pursue growth opportunities across the vast Layer 1 Blockchain ecosystems. This bridge between Dock and Ethereum will unlock new dimensions for community members, programmers, and existing project teams to interlink a host of assets, smart contracts, and native solutions.</p> <p>Follow Dock at</p>  <a href="https://www.dock.io/">Website</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/docknetwork">Twitter</a>  <a href="https://t.me/dockio">Telegram</a>  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/docknetwork/">LinkedIn</a>  <p></p>

  We use the internet constantly. It governs huge portions of our work, our socialization, and our education. Some platforms aim for us to have quasi-lives in it.

<p>Have you ever heard of the frequency illusion, where once you notice something once, you seem to suddenly notice it everywhere? It’s also called the Baader–Meinhof phenomenon, and it’s been ruling my life since joining NuID. </p><p>I’m seeing content &amp; having off the cuff conversations about the woes of logins and credentials more so than I ever would have anticipated. Well Carlyle, you think, that must be because you changed industries – of course you’re going to see and hear about the thing you do for work. That’s a good observation, and a correct one. Naturally the media and conversations I consume will closely align with my area of work. However that doesn’t account for, say, Spotify <a href="https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/spotify-down-access-issues-1235199002/">locking me out of my account</a> moments before a 3 hour flight, or a close college friend spontaneously complaining about the inconvenience of MFA at work. </p><p>The truth is, issues with authentication are everywhere, all the time, and people’s complaints are constant (and valid). I’m just recently internalizing and processing these events because they pertain to me and my efforts within NuID. This phenomenon is called the frequency illusion for a reason: the newly perceived frequency has always been there, just lying unnoticed on the periphery of consciousness. </p><p>What seemed like one-off annoyances in managing my accounts in the past are actually a systemic issue with threads connecting to every facet of our online identities: forgetting passwords, resetting passwords, being locked out of accounts, maintaining an endless password list, platforms’ customer support being utterly unhelpful; I could go on. If you start to observe, you’ll notice the same thing if you haven’t already. It’s not just you whose Netflix password you swear you typed in correctly but it only works on the third try. It’s not just you who watches warily when another of your Instagram followers gets hacked and <a href="https://www.idtheftcenter.org/post/itrc-bitcoin-scams-lead-to-hacked-instagram-accounts/">starts shilling Bitcoin</a>. </p><p>We use the internet constantly. It governs huge portions of our work, our socialization, and our education. Some platforms aim for us to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22959860/metaverse-explained-video-games">have quasi-lives in it</a>. How is it, then, for something so seemingly sophisticated, so omnipresent in our lives, that it can be so dang hard to access and manage? </p><p>Passionate communities and companies want to tackle these issues, which is fantastic, but it can be hard to cut through the noise and the “hype” of what’s being promised. When people start talking about a “decentralized internet” or “web3” it can be easy to lose the thread of what the community is trying to achieve and how it will actually benefit people. Those concepts can get a bit nebulous. What NuID is working toward is Identity Utility on the internet. Let’s unpack that a bit. &nbsp;</p><p>For most of us, our utilities provide a crucial function in our daily lives, but we don’t give too much thought to how exactly they work. I have a rudimentary understanding of how power enters my home, but I’m certainly not thinking about it when I flip the lights on in the morning. I flip a switch, they come on as expected, and I proceed about my day. Same goes for the gas that heats my shower, or the water that washes my dishes. My utilities make my life easy, I expect them to work efficiently, and I don’t have to spend too much time thinking about them; even my bills are on autopay. </p><p>Identity on the internet should be the same: usable, useful, reliable, portable, and convenient (not to mention secure). If you show up at a bar, you should be able to quickly and easily verify you’re 21+ without also sharing a physical ID with your full name, home address, and full birthday as we do now. </p><p>A decentralized web is one in which individuals are the owners of their digital selves; they don’t have to trust platforms with their sensitive data like passwords, and they control who accesses what information. In order to make that a reality, it has to be built for everyone to use. And based on the frequency of complaints about the current model of identity on the internet, everyone should want to use it. </p><p>I would love to to never see another “reset password” email in my inbox again. When I move I would love to update my address once and have it propagate across platforms I care about. I would love to never receive a message like the one below that Locke received from Microsoft (how can you not reset a password to your own account when you’re the admin?!). <br></p><p><br>We have a ways to go before true Identity Utility is implemented, but we have to start somewhere. Fortunately, NuID has been grinding away, head down, building the foundation for such a thing. It started with our <a href="https://nuid.io/solution.html">trustless authentication protocol</a>, and it’s continuing with the development of the NuWallet &amp; KiiChain. We aim to be the utility company for identity.</p><p>Identity Utility on the internet is not just possible, it’s happening, and we’re building it. We hope you’ll join us on the journey to bringing it to fruition. I’m energized and honored to play some small part of this effort, not just for my own benefit, but for the benefit of us all. If you start noticing your own woes with authentication and account management, drop me a line, and we can commiserate together (but rest assured- we’re working to fix it). <br></p>

<p>As a Community Interest Company, Mydex is committed to achieving an ambitious long term vision — of empowering citizens with their own&nbsp;data.</p><p>Just as we’ve discovered that this means <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/finding-the-people-we-need-76a2088d3598">we need the right people</a>, it also means finding the right way of working. This blog is our first attempt at articulating what we’ve&nbsp;learned.</p><p>One of the most important things is the types of organisations we work with. For a start, they have to be willing to sign the terms of engagement with our platform, which means accepting that individuals will have complete control over their data and how and where it is used. No manipulation. No profiteering. No snooping. Just Safe By&nbsp;Default.</p><p>Given that many organisations handling personal data today are organised to do precisely that — to manipulate, profiteer and snoop — that narrows the field somewhat.</p><p>As a Community Interest Company we focus our efforts on those projects and capabilities that really make peoples’ lives better: helping people wrestling with cancer and other long term illnesses, improving services for healthy, independent living for the aged, helping people get and use debt advice and to access benefits and public services they are entitled to, involving them in the design of the services they use. This is inspiring and invigorating.</p><p>On the other hand we’re not interested in moralising and pontificating. Helping people use data to improve their lives means working efficiently and effectively, and that includes building partnerships with organisations that also want to get stuff done. When it comes to these rare and precious organisations and the people who work in them, we want to build the strongest possible relationships, collaborating and learning together over long periods of time for mutual benefit. That requires an open, honest but committed style of&nbsp;working.</p> What is good practice&nbsp;really? <p>A second thing we’ve struggled with is ‘good practice’, which we can have a sort of love/hate relationship with. We love good practice when it is indeed good practice, because that’s the best way of getting things done. But sometimes it becomes a straitjacket or a dogma and actually has the opposite&nbsp;effect.</p><p>Take service design. There are many schools of service design out there. Most of them have really useful insights but none of them are perfect and can even conflict with each other. We make sure we understand them and try to take the good we can out of them, not only applying them pragmatically according to the project we’re working on but using them to learn — to learn how to improve these ways of working. We even provide tools to help those involved in user research, policy development and service design to better find participants and manage the administration and management of projects using our <a href="https://medium.com/incluedplatform">Inclued platform</a>.</p><p>One example of service design gone wrong is a corruption of the mantra of ‘start with user need’, by which it’s taken to mean that if users don’t specifically mention things in research then they don’t ‘need’ them. However, people rarely ask for things they haven’t thought are possible. And presenting them with blank sheets of paper — and not presenting them with different options and testing reactions — actually stifles innovation.</p><p>Sometimes with good practices, some people ‘get religion’ and believe there’s only one right way to do it. So-called ‘agile’ software development is a case in point. It’s great for what it’s good at. But it doesn’t work well when you’re trying to build a platform that operates safely and resiliently 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. So, again, we adopt a pragmatic hybrid approach. In the end, ‘process junkies’ just get in the way of applying common sense to any given situation.</p><p>Likewise with project management. There are many wonderful toolkits for project management out there which are really helpful in not having to develop effective ways of working from scratch. But we take from them what really works well for us and configure them to our particular needs and the projects we&nbsp;run.</p> Learning by&nbsp;doing <p>So in short we are relentlessly practical. We work well with pragmatic dedicated ‘doers’ who want to learn and improve. We don’t work well with ‘talkers’ or ‘thinkers’ that don’t have any interest in actually making things&nbsp;better.</p><p>The other side of this, of course, is that sometimes being effective involves quite a bit of talking and thinking. That’s the only way to learn, gain clarity and achieve common purpose. After all, we are exploring new territory and don’t have all the&nbsp;answers.</p><p>Some other things fall out of this. Much of what we do is focused on what we call ‘FERC busting’ — using data to remove the Friction, Effort, Risk and Cost that people and service providers experience when accessing or providing services. Who are the people who really know about FERC? Citizens using these services and front line staff delivering them.</p><p>So wherever we can, we work as closely as possible with citizens and front line staff, mapping every step of the tasks they undertake, identify when and where the FERC pain points arise, and working out ways of eliminating them. This approach to ‘co-design’ isn’t just a ‘nice to have’, making services a bit more user-friendly. It’s a must. Potentially transformational in terms of both quality and&nbsp;cost.</p> Open Mind <p>We are always looking for organisations and people with open minds, open to different ways of working. In our case enabling a truly person centred approach to the design of services and solutions which truly empower individual’s to be active participants.</p><p>We find so many policies and programmes say ‘person centred’ or ‘citizen centred’ but all too often it’s just rhetoric: what gets designed starts with the organisation from the get&nbsp;go.</p><p>Another challenge is unconscious biases within organisations. People may simply lack awareness of other ways of working, or they may bring attitudes that interfere with positive outcomes. Sometimes, for example, we get a whiff of patronising condescension where citizens’ ability to understand and do things for themselves is dismissed out of hand — and along with this, any serious consideration of their rights. Being open-minded means being open to testing what really works, not just making assumptions that, just because something has never been done before, an innovative idea is not worth considering.</p> Mission achievement <p>Finally, we assess everything we do with an eye to mission fulfilment — with its three core elements of making the case, sustaining funding and building proof&nbsp;points.</p><p>How does this initiative, project or service build our ability to reach our long term goal? Does it build momentum for our mission? So we never judge success solely by the results of the project in isolation, but by the momentum and the possibility it creates. And momentum building requires discipline. We have a theory of change that we are implementing and building proof points to demonstrate the value of our approach for all stakeholders.</p><p>One example of this is our ‘make once use many times’ philosophy. We never do a quick fix that, once done, can’t be used again. If necessary, we’ll work twice as hard to achieve the same initial goal if, along the way, we are creating something that can be used again, and again, and again. This can be frustrating for people concerned only with short term objectives. But the opposite of ‘make once use many times’ is ‘use once make many times’ and that’s a recipe for long term disaster.</p><p>In our last blog we admitted that <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/finding-the-people-we-need-76a2088d3598">working for us can be tough</a>. However, it can also be incredibly rewarding. The same goes for the people and organisations we work with. We really want to change things for the better. And while at times doing so may be hard, it’s also exhilarating.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/what-is-the-right-style-of-working-d704d0150de1">What is the right style of working?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>With business flourishing, the task list for the current marketing team (being 1 person!) grew tremendously. With that in mind, Dock went on a quest to find a talented Marketing Manager whose expertise revolved around the crypto market and a Head of Content who was well-versed in verifiable credentials and decentralized identities. </p><p>We’re pleased to announce a successful quest having hired Vikrant Mansera as Marketing Manager and Francisco Baptista as Head of Content. </p><p>Vikrant, nicknamed Viko, joined the Dock team around a month ago. He has spent the best of 5 years in the center of the crypto industry. In his earlier years, Viko worked as a Content Manager for one of India’s largest crypto exchanges, CoinDCX where all content and communications were under his supervision. He played a crucial role as part of CoinDCX and went on to partner with various crypto marketing agencies, crypto Youtubers, telegram channels, and even Twitter influencers. </p><p>Within a month of joining Dock, Viko has taken on an enormous amount of work managing the branding, community growth, and engagement of Dock. He is currently working on revising the brand style, renovating the website, optimizing social channels, and setting up marketing analytics. This means our community and visitors of Dock.io can expect to see a newly revamped, exciting website highlighting Dock’s mission and vision and futuristic images on our social media!</p><p>The second recruit to the Marketing team took place a short while after Viko joined. Francisco Baptista joined as our Head of Content going straight to work planning and creating a strategic marketing plan taking us into Q23 of 2022. Francisco previously worked as a Marketing Director in Tykn for over 3 years specializing in the decentralized identity space. In his spare time, Francisco keeps up his vlogging series focused around marketing which had reached more than 3 million organic views in its first year of launching. His prominent vlog led to an unexpected invitation to Portuguese Parliament, national TV and radio, and established many great relationships in the space. </p><p>As part of Dock, Francisco is currently working on the content strategy leading the way into Q2 with an aim to educate organizations on the verifiable credential and decentralized identity space. By extending his knowledge to potential partners and users of Dock’s technology, we aim to grow the usage of Dock Certs product portfolio and educate organizations on the benefits of decentralization. </p><p>With our new marketing hires, the Content Marketing Manager was glad to have the assistance tackling the task list. The final piece (for a short while) we’re looking for is a new Head of Business Development to join Dock’s tight-knit team. If you’re interested in learning more about this role, read the full job specification and <a href="https://angel.co/company/docknetwork/jobs">apply here</a>.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Andrea Beskers</a></p><p>When Leonardo Morales from Siemens first attended the European Identity and Cloud Conference, he tried to gather experience and knowledge from others to avoid common mistakes on his IAM journey.&nbsp;Now he is giving a keynote speech <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/sessions/5022/3">Siemens AG: Real-World Enterprise IAM at Scale</a> on Wednesday, May 11, at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2022">European Identity and Cloud Conference 2022</a> to help others overcome the same hurdles.</p>
<p>To give you a sneak preview of what to expect, we asked&nbsp;Leonardo some questions about his presentation.</p>
<p> </p>
 Why is IAM important? 
<p>IAM is important for Siemens to do business and be a better competitor in the market. Siemens needs to move from the intranet to the Internet. We need to implement architectures to verify authorised access from anywhere and from any device for the purpose of security in our hybrid environment, but also to automate the provisioning of new employees. Therefore, we need a very well implemented IAM system that also has the responsibility to verify the authenticity of people in relation to their identity and to perform the appropriate lifecycle processes according to business and control regulations. This is why IAM is so important for Siemens.</p>
<p></p>
 What are the biggest challenges you’ve faced so far?  
<p>Yes, I remember when I started this journey, I thought we knew what we were going to do and how we were going to do it. But we hadn't considered the biggest challenge, our data quality and the many processes around identity and account management. That was a nightmare. We were dealing with more than 100 identity data providers, more than 200 Active Directory providers and different processes. And we've had to find out time and time again that not all of them are compliant. This is because of the data, incorrect and inconsistent data that requires continuous data cleansing. That was the biggest challenge, to create reliable and trustworthy automated processes.</p>
<p></p>
 What is the most common mistake organizations make in IAM projects? 
<p>This question is very good, because I have to think about our start. It was not just about choosing a simple process or tool, but more than that. It's a really holistic perspective, an assessment that everyone has to make in order to meet the right expectations. The biggest mistake at the beginning of the project was that we didn't have a clear idea of what we wanted to achieve, and we found that out quite late. The second mistake was underestimating the effort and the costs. I think it is obvious that it is not a one-time implementation, but a process that goes from the beginning of the project to the enforcement and implementation of new processes and regulations that become part of daily working life. That, in my view, is the biggest mistake.</p>
<p></p>
 What is the one thing you would like people to take away from EIC? 
<p>Yes, when I first participated in the EIC, I tried to gain experience and knowledge from others to avoid making the same mistakes or falling into the same traps. For me, it was important to know and learn from others. Therefore, I would like to share our experiences, recommendations and future expectations on the topic of IAM in a large company like Siemens, which has different business units in many countries and is constantly changing.</p>

<p>This Dev Pulse is a short one, just two Holochain releases and a few new hApps and libraries — plus one bit of big news: Holochain now has a roadmap!</p> Holochain 0.0.130: Versatile links, cell shutdown fix <p><a href="https://blog.holochain.org/big-performance-boosts/#a-second-note-about-breaking-changes">Breaking changes</a>: HDK<br>HDK version compatibility: 0.0.125</p><p>Links got a big change in last week’s release (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1266">#1266</a>). There are two main differences:</p>  The base and target address no longer need to exist on the DHT in order for the link to be valid. This means that you can do fun things like use a string constant as a basis for a link, say, <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/5_links_anchors/#case-study-a-music-sharing-app"><code>"all_user_handles"</code></a>, get its hash, and use the hash as a base for links that point to individual user handle entries — all without creating the <code>"all_user_handles"</code> entry in the first place. This saves steps, like ‘ensuring’ that the base exists before trying to link to it, which was always subject to eventual consistency glitches that could result in multiple agents trying to create the same entry. Note: while this does not by itself break compatibility with your existing code, it does relax the host’s built-in validation behaviour. If you want to get the old behaviour, your link validation code can simply call <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.125/hdk/entry/fn.must_get_entry.html">`must_get_entry`</a> on the base and target.  Breaking: <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.125/hdk/link/fn.create_link.html">create_link</a></code> now takes a <code>link_type</code> parameter. This is simply a <code>u8</code> value that your code can use to create link types, similar to entry types. If you don’t care to type your links, you can simply pass <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.125/hdk/link/enum.HdkLinkType.html#variant.Any"><code>HdkLinkType::Any</code></a>.  <p>Finally, there’s one bug fix: errors in a workflow are logged rather than causing Holochain to abort the cell they occur in (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1279">#1279</a>). This fixes a case in which an <code>UnresolvedDependencies</code> error thrown when committing entries during cell startup would kill the cell; it probably fixes other cases you’ve encountered too.</p><blockquote>And finally, this is the first release that features a fully automated release process! This has been in the works for a while; the DevOps team (Stefan and Jost) has been creating, refining, testing, and fixing the build scripts for a while. They’re delighted to let computers take over the boring work and are excited to apply their creativity and skill to more appealing challenges.</blockquote><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.130/CHANGELOG.md#20220316022611">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Holochain 0.0.131: Efficient network rejoining <p>Breaking changes: none<br>HDK version compatibility: 0.0.125, 0.0.126</p><p>Aside from some excellent documentation about <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.126/hdk/hash/index.html">how Holochain hashes are constructed</a> (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1299">#1299</a>), the networking module has gotten one small change: when a cell starts up and rejoins a network it already belongs to, it remembers prior arc sizes of all of its peers (also called its ‘neighbourhood’), and starts off with those values (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1287">#1287</a>). This reduces a bit of network chatter contacting neighbours and finding out how much of the DHT they’re holding.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.131/CHANGELOG.md#20220323023956">Read the full changelog</a>.</p> Delivery zome: send private messages asynchronously <p>Damien Douté, Holochain core team alumnus and developer of the <a href="https://github.com/glassbeadsoftware/snapmail">SnapMail</a> intranet email hApp, has released a library called <a href="https://github.com/ddd-mtl/delivery-zome">delivery-zome</a>. This is the first library that I’ve seen to implement the <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/mailbox/1084">Mailbox</a> and <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/asynchronous-private-messaging/1085">Asynchronous Private Messaging</a> patterns, which let you send public or private messages to other users when they’re offline. (Can you call them patterns if they’ve never been implemented before? I don’t know. I needed some sort of name for them when I first wrote about them.) It also implements delivery receipts and large message chunking, and will in the future implement read receipts, recipient-to-recipient sharing, automated mailbox polling, and DHT-free delivery using third-party drop-off points.</p><p>Damien warns us that this is an early release and hasn’t had a security review, so please use with caution. I’m sure that code reviews and pull requests would also be welcome!</p> Neighbourhoods MVP (Memeable Viable Product) <p><a href="https://neighbourhoods.network/">Neighbourhoods</a>, a prominent Holochain project stewarded by <a href="https://sacred.capital">Sacred Capital</a> (itself a member of the <a href="https://economikit.org/">Economikit Alliance</a>, another prominent Holochain project), has <a href="https://youtu.be/OaaK6oXL6Ls">released</a> its first working demo hApp. They’re calling it <a href="https://github.com/neighbour-hoods/nh-mvp">MVP</a>, or Memeable Viable Product. This hApp is a very entertaining demonstration, using emoji votes on meme pics to show how their <a href="https://github.com/neighbour-hoods/rep_lang">rep_lang engine</a> and <a href="https://github.com/neighbour-hoods/social_sensemaker">social_sensemaker zome</a> can be used to define the reputationional currencies that a particular group of people might find meaningful.</p><p>Custom algorithms let you tailor your feed using the MVP community’s two basic reputational currencies: funny and mind-blowing. You can choose your own preference from four default community algorithms or create your own using <a href="https://github.com/neighbour-hoods/rep_lang/wiki/USER_GUIDE">rep_lang expressions</a>.</p><blockquote>We talk a lot about what’s wrong with social media, and feed-shaping algorithms usually come out at the top of the list of bad guys. Neighbourhoods’ reputational infrastructure plans to do something about that by giving communities and individuals the power to tailor their social media experience to their values.</blockquote>Neighbourhoods MVP (Memeable Viable Product) demo Status module <p>This zome library, <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/status">status</a>, is yet another product of the <a href="https://discord.gg/GsSxDvq9wW">dev.hc community</a>’s weekly Wednesday Workshops. It’s simple but useful, giving your app the power to track and display users’ online status. The algorithm is straightforward: at a regular interval, each agent ‘pings’ the peers they’re interested in tracking the status of. If they get a ‘pong’ back, that means the peer is active. Both the zome and the UI get involved, using only asynchronous <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/9_signals/">signal</a> passing to communicate status.</p><p>This ping-pong pattern also shows up in Lightning Rod Labs’ <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/where">where</a> hApp, which lets users communicate not just their online status but also their presence on a map (whether that’s a traditional geographical map, or a map of current mood, geographical leanings, or pet preferences, etc).</p><p>This is also the first Wednesday Workshop that got recorded and posted publicly. If you’re curious about what these sessions are like, have a watch!</p>DEV.HC Wednesday Workshop – Building the status module Holochain Roadmap is now live! <p>As Holo announced in their <a href="https://press.holo.host/212551-holochain-roadmap-holo-milestones">recent update</a>, Holochain now has a <a href="https://www.holochain.org/roadmap/">public roadmap</a>. I’m thoroughly excited about this, and I sincerely hope it helps you, dear hApp developers, get an idea of where we’re heading — and plan your development trajectory accordingly.</p><p>There are a lot of milestones planned, including ephemeral storage (non-permanent DHT data) and pub/sub (subscribe to DHT change events), but I want to call out one in particular that’s simultaneously the least and most interesting: Stable Validation.</p><p>What does this milestone mean? In short, there will be two HDKs: an Integrity HDK and a Coordination HDK. You’ll still be able to keep developing your hApp as you always have, using the entire HDK. But if you decide to use the split HDKs, here’s what will happen:</p><blockquote>You’ll be able to build a stable, long-lived core for your hApp, based on a stable Integrity HDK that defines the bare minimum of features needed for entry validation. This will help you avoid most of the unpleasant migrations that would normally come with changes to business logic or HDK version bumps. Only this core will affect the DNA hash.</blockquote><p>In order to support the stability and longevity of your hApp’s DHT, the dev team is making a commitment to changing the Integrity HDK as rarely as possible. This also means reducing the number of third-party dependencies in the Integrity HDK; that way, there’ll be fewer bug fixes and security patches to force us to bump the HDK.</p><p>This also frees up the Coordination HDK to change more frequently and give you access to new features, as changes to zomes marked as coordination zomes won’t affect your DNA hash (you'll even be able to <a href="https://asciinema.org/a/I8CFisDTh9UjHPIjSAuMDhbrG">hot-swap</a> them).</p><p>I plan to talk more about this when it's included in a release — just wanted to give you a taste of what’s to come!</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@anniespratt?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Annie Spratt</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/map?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

			  Ben Bishop is a Full Stack Software Engineer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			<p></p>
 Who are you? 
<p>My name is Ben, I was born in the UK and grew up near Bristol in the south west of England. I have always been fascinated by technology and their inner workings; in short, a nerd. My career started in 2003 as a junior web developer, but I started playing with code as young as 8. I currently live in Sant Cugat Del Valles, north of Barcelona in Spain.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I was invited by a previous developer to the team; tired of working for agencies on simple projects, I leaped at the opportunity and challenge presented by Tokeny. Initially as a contractor, but converted to a full time employee, because I believe in the mission!</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>It is the best job I have had, I am given a lot of freedom to apply my passion, when and where I choose. The team is very friendly and always open to ideas and discussion, and the scope of the Tokeny vision brings challenges I’ve never seen before.</p>
  
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Ever since I was a child, I’ve broken things apart (to the annoyance of my parents) to understand how they work. This has pushed me to learn about many topics from astrophysics and quantum mechanics, to psychology and philosophy. I also have a drive towards efficiency and accuracy, which lends itself well to my career.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>To transcend my mortal form and explore every time and space in the universe. More seriously, to help where I can to make life better, to be able to support myself and others.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>To make people more reasonable.</p>

<p>The LEI ecosystem is constantly evolving, with new cases and realised benefits driving increased adoption globally. As part of RapidLEI’s Partner Spotlight series, I caught up with Darragh Hayes, Group CEO at LEI Worldwide, to discuss how LEI Worldwide is responding to these increased opportunities.</p>
<p>LEI Worldwide is a Registration Agent (RA) with coverage of all global jurisdictions. It is a virtually based business with staff located across Ireland, connected through its cloud-based operating model. Read more about LEI Worldwide’s partnership with RapidLEI and Ubisecure in our <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/news-events/rapidlei-lei-worldwide/" title="press release">press release</a> (July 2019).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Q: First up, tell us a little about LEI Worldwide. 
<p>A: LEI Worldwide is an Official LEI Registration Agent, one of the first Registrations Agents approved by GLEIF since the inception of the LEI. We provide expedient, streamlined and client focused LEI management services globally. Our client base includes financial institutions such as banks, asset management and law firms. We have a portfolio of global entertainment providers and a growing client base in the blockchain, Decentralised Finance (DeFI) and crypto project space. These are some of the core sectors that sit alongside other regulated entities which are required to use the LEI as part of their regulatory obligations.</p>
<p>Securing &amp; maintaining LEIs has previously been a disjointed and a risk-fraught process. We in LEI Worldwide try to make it easier and faster to apply for LEI numbers, manage large portfolios, and reduce the risk of non-compliance or failed transactions.</p>
<p>Thousands of organisations around the world trust our solution, enjoy our client-focused service, to quickly and easily register LEIs, often on behalf of their clients. Using LEI Worldwide allows them to meet their regulatory obligations in a timely manner. The LEI is also being used to facilitate faster on-boarding of new clients by streamlining existing KYC and AML processes by leveraging a globally trusted identifier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 LEI adoption is growing exponentially. What do you see as the key drivers behind this growth? 
<p>The rate of LEI adoption has been generally consistent over the last 6 months, with roughly 20,000 new LEIs being issued per month. We have observed adoption since 2018 and it has primarily been driven by regulation, but as the marketplace is now becoming more familiar with the versatility and interoperability of the LEI it is being voluntarily adopted to add an extra layer of standardisation around a traditionally fragmented and challenging piece of the identity puzzle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>“As the marketplace is now becoming more familiar with the versatility and interoperability of the LEI it is being voluntarily adopted.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why is this growth occurring now? 
<p>Digital ecosystems and the e-commerce arenas are not new to the world but the recent two years has enflamed the activity of the global population with e-commerce platforms to a new height. Dependency on global supply chain has never been higher. For certain corners of society, income has never experienced such fragility with repetitive lockdowns and business closures. It has distilled focus of every purchaser from retail to institutional to the identity and traceability of the vendor. In addition the rise of cybercrime, scams and phishing has the general public in a frenzy about identity and trust that the vendor they send their money to, does exist and will deliver. E-Commerce and the role of the LEI, Small &amp; Medium Enterprise and the role of the LEI are new waves of adoption that will surpass the financial world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What are some drivers of ‘voluntary’ adoption of the LEI as opposed to regulated? 
<p>The LEI is now being used in developing economies where some companies may find it difficult to access high quality documentation, which is a barrier to securing funding from heavily regulated economies such as the EU or the United States. Many of our clients request LEI Certificates to generate trust around their legal status, and therefore the LEI is going a long way towards enhancing financial inclusion and stimulating the global economy as a whole.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The LEI is going a long way towards enhancing financial inclusion and stimulating the global economy as a whole.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The world has truly become one big digital marketplace, and it is time that businesses settled on a single source of corporate identity verification across all industries; the LEI is exactly that.</p>
<p>Adoption will grow as regulators, private sector companies and governments come to realise new use cases for a globally standardised form of corporate identity, I spoke previously about its “swiss-army knife” like functionality and one possible use case being Central Bank Digital Currencies and blockchain applications. Possibilities for innovation are endless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s needed now to push LEI adoption even further, and how is LEI Worldwide preparing to facilitate this growth in adoption? 
<p>The wider benefits of a global identifier such as the LEI are only realised when it is being widely used. Two things are required in order to drive LEI adoption to a point where this can happen.</p>
<p>The first is continuing to promote and educate relevant bodies such as governments and large GIFIs (Globally Important Financial Institutions) on the benefits and savings in resources and time that can be gained by leveraging the LEI fully. We have seen countries like India take this approach, and LEI Worldwide are doing our part to educate and inform. This January I was in Dubai at a meeting with the UAE Ministry of Finance to discuss the LEI and its potential to bolster the already great work they are doing with regards to AML.</p>
<p>The second is to develop the systems capable of handling the large volume of LEI processing requests that would come with an enhanced LEI adoption rate. LEI Worldwide has released its new system for registering and managing LEIs called RAMP 2.0. RAMP (Registration Agent Management Platform), and is a proprietary software tool for managing the entire process of LEIs including maintenance of all corporate data linked to each LEI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How does RAMP reduce risk associated with LEI management? 
<p>One principle we are trying to engender to the marketplace is the operational risk and its likely compensation impact of failing to renew. Particularly in financial markets, where the mantra is No LEI No Trade, this is critical. We have coined the phrase Renewal Risk for this. Dependency and speed is increasing exponentially, the permeation and impact of Renewal Risk is asymmetric. The asymmetricity between the cost of a renewal and financial trading compensation can be astounding. We see it as a company mission to highlight the avoidance of this unnecessary chasm of impact by the frugal cost of the renewal. We acknowledge it’s not the cost of the renewal is the catalyst to Renewal Risk, it’s the user experience and ease of executing the renewal. RAMP 2.0 manages that for clients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s not the cost of the renewal is the catalyst to Renewal Risk, it’s the user experience and ease of executing the renewal.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How does RAMP work to achieve scalability and how is it different from other solutions? 
<p>RAMP has leveraged automation to put our clients on what we call ‘the happy path’ to their LEIs. The system is capable of processing huge volumes of LEI applications, and automates previously clunky manual processes such as generating Letters of Authorisation and LEI Certificates. Most other RA solutions are jurisdictionally based, whereas RAMP offers global LEI coverage.</p>
<p>This means RAMP can also be used by banks, e-commerce platform providers and other financial institutions to import their existing LEIs into a single control account. We have often seen multinational or international firms have their LEIs scattered across providers, offering little visibility into the health of their LEI portfolio.</p>
<p>So, we are well prepared to play our part in facilitating this global move to the LEI as a standardised form of corporate identification and well prepared for the growth in adoption. Our engineering has tethered our processing engines to RapidLEI via API protocols. It is this form of digital partnership that, in a very mutually beneficial way, augments the marketplace for LEIs, where the end beneficiary is always the client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How does RapidLEI technology help LEI Worldwide with its mission for automation and scalability? 
<p>LEI Worldwide spotted early on that RapidLEI was innovating in the space and bringing fresh ideas to the table. This is testament to the fact that RapidLEI have now surpassed traditional Local Operating Units such as Bloomberg and the London Stock Exchange in volume of LEIs ordered.</p>
<p>LEI Worldwide’s RAMP solution is powered by the RapidLEI software and acts as the engine that affords us connectivity to company registries data globally and use that data to provide LE-RD that is of the highest stands in the industry as shown in the GLEIF data quality reports.</p>
<blockquote><p>“LEI Worldwide’s RAMP solution is powered by the RapidLEI software.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Everything we do henceforth is to remove friction in manual processes by streamlining with new approaches, and we view our partnership with RapidLEI as key to achieving the level of scalability required by the LEI ecosystem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Do you have any final thoughts you’d like to share with our readers? 
<p>Yes, we would like to share that LEI Worldwide aligns itself with the mission that the GLEIF has set out and the roadmap it has created to achieve it. We will continue to play our role in supporting the frameworks brought forth such as the vLEI and Validation Agent (VA) system. We have already constructed our first VA solution called VA-Assist and will be making announcements about it in the near future about our first two mandates.&nbsp; In the meantime, please feel free to reach me directly for any questions or queries and I will be happy to assist.</p>

<p>In recent years, increases in fraud and criminal sophistication have led to strengthening regulations. It has never been more important for financial institutions to ensure compliance with this – both to protect themselves and avoid regulatory penalties.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC) is the process of verifying a customer.</a> This takes place throughout the customer relationship and is vital to <a href="https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money-laundering/overview.html">help prevent fraud, money laundering and other financial crime</a>. Fortunately, regulation for KYC is in place in most countries, but what’s the best way to get KYC processes in place? For financial institutions, a three-step approach to this is the best practice.</p>



 KYC for financial institutions 



<p>As a quick recap – why do you need KYC as a financial institution? Checking and staying aware of customers’ identity and activity is important in many industries – especially for financial institutions.</p>



<p>Criminal activity in this sector can affect not just the financial institution involved but other individuals, customers and the wider economy. Financial institutions are therefore tightly regulated, with strict KYC and AML requirements they must adhere to. There are <a href="https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/01/us-and-uk-regulators-take-lead-on-aml-fines-for-2019/">stiff penalties</a> and likely <a href="https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/international/2019/01/23/515533.htm">reputational damage</a> if they do not.</p>



<p>Regulations are in place in many countries to enforce and regulate KYC processes. These were first introduced by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in the 1990s, and the most recent implementations began in the US with the Patriot Act in 2001. In total, over 190 countries follow FATF guidance for KYC.</p>



 







 The 3 steps to implement KYC and set up a KYC process 



<p>While the exact implementation process is left to the financial institution, a three-step process for KYC is standard and specified in many countries’ regulations. This is often referred to as the three components or pillars of KYC, and involves:</p>



  Customer Identification Program (CIP)  Customer Due Diligence (CDD)  Ongoing Monitoring  



 Customer Identification Program (CIP) 



<p>The first step in KYC processes is to establish that the customer is who they claim to be. This requires any customer – both individual and corporate – to have their identity verified.</p>



<p>For all individuals involved (including the identified beneficial owners for corporate customers), identity details must be obtained and verified. There is a scope for financial institutions to use the documents most appropriate for their customers and that they can be verified. This will usually include:</p>



  Name  Address  Date of birth  Government-issued identity number  Other government-issued identities (such as passport or driving license)  



<p>For corporate customers, verification documents also include a business license, articles of incorporation, partnership agreements or financial statements. Financial institutions also need to establish the company’s ownership structure and identify the Ultimate Beneficial Owners (UBOs).</p>



<p>Proper collection and use of this data is also part of CIP requirements. Institutions should be able to verify it – and do so in a timely manner. Procedures for doing so should be well documented and followed by all staff involved.</p>



 Customer Due Diligence (CDD) 



<p>Customer Due Diligence (CDD) takes verification further and asks whether financial institutions trust the customer. CDD is about establishing a customer’s risk level and to what extent they can be trusted.</p>



<p>There are three levels of CDD. Basic due diligence is carried out for all customers to establish their level of risk. This can involve collecting additional information, establishing the location of the customer, and types or patterns of transactions. For corporate customers, due diligence needs to be carried out for all individuals that are identified as UBOs.</p>



<p>Simplified Due Diligence (SDD). For customers and accounts deemed to be at very low risk, SDD can be used. With this, the full checks of CDD are not needed.</p>



<p>Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD). On the other hand, much more analysis is done under the EDD approach for a customer thought to be at higher risk. This could include obtaining more information from customers, additional checks with agencies or public sources, and further investigation into accounts and transactions.</p>



<p>Regulators specify the need to carry out EDD, but will not detail the exact steps to be taken. Thus, it is up to individual financial institutions to establish the level of risk as appropriate.</p>



<p>CDD is an ongoing process, not just carried out when onboarding a new customer. A customer’s activity and risk profile can change over time, and periodic CDD monitoring should be conducted. Full CDD and EDD records need to be kept for internal or regulatory audit purposes.</p>



 Ongoing Monitoring 



<p>KYC is not just about checking new customers during onboarding. This is important, of course, and will establish the identity and initial risk level of the customer. Beyond this, financial institutions must have a program in place for ongoing KYC checks and monitoring.</p>



<p>Ongoing monitoring should pick up changes in the customer or activity that warrant a shift in risk profile or further investigation. The level and frequency of monitoring will depend on the customer’s perceived risk and the institution’s strategy.</p>



<p>Monitoring should look at factors including:</p>



  Customer transaction types, frequency and amounts  Changes in customer or transaction locations  Inclusion on <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/politically-exposed-person-pep/">Politically Exposed Persons (PEP)</a> or sanction lists  Adverse media coverage  



<p>As with CIP and CDD, financial institutions should have well-established processes in place to handle ongoing monitoring. This should include the raising of concerns relating to suspicious activity as appropriate.</p>



 







 Connect with a KYC service provider 



<p>The KYC regulations, and the standard three-step approach, provide a good grounding for KYC. There are many more detailed requirements and technical steps needed for full implementation, however. A KYC service provider can help establish best practices and technology for this. They will also ensure that you stay up to date with changing regulations and meet the latest regulations in different countries.</p>



<p>As a global leader in the identity verification industry, IDnow has developed <a href="https://www.idnow.io/aml-screening-monitoring/">solutions for KYC and AML</a>. These offer a full range of features and meet the regulations in a growing list of countries.</p>



<p>Specifically, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a> offers fully compliant automated onboarding using video, biometrics and identity verification. Regulations differ between countries regarding whether verification should have manual involvement or be fully automated. However, AutoIdent allows both and is fully compliant in several jurisdictions, including the UK, Europe, and the UAE.</p>



<p>KYC and AML are not just about meeting requirements, though. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/customer-onboarding-banking-balance-security-ux/">Financial institutions want to ensure that solutions provide a reliable and positive user experience.</a> Customers want to see that banks take security seriously and carry out appropriate checks, but they do not want to be held back or inconvenienced by this.</p>



<p>Onboarding and KYC provide the first experience with a financial institution and its brand – which should leave a good impression. Thankfully, IDnow solutions are designed with this in mind.</p>

<p>ShareLedger, the underlying blockchain to the ecosystem of ShareRing, will be undergoing a hard fork on 28 March 2022. This ‘update’ will take ShareLedger to Cosmos SDK v0.44.0 and Tendermint v0.34.14, which will further enhance, and release a series of new features to the blockchain. This provides ShareRing with stronger foundations in anticipation of new products to be developed in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, what new features does this hard fork offer?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Intercommunication protocols and modules</p>



<p>An introduction of new protocol buffers will bring about significant improvements to our blockchain state and wire communication within the Cosmos SDK. Additionally, we have implemented the Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol as a module, which facilitates transport across sovereign blockchains, meaning that ShareLedger is able to communicate with other heterogeneous blockchains.</p>



<p>Validator nodes – Single application binary</p>



<p>Validators and nodes now only need to download a single application binary to operate, whereas previously, separate binaries were required. This improves the overall efficiency of the process required to run a masternode.</p>



<p>Simplified fee management for SDK users</p>



<p>We’ve introduced two new modules that simplify the overall fee management process and grant more control to those who use our SDK. Let’s look at the example of ‘document issuance.’ With this new module, the issuer can pay for gas fees using a pool of funds within predefined limits. Furthermore, issuers are able to grant arbitrary privileges between their own accounts, so that grantee accounts can execute certain actions. For example, messages on behalf of the granter.</p>



<p>Chain upgrade process efficiency</p>



<p>Chain upgrades were historically done with the Cosmos SDK by creating an upgrade proposal, halting the chain at the given height, exporting state to a JSON file, making the necessary JSON file changes, and creating a new chain with the modified JSON file as genesis. This procedure is tedious and could take up to several hours. Not to mention that ALL validator nodes must be completely stopped for it to work.</p>



<p>This hard fork introduces a new way of handling upgrades. When an upgrade happens, instead of starting a new chain, the new binary will read the existing database and perform in-place modifications of the store. We expect this method to reduce the migration time significantly.</p>



<p>Removing the risks of ‘denial of service’ and ‘false witnesses’ with block proposals</p>



<p>The upgrade to Tendermint v0.33.6 essentially mitigates the risk of having block proposers sign for wrong blocks, which results in the invalidation of proposed blocks and, as such, a halt to the network (denial of service.) With this hard fork, a ⅔ majority of signatures must be verified for the block prior to committing it to the chain.</p>



<p>In relation to false witnesses, this hard fork removes the risk of proposed blocks not containing 100% verified signatures. Prior versions would have accepted proposed blocks that contained two-thirds majority verified signatures, which resulted in an increased risk of proposers including arbitrary data for the remainder third of signatures.</p>



<p>Denomination system</p>



<p>By nature, blockchains don’t deal with fractions. The minimum amount we can spend for transfers or transaction fees is 1 SHR. As a result, we have faced several issues related to decimalization. For example, staking/reward calculations are calculated by various formulas, and as a result, the user’s reward would sometimes be less than 1 SHR (the numbers are rounded down). With this upgrade, we introduce two new denoms as alternatives:</p>



  nSHR: Nano SHR. Our base and native coin for now. 1 SHR = 10^9 nSHR. It solves pretty much all of our issues. The rounding still happens but at a very, very small scale so that it can be ignorable.  



  CENT: Same story. 1 SHRP = 1 USD = 100 CENT. Prior to this point, we have to keep two different denoms (SHRP and CENT) in our chain, which can be troublesome. Now with only CENT, we reduce some conversion-heavy liftings, thereby increasing performance.  



<p>With the introduction of the two new denoms users are now able to transact in fractions, for example 9.5 SHR.</p>



<p>Governance module</p>



<p>The concept was introduced back in 2016 in Cosmos SDK whitepaper. It is now implemented, and we’ve decided to plug it into ShareLedger. This module allows for the future development of governance features, for example:</p>



  Proposing some changes to the parameters or features  Voting  ShareLedger upgradability  Until now, whenever we wanted to upgrade ShareLedger, we needed to completely stop the chain by communicating with all stakeholders (validators) and requesting them to stop their nodes. With this module, this is no longer the case.    



<p>Block Explorer</p>



<p>In conjunction with the hard fork, we also wanted to take the chance to upgrade our Block Explorer. This new explorer is still built on top of BigDipper, one of the most known open-source block explorers, but using version two.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new version is a complete rewrite with many improvements in terms of both UI and performance. The block parser is now written in Go, which can directly use types and interfaces from our Shareledger, making it seamlessly compatible with all structs we implement. This also means it would be very easy for us to scrape more data and include more UI pages for our own modules.</p>







<p>What key existing feature improvements are being made?</p>



<p>We’ve made quite a few improvements. Below is a list of all the updates to existing features:</p>



  ADR-028 addresses: a new specification for deriving addresses for all kinds of addressable accounts to cover a security risk, due to address space collisions.  Better support for multisig transactions.  Transaction fees are now saved on-chain and configurable. We can adjust the transaction fee whenever necessary without updating the binary.  Better modularization on some of our modules. Gentlemint module will now only take care of token-related tasks like load tokens, burn tokens or fee handling, etc. electoral module takes care of authorization.  Transaction fee will be automatically calculated based on the on-chain values (if not supplied.) Clients can submit higher fees if they want to.  Automatically load SHR by SHRP when there is insufficient balance for transaction fees.  Backports improvements to state synchronization and ABCI performance under concurrent load, and the PostgreSQL event indexer.  Allow state sync fetchers and request timeout to be configurable.  Retry requests for snapshots and add a minimum discovery time (five seconds) for new snapshots.  



<p>What key bug fixes are being made?</p>



  Sometimes a user’s input fee is unexpectedly overridden by the application default fee. This is now corrected.  Transfer tokens accidentally minted the same amount of tokens to the module’s balance (each module has its own address), causing inconsistent total supply values.  When the balance is equal to the transaction fee, the transaction is rejected. We now allow spending of ALL available balance, making it zero.  There is a substantial bug in evidence handling where evidence could sometimes be broadcast before the block containing that evidence was fully committed, resulting in some nodes panicking when trying to verify said evidence.  Sometimes peers (nodes) try to send messages on incorrect channels, causing errors that could terminate the process.  A bug with incorrectly handling contexts that would occasionally freeze state sync.  A memory leak in the evidence reactor.

  <p>Here in part three of our decentralized identity series, I’ll describe the key parts of a decentralized identity architecture without diving too far into the technical details. It takes a village for this kind of ecosystem to work – as you’re about to see – and the concepts discussed here are industry standards that anyone can research and implement. If I succeed, you’ll be able to explain the design pattern behind this architecture and have enough information to look up the underlying specifications, if you choose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quick background: We started this series with the 5 guiding principles for decentralized identities. Then, we looked at why we think that the Direct Presentation model gives us advantages in moving towards our goals. Now comes the FUN part – we get to dig into the technical mechanisms that we think could underlie decentralized trust for individuals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part I: <a href="http://aka.ms/identityprinciples">The Five Guiding Principles</a><br>Part II: <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/identity-standards-blog/decentralized-identity-the-direct-presentation-model/ba-p/3071981">The Direct Presentation model</a> <br>Part III: The Basics of Decentralized Identity &lt;-- You are here<br>Part IV: Deep Dive: Verifiable Credentials<br>Part V: Deep Dive: Anchored Decentralized Identifiers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 A story of three documents 
<p>At the most basic level, decentralized identity is the story of three standardized documents: a proclamation, a letter of introduction, and an endorsement. That’s it! The rest is just tying up loose ends. Because I hate to leave you all in suspense, I’ll give you the technical names for each of these documents up front - but don’t panic! We’ll define them in context right away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A DID document is a proclamation that helps strangers verify communications are authentic.</p>
<p>A verifiable credential is a letter of introduction by an issuer containing authoritative statements about a subject.</p>
<p>A verifiable presentation is an endorsement of a subject at the time a verifiable credential is passed to a verifier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can think of this architecture as a feudal letter passing scheme, with just as much intrigue but a lot more math involved. We open our feudal saga in a mythical land, long ago…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Chapter 1: The proclamation 
<p>Rose Abbey is known throughout the land for its beautiful gardens. The main building is something of a famous landmark: everyone knows where to find it, and those who do can find a proclamation nailed to the door with a wax seal attached that only this abbey can produce:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>A paper with a wax seal in the shape of a flower that says: “Hear ye hear ye: All messages from Rose Abbey will be sealed with wax mixed with rose petals that can only be found in the Abbey. It looks like this”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two interesting properties of this proclamation document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First is the provenance of the proclamation. It’s clearly a proclamation from Rose Abbey because it’s nailed right to the door, for all to see. Anyone can find Rose Abbey on a map, walk to the door, and read the document to learn about the wax that verifies a message is from the Abbey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second is the verification method within the document. The proclamation provides the recipe that explains how anyone can compare the exact composition of wax affixed to a given message to the one on this proclamation, and verify the message was created using wax from the roses unique to the Abbey. Let’s go one step further and say that any attempt to melt and re-form the wax changes the color so that only the Rose Abbey artisans are able to achieve a unique seal from specific raw ingredients. What will Rose Abbey do with this magic superpower?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rose Abbey needs shoes for their monks. Cobbler Jan is the best around, working from her pushcart which she wheels around the village. Luckily, Jan has a proclamation too - but Cobbler Jan isn’t as rich or established as Rose Abbey. Jan doesn’t have a fixed, well-known storefront. Instead of hanging on a fancy door, Cobbler Jan’s proclamation is posted among other merchants’ proclamations on a board in the town squares:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>A paper with a wax seal in the shape of a boot that says: “Hear ye hear ye: All messages from Cobbler Jan will be sealed with a handmade one-of-a-kind wax seal made in the cobbler’s shop. It looks like this”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With these proclamations, Rose Abbey and Cobbler Jan can start corresponding with a guarantee of message integrity, each signing messages with the resource only they control, and verifying the other’s message using the public proclamation document. As long as Cobbler Jan can reliably find Rose Abbey’s proclamation and Rose Abbey can reliably find Cobbler Jan’s proclamation, they should be able to evaluate the unique signature represented by each other’s wax and know they’re the true originators of the message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A DID document is the digital equivalent of a proclamation nailed to the door of Rose Abbey. DID documents contain statements about how to securely interact with an entity. Message recipients who want to validate a message need to know two things: 1) how the DID document can be located and 2) what exact proclamation to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of Rose Abbey, this is easy; they use the time-tested “front-door” method to locate their proclamation, which involves opening a map, looking for a building called Rose Abbeythen proceeding to the front door of the largest building at that address. If you get to an address, look at the front door, and the proclamation doesn’t say “Rose Abbey,” you know you’re in the wrong place or don’t have the right proclamation. In the real world, you would encode both pieces of information into a &nbsp;DID. The amazing thing about the DID is that that it’s self-contained, holding both the “how” and the “what.” For example, the DID for Rose Abbey could be did:front-door:RoseAbbey. Anyone who sees a message from did:front-door:RoseAbbey knows to get a map, find Rose Abbey, and to read the proclamation containing the identifier did:front-door:RoseAbbey on the largest building.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Cobbler Jan’s case, you would visit the commons to find their proclamation among those posted. Cobbler Jan has fewer resources than Rose Abbey but still has a DID. A message signed using the “town-square” method such as did:town-square:CobblerJan is just as valid, but the instructions are different. Instead of opening a map and looking for a direct address for Cobbler Jan, the town square method instructions say to find on the map, and search for the proclamation posted at the commons with a matching identifier. Note that no matter what method the DID uses, the DID document produced has the same standardized contents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2: Verifiable credentials: The letter of introduction 
<p>Now that Rose Abbey and Cobbler Jan know they can correspond securely, they negotiate for the contract to make shoes, and Jan is awarded the job. Rose Abbey creates a new credential document that Cobbler Jan can use to purchase supplies. This is a document standardized throughout the land – here's a before and after of Rose Abbey filling out the document:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>A form-based letter of introduction with blanks where four values can be filled in. The letter says “To whom it may concern, blank (the issuer) says blank (the subject) is blank (claims). Signed, blank (a signature).”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The same form-based letter of introduction filled in to say “To whom it may concern, did:front-door: RoseAbbey says did:town-square: CobblerJan is an authorized buyer of leather. Signed, wax seal in the shape of a flower.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cobbler Jan is now in possession of an authoritative statement that can be used to buy leather for the Rose Abbey boot order! But notice this letter doesn’t say “the bearer of this document is an authorized buyer.” It states that Cobbler Jan is an authorized buyer. Because of this, leather merchants won’t release leather to anyone who presents this credential, only to someone who can prove they’re the person explicitly named. Cobbler Jan can’t sell the letter or give it away because they would have to give up the secret recipe to their handmade wax.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The modern equivalent to this letter of introduction is a verifiable credential, or VC. In this case, Rose Abbey has wrapped an entitlement to buy leather into a container that is coded to their DID and signed cryptographically. Anyone who wants to confirm the VC really came from Rose Abbey can use the embedded issuer DID in the VC to find a public cryptographic key in the associated DID document and do the math to confirm.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Time to go buy some leather!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3: Verifiable presentation: The endorsement 
<p>This brings us to the morning that Cobbler Jan arrives at the leather shop. They must do two things:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Produce the letter of introduction signed by Rose Abbey that shows entitlement to buy on behalf of the Abbey. 
 Prove in the moment that the entitled party mentioned by Rose Abbey is the same party that is present in the shop. 
 
<p>Cobbler Jan accomplishes these two steps by opening the document from Rose Abbey and stamping an endorsement onto the credential, attaching the cobbler’s own unique wax seal only they can produce to prove they’re the same Cobbler Jan that the Rose Abbey credential refers to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The previously shown letter of introduction with an additional note sealed by a wax seal in the shape of a boot that says “Endorsed by Cobbler Jan on April 22”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the most important part! The leather merchant could be looking at fraudulent documents that look convincing. Only by verifying the wax on both seals against the wax in the proclamations of each party can the merchant be sure they’re not giving away leather to the wrong party. If, for example, Cobbler Fred (a competitor) creates a fake letter of Introduction claiming to be from Rose Abbey using his own identifier and authoritative seal, when the leather merchant looks up the seal that is authoritative for Rose Abbey they’ll see that it doesn’t quite match the seal on the endorsement that Cobbler Fred handed over. One difference between our feudal world and modern times is that Cobbler Fred might be smart and talented enough with an inkpot and quill to steal the original letter, and alter it convincingly while keeping the seal intact. Luckily, modern digital doesn’t rely on human perception, so this risk is mitigated today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This endorsement of Rose Abbey’s letter of introduction could happen many times. Cobbler Jan could visit various leather merchants and prove each time that the entity referred to in the letter of introduction is in fact the person there in the moment. As long as everyone protects their secret wax formulas, and everyone faithfully validates the documents there’s reasonable protection against counterfeit letters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The modern equivalent of this endorsement process is a verifiable presentation, or VP. A VP can be considered a “proof of possession.” Here’s how it works in some truly medieval pseudocode:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If:</p>
<p>a VP and VC are presented together</p>
<p>and the issuer of the VP and the subject of the VC are both Cobbler Jan</p>
<p>and the VP signature can be validated with Cobbler Jan’s DID document verification method</p>
<p>and the VC signature can be validated with Rose Abbey’s DID document verification method</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>it can be assumed that the VC was issued to the entity that issued the VP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The big picture 
<p>And that, my friends, is the basic model behind DID. We have fancier terms and we can use modern cryptography instead of wax seals with unique ingredients, but the fundamentals are the same. All parties involved must safely manage the ingredients needed to produce a signature that can’t be replicated, and must all proclaim a signature verification method using a mechanism that’s well-known. When credentials successfully validate, they guarantee message integrity, and that guarantee allows secure conversation to begin, a key layer for trusted commerce. Credentials can be issued to a subject, then presented and endorsed by that subject, enabling the exchange of goods and services as a result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But where is the decentralization?</p>
<p>If you’ve made it this far, you may have noticed we aren’t talking a lot about decentralized concepts. You might also be itching to point out that this story is just a tale of a secure messaging scheme based on asymmetric cryptography, and that signed messages have been around for almost as long as Rose Abbey. You’re absolutely right. There's nothing about the model or standards we’ve defined that forces decentralization or excludes centralization. The DID and VC specifications are intentionally agnostic to the properties of the specific trust anchors that might be implemented, which is a big part of the reason we think they can be successful. The difference between any old, secure messaging scheme based on asymmetric cryptography and this messaging scheme based on asymmetric cryptography, is the layer of abstraction that allows old and new, decentralized and centralized - and anything we come up with in the future - to work alongside each other. We’ll talk more about this in the next installation of this series.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To quickly recap: DID documents are the posted proclamations that enable VCs. VCs are the “fill in the blank” authoritative statements of attribution of entitlement that are issued against a subject identifier. are endorsements at the time of presentation that prove that the entity showing the credential is, in fact, the named party. The system looks something like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>A diagram showing rose abbey on the left with a title of “Issuer”, Cobbler Jan in the middle with the title of “Holder” and a leather shop on the right with the title of “Verifier”. &nbsp;Below each entity is a DID document and there are arrows that show 1) a verifiable credential passing from Rose Abbey to Cobbler Jan, 2) Cobbler Jan verifying the Did document of Rose Abbey, 3) a verifiable presentation passing from Cobbler Jan to the leather shop, 4) the leather shop verifying Cobbler Jan’s DID document and 5) The leather shop verifying Rose Abbey’s DID document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few important things to note here: Everyone has a DID document (even the leather shop didn’t cover in-depth) and the content is standardized. But the method by which the document is fetched can differ. DID documents could be world-readable and searchable like Rose Abbey, but others could be shared privately at the time of first interaction, or even ephemerally created once and then discarded. Every entity can make its own choices about which method works best in each context. We can also support emerging options for DID document storage without requiring a rewrite of the entire architecture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, there’s a lot more to end-to-end architecture than just the documents that fly around. How are the documents delivered? How are the exact contents and types of letters negotiated to match the context? Can you selectively disclose part of the letter without revealing all the details? How does everyone know the rules in any given village? And, how do people know who to trust and for what?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answers are… stay tuned! Feudal metaphors were not built in a day. I’ll be back in the next installment to discuss fascinating topics, like whether Rose Abbey uses couriers on horseback to deliver their documents, or how Cobbler Jan can choose between African or European carrier pigeons to send different portions of the letter of introduction, depending on whether or not a given monk wants to be sure their shoes are made only from vegan leather. If you can’t wait that long, you can cheat a little and – it’s a long list but that’s the fun of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about these topics and the technologies that fill out all the steps in the process, you’re in luck! Our next installment in this series is a DEEP DIVE! We’ll take our feudal tale and outline the industry stack we’ve implemented at Microsoft, including W3C Decentralized Identifiers, the OpenID Foundation OIDC4SSI Transport family, and the W3C VC Data Model 1.1. If you’re still here after this fantastical feudal adventure, I salute you and thank you for joining me on our quest.</p>

The cards we carry and present every single day feel different than many common digital credentials (such as federated credentials) that identify us and communicate our attributes online, but that gap is narrowing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the identity ecosystem looks at emerging paradigms for trust and individual agency in our online interactions, we see use cases where the federated identity model we know so well in the real world might work to provide more digital autonomy and control.&nbsp;We call this model the “presentation model” because an end user collects and controls the presentation of their credential when and where they choose.&nbsp;The presentation model does not replace online federated models, but instead, each model can be used where most valuable.</p>

<p>Part IV: Deep Dive: Verifiable Credentials</p>
<p>Part V:&nbsp; Deep Dive: Anchored Decentralized Identifiers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we use identity-related credentials in the real world, they often have different properties than digital credentials. There are two separate ceremonies in most cases: issuance and presentation.&nbsp; If you have spent any time at a department of motor vehicles or a passport office, you’ve seen what an issuance ceremony can be – it is usually an intensive process, but the tradeoff is that once you have a credential like a driver’s license or passport, you can use that credential for multiple purposes, at multiple places, over a long period of time. You, the “holder” of the credential, can choose to present your credential as a (mostly) voluntary exchange, in which the verifier of your credential can grant you access to some kind of resource - for example, they might allow you into a nightclub, or allow you to check out a library book.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s use a concrete real-world scenario: roadside assistance. Many of us are members of automotive clubs which advertise national and international coverage in the case of vehicle mishaps. After a sign-up song and dance and giving them my annual fee, they issue me a card I stuff into my wallet and forget about. Until one fateful night when my car breaks down in a location I am unfamiliar with. In this case, a miraculous thing happens – I can pull my auto club card from my wallet, and present that card to a garage that has never heard of me before, and a tow truck will arrive to help me. This issue-then-present credentialling model that has long powered the physical world is ready for adoption in the digital world too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The technical name for the model at work here is called the Direct Presentation model. A credential is issued, and then held for a long period of time with intermittent voluntary presentations to many different verifiers. To put that back into our example, my auto club issues me a card, which I hold in my wallet for years (maybe decades!), and I might choose to show that card to a garage when I need a tow, or possibly to a store to get a discount.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let’s switch gears (see what I did there?) to look at the digital world as you use it today. Rather than giving me a card I can store in my wallet, websites (and other services) create a user account. My resource access is tied to this account, and I must prove I own the account by authenticating to the website. After I have authenticated, there is a limited amount of time where the website “knows” who I am and can vouch on my behalf to applications and to other domains, introducing me to resources while sharing data about me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This process of an authoritative Identity Provider who redirects me to resources and introduces me as a valid account within their domain with certain attributes and entitlements is called the Federated Presentation model. Going back to my night on the highway, instead of presenting my road service card to the garage, I’d have to borrow their point of sale (POS) terminal to authenticate to the auto club website, then be redirected to the garage website - with my card information included in the redirect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both of these models got me my tow truck. They both have important qualities, and there are a number of use cases where either could do the job. But each has a few use cases where they can really shine. In the case of federated presentation, enterprise scenarios such as single sign-on (SSO) provide a compelling combination of convenience and security. Likewise, the digital version of the direct presentation model has great applications - where users benefit from increased agency in their dealings with businesses, governments, and even each other. We’ll cover the key qualities of the direct presentation model in the rest of this blog, and then in our next blog, we can talk through what high level architectural requirements we foresee. Remember, my car has broken down, I’m in a remote and unfamiliar place, and I need to leverage the roadside assistance that I have purchased in advance to get service from a garage that I have never previously done business with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Common qualities of the Direct Presentation model (Real-world and digital) 
<p>My choice of when and what gets presented</p>
<p>As I sit in my broken-down car, I have options. I might have roadside assistance coverage from multiple providers. I might even have a coupon for a free tow I picked up from the roadside diner or prefer to use a credit card. If I do, I can debate which offers the best deal, and present what works for me. This sounds like a simple thing, but it is tougher to do in the federated model because I can’t look through my wallet to remember which clubs I’m a member of or what coupons I’ve squirreled away. Instead, the garage would have to try to help me remember which auto clubs I might be affiliated with by showing me logos until I see one I recognize.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything goes through me</p>
<p>When I interact with the garage, I’m the person presenting my credential and I’m the person getting a receipt back. No real-time interaction is needed with the auto club, which is lucky because it’s the middle of the night. But I am aware of the interactions in real time, and if I want to, I can compare my receipts from all the breakdowns my car has had, see trends in what kinds of transactions I’ve been a part of, and even find places where I’ve been overcharged or where the promises of the transaction haven’t materialized. This is because I was an agent in the direct presentation. In a federated model, the logs of what data was passed about me are likely available but I would have to collect those logs from many different places – if they’re made available to me - to see the full picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Present it anywhere</p>
<p>Imagine the case where every garage had to have a separate contract with every regional auto club whose members might want to use their services. The overhead of such a system would be high. Instead, the garages and regional clubs all agree to abide by a common association’s trust framework that establishes the rules and practices that everyone must follow. In the direct presentation model, standards help establish the rules which allow easy establishment of associations, and there’s a potential for direct presentation to make it easier to set up common trust frameworks. This is what allows me to present my membership card from Alberta on a dark highway in North Dakota – where both I and the driver can be confident in the transaction. If everyone uses a common presentation model, it opens the doors to make it easier for trust frameworks to be formed and governed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Unique properties of the Digital Direct Presentation model 
<p>There are few things that couldn’t work for me as I sit in my broken-down car with a physical auto club card, but that could work if I were using a digital credential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selective disclosure</p>
<p>When I hand my auto club card to the tow truck operator on the dark highway, I cannot prevent that person from reading everything printed on that card. If the card were to show my home address, the truck driver would know where I lived. But with a digital credential, I can choose what to release (and what not to) during presentation – in this example, I can simply release the fact that I qualify for a tow, and nothing else. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My wallet has a brain</p>
<p>Another unique quality of a digital direct presentation is that because software can help, my wallet has a brain and can be a trusted advisor. As I sit in my car, shivering, I might make a bad choice about which garage to call. A digital wallet might cross-reference my choice in garages with the Better Business Bureau and suggest I choose a business with a rating higher than one star, saving me from a bad experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 But what IS the digital version of Direct Presentation? 
<p>There are several important initiatives already underway that qualify as direct presentation – including mobile Driver’s License projects based on the ISO 18013 specification, as well as various ePassport initiatives. Vaccine passports are another case where the direct presentation model is emerging, with initiatives such as <a href="https://vci.org/">VCI</a> and <a href="https://www.goodhealthpass.org/">Good Health Pass (GHP)</a> gaining traction.&nbsp; In the identity world, we at Microsoft see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> specification as a Data format with long-term potential to let the industry move towards multi-purpose direct presentation. We hope to see some of the models converge over time as they mature, and we’ll deep dive on each of these options over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Federated Presentation and Direct Presentation are complimentary 
<p>You might be wondering: do we see the direct presentation model replacing federated models? No. We believe that federated and direct presentation models will co-exist, and that each model lends itself to solving different problems. Federated presentation is a modern workhorse when it comes to use cases like enterprise single sign-on, and there will continue to be many places where involving the user in a presentation ceremony will never make sense. The good news is that we have specifications that can help federated and direct models to co-exist, and we are working in the <a href="http://openid.net/">OpenID Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, and other standards bodies to find an interoperable balance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want a sneak peek, check out Kristina Yasuda and Torsten Lodderstedt at the recent OAuth Security Workshop, talking about some of their work that leverages the&nbsp;Self-Issued Identity Provider section of the OpenID Connect specification. This work truly bridges the worlds of Direct and Federated Presentation models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 But wait, what does this have to do with Decentralization? 
<p>If you’ve noticed that we’re not talking a lot about decentralized tech here, don’t be shocked. Microsoft sees unique and differentiated value in how decentralized technology can fulfill many of the criteria listed above, and we’re excited to dig deeper into what decentralized technology can deliver in later posts! But our goals center on both human and business outcomes. As such, we can and will use decentralized technology where it’s needed and useful, and we’ll do our best to discuss with the community the trade-offs and advantages in the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What’s next? 
<p>Now that we have a foundational understanding of the Direct Presentation model and its place in the digital world, our next installment will discuss how we build a reference architecture that could deliver on our principles using the Direct Presentation model. We’ll start with a high-level architecture and slowly drill into the various parts of that architecture, describing the standards at play and how we can see those standards pushing us closer to the 5 guiding principles. There are quite a lot of standards – we’ve constructed a <a href="http://linktr.ee/decentralizedidentity">handy linktree</a> to let you easily index into the various specifications we are participating in and/or implementing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is going to be fun!</p>

<p>Watch Dock’s first webinar as Nick Lambert and Grant Thomas discuss in detail:</p>  Credenxia’s need to move towards a decentralized solution  Why they chose to collaborate with Dock  The ease of integrating Dock’s technology into their workflows  Dock’s latest releases and future roadmap  <p>Back in October of 2021, <a href="https://blog.dock.io/credenxia-leaps-into-the-future-with-docks-api/">Credenxia worked with Dock</a> to move towards a decentralized solution for creating and managing employee credentials. This move towards a decentralized solution was needed to keep Credenxia competitive and relevant to workplace needs. &nbsp;</p><p>After some time of Credenxia integrating with Dock’s technology, we decided to host a webinar to provide details of this collaboration and give real-world insight into the benefits of decentralization. </p><p>Nick Lambert, CEO at Dock was joined by guest speaker Grant Thomas, COO at Credenxia in February 2022 to discuss how the collaboration formed, how Dock’s technology has future-proofed Credenxia’s organization, and more. </p><p>Previously, Credenxia provided a centralized solution with verification through their cloud-based portal. Thanks to Dock’s technology, Credenxia now offers a decentralized solution that gives the control over data and identity back to the user and allows for instant verification of credentials. </p><p>Nick Lambert opens the webinar by explaining the basic concepts of Verifiable Credentials (VC) and Decentralized Identity (DID). Decentralized Identifiers are globally unique identifiers that allow the owner to prove cryptographic control over them. Anything from a person, organization, to data models or abstract entities, can have DIDs. Verifiable Credentials are an open standard for digital credentials, they are tamper-proof credentials that can be cryptographically verified. They represent things found in physical forms such as a driving license or passport, and things that have no physical form such as ownership of a bank account. VCs incorporate digital signatures that make them tamper-resistant and more trustworthy than their physical counterparts. </p><p>He goes on to explain why individuals and organizations should care and want to benefit from the use of VCs and DIDs, from users being able to take back control over one's identity and data, to it being instantly verifiable. </p><p>Over to Credenxia</p><p>Grant Thomas follows on by giving the viewers a detailed brief on what Credenxia does, how the verification is done, and how organizations benefit from their services. Credenxia works with organizations in mining, oil and gas, public transportation, and construction to name a few, acting as a third-party verifier. &nbsp;</p><p>Credentials are checked for each worker depending on the environment they are working within. Everything from an individual's degree, trade certificates, and licenses are checked and verified by Credenxia, on behalf of the organization the individual is working for. Dock’s technology allowing for the creation and issuance of tamper-proof verifiable credentials has streamlined this process where the credentials can be instantly and cryptographically verified. </p><p>Nick Lambert and Grant Thomas go on to explain the process of Credenxia integrating Dock’s technology and the tremendous benefits of Dock’s blockchain and Dock Certs API. Grant goes into detail on the challenges Credenxia faced from the downsides of running on a trust model to the manual verification required. Dock’s Certs API allows Credenxia to mitigate these challenges. Dock’s W3C compliance and wealth of knowledge facilitating interoperability with other open source technologies gave Credenxia trust in the technology. </p><p>Drawing to the end of the webinar, Nick Lambert highlights Dock Certs, our no-code solution for creating, issuing, and verifying credentials. He outlines Dock’s future roadmap and what our community can expect to see in the next month before closing off.

  <p>The Thymeleaf library has been around at least for 10 years and it is still actively maintained as of today. It is designed to allow stronger collaboration between design and developer teams for some use cases, as Thymeleaf templates look like HTML and can be displayed in the browser as static prototypes.</p>

<p>In this tutorial you will learn how to create a simple Spring WebFlux application with Thymeleaf and Okta OIDC authentication, addressing the security concerns of preventing CSRF when submitting forms, and protecting functionality based on the user authorities and authentication status.</p>

 What is Thymeleaf? 

<p></p>

<p>Thymeleaf is an open-source server-side Java template engine for standalone and web applications, that was created by Daniel Fernández. The templates look like HTML and can be integrated with Spring MVC and Spring Security among other popular development frameworks. Although documentation about integration with Spring WebFlux is hard to find, it is currently supported and the Thymeleaf starter dependency performs the <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web-reactive.html#webflux-view-thymeleaf">auto-configuration</a> of the template engine, template resolver and reactive view resolver.</p>

<p>Among its features, Thymeleaf allows you to:</p>

 
   Work with fragments: only a part of a template will be rendered. This can be useful for updating part of a page from responses in AJAX calls. It also provides a componentization tool, as the fragments can be included in multiple templates. 
   Handle forms with model objects containing their fields 
   Render variables and externalized text messages through its <a href="https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/tutorials/3.0/usingthymeleaf.html#standard-expression-syntax">Standard Expression Syntax</a> 
   Perform iterations and conditional evaluations 
 

 Create a Spring WebFlux application with Thymeleaf 

<p>Create a simple monolithic Spring Boot reactive application, that will use Thymeleaf for page templates.
You can use <a href="https://start.spring.io/">Spring Initializr</a>, from its web UI, or download the starter app with the following HTTPie command:</p>

   <code>https -d start.spring.io/starter.zip bootVersion==2.6.4 \
  baseDir==thymeleaf-security \
  groupId==com.okta.developer.thymeleaf-security \
  artifactId==thymeleaf-security \
  name==thymeleaf-security \
  packageName==com.okta.developer.demo \
  javaVersion==11 \
  dependencies==webflux,okta,thymeleaf,devtools
</code>   

<p>Extract the Maven project and some additional dependencies. The <code>thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity5</code> dependency is required to include security conditionals in the templates, and
<code>spring-security-test</code> has mock login features that will help when writing controller tests.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.thymeleaf.extras&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;thymeleaf-extras-springsecurity5&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;3.0.4.RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.security&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-security-test&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   
 Add authentication with OpenID Connect 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Web and press Enter.</p>

<p>Select Okta Spring Boot Starter. 
    Accept the default Redirect URI values provided for you. That is, a Login Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> and a Logout Redirect of <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Web App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>

   <code>Okta application configuration has been written to: 
  /path/to/app/src/main/resources/application.properties
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to see the issuer and credentials for your app.</p>
   <code>okta.oauth2.issuer=https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.client-id=0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
okta.oauth2.client-secret=NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS
</code>   

<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/springboot/create-okta-application/">Create a Spring Boot App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>The Okta configuration is now in <code>application.properties</code>. Rename it to <code>application.yml</code> and add the following additional properties:</p>

   <code>spring:
  thymeleaf:
    prefix: file:src/main/resources/templates/  
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          okta:
            user-name-attribute: email

okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: /oauth2/default
    client-id: {clientId}
    client-secret: {clientSecret}
    scopes:
      - email
      - openid
</code>   

<p>Notice the <code>profile</code> scope is not requested for the first test. Only <code>openid</code> is a <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-basic-1_0.html#Scopes">required scope</a> to perform an OpenID Connect request. The <code>thymeleaf.prefix</code> property enables the hot-reloading of the templates, when the <code>spring-boot-devtools</code> dependency is included in the project.</p>

 Add some Thymeleaf templates 

<p>Create a <code>src/main/resources/templates</code> folder for the templates you are going to create. Create a <code>home.html</code> template with the following content:</p>

   <code>&lt;html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;User Details&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;!--/*/ &lt;th:block th:include="head :: head"/&gt; /*/--&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body id="samples"&gt;
&lt;div th:replace="menu :: menu"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="content" class="container"&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Okta Hosted Login + Spring Boot Example&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div th:unless="${#authorization.expression('isAuthenticated()')}" class="text fw-light fs-6 lh-1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hello!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you're viewing this page then you have successfully configured and started this example server.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This example shows you how to use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot"&gt;Okta Spring Boot
            Starter&lt;/a&gt; to add the &lt;a
            href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/implement-grant-type/authcode/main/"&gt;Authorization
            Code Flow&lt;/a&gt; to your application.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When you click the login button below, you will be redirected to the login page on your Okta org. After you
            authenticate, you will be returned to this application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div th:if="${#authorization.expression('isAuthenticated()')}" class="text fw-light fs-6 lh-1"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Welcome home, &lt;span th:text="${#authentication.principal.name}"&gt;Joe Coder&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You have successfully authenticated against your Okta org, and have been redirected back to this 
          application.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;form th:unless="${#authorization.expression('isAuthenticated()')}" method="get" 
          th:action="@{/oauth2/authorization/okta}"&gt;
        &lt;button id="login-button" class="btn btn-primary" type="submit"&gt;Sign In&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;!--/*/ &lt;th:block th:include="footer :: footer"/&gt; /*/--&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>In the template above, the commented out <code>&lt;th:block/&gt;</code> allows to include a header and footer fragments defined in <code>header.html</code> and <code>footer.html</code>. They contain the Bootstrap dependencies for the templates styling. There is also a menu fragment that will replace the <code>&lt;div th:replace ...&gt;</code> element.</p>

<p>The <code>th:if</code> and <code>th:unless</code> conditionals are used to evaluate the authentication status. If the visitor is not authenticated, the Sign In button will be displayed. Otherwise, a greeting by username will be displayed.</p>

<p>Add a <code>head.html</code> template:</p>

   <code>&lt;html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"&gt;
&lt;head th:fragment="head"&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"/&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"/&gt;
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"/&gt;
    &lt;link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" 
          integrity="sha384-1BmE4kWBq78iYhFldvKuhfTAU6auU8tT94WrHftjDbrCEXSU1oBoqyl2QvZ6jIW3" crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.8.1/font/bootstrap-icons.css"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing to see here, move along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>Create a <code>footer.html</code> template:</p>

   <code>&lt;html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing to see here, move along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;footer th:fragment="footer"&gt;
    &lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"  
            integrity="sha384-ka7Sk0Gln4gmtz2MlQnikT1wXgYsOg+OMhuP+IlRH9sENBO0LRn5q+8nbTov4+1p" 
            crossorigin="anonymous"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>Then, add a <code>menu.html</code> template for the menu fragment:</p>

   <code>&lt;html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"&gt;

&lt;body id="samples"&gt;
&lt;nav class="navbar border mb-4 navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light" th:fragment="menu"&gt;
    &lt;div class="container-fluid"&gt;
        &lt;button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse"
                data-bs-target="#navbarSupportedContent" aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent"
                aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation"&gt;
            &lt;span class="navbar-toggler-icon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarSupportedContent"&gt;
            &lt;ul class="navbar-nav me-auto mb-2 mb-lg-0"&gt;
                &lt;li class="nav-item"&gt;&lt;a class="nav-link" th:href="@{/}"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;form class="d-flex" method="post" th:action="@{/logout}"
                  th:if="${#authorization.expression('isAuthenticated()')}"&gt;
                &lt;input class="form-control me-2" type="hidden" th:name="${_csrf.parameterName}"
                       th:value="${_csrf.token}"/&gt;
                &lt;button id="logout-button" type="submit" class="btn btn-danger"&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

 Create the first controller class 

<p>A Controller is required to access the <code>home</code> page. Add a <code>HomeController</code> class under <code>src/main/java</code> in the <code>com.okta.developer.demo</code> package, with the following content:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.demo;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.security.core.Authentication;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.result.view.Rendering;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

@Controller
public class HomeController {

    private static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(HomeController.class);

    @GetMapping("/")
    public Mono&lt;Rendering&gt; home(Authentication authentication) {
        List&lt;String&gt; authorities = authentication.getAuthorities()
                .stream()
                .map(scope -&gt; scope.toString())
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
        return Mono.just(Rendering.view("home").modelAttribute("authorities", authorities).build());
    }
}
</code>   

<p>The controller will render the <code>home</code> view and will set the authorities as a model attribute, for security checks that will be added soon.</p>

 Tweak the security configuration 

<p>The default Okta starter auto-configuration will request authentication to access any page, so to customize the security, add a <code>SecurityConfiguration</code> class in the same package as before.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.demo;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.method.configuration.EnableReactiveMethodSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.reactive.EnableWebFluxSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.web.server.ServerHttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.web.server.SecurityWebFilterChain;
import org.springframework.security.web.server.authentication.logout.RedirectServerLogoutSuccessHandler;
import org.springframework.security.web.server.authentication.logout.ServerLogoutSuccessHandler;

import java.net.URI;

@EnableWebFluxSecurity
@EnableReactiveMethodSecurity
public class SecurityConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public ServerLogoutSuccessHandler logoutSuccessHandler(){
        RedirectServerLogoutSuccessHandler handler = new RedirectServerLogoutSuccessHandler();
        handler.setLogoutSuccessUrl(URI.create("/"));
        return handler;
    }

    @Bean
    public SecurityWebFilterChain securityWebFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
        http
            .authorizeExchange().pathMatchers("/").permitAll().and().anonymous()
            .and().authorizeExchange().anyExchange().authenticated()
            .and().oauth2Client()
            .and().oauth2Login()
            .and().logout().logoutSuccessHandler(logoutSuccessHandler());

        return http.build();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>In the configuration above, access to the home <code>/</code> page is allowed to all with anonymous authentication, which is required for the authentication expression in the Thymeleaf <code>home.html</code> template to work. An authentication object must be in the security context.</p>

 Run the application 

<p>Run the application with Maven:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and you should see the home page and a Sign In button. Click the button and sign in with your Okta credentials. After signing in, you should be redirected back to the home page and see the content for authenticated users.</p>

<p></p>

 Protect content areas with authorization 

<p>Let’s add a <code>userProfile.html</code> template that will display the claims contained in the ID token returned from Okta, as well as the authorities that Spring Security derives from the token.</p>

   <code>&lt;html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;User Details&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;!--/*/ &lt;th:block th:include="head :: head"/&gt; /*/--&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body id="samples"&gt;
&lt;div th:replace="menu :: menu"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="content" class="container"&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;My Profile&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hello, &lt;span th:text="${#authentication.principal.attributes['name']}"&gt;Joe Coder&lt;/span&gt;. Below is the 
            information that was read with your &lt;a 
            href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/oidc.html#get-user-information"&gt;ID Token&lt;/a&gt;.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This route is protected with the annotation &lt;code&gt;@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_profile')")&lt;/code&gt;, 
            which will ensure that this page cannot be accessed until you have authenticated, and have the scope &lt;code&gt;profile&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;table class="table table-striped"&gt;
        &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Claim&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Value&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/thead&gt;
        &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr th:each="item : ${details}"&gt;
              &lt;td th:text="${item.key}"&gt;Key&lt;/td&gt;
              &lt;td th:id="${'claim-' + item.key}" th:text="${item.value}"&gt;Value&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

    &lt;table class="table table-striped"&gt;
        &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;Spring Security Authorities&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/thead&gt;
        &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr th:each="scope : ${#authentication.authorities}"&gt;
              &lt;td&gt;&lt;code th:text="${scope}"&gt;Authority&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/tbody&gt;
    &lt;/table&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;!--/*/ &lt;th:block th:include="footer :: footer"/&gt; /*/--&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>Add the route mapping in the <code>HomeController</code>:</p>

   <code>@GetMapping("/profile")
@PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_profile')")
public Mono&lt;Rendering&gt; userDetails(OAuth2AuthenticationToken authentication) {
    return Mono.just(Rendering.view("userProfile")
        .modelAttribute("details", authentication.getPrincipal().getAttributes())
        .build());
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>@PreAuthorize</code> annotation allows you to define an authorization predicate that can be written in SpEL (Spring Expression Language). It will be checked before the method execution. Only users with the authority <code>SCOPE_PROFILE</code> can request a display of the <code>userProfile</code> page. This is server-side protection.</p>

<p>For the client-side, add a link in the <code>home.html</code> template to access the <code>userProfile</code> page, below the “You successfully …” paragraph. The link will also only display for users that have the <code>SCOPE_profile</code> authority.</p>

   <code>&lt;p&gt;You have successfully authenticated against your Okta org, and have been redirected back to this application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p th:if="${#lists.contains(authorities, 'SCOPE_profile')}"&gt;Visit the &lt;a th:href="@{/profile}"&gt;My Profile&lt;/a&gt; page in this application to view the information retrieved with your OAuth Access Token.&lt;/p&gt;
</code>   

<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: The authorization conditional is implemented in this way, because authorization-oriented expressions like <code>${#authorization.expression('hasRole(''SCOPE_profile'')')}</code> are restricted in WebFlux applications due to a lack of support in the reactive side of Spring Security (as of Spring Security 5.6). Only a minimal set of security expressions is allowed: [<code>isAuthenticated()</code>, <code>isFullyAuthenticated()</code>, <code>isAnonymous()</code>, <code>isRememberMe()</code>].</p>

<p>Run the application again. After signing in, you still won’t see the new link, and if you go to <code>http://localhost:8080/profile</code>, you will get HTTP ERROR 403, which means forbidden. This is because in <code>application.yml</code>, as part of the Okta configuration, only <code>email</code> and <code>openid</code> scopes are requested, and <code>profile</code> scope is not returned in the access token claims. Add the missing scope in the <code>application.yml</code>, restart, and the <code>userProfile</code> view should now be visible:</p>

<p></p>

<p>As you can see, Spring Security assigns the groups contained in the claim as well as the requested scopes as authorities. Scopes are prefixed with <code>SCOPE_</code>. <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code>, and <code>ROLE_USER</code> groups are created by default when you create a client application with Okta CLI, and your user is assigned to them.</p>

 Prevent CSRF when submitting forms 

<p>CSRF stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery, and is a form of cyber-attack through the submission of a form from a malicious site to a known site, exploiting the browser behavior by which the malicious request is sent along with the known site cookies, passing as an authenticated request.</p>

<p>Spring Security CSRF protection is enabled by default for both Servlet and WebFlux applications. The predominant protection mechanism is the <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/features/exploits/csrf.html#csrf-protection-stp">Synchronizer Token Pattern</a>, which ensures each HTTP request must contain a secure random generated value, the CSRF token. The token must be required in a part of the request that is not populated automatically by the browser. For example, you can use an HTTP parameter or header.</p>

<p>Let’s verify the CSRF protection is active by creating a quiz form to the application. Create the template <code>quiz.html</code> with the following content:</p>

   <code>&lt;html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Thymeleaf Quiz&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;!--/*/ &lt;th:block th:include="head :: head"/&gt; /*/--&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body id="samples"&gt;
&lt;div th:replace="menu :: menu"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="content" class="container"&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Select the right answer&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;form action="#" th:action="@{/quiz}" th:object="${quiz}"
          method="post" class="col-md-4 fw-light"&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li th:errors="*{answer}" /&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;div class="col-md-12"&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;What is Thymeleaf?&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="col-md-12 form-check"&gt;
            &lt;input class="form-check-input" type="radio" th:field="*{answer}" value="A" id="check-1-1"/&gt;
            &lt;label class="form-check-label" for="check-1-1"&gt;
                &lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt; A server-side Java template engine
            &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="col-md-12 form-check"&gt;
            &lt;input class="form-check-input" type="radio" th:field="*{answer}" value="B" id="check-1-2"/&gt;
            &lt;label class="form-check-label" for="check-1-2"&gt;
                &lt;strong&gt;B.&lt;/strong&gt; A markup language
            &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="col-md-12 form-check"&gt;
            &lt;input class="form-check-input" type="radio" th:field="*{answer}" value="C" id="check-1-3"/&gt;
            &lt;label class="form-check-label" for="check-1-3"&gt;
                &lt;strong&gt;C.&lt;/strong&gt; A web framework
            &lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="col-md-12 mt-4 mb-4"&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Your CSRF token is: &lt;span th:text="${_csrf.token}"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="col-md-12"&gt;
            &lt;button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;!--/*/ &lt;th:block th:include="footer :: footer"/&gt; /*/--&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>The CSRF token is available as a request attribute and will be displayed in the <code>quiz.html</code> template for learning purposes.</p>

<p>Add a template for the quiz result with the name <code>result.html</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Thymeleaf Quiz Submission&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;!--/*/ &lt;th:block th:include="head :: head"/&gt; /*/--&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body id="samples"&gt;
&lt;div th:replace="menu :: menu"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="container" id="content"&gt;
    &lt;div class="text-center"&gt;
        &lt;i class="bi-balloon-heart-fill" style="font-size: 6rem; color: green;" th:if=${quiz.answer=='A'}&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;i class="bi-x-circle-fill" style="font-size: 6rem; color: red;" th:unless=${quiz.answer=='A'}&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
        &lt;div class="panel mt-4 text-center"&gt;
            &lt;div class="panel-body"&gt;
                &lt;h4&gt;Your selected answer is &lt;strong&gt;
                    &lt;span th:text="${quiz.answer}"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
                &lt;p th:if=${quiz.answer=='A'}&gt;Good Job!&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class="panel mt-4 text-center" th:unless=${quiz.answer=='A'}&gt;
            &lt;div class="panel-body"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;It is not the right answer&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a th:href="@{/quiz}"&gt;Try again!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;!--/*/ &lt;th:block th:include="footer :: footer"/&gt; /*/--&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>Add a <code>QuizSubmission</code> data class, for holding the quiz answer:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.demo;

public class QuizSubmission {

    private String answer;

    public String getAnswer() {
        return answer;
    }

    public void setAnswer(String answer) {
        this.answer = answer;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add a <code>QuizController</code> for displaying the quiz and processing the form submission:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.demo;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
import org.springframework.security.access.prepost.PreAuthorize;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.result.view.Rendering;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

@Controller
public class QuizController {

    private static Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(QuizController.class);

    @GetMapping("/quiz")
    @PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_quiz')")
    public Mono&lt;Rendering&gt; showQuiz() {
        return Mono.just(Rendering.view("quiz").modelAttribute("quiz", new QuizSubmission()).build());
    }

    @PostMapping(path = "/quiz", consumes = {MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED_VALUE})
    @PreAuthorize("hasAuthority('SCOPE_quiz')")
    public Mono&lt;Rendering&gt; saveQuiz(QuizSubmission quizSubmission) {
        return Mono.just(Rendering.view("result").modelAttribute("quiz", quizSubmission).build());
    }
}
</code>   

<p>In the new controller and templates, the quiz is authorized for users that have <code>SCOPE_quiz</code> authority. Add a protected link to the <code>home.html</code> template, below the profile link:</p>

   <code>&lt;p&gt;You have successfully authenticated against your Okta org, and have been redirected back to this application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p th:if="${#lists.contains(authorities, 'SCOPE_profile')}"&gt;Visit the &lt;a th:href="@{/profile}"&gt;My Profile&lt;/a&gt; page in this application to view the information retrieved with your OAuth Access Token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p th:if="${#lists.contains(authorities, 'SCOPE_quiz')}"&gt;Visit the &lt;a th:href="@{/quiz}"&gt;Thymeleaf Quiz&lt;/a&gt; to test Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.&lt;/p&gt;
</code>   

<p>Before running the application again, let’s verify CSRF protection with a controller test. Add <code>QuizControllerTest</code> to <code>src/test/java</code> under the package <code>com.okta.developer.demo</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.demo;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.reactive.WebFluxTest;
import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
import org.springframework.test.web.reactive.server.WebTestClient;

import static org.springframework.security.test.web.reactive.server.SecurityMockServerConfigurers.csrf;
import static org.springframework.security.test.web.reactive.server.SecurityMockServerConfigurers.mockOidcLogin;

@WebFluxTest
public class QuizControllerTest {

    @Autowired
    private WebTestClient client;

    @Test
    void testPostQuiz_noCSRFToken() throws Exception {
        QuizSubmission quizSubmission = new QuizSubmission();
        this.client.mutateWith(mockOidcLogin())
                .post().uri("/quiz")
                .exchange()
                .expectStatus().isForbidden()
                .expectBody().returnResult()
                .toString().contains("An expected CSRF token cannot be found");
    }

    @Test
    void testPostQuiz() throws Exception {
        this.client.mutateWith(csrf()).mutateWith(mockOidcLogin())
                .post().uri("/quiz")
                .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED)
                .exchange().expectStatus().isOk();
    }

    @Test
    void testGetQuiz_noAuth() throws Exception {
        this.client.get().uri("/quiz").exchange().expectStatus().is3xxRedirection();
    }

    @Test
    void testGetQuiz() throws Exception {
        this.client.mutateWith(mockOidcLogin())
                .get().uri("/quiz").exchange().expectStatus().isOk();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>In the test class above, the first test <code>testPostQuiz_noCSRFToken()</code> verifies the quiz cannot be submitted without the CSRF token, even if the user did sign in. In the second test <code>testPostQuiz()</code>, the CSRF token is added to the mock request with <code>mutateWith(csrf())</code>, so the expected response status is HTTP 200 OK. The third test <code>testGetQuiz_noAuth()</code> verifies a request of the quiz will be redirected (to the Okta sign-in form) if the user is not authenticated. And the last test <code>testGetQuiz()</code> verifies the quiz can be accessed if the user has been authenticated with an OIDC login.</p>

<p>As <code>quiz</code> is not a standard scope or a scope defined in Okta, you have to define it for the default authorization server before running the application. Sign in to the Okta Admin Console, and in the left menu, go to Security &gt; API, the choose the default authorization server. In the Scopes tab, click Add Scope. Set the scope name as <code>quiz</code> and add a description, leave all the remaining fields with default values and click on Create. Now the <code>quiz</code> scope can be required during the OIDC login.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Run the application without adding the <code>quiz</code> scope to the <code>application.yml</code> file, sign in, and you should not see the quiz link yet. If you make a GET request with the browser to <code>http://localhost:8080/quiz</code>, the response will be 403 Forbidden.</p>

<p>Now add <code>quiz</code> to the list of scopes in the Okta configuration in <code>application.yml</code>. The final configuration should look like this:</p>

   <code>spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          okta:
            user-name-attribute: email

okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: /oauth2/default
    client-id: {clientId}
    client-secret: {clientSecret}
    scopes:
      - email
      - openid
      - profile
      - quiz
</code>   

<p>Run the application again and you should see the quiz link “Visit the Thymeleaf Quiz to test Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection”. Click the link and the quiz will be displayed:</p>

<p></p>

<p>The CSRF token is displayed, but if you turn on developer tools, you can also find it as a hidden attribute <code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="_csrf" value="..."&gt;</code> that Spring Security adds to the form.</p>

<p>You can try the POST request with HTTPie, and you will again verify the POST request is rejected without the CSRF token.</p>

   <code>$ http POST http://localhost:8080/

HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate
Content-Type: text/plain
Expires: 0
Pragma: no-cache
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1 ; mode=block
content-length: 38

An expected CSRF token cannot be found
</code>   

<p>The interesting fact here is that it seems CSRF protection takes precedence over authentication in the Spring Security filter chain.</p>

 Meet the Team — Kevin Boehm, Head of&nbsp;Product Kevin Boehm<p>Meet the Team is our ongoing series of employee profiles. It’s an opportunity for our users and partners to get to know us a little better. As a remote company with employees around the world — from the U.S. to Slovenia to Spain to New Zealand — it’s also an opportunity for our team to get to know each other a little&nbsp;better.</p><p>We’re thrilled to introduce Kevin Boehm, Head of Product at GlobaliD. Kevin’s an MIT-trained engineer who cut his teeth in consumer finance before moving to Amazon and ended up as an early team member on a little project called&nbsp;Alexa.</p><p>Now, he’s helping us build the future of digital identity. In our wide spanning conversation, Kevin talks about the thread that connects everything he’s worked on so far, the core principles he abides by, and what makes GlobaliD different from anywhere&nbsp;else.</p> Introducing Kevin&nbsp;Boehm <p>Kevin: I’m Kevin Boehm, Head of Product. The best way to summarize my role is that I look at the universe of opportunities and the portfolio of products that we can build and ultimately make sure that we’re making progress to deliver digital identity that people, businesses, and developers want to&nbsp;use.</p> On the themes that drive him — including rocket&nbsp;science <p>There’s a couple themes that jump out in terms of the work I’ve done or the jobs I’ve found myself in. They’ve all typically been related to technology or some sort of large scale or optimization problems. They almost always involve multiple stakeholders, whether that’s developers and end users, buyers and sellers, or advertisers and publishers.</p><p>I studied mechanical engineering at MIT. I just enjoy tinkering, taking things apart — learning how really, really complex systems like heat exchangers for a nuclear reactor work, and then breaking it down into: Here’s the 12 sub-problems that allow this to function. How do we figure out how to optimize each part, and which part should we start optimizing first?</p><p>Some of the research work I did in college was around non-destructive testing of aerospace components, including figuring out how well new technologies can identify defects in parts like engine blades. It allowed me to zoom in really, really deep and optimize a single process that has life or death consequences. By learning to work at both breadth and depth, I got comfortable that no problem is too large or difficult to approach.</p> What the credit card game taught him about data and feedback&nbsp;loops <p>I ended up at my first job at Capital One — I don’t want to say by happenstance — but I didn’t know that much about credit cards or lending coming out of school. The big thing there that was interesting and shaped the way I think: Capital One actually invented the concept of credit cards with tiered pricing. Up until the late 80’s, almost everyone got the same interest rate around 20%. Capital One was the first company to say, Hey, let’s start looking at users differently, A/B testing, and optimizing.</p><blockquote>The big thing I learned at the bank was: How do I take billions of rows of data around hundreds of millions of users and figure out a hypothesis that we can&nbsp;test.</blockquote><p>Here’s someone who we can give a 10% rate or 25% rate. Their whole culture and DNA was around: Test, segment, optimize — all the way down to the mail that you&nbsp;receive:</p><p>What envelope?</p><p>What color is&nbsp;it?</p><p>What’s the call to&nbsp;action?</p><p>What are the product&nbsp;terms?</p><p>What’s the signup incentive?</p><p>All of that is something they test; they learn. They have a feedback loop. I developed this assumption after two years working at the bank that everyone in the world has measurements, goals, and success criteria.</p><p>The big thing I learned at the bank was — I hate the term big data so I try to actively not say it&nbsp;: How do I take billions of rows of data around hundreds of millions of users and figure out a hypothesis that we can test? I like to joke that it was kind of like being a private investigator. You had all the evidence and clues in front of you. It was just a matter of putting together your business hypothesis.</p> How Amazon’s culture showed him the big&nbsp;picture <p>I moved to Amazon after two years at the bank, and I went from owning a really narrow piece of how credit cards work to owning an end-to-end credit&nbsp;program.</p><p>What was really exciting was that I got to transition from just trying to understand how credit cards work — and being a nerd and having dozens of credit cards — to understanding how I can leverage the assets that Amazon has. There’s so many users. It’s like a giant Petri dish, having the ability to carve that up and say, I’m going to run this test on 5% of Amazon users. I had millions of opportunities to test something.</p><p>That feedback loop between having an idea, implementing it, and seeing how much money you’re making was 15 or 30 minutes — not days or&nbsp;weeks.</p><p>There was one really cool experience I had at Amazon. I was working on a new program, kind of an internal startup, that was on pace to make hundreds million a year. We shut it down — what, at a normal company, would have been a crazy, irrational decision — because there was a competing opportunity we could focus on with the potential to make billions of dollars a year in&nbsp;profit.</p><p>We looked at it and said, Here’s an opportunity that’s 10X bigger than the other. Let’s shut it down right now. Yes it hurts, but once the decision is made, there’s no second thought. You just move on and focus on the big thing. That was something that was ingrained in the culture; everything is constantly changing, and it’s your job to adapt and evolve and solve the biggest problems for the business&nbsp;overall.</p> Joining the Alexa team early&nbsp;on <p>The last role that I had at Amazon was working on Alexa. I got to join early on, about a year after the first Echo device launch. At the time, Amazon had invested several years into developing Alexa, solving the science and engineering problems to make a smart speaker work and figuring out: How do we build this into a business?</p><p>Back in 2015 or 2016 — there were a limited number of things a user could do with Alexa. But in the long term, we had all these aspirations about how to make an operating system that is everywhere — in people’s homes, computers, hotels and cars. How do we use this to drive long term value of the&nbsp;company?</p><p>Amazon’s very long term focused and specifically focused on driving value for end users. This was even taking that to an extreme and saying, 10 years from now, we might start making a profit off of this. What are the things that matter most between now and&nbsp;then?</p><blockquote>When I think about GlobaliD, we have some use cases now, where it’s like: Let’s make this work so users understand digital identity. Even if all the partners and players aren’t there yet, let’s deliver value to users today wherever we can do better than the current solutions.</blockquote> On building for the future — lessons from&nbsp;Alexa <p>In terms of things that shaped my thinking and are valuable at GlobaliD, this lesson stands out: You need to provide and illustrate value to users as quickly as possible.</p><p>For Alexa, some of our first use cases we supported were prominent features like ordering a Domino’s pizza or an Uber. While we didn’t necessarily think these would be the killer app, we believed that users, developers, and businesses could understand, get excited, and start imagining how they could incorporate it into their lives in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>It was on us as a company to figure out: What are the five or six cases that people will get — even if it’s not something they’ll do all the time. Otherwise, they’ll use it for a day, unplug it, and throw it into the&nbsp;closet.</p><p>When I think about GlobaliD, we have some use cases now, where it’s like: Let’s make this work so users understand digital identity. Even if all the partners and players aren’t there yet, let’s deliver value to users today wherever we can do better than the current solutions.</p><p>Another piece that was really instrumental was building things in the scrappiest and cheapest way possible. One of the benefits we had at Amazon — because we were spending probably about a billion dollars a year on the program — was that we would have three or four teams building competing solutions for the same problem. They were building in different ways.</p><p>More often than not, the team that was most successful was not the one that started off using the latest and coolest forms of machine learning and data science; it was a team that did things really scrappy to test and continuously iterative solutions to solve user problems.</p> Core principles #1: Focus on the end&nbsp;user <p>The first principle is always being focused on the end&nbsp;user.</p><p>Knowing what they care&nbsp;about.</p><p>If they’re going to wake up and want to engage with us, then we need to know what they wake up and think about in terms of their biggest problems.</p><p>That customer focus — whether that’s when we’re building, designing, or selling — that’s number&nbsp;one.</p> Core principles #2: Moving fast or&nbsp;slow <p>Number two is realizing — and I’m going to sound like such a shill for Amazon here — but realizing what we call one-way door versus two-way door decisions.</p><p>When something is easy to change, let’s not spend a lot of time talking about it. Let’s make the best decision and move fast. We can always go back through the door and change our decision.</p><p>When something is going to be expensive or impossible to change, that’s when it’s worth us spending time to get it&nbsp;right.</p><p>There are so many decisions we have to make every single day, it’s about figuring out which ones are worth the extra cognitive burden.</p><p>Moving fast when it’s smart, and then taking time where the stakes are&nbsp;higher..</p> Core principles #3: What matters&nbsp;most <p>The third is just being willing to say — I don’t want to say throw stuff away — but ruthlessly prioritizing what matters most&nbsp;now.</p><p>The predominant belief of, I want to keep doing this instead of admitting defeat, is counterproductive. You are losing if you’re letting your less valuable ideas get in the way of the more important ones.</p><p>If a scientist or an investor sticks with 100% of their hypotheses in the face of contradictory evidence, they’re likely not in the top of their field. As a business, if you’re not throwing away your worst ideas, you’re either a genius and correct 100% of the time, or you’re unintentionally starving your best ideas from succeeding. In my experience, it’s usually the&nbsp;latter.</p> The road to blockchain is paved in economic incentives <p>I went down the Bitcoin and blockchain rabbit hole in — was it 2017? It was one of the Super Bowls where the Patriots won, and I actually had some money to cash out. I had previously read about Bitcoin, and once I used it, it piqued my curiosity. How does this actually work? This led me to start reading white papers, learning about encryption, protocols, and projects.</p><p>What I really, really appreciated was — I don’t want to just overuse the term decentralization: The ability to build a functioning system resistant to participants who are actively trying to screw each other over. That’s about as close to perfection as it gets when people are trying to collude, trying to steal — and the system aligns economic incentives accordingly.</p><p>As soon as I saw the potential value there, I became interested in exploring and identifying where future business applications could&nbsp;be.</p> “Anything that I care about in the next 10 years is going to be bolstered by identity.” <p>Outside of payments, I did a lot of research into projects and took a course through MIT’s executive education program. Some of the use cases that were covered included some early identity providers. None of them are still around today because they were a bit too early or they pivoted since then. But having learned about the concept, I was intrigued. Intrigued but also skeptical. It’s a tough nut to&nbsp;crack.</p><p>What ultimately led me back here when I was looking at my next opportunity: I landed on identity because I couldn’t&nbsp;choose.</p><p>I was really interested in payments, fintech, and the crypto space. I knew I was going to do something adjacent to that. I was also exploring companies in insurtech and insurance, which ultimately comes back to identity. The third was a lot of stuff in advertising and data — but the data optimization space.</p><p>All of these revolve around individuals, their data, and the ability to connect products and goods to those individuals. I could say this in two ways. One, I figured out that identity was at the hub of all the things I cared about. Another way to put it is, I was too indecisive to pick a single&nbsp;field.</p><p>So I said, Why don’t I pick the one that has the most applications? I thought to myself, Anything that I care about in the next 10 years is going to be bolstered by identity. So why not go solve something that heavily shaped my&nbsp;mind?</p> The GlobaliD difference <p>When I think about where we stand and the other players in the space, I think about the common themes that exist beyond GlobaliD. As a human race or as users of technology, we definitely want to have as much control as possible.</p><blockquote>What I think is different about our approach is not just that we’re taking this long term focus — lots of people can say they’re taking a long term focus. But it’s us starting with the most meaningful and high stakes problems (in terms of overall reach) that ultimately revolve around money (and as a result, put us into a highly regulated, highly inspected space).</blockquote><p>Where I see us coming into play along with a lot of our competitors is providing users a new way of doing things, a new way of interacting with other individuals, online businesses, peers, enterprises — and doing so in a privacy-preserving manner.</p><p>These are going to be the table stakes&nbsp;terms.</p><p>What is different about our approach and what ultimately led me to pick GlobaliD versus any of these other competitors is the time horizon that we’re looking&nbsp;at.</p><p>The kinds of problems that we’re looking at solving require a certain long term focus but also a certain type of stubbornness. It’s not necessarily looking at a one-off problem we can solve. It’s looking at what we would seek to change on a 10-year time horizon. What are the big biggest problems for us to solve in order to do&nbsp;that?</p><p>What I think is different about our approach is not just that we’re taking this long term focus — lots of people can say they’re taking a long term focus. But it’s us starting with the most meaningful and high stakes problems (in terms of overall reach) that ultimately revolve around money (and as a result, put us into a highly regulated, highly inspected space).</p><p>And it’s not just our focus around payments. (Most of the identity companies I’ve seen that have picked a lane to start in have chosen payments or healthcare.) It’s the combined focus on solving an immediate problem today, while knowing that if we continue to solve the second, third, and fourth problem — if we connect these four or five pieces together — we can actually fundamentally change the way that commerce happens, the way that people bank, and the way that people interact.</p><p>It comes down to having the long term approach, having the regulatory focus, and constantly seeking out where there’s immediate end-user value. If it’s just the first two, I’m not as excited. With the third, that’s where we’re going to be successful.</p> What we’re most excited&nbsp;about <blockquote>The huge opportunity for us is if we can make this ability for people to share info in a privacy-preserving manner intuitive. It’s our best shot at becoming a&nbsp;verb.</blockquote><p>There’s two areas I’m really excited about. They’re related but pretty different.</p><p>What I’m really, really, really excited about is making digital identity accessible and understandable to a mass market audience. When I talk to people — my friends, my family, people I grew up with — I tell them that the general idea of what we’re trying to solve is how they can interact with someone or a business and prove information about themselves without revealing their identity.</p><p>Every single person I talk to is like, Sign me up. This sounds like a better way. How do we do&nbsp;it?</p><p>The challenge for us is that at no point in solving this for the user do they need to understand hashing encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, or credentials standards. In the same way, when I look at jokes on the Reddit homepage, I don’t need to understand what protocols are happening in the background.</p><p>It’s just: I want to do this thing, and it’s as simple as possible.</p><p>The huge opportunity for us is if we can make this ability for people to share info in a privacy-preserving manner intuitive. It’s our best shot at becoming a verb. You don’t search for things, you Google things. What would it mean if you were to GlobaliD someone? It’s not to say the overarching goal is to become a verb — but it’s the ultimate sign that you’ve solved a problem in an intuitive way.</p><p>That’s our biggest end-user-facing or consumer-facing opportunity. The bigger one for us as a business is figuring out how we can start solving problems for developers in this growing web3 space. There’s nothing but problems and opportunities in any emerging&nbsp;market.</p><blockquote>It comes down to knowing the end user, knowing what their problems are, and then it’s our job to solve them now while looking ahead and deliver solutions to problems they don’t even know they have&nbsp;yet.</blockquote> GlobaliD’s biggest challenge <p>Our biggest challenge is that the areas we can add the most value today and the areas we want to be providing value in the long term are related but not necessarily translating one-to-one to each&nbsp;other.</p><p>Specifically, if we believe we can make these new financial instruments with regulatory compliance in a privacy-preserving way, the problem is that developers and users won’t wake up and say, How can I be more compliant today? It’s just not top of mind for&nbsp;them.</p><p>So today, if all we’re doing is trying to sell them compliance, compliance, compliance, it’s kind of like saying, eat your vegetables. Vegetables come great as a side dish for a lot of people. It’s on us to figure out what the main protein or entrée is. How do we gradually introduce these vegetables, and before they know it, it’s part of their&nbsp;diet?</p><p>It comes down to knowing the end user, knowing what their problems are, and then it’s our job to solve them now while looking ahead and deliver solutions to problems they don’t even know they have&nbsp;yet.</p> We’re hiring!   <a href="https://www.global.id/about/careers/">Careers at&nbsp;GlobaliD</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/meet-the-team-kevin-boehm-head-of-product-27e1f21cf580">Meet the Team — Kevin Boehm, Head of Product</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  Digital Identity Convenience 
<p>by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/martch/">Christine Martin</a></p>
<p>I just had two different but related things happen with my 18-year-old daughter regarding her identity…</p>
<p>This week, I took her to the DriveTest Centre to get her G1 (driving license). Since she’s 18, I left it up to her to ensure she had all the necessary documentation. She brought her Ontario Health Card and Canadian Passport. When it was her turn, she went to the counter and presented her documents. The representative looked over the papers and let us know the passport was expired, and thus she could not accept it. She asked if she had another piece of identification, like a birth certificate. Of course, she did not have this with her. As we left the DriveTest Centre, I mentioned that we wouldn’t have had this problem if she had a digital wallet that could store her identity documents. She would have had all her credentials on her phone to prove who she was. She told me, in short, that it wasn’t a better alternative because she just watched a movie on digital identity, and we are all going to turn into tracked and controlled robots of Big Brother if we let that happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My daughter opened a new bank account online, but she still has to present herself in person to finalize things. With a digital wallet holding credentials and verification via biometrics, she could have completed that step online and had access to the new account immediately. Why does the bank offer the option to open an account online?</p>

 You’re already at risk. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe it’s because of the nature of my job in decentralized identity consulting, but lately, I’ve been seeing a lot of conspiracy theories on social media about Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). People criticize the way it’s being implemented and warn about the negative consequences it will have. It’s almost as if people don’t realize that organizations are already monitoring and influencing us and that Google and social media algorithms have been instrumental in this.</p>
<p>Right now, Facebook owns your identity and <a href="https://bigthink.com/the-present/social-media-algorithms-manipulate-you/">essentially decides what you see in your feed</a>; and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/north-america-science-technology-business-ap-top-news-828aefab64d4411bac257a07c1af0ecb">Google tracks your every move</a>. These companies claim our data as their asset and make money off it. </p>
<p>“Many acts of ‘digital misdirection’ are happening before our very eyes every day, and we are starting to become more aware of them. Every action we perform online has become a piece of data which is used to coerce and constrain our digital experiences. We see it in the ads that show up across all our devices following an Internet search, in the ever-narrower set of content we’re shown on our social media sites, and in the increasingly compelling, and sometimes spooky, product recommendations we receive. This digital misdirection goes on to the point that we begin to wonder whether we can still exercise any free will online at all.” –<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/"> The Rise of Surveillance Capitalism</a></p>
<p>What if you could monetize your identity? What if you could share extra preference data with Facebook and allow them to share that data with a third party for a fee? You could charge $0.50 for every additional set of preference data you share. Self-Sovereign identity can give you control over your data and generate passive income. Why wouldn’t you pick this option?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How can we trust them to be honest stewards of our data? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/03/google-sued-for-misleading-users-over-location-data-privacy/">lawsuit has been filed against Google</a> that stems from investigations dating back to 2018 by Princeton University and the Associated Press. The lawsuit alleges that “Google falsely led consumers to believe that changing their account and device settings would allow customers to protect their privacy and control what personal data the company could access. The truth is that contrary to Google’s representations it continues to systematically surveil customers and profit from customer data.”</p>
<p>What else are these media giants doing that we haven’t figured out yet? <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">How Bad is the Global Data Privacy Crisis?</a> And you want them holding your information? I’m confused.</p>
<p>Platforms like Facebook and Google aren’t fond of losing access to people’s data; having less control over the user data makes it far less valuable for monetization. I’m not sure why people aren’t more concerned with this aspect.&nbsp; I can’t help but come up with my own conspiracy theory: the Facebook algorithm suppresses positive news and advancement in SSI while pushing misinformation.&nbsp; With digital identity, you (the holder) will be able to control your identity and decide which credentials to share with whom.&nbsp; That’s a significant loss for big tech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 SSI Architects care about privacy and security 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I saw a <a href="http://www.continuumloop.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-23-at-7.00.36-AM.png">Facebook post</a> shared with a photo of a copy of <a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Advancing_towards_Digital_Agency_2022.pdf">The World Economic Forum – Advancing Digital Agency</a> report with the quote, “Digital ID, it isn’t just a rumour, people. WEF wants to control everyone’s life. SHARE“. The WEF report is more about protecting users, the challenges of broken trust, and data intermediaries instead of controlling everyone’s life.&nbsp; There are many benefits to Digital Identity, particularly with vulnerable and marginalized groups (refugees).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We care about privacy and security; we have the same concerns. Organizations like Evernym/Avast want to embed <a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/eu-digital-identity/">eIDAS</a> in their products, but only if it <a href="https://blog.avast.com/eidas-2.0-avast?_ga=2.188632365.442058729.1646653922-1048450645.1646653922">addresses these four problems</a> and maximizes opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something crucial for laymen to remember is that governments cannot build and implement these frameworks without help from the private sector. That includes SSI consultants like us here at Continuum Loop. We’re regular members of society; we have friends, family and children that we care about and want to protect: now and in the future. We are involved because we care and are aware of the negative implications and aspects; we can help mitigate these factors, build these frameworks, and make them beneficial for all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Hold, own, and control your credentials/identity. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Digital ID is nothing new; it’s been around for a while in one form or another. However, the COVID pandemic has caused a “digital acceleration” event where our reliance on technology has catapulted forward. The pandemic has accelerated the adoption in many ways, like the increased use of QR codes and contactless payment to mitigate the risk of exposure to the virus. In particular, it has helped to raise awareness of the need for such a system and its benefits.</p>
<p>You will take back control of your identity and hold it. Not Facebook, not Google, and you will decide what credentials to share on a need-to-know basis. We don’t have to be scared of the shift; we have to ensure the architecture is built ethically for all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Privilege of Hesitation. 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are privileged to be able to be so critical of these emerging technologies. We take for granted that the college or university we graduated from will always be there or that our government institutions will always be in place and functioning to provide us with the services we need. I can’t help but wonder how a current refugee, who had no time to take paper documents, would feel to have the ability to easily prove their identity while starting over in a new county. All we have to do is look to Ukraine and see <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ukraine-why-centralized-identity-systems-can-cause-problem-freitag/">why centralized Identity systems can cause a problem</a>.</p>
<p>Many Ukrainians have been displaced and need to apply for new documents to be able to travel and access services in other countries. The centralized identity system can make it difficult for people to get their records. As different groups seek refuge, they face unique challenges. Many Ukrainians of Roma origin, for example, suffer discrimination in Ukraine and <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/3/7/ukraines-roma-refugees-recount-discrimination-on-route-to-safety">may not have any documentation</a> indicating their identity or citizenship. Being undocumented as you flee conflict and navigate foreign countries can lead to many dangers like human trafficking. Desperation can lead to refugees bribing government officials to get their documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In contrast, <a href="https://e-estonia.com/solutions/e-identity/id-card/">Estonia has a practical but highly-centralized digital identity system</a> that makes it easier for people to access the various services they need. While it is centralized and questionable from a privacy and surveillance perspective, this system allows for secure and transparent transactions that make citizens’ and e-residents’ lives more convenient and secure. The Estonian government has been using this technology since 2001, and it has helped them become one of the most digitally advanced countries in the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this implementation of digital identity is not ideal for many reasons, it’s a step in the right direction, and we can build from it. The flaws within the system (e.g. privacy, centralization) can be handled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Rebuilding Trust 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These technologies cannot move forward without the general public’s adoption. Organizations must rebuild trust for this to happen. Those building the framework architecture are fully aware of this challenge; the general public has lost confidence in the way organizations hold and use their online information.</p>
<p>There are many possible ways to rebuild trust. One way is to give people more control over their information. With Self-Sovereign Identity, they can choose what information they share and with whom, and they can also see how their data is being used and change their settings accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another way to rebuild trust is to ensure that the technology is secure. People need to know that their information is safe when shared online. Organizations need to ensure that they use the latest security technologies, Blockchain Technology, to protect people’s information.</p>
<p>Finally, people need to know that the organizations they trust with their information are reputable and honest. Organizations need to be transparent about using people’s information and their steps to protect it, and Verifiable Credentials will facilitate this. </p>
<p>In a world where corporations and governments are constantly harvesting our data, it is more important than ever to take back control of our identities. Self-sovereign identity is a new way of thinking about identity that puts the individual in charge of their information. We should embrace it and use it to create a more just and equitable society.

Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>XR Today — “<a href="https://www.xrtoday.com/virtual-reality/the-hottest-trends-in-metaverse-technology-for-2022/">The Hottest Trends in Metaverse Technology for&nbsp;2022</a>”</p><p>“Described by some as the future of the internet, and others as the next major tech platform, the metaverse is taking the world by storm. Though definitions of the metaverse are still somewhat varied, experts agree this new landscape will help to bridge the gap between our digital and real-world identities. In other words, we’ll be closer to a computer-enhanced world than ever&nbsp;before.”</p><p>As we move into the next iteration of the internet, decentralized identity solutions and privacy preserving technology are becoming increasingly important for the secure expansion of decentralized networks. Ontology’s EVM will facilitate the creation of privacy preserving technologies within a more mainstream developer group. These developers will be able to leverage ONTO Wallet, the gateway for a seamless Web3 experience which has a base of 800K users, as well as ONT ID, Ontology’s decentralized digital identity application which reached over 1.5 million users last year. To achieve effective connection with the Web3 network environment to access the upcoming metaverse.</p> Read this month’s report in your preferred language:   <a href="https://medium.com/p/da902d4caad1/edit">中文</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/1abcd456fab/edit">繁體中文</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/858c615944af/edit">日本語</a>  한국어(coming soon)  <a href="https://medium.com/p/406eba680a09/edit">Española</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/a9338aeb7551/edit">Français</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/d5f6148a30bc/edit">Slovenčina</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/b4a055b0b9a8/edit">Tiếng Việt</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/1760cb8e964/edit">Hindi</a>  русский(coming soon)  <a href="https://medium.com/p/d11d73d05940/edit">Tagalog</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/cf12d0241230/edit">සිංහල</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/p/cb2bddea7186/edit">Türk</a>  Italiano(coming soon)  <a href="https://theontologyteam.medium.com/ontology-monthly-report-february-2022-%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%82%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE-40b0945c013e">বাংলা</a>  <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p> Explore How AI is Changing the Playing Field of Analytics 
<p>Analytics isn’t new. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/artificial-intelligence">Neither is AI</a>. But the combination opens up a whole new playing field.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/05/data-science-machine-learning-business-analytics.html">Analytics</a> is the domain of processing data to derive insights. Computations are done on data, relying heavily on statistics and data science fields to identify patterns previously unseen. Analytics is very useful in business, as the insights it yields helps decision makers understand their organization and its performance. Analytics is often used to optimize marketing or product performance, better understand consumer behavior, measure employee productivity, risk of various types, or to gauge the security status of your organization.</p>
 How AI is Changing Analytics: the fundamentals 
<p>Predictive analytics exists without AI/ML too. It uses historical data to assign a probability to potential future events. Predictive models are used to generate forecasts of all types, from revenue to demand. But traditionally, our data scientists and tools only worked with limited variables and parameters, which in turn gave less accurate predictions.</p>
<p>AI, or rather machine learning (ML) gives predictive analytics a big boost. <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/predictive-analytics.html">ML for predictive analytics</a> has several advantages: it can preprocess data to clean and transform it, and extract features for a customized model that handles far more data. Through the training and validation process, the model can be checked for accuracy and continually improved.</p>
 Predictive AI: Buzzword or Game Changer? 
<p>AI is always a buzzword, but that doesn’t mean that it can’t be a game changer too.</p>
<p>One of AI/ML’s strengths is providing predictions. That is most of the tasks it performs in any implementation. An image classification model? It is predicting with 82% certainty that the image is of a tree and not a bush. Predictive analytics with ML is able to capitalize off of this design for future-oriented predictions.</p>
<p><a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/ai-more-than-just-a-buzzword-845e5e320981">AI is always a buzzword</a>, but that doesn’t mean that it can’t be a game changer too. Predictions drive most business models. Predicting demand is a very traditional approach, while delivering personalized content (based on recommendations, which are predictions of what a user will want to see next) is a more modern business model. Both are able to benefit from predictive AI and analytics with heightened accuracy.</p>
 Beneficial Business Areas 
<p>Business intelligence (BI) is being strengthened with predictive analytics. Typically BI was focused only on historical data, or in rare cases on real-time data. But predictive forecasts can be overlaid on BI visualizations of historical data, for example sales of a product in a certain region, with an ML-based prediction of how sales will continue in the next period.</p>
<p>Consumer experience benefits from predictive analytics largely through recommendations (predictions of what the user wants to see next). Personalization of content has completely transformed many online experiences for users, thanks to predictive analytics.</p>
<p>Fraud detection uses predictive analytics to score the risk of events, for example an authentication attempt to a system. This risk score processes (with the help of ML) several parameters that indicate if the user is a human or a bot, and if they are malicious or just a normal consumer.</p>

 What Does the Future Hold? 
<p>The future is bright for AI/ML, and especially predictive analytics. But how do you and your organization get started?</p>
<p>Its easy to imagine how many organizations can get a new insight into their products, processes and IT systems with predictive analytics. But be sure to adopt a new technology solution because it fits with your organization’s digital transformation plan, not because it’s new and shiny.

<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: The emerging ethics of digital identity is what we’re going to discuss today. And our guest today is Jessica Figueras, founder at Hither Strategy. Jessica is a strategist specialising in trust and security governance, and the role of tech in civil society. She works with start-ups and scale-ups on commercial strategy, and advises the UK Government on technology and policy issues relating to cybercrime in online harms.</p>
<p>Previously, Jessica led multimillion pound research and data programmes for companies including Dods, GlobalData and Ovum, and has advised senior executives in large established tech companies, as well as many venture capital-backed scale-ups.</p>
<p>She is currently Vice Chair of the UK Cyber Security Council, and was previously Chair of the Board at NCT, the UK is largest charity for parents. She is a sought-after speaker and commentator and has published extensive research on the application of emerging technologies across government, telecoms, and other regulated industries.</p>
<p>Hello, Jessica.</p>
<p>Jessica Figueras: Hi, thank you so much for inviting me.</p>
<p>Oscar: It’s great having you, Jessica. It’s super interesting, the conversation that we’re going to have now. So let’s talk about digital identity. And first of all, I would like to hear a bit more about yourself, if you can tell us about yourself and your journey to the world of identity.</p>
<p>Jessica: Sure. So in fact, I mean many people I found to work in the field of digital identity, it’s interesting, actually how many have a background in the telecoms industry, which is my background as well, originally. So around 20 years ago, I worked at a company called Ovum, which was at that time, the leading European tech analyst firm. And I was really focusing on how you had, for the first time, the telecoms industry converging with the mainstream IT industry. And as mobile telecoms operators started to get to grips with the consumer web, it was really clear that one interesting asset they had, mobile telcos had, was identity. And so you know, I became very interested in ways in which telcos might be able to use their knowledge of the identity of the user in different ways. And in those kinds of use case.</p>
<p>So after that, I moved away from telecoms and for the past eight years, I focused most on government technology, particularly here in the UK. And around 10 years ago, the UK government, like everyone else is looking to digitise but it became apparent that there was a very significant barrier around digital identity. Government, at that time, was very keen to where they could, to replace call centres and expensive channels with what was seen as cheaper digital channels. But it was understood that if citizens couldn’t verify their identity online then the take up of government digital services would stay low. And at the time, there were there were very, very long and complex attempts to create a cross government digital identity service, which ran into a lot of problems. So, that’s something I’ve been following with interest.</p>
<p>And of course, government isn’t just about its own digital services for citizens. Government also leads our national cyber security response, it has an important role to play in making the digital economy work as well as it can. And of course, also government is the authoritative provider of many identity credentials, you know, like passports, driving license and so forth. So, this kind of whole area is of strong interest to me and a lot of the work I do at the moment is looking at these areas where government can do more to support security and trust with digital identity.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, excellent. So, from the telco industry and nowadays more with government as you mentioned, yeah super interesting. So, looking at today, so how important is identity and identity management for any government and every – any type of organisation to establish digital trust with the users?</p>
<p>Jessica: Well, of course, it’s a crucial building block. I mean, if we look beyond digital for a moment, we can see that everyday life just doesn’t function unless there is trust there. And what I mean by that is that in society, we need a basic level of trust that people are playing by the same rules as us. Trust kind of oils the wheels of social interactions, and when it’s missing, things go wrong.</p>
<p>So, for example, if people don’t trust the police, you know, they won’t report crimes, and therefore, crime will go up. And again, people won’t pay their taxes, if they think there’s a lot of corruption there. And then kind of look at looking to, you know, everyday commerce, you won’t buy things online if you don’t trust the other party is going to fulfil their side of the bargain, or if they’re going to exploit you in some way.</p>
<p>Equally, if you’re a potential merchant or a service provider, you may well not offer services online if you think there’s a very good chance that bad actors are going to use these services in ways that expose you to risks. So, there are particular areas where both organisations and users on both sides need digital trust to be in place. These are questions such as, you know, are you who you say you are, primarily? And that links on to the question, are you entitled to be here? Are you entitled to use this service? And then there are questions again, about, are you going to do what you said you do? And, I hope also that you’re not going to do what you didn’t say you’re going to do, like, for example, exploit my personal data, or use my service in a way that exposes me to harm.</p>
<p>And trust is also about understanding that the other party is going to treat you fairly. For example, making exceptions or special provisions in areas where, I as a user have got special needs. So yeah, establishing trust is absolutely critical. And identity management is the foundation piece for all of this. It starts off with those questions, you are who you say you are, you’re entitled to be here, and it provides a level of assurance in case things go wrong that you can then kind of trace it back.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah definitely, I can see the connection with identity management in digital trust, right? In both sides, that’s interesting, what you say it’s both sides, not only the end users, but the other service providers, the companies and organisations like government that provide services.</p>
<p>And you also touched that sometimes it’s possible the bad actors will have bad use of the identity and everything related to persons. So this comes to the main topic we’d like to discuss today about ethical use of identity. So we’d like to know, as you work a lot on this, what’s happening today to ensure that the ethical use of identity, so what’s happening today in the UK, as you might be working much closely and globally? So what’s happening today?</p>
<p>Jessica: Yeah, absolutely. So identity is a really interesting area because it’s a kind of focus point, I think, for ethical concerns touching quite a number of areas. And in many cases, I think these issues are quite complex. There’s not always an easy answer. It’s about finding a balance.</p>
<p>So I guess to start off with, just to kind of try to summarise some of the concerns, the ethical concerns, around digital identity and the reasons why people worry. So firstly, there’s the whole area of privacy – end user privacy. So, when we verify someone’s identity online, we potentially, not necessarily but we potentially, have the ability to build a very detailed picture of a named individual. That’s not always the case, clearly, there are many digital services which build detailed pictures of users’ activity online, but without necessarily being able to map it to a real world identity.</p>
<p>When we verify someone’s identity, again, we’re talking about specific person here. Now, if you start to link that real world identity to their usage of your services, whether those are government services, financial services, what they’re buying online, websites they’re looking at, perhaps you start to join up the data you have with data from elsewhere. What you then have is potentially a wealth of data about a named individual, which could be used in many ways, some of which may be extremely unethical. These kind of very detailed profiles, they could be used as a tool of social control in a sinister way by governments or private organisations equally.</p>
<p>And if you look at the concerns generally today around surveillance, around too much power in the hands of tech companies, which citizens cannot hold accountable, we certainly see what happens when authoritarian regimes start to collect very detailed data on their citizens’ activities, just how kind of troubling this area is. So this is this is the first area where we need to be ethically aware. When we verify someone’s identity, what are we then going to do with that data?</p>
<p>And the second area is around the whole area of bias. Here, this goes back to the role of identity verification as a gateway to access services. The idea is there are many digital services which are sensitive in different ways, they expose the provider to significant risk of fraud, for example, cyber security. And, of course, there are those questions about needing to check the entitlements of the user.</p>
<p>So this is why identity verification is around gatekeeping, you know, are you who you say you are? And are you entitled to be here? Now, that’s fine. But where bias can creep in is that if there are unreasonable assumptions made about how that gatekeeping should work. What that could mean is that certain groups of users could be systematically denied access to services on basises which are very unfair. So, you know, and here is where we have the concerns around digital exclusion. And there are lots of different facets to this. We can think about people who are excluded for different reasons. There is a lot of concern around a kind of cluster of characteristics to do with poverty, old age in particular, education, people who are less digitally literate, people with an irregular immigration status, or perhaps people who are homeless or no fixed address.</p>
<p>And characteristics like this, you tend to find that people in these groups are much less likely to have the credentials that they need to verify their identity. They may not have a bank account, they may not have a fixed address, no passport, no driving license, no credit record. And then you have the challenges around the user’s actual ability to use the service. And typically, you might find this with older age groups or people with learning disabilities, who simply don’t have the digital skills or find it very kind of hard to navigate services which can be very complex. And then you have other kinds of potential bias as.</p>
<p>So for example, it is quite well known that at least some of the algorithms which are used to verify people’s identity against a photograph have a real problem with skin colour. So, people with darker skin are much more likely to be rejected and that’s a real problem. Particularly then when you bring in things like facial recognition in biometrics for security purposes. That’s really kind of quite troubling there because you may well be involving a kind of law enforcement element on the basis of a technology which is treating people differently on the basis of their skin colour. So, you know, there are lots and lots of different ways that bias can creep in, and work in quite an insidious way with identity verification to lock certain types of people out.</p>
<p>So here we have, you know, kind of two kind of broad categories of ethical difficulties, one around privacy, and the other around bias. So, in terms of what’s happening, I would say that both of these issues, you know, there is a lot of awareness about them. And these are areas of interest for many civil society groups. We have some codes of conduct out there, which are kind of voluntary. There’s one, for example, a group called <a href="https://www.womeninidentity.org/cpages/home">Women in Identity</a> has one which covers bias, which is good. There are some voluntary code of conducts around biometrics. So, for example, the <a href="https://www.biometricsinstitute.org/">Biometrics Institute</a> has one, here in the UK, the law enforcement are starting to go down that route as well.</p>
<p>And the UK Government is also developing a trust framework, which is really interesting. And the idea is that this will be something that companies which provide digital identity services will be able to accredit that service against the trust framework, which should cover issues such as these. So that’s certainly very encouraging.</p>
<p>One thing I would say, though, is that I think it’s – so far, civil society, like I’ve said, it’s certainly waking up to potential issues with the way that identity is used. It’s a particular parts of civil society have taken an interest more than others. I think that’s a potential issue.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thank you for that overview. It’s very interesting about the many aspects of the ethical use of identity. And now, ultimately who’s the responsibility to ensure that ethical use of identity? Is it government regulation – regulation is that’s part of the job? Or, is it organisations are the ones who build the services? So what would you say? Whose responsibility is it?</p>
<p>Jessica: It’s everyone’s responsibility. This is a question about the kind of society we want to live in. There are so many different questions here – some which are about ease of use and accessibility of digital services. Others are about how we balance different good things that we might want. We all want security, we all want privacy as well. And, you know, balancing these different kind of good things is something that everyone needs to get involved in.</p>
<p>Certainly, there are lots of areas where government really does need to step into lead. And these, typically, are in areas where kind of technical standards are required. Interoperability, of course, is key. And interoperability if we can build that on the basis of high standards then we can avoid the problem of having a race to the bottom as they say, where providers look to compete on having the kind of easiest and cheapest digital identity service, which is something we want to avoid.</p>
<p>So yeah, so government is I think, starting to lead now in digital identity, which is good, and they are starting to put in place some solutions, such as the trust framework I mentioned. But yeah, I did want to say more I think about civil society’s role here. There certainly is a response from civil society. I mean, we see, for example, that there are quite a few kind of think tanks who are interested in this, particularly looking at the international angle. So, for example, the Omidyar Network had a program called Good ID, which has been taken on I think, by <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2021-11/incorporating-good-id">Harvard</a> now. The <a href="https://institute.global/">Tony Blair Institute</a> also has a programme looking at how digital identity is developing in different countries and what are some of the different issues, and how would they balance some of these different factors. So that’s good.</p>
<p>I think that what we haven’t seen in civil societies, we haven’t seen the breadth and depth of voices, the diversity of voices, actually, that we need to see involved in this debate. I’m starting to see much more participation by groups which are interested in bias, which is really, really good. I think I would like to see a lot more contribution from those who represent the digitally excluded. You know, the elderly, people who are less educated, people with learning disabilities, people who are poor, homeless, don’t have credentials.</p>
<p>These are the kind of people who are worst represented generally in society. They tend to not be at the table, they don’t work in the tech industry. They don’t take part in conversations like you and I are having now. And so, groups which represent these people, they really, really need to step up and take part because it’s not until we hear both sides that we start to understand how we balance these important social goods.</p>
<p>Now, to give you an example about where this has actually worked is in the field of child safety online. So, we have seen, unfortunately, over the last, you know, 10, 10, 15 years, an absolutely massive growth in the rise of online child exploitation, which is really kind of quite appalling. And has become a really, really major, perhaps even the major part of the work of law enforcement working in this area. They have to consider the digital element.</p>
<p>Now, the fact is, is that if you’re going to protect children online, around social media when they’re interacting online, then part of the solution to that is almost inevitably going to be constraints and limitations around anonymity. And these are some of the debates that we’re having now in society. And, one thing that I think that has worked there is that NSPCC, which is I think the largest British children’s charity with a background that goes back, it’s sort of legacy spans a couple of 100 years, I think. The NSPCC has really taken up this as a huge part of its mission now to kind of go and fight on behalf of children exploited online.</p>
<p>And so they’ve brought some real diversity to this debate. And they make sure that whenever we’re talking about things like encryption or digital identity or anonymity online, we don’t forget that protecting children is an important and legitimate use case, because otherwise, these things do tend to get forgotten. It’s everyone’s responsibility. And I would like to see a lot more diversity of voices at the table, I think discussing these important issues.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I couldn’t agree more. And it’s much wider than we normally hear, right? As you said, we work in the tech industry, I hear some of the voices that are already showing this concern about the ethical use of identity. But many of the ones you just said, we rarely hear about that. And there are people who are much less connected than us, as you say, they are not listened to this podcast or similar places where they can be informed or have a voice. So yeah.</p>
<p>Jessica: Yeah, for sure. And it’s difficult because I think many people in the tech industry are starting to wake up and become aware now and looking to be educated. And I think it’s often hard to know where to start.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly, exactly. Excellent to know all this based on your extensive work and research on all the aspects that relate to ethical use of identity. And now, looking at the organisations, both private and public, so how can organisations continue to protect themselves? Because something has to be done to protect themselves, while at the same time being on the right side of these ethical minefield.</p>
<p>Jessica: Yeah, it really is, it’s very challenging. And I think it’s particularly challenging for organisations that may be looking to develop their own solutions in this, which some still do. So I think, you know, first question, so, OK, organisations fundamentally should be aware that digital identity is an area where they need to carry out some assurance. And so, some questions to think about when you’re doing that assurance…</p>
<p>First of all, you need to know where in your organisation you need to verify people’s identities and how that gets done today. Typically, it falls into two categories, doesn’t it? Your own employees, and then your customers and partners. Of course, with customers and partners, some customers may be individuals, they may be businesses with individuals as well, some of identity verification is kind of quite complex.</p>
<p>So, the second thing is, you need to understand is, what are the purpose? Why are you needing to verify identity? And you need to really fully understand the risk you’re trying to mitigate and whether you’re providing the right level of assurance to mitigate it. If it’s too high, if you’re kind of putting in place too much friction that could make it harder for your customers to interact with you. And it also could worsen problems around inequality of access, like we’ve talked about. But of course, if you don’t put enough controls in, you’re opening yourselves up, of course, to all sorts of forms of cybercrime, and all sorts of risks.</p>
<p>So then you need to think about what is it that you’re trying to verify here? What attributes? Now, for the vast majority of organisations, this will be name, address, possibly the organisation you’re associated with. For some services, particularly public services, it may well be your entitlement, questions about for example, your immigration status. And if you think, some services, health related services, increasingly sensitive data. So for example, if you think of the COVID app there, you know, that’s your entitlement to go to a concert or something based on data about your vaccine status.</p>
<p>Now, on top of this, there are also services which are at particular risk of fraud, so it tends to be financial related services, where they’re regulated. They have a regulatory requirement to carry out additional checks. Now, these services are interesting, because as well as identity checks when you first sign up during on boarding, they often will lay on additional checks while you use the service to make sure you’re still the person you say you are. And here, you’re bringing in much more complex background data, often without necessarily the explicit knowledge of the user around for example, what is your device, your location, your behaviour? Is the person using the service, are they the same person who signed up in the first place?</p>
<p>OK, so then you need to think about, based on what attributes you’re trying to verify, what are the credentials you’re using to verify this individual? And what are the implications of that? You need to think about what you’re asking for. Now, in your target user group, can everyone in that user group, do they have those credentials? Can they prove themselves? Now, if they can’t, what are the implications of that? Who is excluded? This is when we start to think about, you know, what groups are being systematically excluded here. There are always going to be individuals with particular needs. But if there’s a kind of big group, we need to be concerned about that.</p>
<p>And of course, we also need to think, on the flip side, are the credentials you’re asking for, are they going to be enough? Who can get those? If anyone can get those credentials easily, you know, if you can steal something from someone’s bin, steal a document from someone’s bin. Well, you know, you need to think about that as well.</p>
<p>And last but absolutely not least, a really, really critical part of assurance now, of course, is your suppliers, you need to vet your suppliers. You need to ask questions about their own cyber security posture. Government is becoming much more demanding on this front now. You need to ask how they protect users’ data. And, of course, how they mitigate against bias and the problems we’ve talked about.</p>
<p>As I said originally, if you, as an organisation, if your own developers are creating an identity verification solution, you need actually to ask even more questions. Because we need to remember that in-house teams, unless they are specialists in building identity solutions, they’re often not going to have either the resource or the expertise to do this well. So yeah, so important to think about that too.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yes, in the end, it’s asking a lot of questions to a lot of people I believe, that’s the moral of this, asking a lot of questions and to a lot of people. So when designing the services, you mentioned developers of course, they are part of that, what are their roles, the persons who should be asking these questions or leading this work?</p>
<p>Jessica: These are basic governance questions. So, depending on how large the organisation is, they may well have risk owners. Senior executives who are running the parts of the business, which the identity solution is going to be aligned with, they absolutely need to be on board. And, in many cases where this is a kind of novel use, it may well be that the board needs to have visibility over this. This is an important dimension of risk management generally. And I think this is one area where senior staff certainly need to increase their awareness of the issues.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah, and it’s clear that it’s, as you said very early in our conversation, the balance is quite hard to achieve, but of course, has to be the ultimate goal. Jessica, finally, one question, for all business leaders listening to us now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Jessica: It’s an idea that I call digital native risk. And these are forms of risk, which are native to digital, they’re not necessarily kind of old risks which have now developed an online aspect. And I think, the fundamental idea is, business leaders need to think about digital native risk, and how they’re going to fill those gaps in their understanding, where are the weaknesses in your risk radar?</p>
<p>Risk management, it’s been a board level responsibility for a long time. And organisations in some sectors have a mature culture around risk management. I’m thinking particularly, for example, very safety critical industries, like the nuclear industry, and financial services, pretty mature in risk management. But as I say, there are new forms of risk now coming thick and fast, which are kind of quite new. And they fundamentally come from the very rapid adoption of digital in every area now of business in a way that has actually created a kind of dependency, a reliance which may well really undermine basic business resilience.</p>
<p>Many organisations have spent the last 20 years removing redundancy in their operations. They’ve removed manual processes. And we only have to look at what’s happening now in Ukraine and Russia to ask questions about well, just how long could a business operate with no internet access? We can add to that forms of risk, of course, around cyber security, how the rise of ransomware during the pandemic has really made that top of mind.</p>
<p>Cybercrime is spiralling in every developed country, particularly economic crime, lots and lots of new novel forms of fraud, insider threat as well is top of mind for financial services. And then of course, there’s that whole piece around the unintended consequences of innovative digital services. So we’ve talked today about ethics and issues such as, for example, how the rise of social media created a real problem around online child exploitation. Many, many innovative services, they do have unintended consequences, that’s just a fact of life.</p>
<p>And I think that business leaders, particularly at board level, they really now need to start kind of building this in right from the start. It’s not about becoming incredibly risk averse, I think it’s just about planning right from the start about how you’re going to, as I say, kind of fill the gaps in your understanding. So the way that we develop our understanding of digital native risk, it needs to evolve and get better.</p>
<p>And as I said before, I think our failure to anticipate the scale of online harms, I think many people feel that it’s lack of diversity was at the root of that. The fact that technological innovation has been driven by such a narrow demographic of people. Of course the stereotype is you’re talking about white men in Western developed countries, particularly the US, who tend to be disproportionately young, disproportionately highly educated, and probably have no children yet. We really, really need to think about broadening our awareness of the environment.</p>
<p>And one thing I’m seeing, which is interesting now, is that those organisations which find themselves under attack, which find themselves particularly subject to these forms of digital native risk, increasingly, they’re finding that they’re needing to share much more information between themselves, often their competitors, bringing in government, law enforcement, academia, the private sector, their technology suppliers, and the importance of collaboration. As I said before, I feel these issues are just too important to leave to business as usual. These issues are everyone’s responsibility to fix and I think that if we can get this kind of collaboration and open discussion, diversity of voices around the table, I think we have a good chance of moving forward in a positive way.</p>

  <p>So, you’ve heard a lot of impressive things about Zero Trust, and how implementing it in your organization should solve most of your security problems, especially these days, when people still primarily have to work remotely. Now you would like to start with Zero Trust as soon as possible, but still unsure how to separate truth from fiction and how to turn theory into practical steps? Then you are at the right event!</p>
<p>But before jumping to specific technologies in later presentations, we have to address some common misconceptions and dispel a couple of myths. Most importantly, we will demonstrate that Zero Trust is not a single product you can buy, but a broad spectrum of practical solutions that address various business problems by targeted application of ZT principles.</p>
<p>Are you looking to implement Zero Trust for your corporate network? For your modern cloud-native application? To secure your sensitive data against unauthorized access? Only you can assess your risks and set your priorities. But we can help you understand the true scope of ZT-enabled solutions and to show how to look beyond labels, focusing on specific capabilities needed to solve your burning business problems.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/balaganski-practical-zero-trust-concepts-quick-wins"></a>

 Zero trust promises better security in a highly interconnected world, but many of the tenets of zero trust are contradictory to entrenched practices and ideas. Getting beyond MFA into a true zero trust environment isn't an incremental change, it's a radical restructuring of how resources are secured and accessed. 
 
 
 Encrypt everything - True end to end encryption means that data packets can't be inspected for malware in between the source and destination. Are your endpoints ready? Can your policies adapt? 
 Micro-segmentation - Preventing lateral movement of an attacker requires breaking up the smooth flow of data across a network. But segmentation is inherently inefficient. Is your network able to meet the need for speed? 
 Deny all by default - Users are all in favor of security, until it impacts their ability to work. If access is denied by default, do you have processes in place to quickly approve access when needed? Are the users (including those in the c-suite) on board? 
 Continuous authorization - Using trust scores works well in white papers, but do you know what the rules governing access to your resources really are? Does your IT department have the authority to drop a user mid-transaction because of a change in their trust score? Have you decided what your risk tolerance is?

<p>È stato presentato al “CLUSIT Security Summit”, svoltosi dal 15 al 17 marzo, il libro dal titolo: “Rischio digitale Innovazione e Resilienza – Conoscere, affrontare e mitigare il rischio digitale”. L’opera è frutto della collaborazione di numerosi autori, specialisti del settore, membri della comunità accademica e scientifica, manager esperti e professionisti di Information Security ed ha l’obiettivo di conoscere, affrontare e mitigare il rischio digitale. Fra di essi anche Giovanni Belluzzo – Head of Cyber Security &amp; Management System di InfoCert, il quale ha collaborato nella stesura degli articoli relativi a Perimetro Sicurezza Nazionale Cibernetica, al Framework NIST ed al Framework Nazionale Cyber Security.</p>

<p>Con rischio digitale si intende quella tipologia di rischio a cui sono esposti dati e servizi digitalizzati e che generalmente è la conseguenza dell’utilizzo delle nuove tecnologie. Il testo offre una panoramica su temi come l’analisi del rischio digitale, la quale assume un’importanza prioritaria in una società nella quale le minacce di cybersecurity sono considerate ormai in cima alla lista dei rischi d’impresa. Fra le attività cardine che il libro suggerisce di adottare, vi sono la mappatura dei processi, l’analisi del contesto e dei rischi, l’identificazione dei controlli di mitigazione definiti nei framework di riferimento e la realizzazione del piano di trattamento del rischio.</p>



<p>Questa pubblicazione nasce allo scopo di richiamare l’attenzione sulla corretta gestione del rischio digitale in tutte le organizzazioni, pubbliche e private, spesso connotate da una peculiarità di interconnessioni con soggetti diversi. Oggi, le PA giocano un ruolo fondamentale per lo sviluppo della società, per il rilancio economico e sociale del paese e per la realizzazione di nuovi progetti e investimenti anche collegati al PNRR. La diffusione della cultura della sicurezza al livello dei vertici e l’adozione all’interno delle PA di processi governati e integrati di gestione del rischio e della sicurezza digitale possono contribuire in modo fondamentale al raggiungimento degli obiettivi a cui sono chiamate le pubbliche amministrazioni nell’interesse primario del singolo cittadino. Nel comparto privato, invece, al di là della dimensione, è necessario evitare di considerare i dati e la tecnologia solo come meri strumenti per incrementare i propri introiti: essi devono essere valutati e gestiti sistematicamente e in modo sicuro così da sfruttarne ogni beneficio senza ledere gli interessi degli stakeholder.</p>



<p>Il libro è un’utile lettura per le figure con responsabilità più operative e di supporto al vertice, per esempio CIO, CISO, Risk manager, IT risk manager, i Data protection officer e, nell’ambito pubblico, i Responsabili per la transizione al digitale, ma anche il CEO e CFO, in breve tutti coloro che possono sviluppare la consapevolezza sul tema affinché la gestione del rischio sia correttamente affrontata.</p>



<p>Questa è la tredicesima pubblicazione della Clusit Community for Security, una community i cui componenti, nonché autori del libro e dei contenuti del blog, svolgono un costante lavoro di preparazione tramite un confronto multidisciplinare e multisettoriale, sono accomunati da una forte consapevolezza del grande bisogno di sicurezza e compliance delle organizzazioni italiane, oltre ad un un forte senso di responsabilità verso la nostra società.</p>

<p>Bob Schukai, Mastercard’s Executive Vice President of Technology Development, New Digital Infrastructure &amp; Fintech, lays out the Mastercard philosophy around protection of consumer data:</p>
<p>“Strong connectivity is important; however we also know that handling people’s data is an enormous responsibility. We have an obligation to keep our customers’ data secure and we set out <a href="https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/vision/corp-responsibility/data-responsibility.html">four simple principles</a>&nbsp;for the use of data. Consumers own the data they produce every day — and have the right to understand and control how it is shared and used. Ultimately, consumer data should be used to make their lives easier.</p>
<p>If you are building a fintech that is innovating with consumer data, it’s critical to clearly outline a set of privacy standards and data management practices up front. Protect that data using an appropriate set of privacy-enhancing technologies to back your claims. Treat the data of your users as if it was your own.”</p>

<p>KILT identity blockchain for issuing decentralized credentials will enhance Authtrail’s data integrity for enterprise</p><p>22 March 2022, Malta and Berlin — Authtrail and B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH (BTE), a developer of applications for KILT Protocol, announced plans to integrate KILT DIDs into the Authtrail platform to improve its trustworthiness and transparent data flows. Authtrail is a complete SaaS platform bringing blockchain-based integrity to enterprise data and is powered by Moonbeam, which like KILT is part of the Polkadot ecosystem.</p><p>To ensure data provenance throughout the enterprise value chain, digital identities composed of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials using KILT will be integrated into the data sources Authtrail works&nbsp;with.</p> In data we&nbsp;trust <p>Historically, trust is something that existed primarily in the physical universe. Personal data is upgraded with credentials (passports, driver’s licenses, educational certificates) that are typically managed and monetized by centralized Web2 institutions and&nbsp;systems.</p><p>KILT is a decentralized blockchain protocol for issuing verifiable, revocable, and anonymous credentials and DIDs for Web3. Building on KILT brings trust to the digital world by creating a framework for self-sovereign online identities. Developers can use KILT to create identifiers and credentials for humans, machines, services, IoT use cases, and anything that needs identity.</p> Data provenance through&nbsp;DIDs <p>KILT Protocol’s translation of real-life identity credentials to a digital realm offers Authtrail an additional level of veracity and traceability of the data. Authtrail’s enterprise clients have systems, organizations and employees that would need DIDs. These would be created via the Authtrail application using DIDsign, streamlining the onboarding process for large enterprises since no knowledge of blockchain or DIDs is needed by the end&nbsp;user.</p><p>With <a href="http://didsign.io/">DIDsign</a>, an application built on KILT by BTE, a hash for the data could be linked with a DID to form a signature. The KILT blockchain would not store the signature on-chain, but only the&nbsp;DID.</p><p>Authtrail currently provides immutability of data aggregated within its platform, and with DIDsign it could now ensure accountability before data is written to the blockchain. If the anchored data is later altered, the signature and the altered data would no longer match and therefore changes to the data could be easily detected.</p><p>“We are excited to work with BTE to integrate DIDs using KILT Protocol. By employing DIDsign, we can procure more value for enterprise customers who want to innovate their identity systems without compromising the security of personal or organizational data in their environment,” said Authtrail CEO, Matjaž&nbsp;Sobočan.</p><p>“Both Authtrail and KILT Protocol are bringing Web3 solutions to enterprises and end-users that will drive blockchain adoption in the real world. Collaborating with Authtrail, an expert in enterprise data management, will drive higher trust at a lower cost deeper into organizations,” said Ingo Rübe, founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity&nbsp;GmbH.</p> About Authtrail <p>Authtrail platform tackles data integrity issues in digitized enterprises and organizations through advanced blockchain technology and high operational scalability.</p><p>With Authtrail, companies can embrace a new competitive edge. While continuing their business as usual, they show they can be trusted and collaborated with, can easily access relevant and verified data internally, and help end-users, auditors, and/or regulators to gain trust in their data. Ultimately, more efficient business operations result in increased productivity while minimizing the cost of internal data management.</p><p>Reach Authtrail on:</p><p><a href="https://t.me/Authtrail">Telegram </a>| <a href="https://twitter.com/authtrail">Twitter</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://authtrail.com/">Website</a></p> About B.T.E BOTLabs Trusted Entity&nbsp;GmbH <p>B.T.E.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>I firmly believe that one of the key success factors of a product strategy in any industry is to be able to offer customers just the right amount of choice. Looking back at the history of such companies as Ford, Kodak, IKEA, or Apple, we can see that their success was to a large extent in their ability to sell not just a product, but an entire lifestyle, a single, convenient solution for all their customers’ problems, whether real or just invented by marketing departments. Of course, this approach does not work every time, as the eventual fate of Kodak indicates. Customer requirements, just like technology, fashion and other societal factors, change all the time, and the product ecosystems have to adapt or risk extinction…</p>
<p>In a sense, Oracle is undergoing a similar transformation now, as the company is reinventing itself as a <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/oracle-delivers-on-earlier-cloud-promises">major player</a> in the cloud service provider market. This has naturally required major changes in Oracle’s strategy, transitioning from the old “hermetic” way towards open, mutually beneficial partnerships with other vendors and even direct competitors like Microsoft Azure. The most obvious sign of this change, as we have mentioned many times before, is the idea that instead of catching up with competitors on their established playing fields (for example, trying to offer cheaper infrastructure than AWS), Oracle should focus on its unique services that no other competitor can offer, like the Autonomous Database, and promote efficient and convenient multi-cloud architectures through 3rd party integrations.</p>
<p>Essentially, whenever a customer is facing a supposed dichotomy, having to choose between a solution from Oracle or from a competitor, the company’s answer now boils down to a well-known meme: <a href="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/538/731/0fc.gif">why not both</a>? Practical examples of this strategy can be seen in supporting direct interconnects between Oracle and Azure cloud datacenters in many regions or even in <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/new-heatwave-is-coming">making MySQL HeatWave a first-class open source alternative</a> to Oracle’s own database even for enterprise use cases.</p>
<p>Basically, we can see a major transformation in the market of cloud services, both for data management and in general. Before, customers had to make fundamental choices before starting a new project, such as selecting the underlying database layer: should they opt for the universal approach with Oracle Database or choose the broad range of specialized engines from AWS. This choice has effectively robbed them from most of the future flexibility, should something go wrong and the initial selection prove to be suboptimal.</p>
<p>Nowadays, customers are free to use Oracle’s database services but, say, connect them to applications running on Microsoft Azure and AI services from GCP. And, of course, these services are expected to be truly and independently elastic to accommodate for unexpected changes in demand and to minimize operational costs for customers. This is what I call the right freedom of choice that underlines the real modern “multi-cloud native” approach.</p>
<p>However, Oracle does not stop there and in a sense, adopts the same strategy even within its own product ecosystem. The latest example of this I can see in the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/multiple-vm-autonomous-database-on-exadata-cloud-at-customer-2022-03-16/">recent announcement of Multi-VM Autonomous Database</a> on Exadata Cloud@Customer, Oracle’s private cloud platform. Even if it sounds too technical at first sight, it is really all about giving customers real choice of running both the Exadata Database Service and Autonomous Database Service simultaneously on the same hardware deployed in their data centers and managed by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).</p>
<p>Previously, customers of Oracle’s managed private cloud platform were able to choose whether they wanted to run the traditional, enterprise-proven databases on a particular Exadata Cloud@Customer system for their business-critical applications or instead opt for the fully managed, self-tuning Autonomous Database instances, favored by modern developers on a separate Exadata Cloud@Customer system. They had to make a choice once and then stick to it for the whole lifecycle of the platform.</p>
<p>Now they can have both. Thanks to the improvements in the underlying management platform, customers can create multiple clusters of virtual machines on the same Exadata Cloud@Customer infrastructure and then configure each cluster for the type of database service that they need independently. This is implemented as a set of self-service workflows that can be delegated to different roles, such as developers, application DBAs and DB fleet managers.</p>
<p>From a security and governance perspective, the role of fleet managers is particularly interesting and has a follow-on positive impact on developers. The fleet manager defines the runtime environment isolation and SLAs at the cluster level, according to corporate governance best practices, and then gives each developer or operational team visibility into a subset of environments along with access controls and quotas that limit the resources they consume.</p>
<p>Exadata Cloud@Customer’s built-in security helps secure the actual databases, but it’s up to the fleet administrator to ensure that corporate governance is defined for each environment – functional governance like defining backup retention policies, failover capabilities, update scheduling, and where data is stored throughout its lifecycle in order to meet data residency requirements. Operational governance like separation of dev-test from production, secure isolation between application teams, and mission-critical workload separation are also managed by them.</p>
<p>As a result, individual developers and application DBAs no longer have to think about security and governance requirements, and they can just take the operating environments given to them and do whatever they need within their assigned quotas, increasing their personal productivity.</p>
<p>However, for organizations as a whole, the governance and compliance benefits of this approach are also obvious. Instead of having to manage multiple disconnected development, test, and staging environments separately from production instances, now companies using Exadata Cloud@Customer can benefit from applying the same policies across all their data and at the same time significantly reducing the administrative effort and data friction between organizational units. Another win for “Why not both” indeed!</p>

			 US and EU Regulators Move to Embrace Blockchain Technology 
<p>This month, we are traveling to Miami, New York, and San Francisco for business meetings and events. Our partner Inveniam organized an impressive conference where mayors from Miami and New York spoke and embraced blockchain technology.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our CEO Luc and CCO Daniel were honored to speak on three panels to share our knowledge and experience on asset tokenization. In conversations with attendees and speakers, the topic of regulation kept coming up in light of recent regulatory developments in the U.S. and EU:</p>
 
 US’s Digital Asset EO: on March 9, the White House signed an executive order (EO) on digital assets, representing a turning point in the acceptance and recognition of digital assets by the government. 
 EU’s MiCA: on March 14, the European Parliament’s ECON Committee passed Marketplace for Crypto Assets (MiCA) draft legislation, refusing to ban the Proof of Work (PoW) mechanism, which was a relief for all European players. 
 
<p>What are our thoughts on the current state of regulation in Europe and the US regarding tokenization?</p>
 
 Issuance:&nbsp;The EU has progressed well on recognizing that blockchain-based financial instruments as securities, especially in Luxembourg, where we are based, providing the regulatory clarity for native issuance of assets on blockchain. 
 Liquidity:&nbsp;The US regulators FINRA and SEC, have approved several ATS for tokenized securities (e.g. Rialto, Oasis Pro Markets, Texture Capital, …), giving participants faster access to liquidity, whereas the EU has a complicated CSD regulation that makes access to liquidity expensive and slower. Consequently, our&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/t-rex-billboard/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9ZXIO-zmf7NU4VP2ZLO5zZNwT4Cdl1_ouCEj8CeyezSpSiL2UfG8GZHq-EtSg0Js0DImXe">Billboard</a>&nbsp;solution was designed to provide European players with a license-free liquidity solution. 
 Cash legs: Dollar stablecoins are dominating the market, while Euro stablecoins were rarely issued and used due to an unclear regulation. The new MiCA regulation clarifies the different types of authorized stablecoins. 
 
<p>Regulation is an important factor in the widespread adoption of innovation, however it will take a long road until the bill is passed and implemented. Our role is to protect our partners and clients through a compliance infrastructure that allows them to remain agile regardless of the jurisdictions and regulatory changes.</p>

 Identity platform IDnow expands Digital Identities and Trust Services division 
<p>Munich, March 22nd 2022: IDnow, one of the leading European providers in the field of digital identities and identity verification, has appointed Johannes Leser as the new VP Trust Services.</p>
<p>Leser’s primary responsibilities at IDnow will be the expansion of the Trust Services unit as well as the management of a new German trust service.</p>
<p>The company, headquartered in Munich and with five additional European locations, is announcing plans to build a Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP) as part of the appointment of Johannes Leser. In the area of digital wallets to prove identity, QTSPs play a central role. Within these digital wallets, users and citizens can link their national digital identity (which is also known as their ‘basic identity’) with digital proofs of other personal attributes such as their driver’s license, degree certificates or bank account. The authenticity of these attributes must be confirmed by a specially certified provider of qualified trust services. With the appointment of Johannes Leser and the plans to build a QTSP, IDnow will further expand its service offering around digital identities and wallets.</p>
<p>In his new role, Johannes Leser will bring extensive experience in qualified trust services and digital transaction management to the organisation. Four years ago, he founded Namirial Germany, the German subsidiary of one of the largest providers of trust services on the European market. For more than a decade, he has been involved with the trustworthy integration of electronic signatures into digital processes.</p>
<p>Johannes Leser commented: “I am looking forward to building a provider for qualified trust services with IDnow. Among other challenges, we will solve the issues of how qualified attributes interact with wallets in proving digital identities.”</p>
<p>Armin Bauer, CTO and Managing Director at IDnow, added: “This is an important step in the digital identities space for IDnow. By building our own QTSP, we can not only verify and store digital identities, but also attest additional electronic attributes. Johannes Leser brings the ideal experience to make this initiative a success and I look forward to working with him.”</p>

Phantom Seokgu Yun / The main speaker of the Live Webinar Discussion<p>Since the invention of Bitcoin in 2009, the blockchain industry has tried to revolutionize the current banking and financial infrastructure on decentralized networks. Ethereum, the first blockchain to adopt the smart contract to its blockchain structure, has revolutionized the current blockchain industry with bringing a new concept of financial innovations such as ICO, DeFi, NFTs and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>However, most of the blockchain projects, including Ethereum, the 3rd generation blockchain projects and even private blockchain projects, have been failed to be tailored in the real financial world. There are many reasons why the current conventional blockchains don’t work with the real world’s financial environment, but the most important key of the mass adoption is that avoiding anonymity and making possible parallel transaction executions.</p><p>In this Live Webinar, Don Tapscott, Executive Chairman of the Blockchain Research Institute, will host the webinar and our CEO Phantom Seokgu Yun. They will discuss how the real blockchain work with the current financial infrastructure and how MetaMUI Blockchain has revolutionized the blockchain industry into the new era of a real working blockchain in the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>Registration Link:<br><a href="https://t.co/qBV2sk7m9S">https://t.co/qBV2sk7m9S</a></p>Don Tapscott / Executive Chairman of Blockchain Research Institute Don Tapscott <p>Don Tapscott is one of the world’s leading authorities on the impact of technology on business and society having authored 16 widely read books. He has coined many concepts that are part of the business lexicon today and is sought by corporate and government leaders globally. He is currently Co-Founder &amp; Executive Chairman of the Blockchain Research Institute, an Adjunct Professor at INSEAD, recently a two-term Chancellor of Trent University in Ontario and Member of The Order of&nbsp;Canada.</p>Phantom Seokgu Yun / CEO of Sovereign Wallet Network &amp; Project Lead of&nbsp;MetaMUI Phantom Seokgu&nbsp;Yun <p>A pioneer of digital currency and distributed systems since 1992, Phantom Seokgu Yun is the CEO and Chief Scientist of Sovereign Wallet Network and SWN Global. He is a South Korean national with over 25 years of experience in cryptography, algorithms, and security architectures. He has provided security solutions to DAVOS and G20 summits, LG, Samsung, Yahoo, and eBay, among other multi-national corporations. Following his professional achievements and academic research at Korea Advanced Institute of Technology and the University of Southern California, Phantom founded Sovereign Wallet, the precursor to Sovereign Wallet Network and SWN Global. He currently leads the MetaMUI Platform, a CBDC and NFT specialized blockchain.</p> About MetaMUI <p>MetaMUI is the world’s 1st Identity-based blockchain to truly enable regulated Peer_to_Peer (P2P) transactions. It can be used as the cornerstone for most financial offerings, with its high versatility and support for custom-developed use cases that enable Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) implementation and issuance easily on the MetaMUI CBDC platform.<br>MetaMUI is built around Self-Sovereign Identity (SSID) technology. By combining the SSID and blockchain token mechanism, MetaMUI was able to create a new identity-based CBDC system that can protect user’s privacy while providing an identity-based transfer system that can satisfy travel rules and other regulatory requirements such as Know your customer (KYC), Anti-money laundering (AML) and Counter Financing of Terrorism (CFT).</p><p><a href="https://sovereignwallet.network/">Website</a>/<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/metamui/">Linkedin</a>/<a href="https://twitter.com/MUIcommunity">Twitter</a>/<a href="https://t.me/muicommunity">Telegram</a>/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SWNGlobal">Youtube</a>/<a href="https://sovereignwallet.medium.com/">Medium</a></p>

<p>Impervious Technologies Inc. (<a href="https://impervious.ai">impervious.ai)</a></p><p>3.21.2022</p><p>Abstract</p><p>Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are user-controlled, can be globally persistent and are generated or registered cryptographically. A DID consists of a Uniform Resource Identifier specified in and used to resolve a DID document. An entity with write-privileges called a controller inputs the specifications describing a DID subject into a DID document. The DID Specification enables a controller to improve DID resiliency by listing multiple service endpoints and transport pathways. These specifications and their resulting resilience form the basis of DIDCommunications (DIDComm).</p><p>DIDComm offers communication options regardless of protocol or transport layer, enabling users to communicate without hosting their own listening servers online. DIDComm mediators act as relays that receive an onion-encrypted message from a sender (or another previous mediator in a chain) and pass this message on to another party. Relays are transport agnostic and can be used with any desired transport layer, including Lightning, HTTP, TOR, webRTC or WebSockets. DIDs make reliable direct payments possible by abstracting an identity layer from the public address of Lightning nodes.</p><p>Through the DID Specification, service endpoints and DIDComm, Impervious has interlaced DIDs with Bitcoin Lightning, IPFS, WebRTC and resilient relays to introduce a new peer-to-peer internet standard with practical applications for mitigating censorship and surveillance risk.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">See Impervious Technologies Inc.’s Github to reference example code snippets:</a></p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">  specs/did-usage.md at main · imperviousai/specs  Contribute to imperviousai/specs development by creating an account on GitHub.

DIDs can be tailored for different contexts, used to reinforce pseudonymity or leveraged to port attributes between identities. This technology aims to solve many ills on the internet today, from intermediary control of identity to surveillance at successive layers of the technology stack.</p><p>A DID can identify any subject (e.g., person, organization, data model, abstract entity, etc.) based on its controller, which has DID document write-privileges. A DID document specifies the syntax, common data mode, core properties, serialized representations, operations and an explanation of the DID resolution process. A DID is represented by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for trustable interactions between a DID subject and a DID document. A DID is verified by associating a DID document and URI and can be universally resolvable with DID methods such as the Microsoft ION Sidetree protocol &lt;https://github.com/decentralized-identity/ion&gt;.</p><p>DIDs consist of a URI string used to resolve a DID document with information that describes the identity’s subject.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">DID Document</a><p>A DID document may include authentication keys, service endpoints, a short-name alias, free-form text and other attributes as specified by the controller. Use cases can also be implemented without a protocol modification by updating a DID document.</p><p>The URI resolves to a DID document based on the implementation of the specific DID method. This infrastructure could be a web server (similar threat model to current URL API calls), peer-to-peer discovery, anchor to the Bitcoin blockchain, IPFS or custom implementation devised by the controller. The DID Specification enables a controller to add or update information within a DID document, improving the utility of a DID and enabling DIDCommunications (DIDComm).</p><p>The DID Specification</p><p>The DID Specification enables a controller to maximize decentralization by inputting additional information into a DID document. It meets the core attributes of an optimal decentralized payment and communications network. The DID Specification is updatable and open-standard and is redundant and resilient with fallback nodes, fallback on-chain addresses and alternative pathways to receive data or payments through a custodian. A DID is a static string that can function as a QR code for ease of use.</p><p>A controller may specify service endpoints in a DID document by listing the applications, features and functions a DID can support. The DID Specification for service endpoints allows for choosing the transport path, message type and method used to perform payment actions. A network of users may also select a subnet configured for their particular needs.</p><p>DID Service Endpoints</p><p>Service endpoints can be application-specific data stores (e.g., Tweets), IPNS links or any other protocol. Moreover, a DID can support several specified service endpoints. A DID document specifies the broadcast method and claims ownership over a personal domain, as shown in the following code example:</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">DID Document Specifies a Service Endpoint</a><p>A DID document must include all metadata necessary for the respective service endpoint type. Service endpoints can be duplicated and hosted across multiple providers (URLs) for enhanced resilience. A controller can specify which service endpoint receives message information, either through code or configuration. See the W3C DID Specification Registries (working) for a standardized list of service endpoints and supporting appropriate documentation:<br><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#service-types">https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/#service-types</a>.</p><p>Service endpoints are not only an example of the utility and flexibility that DID documents provide, but also a critical characteristic of higher-order decentralized applications that rely on DIDComm.</p><p>DIDComm</p><p>DIDComm is a secure, private communications layer built on top of the decentralized properties of a DID. DIDComm Messaging accrues the decentralization benefits to a network of connected identifiers with a particular set of specifications. While a range of secure messaging protocols exists, most require trusting a centralized authority to issue identities, register keys and delegate certificate authorities. Furthermore, most legacy messaging protocols rely on a single transport mechanism. Centralized systems often sacrifice security to gain convenience and are limited by a lack of interoperability. DIDComm Messaging relegates centralized messaging protocols and dependent systems.</p><p>DIDComm uses service endpoints and public keys located in the DID document to enable communication between DIDs. Signing, authentication and authorization are derived from a DID and are therefore inherently decentralized. DIDComm optimizes for resilience and utility while providing individual discretion of the preferential communication protocol or transport layer. DIDComm messages are easy to understand as they utilize the same message formatting and parsing as a DID document. The receiver can set priorities to manage optimal message delivery.</p><p>In the following example, three target services are listed:</p>  The lightning node pubkey, specified as LNPubkey to support Keysend and AMP.  A DIDComm Messaging service, listening for POST requests sent to the http://example.com/path.  A DIDComm Messaging service over Lightning payments.  <a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">DIDComm</a><p>The specific DIDComm service endpoint above allows for receiving messages despite the sender &nbsp;not having access to a Lightning node. In addition, the receiver can set a priority as to which other service endpoint or communications method they prefer. This functional utility inherent in DIDs can be improved by implementing mediators or relays to ensure offline communication and traffic resilience.</p><p>DIDComm Mediators: Introduction to Relays</p><p>DIDComm allows users to communicate without hosting their servers online. Mediators receive an onion-encrypted message from a sender (or a previous mediator in the chain) and relay this message to another party. A mediator cannot assess whether the recipient is another relay or the intended recipient, and they cannot access message content since it is encrypted with the recipient’s public key. Delivery methods are transport agnostic and should be coordinated between the receiver and the designated mediator. In addition, a mediator can push mobile or email notifications or store the encrypted messages and wait for the receiver to fetch them directly when they are offline. DIDComm mediator properties enable evolutionary advances in secure and decentralized communications and in Bitcoin Lightning payments by securely routing messages and payments to recipients, even if they are temporarily offline.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">DIDComm Mediators: Introduction to Relays</a><p>DIDComm as a Lightning Transport Method</p><p>Lightning transports data via IP or TOR TCP sockets, and payments are routed by pubkeys, which are gossiped across the Lightning network. DIDs and DIDComm-based messaging can be added as alternative ways to communicate with nodes. Additionally, WebSockets, mediators, pubkey swaps, fallback nodes or communication servers can be implemented native to the network. As a transport option for Lightning payments, DIDComm improves adaptability and future-proofs the protocol. The following sections discuss how IP/TOR/Pubkeys can be referenced inside a DID to replicate Lightning features and make these resilient.</p><p>Keysend/AMP</p><p>Keysend and AMP allow for ad hoc payments by sending them directly to the destination node’s public key. This payment method does not require an invoice. In the example below, the serviceEndpoint URI is the lightning prefix followed by the node pubkey.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">Keysend/AMP</a><p>LNURL</p><p>Lightning URL (LNURL) is a service endpoint inside the DID document. The benefit of abstracting LNURL—also an abstraction layer—is that it does not need to solely depend on IP addresses or domain names. The LNURL location can be updated as needed without affecting payers. In the example above, there could be a list of multiple origins for LNURL.</p><p>In the next example, the serviceEndpoint URI is the lightning prefix followed by the LNURL encoded string &lt;<a href="https://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc/blob/luds/06.md">https://github.com/fiatjaf/lnurl-rfc/blob/luds/06.md</a>&gt;.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">LNURL</a><p>Offers</p><p>Offers are improved static invoices that enable ad hoc payments through a generic, non-amount-dependent bolt12 payment string &lt;<a href="https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/798">https://github.com/lightning/bolts/pull/798</a>&gt;. To support offers, recipients can simply create a bolt12 payment string and then add it as a service endpoint. The serviceEndpoint URI consists of the lightning prefix followed by a bolt12 encoded string.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">Offers</a><p>Custodians</p><p>Custodians add convenience to the secure and decentralized attributes of DID mediators or relays. DID mediator properties enable a standard for custodians to accept Lightning deposits on behalf of a recipient. This protocol is similar to a banking wire transfer protocol, with recipient information attached via Type-Length-Variable (TLV). The front-end of applications that understand specific custodians can open the profile in another browser tab. Back-ends that &nbsp;understand the API for specific custodians can make the payment through these URLs.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">Custodians</a><p>The serviceEndpoint URI links to the component of the custodian’s code that provides a specific service to the recipient (e.g., message forwarding, Lightning deposit, other service endpoint). A controller specifies a particular custodian using the “type” argument in the “service” function. The type argument can be a URL, DID, or Lightning pubkey that has been delegated as the user’s custodian. This can be particularly useful when a Lightning node is not always online but a friend or custodian is.</p><p>BIP47 and Paynyms</p><p>Paynyms allow on-chain payments to a pseudonymous username (i.e., “paynym”). A new address is generated using BIP47 each time a payment is made to preserve on-chain privacy and transaction security.</p><p>There are two options for interacting with paynyms. The first displays a specific BIP47 payment code directly to the payer, while the second stores the paynym URL in a public directory.</p><p>For BIP47, the serviceEndpoint URI is the prefix BTC followed by the BIP47 payment code. The serviceEndpoint URI is the paynym URL for a given user’s registered paynym. Paynyms are a resilient and secure way to conduct payments, but another approach is to use a designated on-chain address.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">BIP47 and Paynyms</a><p>On-Chain Address</p><p>A static Bitcoin address can also be provided as payment information. In this case, the serviceEndpoint is BTC followed by the address. When advanced functionality such as running a Lightning node becomes too complex, another choice is to use a normal Bitcoin address. There is wide support for sending and receiving bitcoin to a normal on-chain address. However, due to privacy implications when reusing addresses for multiple purposes, on-chain addresses should mainly be a fallback payment option.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">On-Chain Address</a><p>Bitcoin Payment Metadata</p><p>For each service endpoint payment type, optional metadata can be added to specify a receiver’s preferences. This can include the priority and the minimum/maximum number of Satoshis (sats).</p><p>Priority</p><p>For payment options, a proposal for how the recipient prefers to get paid is as simple as setting the parameter “priority": 1.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">Bitcoin Payment Metadata: Priority</a><p>Min/Max</p><p>A minimum/maximum sats amount can be specified by setting the parameter “minAmountSat": 1 and “maxAmountSat": 100000. Msat and BTC could be supported as well.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">Bitcoin Payment Metadata: Min/Max</a><p>Lightning Communication</p><p>Several Lightning based communications applications rely on Keysend/AMP to attach messages to the payment TLV records. One existing issue for any decentralized communications method involves determining whether a specific Lightning node is online and listening. Service endpoints can be used to signal the Lightning node status. By resolving a recipient’s DID, a caller may learn the status, payment and messaging information for their desired Lighting node.</p><p>In the example below, the recipient has their desired Lightning node pubkey specified as LNPubkey and is listening to Sphinx and Impervious messages.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">Lightning Communication</a><p>The service endpoint is the method used to communicate with destinations by referencing the pubkey directly from within the DID document. The type identifies the application listening to these messages, each of which may require their own message protocol or TLV records according to that application’s standard.</p><p>Lightning Mailboxes</p><p>DIDComm mediators provide an avenue for two parties to coordinate payments, even if one is temporarily offline by delegating a fallback:</p><p>If a DID sender wants to pay via Lightning to a DID recipient who is currently offline but has a delegated mediator as a fallback, the sender can send a message to their mediator. This message would contain payment details such as “DID:xyz tried to pay you 10000 sats.” Once they are online and pull this message from the mediator, the sender can contact DID:xyz to request payment again.</p><p>This method informs the recipient that a Lightning payment was missed. In addition, DIDComm mediators offer advanced functionality such that upon Lightning payment transmission to an offline node, this payment is routed to a receiver-designated mediator. Next, a secondary message is sent out of band (txt, email, etc.) alerting the recipient of a missed payment. The user is then able to bring their Lightning node online, which alerts the designated mediator to receive payment. DIDComm can use the Lightning Network as a transport layer for a pure Bitcoin Layer 2 experience.</p><p>Well Known DID and DID DNS</p><p>The LNURL protocol (<a href="https://lightningaddress.com">https://lightningaddress.com</a>) has been popularized as a method for human-readable email addresses for making payments. LNURLs utilize the well-known txt record of a domain in order to return a LNURL-pay compatible payload specific to a particular username under the /.well-known/ URI. A similar protocol exists for DIDs called the “Well Known DID” (<a href="https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/">https://identity.foundation/.well-known/resources/did-configuration/</a>). Well Known DIDs provide human-readable addresses for payments and messages.</p><p>The “alsoKnownAs” field (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#also-known-as">https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#also-known-as</a>), which can be specified in a receiving party’s DID document, can be used in conjunction with Well Known DIDs to prove the common identity of a DID and URL.</p><p>In addition, the IETF has proposed a DNS for DIDs (<a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-mayrhofer-did-dns-05.txt">https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-mayrhofer-did-dns-05.txt</a>). This proposal is designed to achieve the same effect as Well Known DIDs and represents another competitor for a DID URI standard as well as a redundant service endpoint that the controller may include to make a DID document more robust.</p><p>Example: _did.example.net. IN URI 100 10 “did:example:1234abcd"</p><p>The Impervious Browser: A Revolutionary Application of Decentralized Identity</p><p>DID is the cornerstone of the peer-to-peer web, and the Impervious Browser makes peer-DIDs accessible for everyone. These enable a range of functions, from messaging to video conferencing, live document editing and content monetization. The following two scenarios involve Impervious DIDComm between two hypothetical users (Alice and Bob).</p><p>In each scenario, Alice opens a chat box to message Bob. The Impervious Browser prepares a plaintext JSON message. The Impervious Daemon checks to see if Bob’s DID document is saved on the Daemon itself, checks a public DID-resolver URL or as a fallback checks Microsoft ION. The Impervious Daemon accesses two pieces of information and then returns to Alice: a service endpoint for messages to be delivered to Bob and the public key that Bob’s agent is using in the Alice-to-Bob relationship. Next, Alice’s browser uses Bob’s public key to encrypt the plaintext messages so that only Bob’s browser with that particular DID can read it. Alice’s browser also adds authentication with its own private key.</p><p>Scenario 1: Alice and Bob are online</p><p>The browser arranges delivery to Bob directly, using either the Lightning Network, HTTP or TOR. Bob’s browser receives and decrypts the message and authenticates its origin using Alice’s public key. Bob’s browser searches for Alice’s key and an appropriate service endpoint in her DID document. Bob’s browser then routes a response by encrypting the plaintext message, adding authentication with his private key and coordinating delivery via the available transport method and service endpoint.</p><p>Scenario 2: Alice or Bob are offline</p><p>Alice attempts to contact Bob based on the prioritized communication channel specified in Bob’s DID document, but this fails because his server is offline. Therefore, the browser arranges delivery to Bob via a DID mediator (also known as a “relay”), using either the Lightning Network, HTTP or TOR. When Bob comes back online, his Impervious Daemon connects to the mediator and retrieves messages. The relay does not have access to message content, as it is encrypted to Bob’s public key. In this case, the mediator acts as a mailbox for Bob. If Bob has a pre-negotiated service endpoint (i.e., email address, Lightning Address, etc.), the mediator network acts as a forwarding service.</p><p>At launch, the Impervious Daemon will employ DID Specification service endpoints, DIDComm and mediators to provide the core peer-to-peer and encrypted functionality of the Impervious Browser. In future Impervious Browser versions, DID Specification will improve the usability and resilience of the Lightning network. The novel use of DIDs covered in this paper addresses the potential of this technology to weave the fabric of a new peer-to-peer internet standard, enabling everyone to mitigate the risk of censorship and surveillance.</p><p>Complete Code Example</p><p>The DID document includes:</p>  Personal domain ownership  Owning two nodes: the user’s preferred method of payment under 1M sats  An LNURL endpoint supporting pay requests  Supporting bolt12 offers with a generic donation invoice  BIP47/paynym as a privacy preserving fallback payment method  A static bitcoin address as a fallback payment method after paynyms  A custodial service as a last resort payment method  Impervious and Sphinx running off both LN nodes  Supporting DIDComm on a user-owned HTTP server, user-owned LN node and mediator HTTP relay when a user is offline  <p>The following example shows a DID document utilizing all payment and communication service endpoints covered throughout this paper.</p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">DID Document Complete Code Example: Part 1/2</a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md"></a><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">DID Document Complete Code Example: Part 2/2</a> <p>See Impervious Technologies Inc.’s Github to reference example code snippets:</p><p>Impervious Technologies: Decentralized Identifiers ("DID") Spec</p><p><a href="https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md">https://github.com/imperviousai/specs/blob/main/did-usage.md</a></p><p>A copy of this document in PDF can be found via IPFS: <a href="https://imp.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmbMBc96PNYmJVFuQ4jReR4cgx9ZctZSsFyy9QdSuRZk18">https://imp.mypinata.cloud/ipfs/QmbMBc96PNYmJVFuQ4jReR4cgx9ZctZSsFyy9QdSuRZk18</a></p><p>Copyright Ⓒ 2022 Impervious Technologies Inc.</p>

<p>The payment landscape continues to shift. The move from cash and checks to digital payments such as ACH (automated clearing house) has accelerated, particularly in high-dollar or recurring categories like rent and utilities. These moves offer benefits for both consumers and merchants – more choice, simpler experiences and greater speed to payment – but they come with a few challenges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unsuccessful transactions create friction in the experience by leaving parties scrambling to find a different way to get a payment through, or it can generate penalty fees for both merchants and consumers. There is always the risk of fraudulent accounts or account credentials being used.</p>
<p>To improve the process, Mastercard today unveiled a new suite of Smart Payment Decisioning Tools that minimize these pain points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new products – Payment Success Indicator and Payment Routing Optimizer – rely on real-time bank data permissioned by a consumer to show payment indicators that raise successful payment completion rates and reduce transaction costs.</p>
<p>When it comes to ACH transactions,<a href="https://www.nacha.org/content/ach-network-volume-and-value-statistics"> Nacha reported</a> that payment volume on the modern ACH Network increased 7.7% in the third quarter of 2021 alone, showing that consumers are becoming increasingly interested in making direct payments from their bank accounts.</p>
<p>With the increasing volume of ACH payments, there are a few hurdles that may potentially slow the increase in adoption, delaying the improved merchant and consumer experience:&nbsp;</p>
 
 Settlement risk – Lack of payments visibility leaves merchants exposed to the potential for returns, which disrupt and add friction to a consumer-merchant relationship. When a customer ‘walks away’ from a payment experience, the merchant is unsure of the likelihood of ACH settlement. This has the potential to create a costly return process with added fees and manual intervention or operational costs. 
 Security – On occasion, merchants experience failed payments due to a consumer providing false or inaccurate credentials. 
 Payment decisioning – Having multiple ACH payment options, such as the payment rail and settlement date, provides consumer choice and minimizes expense. However, lack of greater visibility can introduce risk to settlement.&nbsp; 
 
 
 Minimizing Payment Failure, Maximizing Cash Flow. 
<p>How do these pain points play out in the market? According to <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/press/2021/december/the-future-is-here-new-mastercard-study-finds-majority-of-consumers-embrace-open-banking-to-power-digital-financial-experiences/">Mastercard research</a>, each time an ACH payment fails, the merchant is hit with a fee. Fraud also continues to be a major issue in payments. According to a <a href="https://www.afponline.org/publications-data-tools/reports/survey-research-economic-data/Details/payments-fraud/">2021 AFP Payments Fraud Survey</a>, checks and wire transfers are by far the preferred methods that fraudsters exploit, but ACH debits have seen an increase in fraudulent activity as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enter the power of open banking. By using consumer-permissioned data, these hurdles can be lowered or even eliminated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With Payment Success Indicator, failure risk is mitigated by scoring the likelihood of a successful payment before initiating it. Then with Payment Routing Optimizer, originators are given a recommendation for the most optimal day and payment rail to choose for the highest likelihood of successful settlement at the best cost and speed.&nbsp;</p>
 Better Data, Better Decisions. 
<p>With smart data comes better decision-making. This is true in virtually every aspect of life, and it’s true in handling account-to-account payments. Leveraging machine learning and predictive modeling, Payment Success Indicator and Payment Routing Optimizer can help mitigate or eliminate ACH failure. This can increase cash flow and improve the bottom line while also creating a more positive experience for customers.</p>
<p>Consumers are adopting more apps and services that utilize digital checkout and payment options. It’s more important than ever to minimize fees and their associated costs, reduce fraud, non-sufficient funds (NSF) returns and make payment settlement confident and cost-effective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By utilizing consumer-permissioned bank insights, Payment Success Indicator will provide payment originators a composite score across 10 future calendar days, as well as an individual score for each of those 10 days. Scoring is based on real-time balance and historical behavioral risk patterns. This system is used to evaluate the likelihood a given amount will settle successfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>If there is a high risk of settlement or non-sufficient funds over the given time period, the merchant can then use that information and request an alternative payment method, deny the transaction or assume the risk and proceed.</p>
<p>The analytics engine returns a score separating the risk factors across four tiers, giving merchants the advantage of maximizing the available data before making the decision to initiate a payment:</p>
 
 Tier 1: Highly likely to settle. 
 Tier 2: Likely to settle. 
 Tier 3: Less likely to settle. 
 Tier 4: Do not process. Errors present. 
 
<p>Each composite score comes complete with weighted reasons accompanying it. Account balance, NSF history, consumer spending and consumer deposits are all factored into the analytics.</p>
<p>Payment Routing Optimizer will make payment rail, cost and payment date suggestions, based on the risk findings by Payment Success Indicator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if the balance is available in a consumer’s account to make the payment today, but the analytics determine that it may not be available over the next few days, Payment Routing Optimizer will suggest Same-Day ACH over risking Standard ACH processing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This product aims to take the friction out of choosing between digital payment options with future updates of the Payment Routing Optimizer potentially including a debit card option.</p>
 Real-World Benefits. 
<p>The <a href="https://www.biltrewards.com/">Bilt Rewards Alliance</a>, a collection of more than 2 million rental homes across the country that lets renters earn highly valuable rewards points just by paying rent, will be the first fintech partner to launch Payment Success Indicator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our mission is to help renters get the most value out of one of their biggest expenses, and returned payments create significant expense and friction for both residents and landlords,” says Ankur Jain, Founder and CEO of Bilt Rewards. “Payment Success Indicator should significantly reduce the potential for returned payments, delivering a digital payment experience that works harder and smarter for everyone.”</p>
<p>Through smart decisioning analytics, Mastercard is helping financial services innovators and payment platforms change the ACH payments landscape. Increased confidence, minimization of fees, improved profitability and simplified payments. That’s the power of open banking.&nbsp;</p>
