<p><a href="https://www.socure.com/">Socure</a> has released a new onboarding solution that combines biometric identity verification and risk screening in a single package. In concept, Predictive Document Verification operates much like any other face-based onboarding tool. Customers are asked to take a selfie and a photo of a government ID. Socure will verify the authenticity of the document, and use facial recognition (with passive liveness detection) to match the selfie to the image on that ID.</p>



  



<p>However, Predictive Document Verification will also extract the customer’s personal information from the identity document, and then cross-reference that information with other sources to gauge the level of risk that they present. For example, the solution will check telecom records to make sure that the device being used belongs to the person being onboarded, and that they are doing so from a location close to their actual address.</p>



<p>That supplemental information lets organizations know whether or not it is safe to do business with a particular individual. Socure will check credit and utility records and see whether or not that person is on any sanctions or watch lists, and then either reject or clear each account opening application based on the perceived level of risk (users could be asked to resubmit information in certain situations).</p>



<p>Predictive Document Verification automates the decision making process, and can reach a conclusion in 98 percent of cases. Socure’s facial recognition technology, meanwhile, boasts Level 2 PAD certification, and stops 99.5 percent of all spoofing attempts. The company suggested that the solution will help speed up the onboarding process for legitimate customers while still filtering out people that an organization would prefer not to be involved with.</p>



<p>The Socure solution can be integrated with an API, or with Mobile and Web SDKs. Customers can add their own corporate branding with custom language if they are bringing Predictive Document Verification into an existing app. The platform itself offers support for iOS and Android devices, and offers no-code workflows and configurable dashboards.</p>



<p>Predictive Document Verification arrives shortly after Socure received an <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/socure-picks-up-inaugural-impact-innovation-award-091303/">Impact Innovation Award</a> from the Aite-Novarica Group. Socure has <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/selfie-onboarding-boom-delivers-record-growth-socure-081003/">enjoyed record growth</a> in <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/socure-reports-113-percent-yoy-growth-amid-selfie-biometric-boom/">the past few months</a>, and was recently <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/capital-one-investment-brings-socure-valuation-76202102/">valued at $1.3 billion</a> after a Capital One investment.</p>

<p>Identity proofing and authentication specialist Imagewa<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometric-identity-specialist-imageware-release-q3-update-nov-23rd-110901/">re</a> and mobile access technology company Alutel Mobility have announced a partnership that will see the integration of Imageware’s biometric authentication capabilities into Alutel’s AMS Suite 6.0 solutions.</p>



  



<p>The introduction of biometrics into Alutel’s solutions — which specialize in mobile access control technologies, mustering, visitor management, document control, and corporate cafeteria management — means that a photo of an individual who is registered in AMS Suite 6.0 will then be compared against a captured live image of the same individual when entering or leaving a facility. </p>



<p>Imageware’s Biometric Engine will look to match the biometric data from both images, which will then allow AMS Suite 6.0 to either allow or deny access to the individual based on the results of the match.</p>



<p>“Customer requirements, environments, and situations all change, and our technology must adapt to these changes,” said&nbsp;Michel Grudzien, CEO of Alutel Mobility. “Authentication via facial&nbsp;recognition will increase&nbsp;security when verifying and facilitating&nbsp;access in open environments where fixed systems (such as turnstiles or gates) cannot be implemented.&nbsp;This functionality also allows access without physical items&nbsp;that people must have, such as cards or even telephones, that in an&nbsp;emergency can become an obstacle to&nbsp;validation.”</p>



<p>Additionally, due to its on-device biometric matching with continuous syncing to a cloud-based database, this combined solution will allow for biometric access control and authentication even when local systems are offline.</p>



<p>“Imageware and Alutel have worked very closely together to design a system that will be secure in any environment: with network connection or even offline, leveraging biometrics and AI at the edge,” said AJ Naddell, Imageware SVP of Product Management &amp; Sales. “Alutel’s market leading mobile access control solution paired with top NIST-rated biometric algorithms delivered through Imageware’s patented Biometric Engine will help increase security for customers across multiple locations, including airports, ports, office buildings, mines, refineries, production plants, public transportation, and several others. We are already working together on a number of domestic opportunities in&nbsp;the United States.”</p>



<p>The news of the partnership caps off a busy month for Imageware that included the announcement of a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/tech5-partnership-nets-imageware-new-customer-709131/">strategic relationship with TECH5</a>, and an appearance at the Advance 2021 Conference&nbsp;organized by the California Peace Officers’ Association, <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/imageware-showcases-law-enforcement-solutions-california-peace-officers-conference-092202/">where it demonstrated</a> some of its solutions aimed at the law enforcement community.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nec.com/">NEC</a> has bested the competition in the NIST’s latest Iris Exchange (IREX) 10 evaluation. The company ranked first in the ongoing benchmark test, after previously achieving the top spot in a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/nec-iris-most-accurate-nist-testing-504275/">prior IREX test back in 2018</a>.</p>



  



<p>The news solidifies NEC’s position as one of the world’s top developers of biometric technology. The repeat IREX ranking demonstrates that the company can deliver a consistent and high-level performance over an extended period of time, and that NEC has continued to improve its technology in the intervening years. In that regard, NEC noted that its current iris recognition algorithm does a better job of handling low-quality images, which has in turn led to a significant reduction in the error rate observed in earlier versions of the technology.</p>



<p>The IREX score also shows that NEC has a truly multimodal portfolio. The company’s facial recognition algorithm placed first in a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/nec-once-again-reaches-top-of-nist-leaderboard-708241/">NIST Facial Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT) back in August</a>.</p>



<p>For its part, NEC is planning to combine the two technologies to provide multimodal authentication and access control. Face and iris recognition are both contactless modalities, so a solution that blends the two can offer a high degree of security while still eliminating shared touchpoints during the pandemic. They also offer a more streamlined user experience, insofar as iris recognition can be used in a <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/nec-biometric-payments-tokyo-607085/">walkthrough access control solution</a>.</p>



<p>NEC believes that its face and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/nec-brings-biometric-art-exhibit-sxsw/">iris tech</a> will have a number of different applications, including industrial access, clean room access, and in-store retail payments. The company is already using the technology to manage employee entry at its own headquarters, while a payment system is being demoed at a retail outlet in Tokyo.</p>



<p>The iris recognition algorithm, meanwhile, was 99.59 percent accurate when matching in the 1:N identification scenario looked at in the IREX 10 evaluation. The test dataset included images of both eyes for a sample group of approximately 500,000 individuals.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gnani.ai/">Gnani.ai</a> is making a play in the voice recognition space with the release of its new armour365 solution. The company is based in Bangalore, India, and armour365 is a voice biometrics software offering that can be used for authentication and fraud prevention across a range of voice channels.</p>



  



<p>According to Gnani.ai, armour365 has an equal error rate lower than two percent, and needs less than two seconds to verify the identity of an individual based on their vocal characteristics. It also comes with a slew of fraud prevention features, including replay attack detection and anti-spoofing technology. The company is pitching the solution <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/pindrop-report-details-impact-covid-19-call-centers-050104/">primarily to contact centers</a> and the financial sector, but believes that it has additional applications in healthcare, defense, and other industries.</p>



<p>In each case, armour365 can be used to enable a more streamlined user experience for people who need to authenticate themselves in voice channels. The solution runs through an API, and can be fully integrated with software offerings from many of the world’s leading contact center technology providers. Customers that choose to deploy armour365 will be able to do so with minimal coding, and without a dedicated device interface. Gnani.ai, meanwhile, plans to market armour365 on platforms that list cloud solutions to make it more accessible.</p>



<p>“With a response time of &lt;500 milliseconds, armour365 has been engineered to help IT and security teams to replace error-prone and legacy authentication methods like PINs and passwords to realize the potential of Voice Biometrics being truly contactless,” said Gnani.ai Co-founder and CEO Ganesh Gopalan.</p>



<p>“We’re confident our customers will benefit immensely with this ‘low-cost and no-code solution’ built to offer reliable voice security,” added Co-founder and CTO Ananth Nagaraj.</p>



<p>Gnani.ai will be looking to capture a portion of a burgeoning voice recognition market. Meticulous Research has predicted that it will hit <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-news-meticulous-forecasts-26-8-billion-speech-voice-recognition-market-020705/">$26.8 billion by 2025</a>, while Grand View Research expects it to hit <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/speech-voice-recognition-market-report-506046/">$31.83 billion in that same period</a>.</p>

<p>The East Japan Railway Co. (JR East) is scaling back a facial recognition surveillance program that was installed over the summer. The cameras were installed at JR East stations and on its trains in July, ahead of the now-completed Olympic and Paralympic Games in Tokyo.</p>



  



<p>In that regard, the cameras were deployed to <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biometrics-other-safety-measures-will-ensure-olympics-are-not-cancelled-official/">boost security during the event</a>. The cameras gave JR East operators the ability to track suspicious individuals loitering in their stations, and to identify suspects already wanted in relation to criminal activity.</p>



<p>The system could also be used to track ex-cons who had been released from prison, and it’s that last utility that drew the ire of privacy advocates. In response, JR East has announced that parolees will no longer be added to the watchlist that it is tracking with facial recognition.</p>



<p>JR East had initially received information about recent parolees from the Public Prosecutors Office, through a notification program that alerts venue managers when someone who has committed a serious crime at their location has been released from prison (the Office also notifies the victims of those crimes). Therefore, the ex-cons being monitored by JR East had committed crimes at the company’s stations or on its trains.</p>



<p>However, critics outside the company argued that the tool was needlessly invasive, and encroached on the privacy of those parolees as free citizens. JR East now seems to agree, and will no longer be tracking released prisoners in its stations.</p>



<p>JR East is not the only transit provider that has adopted facial recognition. <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/indian-railways-installs-ntechlab-facial-recognition-system-708304/">Indian Railways has installed roughly 500 cameras</a> with NtechLab technology at 30 stations in Gujarat and Maharashtra, while local police have <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/german-authorities-facial-recognition-406122/">trialed similar systems in Berlin</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/south-wales-police-facial-recognition-soccer-stadium-train-station-404275/">Cardiff</a>. New York’s Metropolitan Transit Authority had also planned to test cameras in subway cars, but scrapped the project (<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/new-york-fails-major-facial-recognition-test/">at least for now</a>) after its provider was <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/mta-halts-surveillance-camera-pilot-over-china-links-facial-recognition-concerns-042803/">linked to the Chinese government</a>.</p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>This episode features a live recording of an <a href="https://www.meetup.com/indicio-identity-community/events/280323809/">Indicio community event</a>. </p>
<p>Digital Wallets are taking off! OS operators such as Apple are starting to support open standards for digital credentials (<a href="https://spec.smarthealth.cards/">here</a>). Technology disruptors (like the companies represented in this episode) are taking wallet solutions to market (<a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-digital-wallet/">here</a>).</p>
<p>This objective of this discussion is not to take a deep dive from a technical perspective, but more from an adoption standpoint.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This image was taken from a presentation on Digital Trust. If you’re looking for a better framing on SSI and Digital Trust, we wrote an article to hopefully help you better articulate it <a href="https://northernblock.io/introduction-to-digital-trust/">right here</a>.</p>

 Distributed Agency, Distributed Care <p>This piece was authored by a member of the Dark Matter Labs team based in the UK as part of the #BeyondtheRules project and, as such, is written in British English and has particular references to contexts in the&nbsp;UK.</p><p>This blog was written in September 2021 and reflects our learning at that&nbsp;time.</p> Our Context <p>In a context of climate breakdown and technological disruption, Dark Matter Labs works to accelerate societal transition towards collective care, shared agency, long-termism and interconnectedness. We focus on the dark matter — the invisible structures responsible for producing the majority of the world around us, from policy and regulation to finance and data, governance and democratic participation, organisational culture and identity. What we seek to build in the wider world we look to create at a smaller scale in how we organise together.</p><p>Our context as an organisation, and from which the learning that we share here is anchored, is largely defined by&nbsp;being:</p>  A platform for shared&nbsp;missions  Focused on discovery and&nbsp;learning  International with a planetary view  Primarily virtual  Evolving constantly  <p>See <a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-e59e4f5dd32f">blog 1</a> in this series for more information on our context and current structure.</p><p>A distribution of agency is a defining feature of how we organise and this blog aims to explore that in detail. When I use the term ‘agency’ here I mean the distribution of power and of autonomy and also the correlating responsibility, accountability and risk-holding that sit alongside them (for a deeper exploration on these elements and how they sit alongside each other see <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/beyondtherules-balanced-governance-and-behaving-well-everywhere-every-day-5aa852b4843e">this blog</a>). We will&nbsp;cover:</p>  Our system of self-management  Legal and financial risk&nbsp;holding  Accountability  Decision-making and community organising  The relevance of&nbsp;pay  <p>We have found that a system of distributed agency unchecked can also have a propensity to compound existing inequalities in a system (and/or create potential harm), and we look to counteract this with a platform of deep care, security and safety that underpins our work together. We will explore what this looks like in the areas&nbsp;of:</p>  Care as a foundation for our&nbsp;work  Self-management of time and minimum&nbsp;rest  Distributed acts of&nbsp;care  Training and Structural support  Clean feedback   Self-management <p>DML as a self-managed organism. For us this means that each of us takes responsibility for our agency in the system — our agency is not predetermined by a position or&nbsp;‘rank’.</p><p>When it comes to our roles and responsibilities, these are not our job ‘title’ but more like a hand of cards that we hold at any time and that regularly may change (see more on this in blog 2 to this series). We can choose to change these, whilst we ensure that the responsibilities are handed over to someone who is also happy to take them&nbsp;on.</p><p>The scope of each of our work varies per person — some may be focusing on the scope of a project, some on a series of projects, some at the scope of a mission and some at the scope of the whole organism of DM. As such, we do not consider that there is no hierarchy, but rather a dynamic hierarchy that is dependent on what makes sense for individuals and the wider system at any given&nbsp;time.</p><p>We each have the autonomy to decide how a piece of work that we hold/steward is done (whatever its scope) within the parameters of the shared mission that we have, the agreements that we make to each other and any contractual terms. We all hold/steward different pieces of work with a range of scope and negotiate with each other how they fit together.</p><p>Some hold clearer roles to drive forward improvements to how our shared operational system works and are more likely to lead this, although anyone can craft and propose changes/directions into our shared system (and shift into these&nbsp;roles).</p><p>High autonomy and high choice are balanced with the responsibility that each of us hold for what we propose and accountability for our work. This means — among many things — taking on workload, exposing our reputations, showing up when things go wrong, explaining our decisions, accepting failures. Genuinely stepping into this agency requires each of us to show up and face reality head-on, and that can be emotionally difficult and mentally demanding, compared to having a bounded responsibility within a system where blame can be passed up the chain. We notice that this way can also be much more effective, rewarding and liberating.</p><p>Our bandwidth to take on the emotionally and/or mentally demanding aspects of high agency is naturally influenced by the situations that we are each in at that time and the structural conditions that affect them. We have learned that choice alone as a system to determine personal agency is one that readily compounds existing structural and personal inequalities and privileges.</p><p>At an organisational level, we cannot redress the structural impact of a socioeconomic system. We can, however, aim to embed our shared platform within a culture of deep care, which nourishes people to step into their full agency (whatever that means to them, including the boundaries they put to that) and seeks to counteract underlying imbalances.</p> Legal and financial risk&nbsp;holding <p>A system cannot thrive where power and autonomy are distributed but risk-holding is concentrated. And yet, when it comes to legal and financial risk-holding, our methods to distribute this are heavily constrained by the external rules of the systems that we sit in, such&nbsp;as:</p>  The legal companies through which we operate require Directors who take on the legal responsibilities of company records and accounts, with the risk of being fined, prosecuted or disqualified if not completed fully or correctly.  Some banking systems will only allow banking access for companies with Persons of Significant Control  Loans may require signatories to agree to take on the financial liabilities of the&nbsp;lending  <p>In traditional hierarchies, the people holding these risks normally also have the decision-making power to control the company, and they are both responsible and accountable for the company&nbsp;risks.</p><p>We seek to fully comply with the rules of the system whilst also being true to the principles of how we organise. We currently organise around this as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Directorships are held by ‘legal stewards’ who hold the official risks of a DM company (or companies, when more than one) as one of their roles. They have the minimum powers that they need to fulfil their legal duties as Directors, such as to veto any large decision that might expose them personally to significant risk as Directors or contradict their duties (we have not yet faced such a scenario but might one day), without playing a control function for the&nbsp;company.  Day-to-day decision-making is held by people across the ecosystem, and de facto risk holding is shared as much as possible to not create unnecessary risk liabilities on the legal stewards.  <p>Let’s take the example of financial cash flow risk to illustrate what this looks like in practice. Normally in a small not-for-profit the executive team might make a plan in the case of cash flow risk, and it’s not uncommon for them to temporarily forfeit payments if it were needed during a cash flow crisis to ensure that others are paid. Distributed risk management at DM means that in a cash flow risk scenario:</p>  an approach and decisions for cash flow management are made by a finance group who can decide on behalf of the whole following sense-making with the full&nbsp;team  The shouldering of financial implications is distributed more widely across the system among those who nominate themselves to hold more&nbsp;risk  <p>For example, when we recently faced an issue following a large receivable falling overdue — impacting our payments for a number of weeks — the Finance Holder at DM called an (optional to attend) All-Hands meeting to lay-out the situation and our options to the whole team, and to invite shared approaches. On that occasion, a proposal was made, evolved live and collectively agreed upon, whereby an absolutely no pressure invitation was made to anyone who would be happy to provide a 0% interest loan for a short fixed period of time. By the end of the day, 6 loans were made for 3 weeks which brought all of our outgoing payments back on track. There was a lot of care in the specific details of how this was structured and communicated — including the emphasis on only offering where someone was comfortable to do so; the non-glorification of loan-making; the details of the loans and loan-makers kept anonymous. These loans were all fully repaid on banking the overdue receivable invoice and the feedback from the teams across DM around this process was notably positive.</p> Accountability <p>As explored by Ebrahim and Weisband in Global Accountabilities: Participation, Pluralism, and Public Ethics (2007), in a ‘principal-agent’ view of accountability, accountability involves individuals or groups reporting to a recognised authority(ies) to justify their behaviour, be scrutinised, and the possibility for a penalty to be imposed. Its core components include transparency, justification, compliance and sanctions, with the capacity for sanctions being an important part of retributive justice. This approach requires there to be an agreed relationship between power-wielders and those holding them accountable, and a shared understanding of the standards of behaviour that they are accountable to.</p><p>Without a hierarchical vertical structure of power in a system, the embedded binaries of power-wielder and accountability-holder make less sense. When our work is based on relationships of care, the capacity for punitive retribution becomes much less of a&nbsp;concern.</p><p>We are starting to put together a draft thesis on what accountability means for us, although we still have much more work to do on this. So far, we recognise that our accountability sits at various&nbsp;layers:</p>  Accountability to ourselves (what we choose to commit our time to, our families, needs, passions)  Accountability to each other (in caring for each other and distributing governance fairly between us and following up on things that we committed to)  Accountability to our shared missions (to whether the way we set our intention and spend our time brings us collectively towards the missions that we&nbsp;share)  Accountability to the living world (to the choices that we make and how these affect the human and non-human world that we are in balance&nbsp;with)  Accountability to future generations (to the human and non-human populations of the future who are impacted by the choices that we make&nbsp;now)  <p>These show up in many different ways:</p>  Part of the embedded training for the team is around setting your personal boundaries and learning to hold them, holding yourself accountable to your needs. People at DM have manifested this in various ways such as personal and self-declared time tracking followed by an analysis of time spent which is declared to the&nbsp;team.  Our clean feedback processes allow us to raise issues of accountability to each other directly, with&nbsp;care.  We are each accountable for our decisions and approaches, and Working Out Loud (see <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dml-2-4-ef87a1e466c">blog 2</a> on this) helps to make that transparent  Where there are ongoing issues with accountability from someone in the team that is beyond a 1:1 relationship, a team can be invited to support a process of more structured wider feedback to explore together where a misalignment lies.  Our projects have project-holders, contract holders and budget holders who are considering deadlines, taking care that we meet terms and keeping on track financially. These are roles that people hold (for now), not their identity or their rank. They can hand these responsibilities over or evolve them, according to what makes the most sense for them and the system. They hold any accountability needs of partners, funders and others with whom we work around our shared performance and compliance, where&nbsp;needed.  Our legal stewards hold accountability for the overall progress of each respective company.  <p>Being self-managed does not mean ignoring accountability or risk in a system. Rather, accountabilities and risks align to the scope of responsibility, power and autonomy in our roles (with higher or lower degrees in different roles); and that these roles are cards that we hold at any given time, and can&nbsp;change.</p><p>We still have a lot of work to reimagine what accountability means for us in detail, and to embed more deeply into our work. We hope to bring in place intentional structures and processes for this in the coming 6&nbsp;months.</p> Decision-making &amp; community organising <p>Making decisions in a self-managed organism might sound like one of the trickier areas to get right, and in some ways it is (particularly when this way of working is less familiar), and in other ways it can also be very&nbsp;natural.</p><p>It’s a bit like making decisions within a family setting wherein the person who — say — handles the cleaning wouldn’t ask for advice or permission each time they clean a surface, although they might check for objections before they throw paperwork in the bin, and if they wanted to hire a cleaner there would be a discussion together before going ahead, weighing up the options and finding the best approach. These options of advice, consent, co-sensing &amp; consensus play out organisationally in similar ways. Most day-to-day decisions (clean a surface) with relatively minor implications are taken by the people closest to the questions — that might mean one person takes a decision, or that they take advice from others close to the question and then make a decision. They would declare these decisions if they are significant, and others would have the chance to object if they expressly disagree. Feedback can also be given through the clean feedback method so that issues or disagreements can be discussed directly.</p><p>Decisions with a medium level of impact would start involving more of a community organising approach.</p><p>For example, the decision of setting up a new international payroll system affects many people and affects our shared finances. We start by researching the options, speaking to providers, finding out services that they do, don’t provide, costs, ease of use, process etc. This allows us to gather an overview of the options available and their potential impacts. We then speak to the people that those options might impact (those holding responsibility for parts of the delivery, or responsible for finances who would need to factor in costs) and gather their insights. We then find out how many people it would impact and in what ways — reaching out to those individuals (via a survey, or directly, as appropriate). We gather all of this information together and work out options in terms of an approach — we would weigh these up against the kind of world that we want to bring into being. We would then invite all of those affected/all interested or the whole team and present all of the findings. At this point, depending on the specifics, we might use one of a few approaches:</p>  Propose an approach using a process such as Percolab’s <a href="https://medium.com/percolab-droplets/generative-decision-making-process-cf0b131c5ac4">Generative Decision-Making</a>, if there were a clear favourable option on the table,&nbsp;or  Ask for opinions across a sliding spectrum, with comments, if there is not an obvious best approach. We would ask people about their fields of tolerance to find where the least contested option&nbsp;is.  <p>This would either give us a way forward (in the former) or a shared direction (in the latter) that the responsibility-holder can take forward to implement.</p><p>Decisions that are more complex and affect us all more deeply normally involve a co-sensing approach. This might involve facilitated discussions from space holders to explore the topic in detail, wherein we can get a better feeling of the question by listening to different perspectives to it, hearing how different people experience it, and exploring all its connections together so that we can get a shared sense of the interconnectivity of the question. At that point we may be able to progress with a process of consent rather than consensus — rarely do we feel that we need to all agree on what the best decision is, as long as it is within all of our realms of tolerance. However, in some cases where people would be deeply affected (a change in purpose, say) we would agree by consensus.</p><p>Making these methods clear and legible to assist people to navigate DM is work that we still need to&nbsp;execute.</p> The relevance of&nbsp;pay <p>Our pay formula — decoupled from rank or role (see more on this in blog 1 to this series) — is an important foundation for our system of self-management, distributed decision-making and moving roles. It means that people can genuinely choose and agree upon their roles, projects and responsibilities in any given scenario based on what makes the most sense, without it having an impact on their pay. This also invites them to step back (and, sometimes, get out the way of others) in decisions and situations when they might not be closest to the problem, without it creating a perceived negative implication to pay, prospects, roles etc. It frees all of us to take up less space as much as it does&nbsp;more.</p><p>Despite various flaws in its current form, it inherently incentivises us to collaborate, care and be effective rather than to compete for positions or resources and thus is an important foundation for this way of&nbsp;working.</p> A platform of&nbsp;care <p>When we recognise that people are creative, caring beings who want to commit their time to things they care about and do so in a way that improves our shared conditions, our preoccupation comes not with how we can control them but how we can care for them in a way that enables them to do&nbsp;this.</p><p>This might&nbsp;mean:</p>  Structurally creating space for the other commitments that are important to each of us (see e.g. self-management of&nbsp;time)  Inviting each other to improve and grow, particularly where we might have habits or behaviours that can cause harm (see e.g. clean feedback)  Recognising that each of us has barriers, traumas, enablers in our routes to this, and may need care as we work through them (see e.g. training and structural support)  ‘Seeing’ each other and the labour and care that we put into this (See e.g. clean feedback)  <p>Our work at DM is uncertain and complex and invites us to think daily about some of the existential questions that we face. It invites us to inspect what influences how we show up, such as what triggers us in our work relationships and where those triggers might stem&nbsp;from.</p><p>This might be coupled with challenging situations in other areas of our lives, and not forgetting the last 20 months amid a pandemic, which for many of us has had huge implications including on mental&nbsp;health.</p><p>If there is anything important in how we show up together, it’s the care, understanding, mutual support and realness with how we do&nbsp;it.</p> Self-management of time and minimum&nbsp;rest <p>The ability for each of us to manage our own time — including our working schedules and also our time off — is a foundation part of&nbsp;this.</p>  Our holiday policy is currently structured with a minimum holiday per year and no maximum. It invites each of us to take the rest that we need and to structure it in ways that work for&nbsp;us  Each of us is able to set our working schedule according to what we need to be effective (there are no ‘core mandatory hours’, for example, and people might fluctuate between 9–5, ‘oxford hours’ with a long afternoon break, a mix of day and night working, or indeed whatever hours work for them, ensuring it is viable for their work and&nbsp;teams)  <p>This invites us to create a balance in our lives that enables our creativity and ensures that we have rest. It also fundamentally recognises that we are all caring and decent adults who know best what we need and who want to do well by each&nbsp;other.</p><p>This is certainly evident from how this policy works in practice, Despite an unlimited holiday policy, our main collective challenge is in people take the minimum amount of time off to properly&nbsp;rest.</p><p>Since autonomy is also deeply linked to responsibility, for many people at DM their commitment and care to the missions mean that taking time off can seem to be at the cost of not doing work to the quality that we want to, or leaving colleagues with high workloads. Cultural norms also play a role in the rest we take, where some cultures embrace long periods rest and others revere ongoing&nbsp;work.</p><p>Active peer encouragement helps but we have found is not enough to create equity in rest, and we are currently exploring measures to ensure that enough rest can be a genuine option for everyone at DM, such as by bringing in two periods (in summer and winter) a year where we actively discourage work to be scheduled so that the team can more easily plan holidays, and rewording of the policy so that the invitation to take holiday particularly speaks to people who have not been accustomed to this as a&nbsp;norm.</p> Distributed acts of&nbsp;care <p>As a group of people who generally recognise the importance of care for each other, people who are struggling are likely to be spotted and supported by those who interact most with them. This support might mean helping them to take time off, sending thoughtful gifts or offering to talk through matters or distribute workloads. We recently decided collectively to create a common pool care pot of funds, which everyone can access to use to spend on other team members whenever they spot someone needing&nbsp;support.</p><p>These acts are valuable and important, although alone do not address the deeper care and structural support that we may&nbsp;need.</p> Training and Structural support <p>A year ago we brought on a specialist coach and trainer who provides a range of training and group coaching around some of the key capabilities for self-management and agile teams. This includes:</p>  Clean language and clean&nbsp;feedback  Learning from&nbsp;emotions  Creating and holding boundaries/limits  Time management  Choosing and noticing attention  <p>This training has been fundamental in helping us as a group of individuals to practice some of the behaviours and habits that come with a self-managed and agile way of working, particularly among many of us who may have worked in very different structures.</p><p>We have noticed that our shared spaces of reflection (weekly optional meetings for shared reflection) quite often hold space where people surface some of the deeper personal experiences or organisational dynamics they see and/or are sat with. Yet, we are currently lacking the triage and follow up support to link what people experience to group process work, coaching, therapy, practical needs or funding for the above for them to directly access this. We are currently putting an approach in place to this, and in August we signed off together a budget that will fund some of this provision. We welcome examples of how others have found ways to approach this as we work out how to structure this&nbsp;well.</p> Clean Feedback Screenshot of our shared Notion page with Clean Feedback&nbsp;guidance<p>Without managers, we still need processes for feedback and recognition. Providing clean feedback to each other — particularly after a potential misunderstanding or misalignment — becomes of the most caring acts that we can&nbsp;do.</p><p>Following Caitlin Walker’s conception of clean feedback in her book “From Contempt to Curiosity”, the biggest difference between regular and clean feedback is that the latter is designed/ prompted in a way that helps separate out what actually happened from what you are making up about that event and from the impact it is having. It also enables you to be specific in your feedback and put the growth of the receiver&nbsp;first.</p><p>This is made possible through a very simple structure for your feedback: 1. Evidence — what you saw or heard 2. Inference — the meaning you made of what you saw or heard 3. Impact — the effect it had on a situation or on&nbsp;you</p><p>We follow Brene Brown’s (from Dare to Lead) 10 signs of being in the right headspace to give feedback to know when the time is&nbsp;right.</p><p>Alongside the training courses that are run to help us to learn how to use this technique:</p>  We have a Clean Feedback page that details the intention, process and tools for&nbsp;it  There is a group of people who are available to help pairs or groups to use this technique with each other if they need additional support  <p>The act of sitting with a colleague in a space of respect and inviting them to improve is truly powerful, and can also be emotionally demanding. Clean feedback allows us to make time to recognise and truly see each other, our intentions, our labour and effort, even when the reason for the conversation may have been conflict. We are all learning, at a different pace and progress, how to use these techniques well to improve the quality of our relationships, and we all make mistakes along the&nbsp;way.</p><p>In blog 4, we will look at how we organise as a team to build organisational infrastructure and the impact that our way of organising has on our ability to do our work. We will look at how it feels to work in this&nbsp;way.</p><p>If you would like to receive updates (every few weeks/months) about the #BeyondtheRules project you can do so via <a href="https://dark-matter-labs.typeform.com/to/jpm8rdp1?typeform-source=provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">this short form</a>.

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the seventh interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/hackteen">Hamzat</a>, administrator of our <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">English Community</a>.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I heard about Ontology in the early days from online blockchain communities. I subscribed to the Ontology newsletter and the rest is&nbsp;history.</p><p>What attracted me to the project was its novel approach to making digital identity easy to prevent data theft, abuse etc., even before news about GDPR and Cambridge Analytica surfaced. So, the foresight of the team alone was sufficient to make me want to get involved.</p> 2. What made you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>Ontology was of interest to me owing to its novel consensus approach, solution to data theft and privacy and lastly, building a future proof digital identity framework that could stand the test of time. Helping others to understand Ontology’s mission and vision is the reason I became a supporter and champion of its&nbsp;brand.</p> 3. What do you see as the key role of a Harbinger? What is your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>Being able to communicate or share information about developments in the Ontology ecosystem, helping people learn about Ontology, solving their issues (<a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a>, staking, and general knowledge) while providing feedback are my key roles as a Harbinger. My favorite part is the ability to help others and seeing them&nbsp;grow.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>Ontology has a very big mission and vision to accomplish as regards building a future proof digital identity framework that can stand the test of time. Ontology achieving this milestone and more is the reason I am supporting the&nbsp;project.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities, is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>Ontology has created a niche for itself, being a fairly distributed token project with a novel consensus mechanism. Aside from that, Ontology has support for over 30 languages/local communities working together with the mission of building a truly future proof decentralized identity framework.</p> 6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>My key communication channels for engagement are Telegram and Twitter. Though Ontology has a community and sub-communities with respect to different languages on Telegram, Reddit, Discord, YouTube, WeChat, and Kakao. Overall, <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a> makes it easy to communicate and manage group activities as well as resolve issues. I would like Ontology to do more Twitter threads, which will call for engagement and feedback when explaining newly launched products, integration or implementation.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>The community being unapologetic, ready to help, also most are selfless. That alone is a memorable moment for the community. Lastly, the Ontology team is very innovative. My advice to people wanting to become a Harbinger is that they should be selfless and helpful to&nbsp;others.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Educational, unique and innovative.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>Ontology, as a blockchain startup, has grown over the years and has achieved many important milestones and partnerships with other blockchains. Worth mentioning, is the provision of their novel DID protocol for use on Binance Smart Chain and also the Welcome Home app for&nbsp;Daimler.</p><p>There is room for improvement in the area of marketing and communication. We have a good product to showcase but marketing is important for widespread acceptance and adoption. Twitter threads can help explain new products, updates, implementations or integrations, and feedback from the community, which positively impacts the project both short and medium long&nbsp;term.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>As stated above, integration with Binance Smart Chain is a huge one that could open doors with other projects to integrate Ontology’s decentralized identity framework. So, the community understanding Ontology’s mission and vision is very important, as it will help in educating others and thereby impacting their lives in a positive&nbsp;way.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>This week’s release brings few developer-facing features, but it’s a big one in terms of performance. Holochain v0.0.107 is set to unleash an explosion of progress for the HoloPort Alpha Program.</p> V0.0.107 is for Holo hosting <p>Even though we’ve released a number of Holochain versions with plenty of features and fixes, the version on the HoloPorts is over three months old. That’s mainly because we <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-gets-some-parts-upgrades/#lmdb-to-sqlite-the-road-to-infinite-scalability">switched to a new database engine called SQLite</a>. This change held long-term promise for making Holochain infinitely scalable via sharding, but in the short term performance was much <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-pulse-94-when-signup-goes-wrong/">slower</a> than the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/a-new-holochain-developer-release/#seen-in-dev-team-land-upcoming-initiatives">previous database engine, LMDB</a>. The Holo team decided it would make an unacceptable experience for Elemental Chat testers, so they decided to stay with the LMDB version until the SQLite version could match its speed.</p><p>I’m excited to share that the SQLite version is now even faster, more efficient, more stable, and more reliable than the LMDB version. The dev team has recently made optimisations and bug fixes to the database layer and gossiping, and data is now getting stored and gossiped faster, while HoloPorts can comfortably host more users per machine.</p><blockquote>“I'm also getting really good results. We easily pass LMDB parity targets.”<br>— Alastair Ong, Holo engineer, after running Elemental Chat stress tests on Holochain v0.0.107</blockquote><p>After chatting with Alastair, I learned that <a href="https://twitter.com/H_O_L_O_/status/1437908801135554561">every performance benchmark has been surpassed</a>: some are slightly better, while others are orders of magnitude better. One Elemental Chat benchmark, designed to measure the time it took for all agents to reach consistency, went from a hefty 10.23 minutes to a tiny 36 seconds (a 17× improvement). These performance gains come with significantly reduced resource consumption; another test was able to host seven times more agents on the same hardware.</p><p>(And we suspect that things are even better than that — perhaps up to 100× better for some metrics. The main bottleneck now appears to be our <a href="https://github.com/holochain/tryorama">testing framework</a>, not Holochain itself.)</p><p>Now that the Holo team can move to this version, they’ll update Elemental Chat and the Holo suite of apps to take advantage of it. Service Logger, Holo Hosting App, HoloFuel, the HoloPort registration flow, and the client/host connection components will get features and fixes that have been planned for a while.</p><p>And it also means we can start inviting more hosts and Elemental Chat testers to participate — which paves the way for the <a href="https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/the-holoport-alpha-program-f35324ba367d">HoloPort Alpha Program</a>! If you’re a HoloPort owner, <a href="https://forum.holo.host/t/holoport-alpha-program-registration-general-info/3687">here are the instructions</a> for registering in the program.</p> v0.0.107 Is for the Dev Camp <p>You may have <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/dev-camp-8-starts-in-two-weeks/#dev-camp-8-huge-turnout-exciting-curriculum">heard the news</a> that the community-led Dev Camp 8 starts next week. In order to support the Dev Camp, we wanted a fairly stable version of Holochain so that participants have a good experience. This release comes after a lot of improvements, so we’re confident that it’s a good baseline for them to start building on.</p><p>Of course, there will be weekly Holochain releases throughout the Dev Camp, so it’ll keep getting more solid. We intend to keep updating participants about breaking changes and new features</p> Holochain v0.0.107 changelog   Relaxed chain top ordering properly merged (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/985">#985</a>): This feature was scheduled for last release, but an incomplete merge caused it to be non-functional.  Only one agent full-sync (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/978">#978</a>): This interim fix allows a conductor hosting multiple agents in the same DHT (such as a Holo host) to only involve one of their agents in DHT syncing, which reduces gossip traffic dramatically in full-sync DHTs. This feature is behind the configuration parameter <code>network.tuning_params.gossip_single_storage_arc_per_space</code>, and is disabled by default. Native Holochain installations are unlikely to benefit from it. (Holo hosts, on the other hand, see up to a 50× increase in the number of cells they can comfortably handle.)  Fix SQLite connection parameters (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/978">#978</a>): These fixes resulted in big speedups for HDD-based HoloPorts and should be helpful for native Holochain installations too. As part of these fixes, you can tune the durability of writes with the configuration parameter <code>db_sync_mode</code>, which mirrors SQLite’s <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous"><code>synchronous</code></a> flag.  Web happ bundle helpers (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/991">#991</a>): These internal fixes help the upcoming <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher">Holochain Launcher</a> manage installed hApps more easily.   Dev Camp excitement building <p>Well, even though I’m not a developer (at least not anymore), I thought I might help out with Dev Camp. So I’ve been privileged to listen to the back-room conversations of the organisers and support team, and they’re getting really excited! With 1500 applicants, it’s been a bit overwhelming, but they’ve changed the format in ways that will support everyone better.</p><p>The Holochain community stretches the globe, so it’s appropriate that the Dev Camp is shifting to support people who aren’t in the ideal time zone. Although the sessions will favour people in the Europe, Middle East, and African time zones, they’ll be recorded, and there will also be live support sessions for the Americas and Asia-Pacific. And there will also be a dedicated Discord server for anytime conversation — both among participants, and from support volunteers. And lastly, the Dev Camp section of the forum will be there for more lengthy discussions.</p><p>The app you’ll be building, called Tragedy of the Holocommons, is a turn-based game in which players try to consume natural resources cooperatively without causing them to collapse. It will exercise and grow your understanding of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency">eventual consistency</a> (a very important concept in hApp design), <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/6_crud_actions/">CRUD chains</a>, <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/5_links_anchors/">links, anchors</a>, <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/9_signals/">signals</a> and more in a format that lets you learn with your peers and gain wisdom from experienced developers.</p><p>Each Dev Camp is hosted by a slightly different team of community members. It takes a lot of work, a lot of care and time, to organise something this big, and they're doing it all for free. It’s truly a labour of love, and I want to thank the current team Nastasia, Alex, Tim, Guillem, Hedayat, Lily, Peter, Tats, Sid, and the many other contributors for everything they’re doing.</p> Still time to register! <p>But it starts next week, so do hurry! It’s free, the curriculum sounds really fun, and it’s got a great crew of leaders, facilitators, teachers, and mentors. It’ll last six weeks (with a break in the middle), with weekly live sessions for Europe time zones and support sessions for Asia-Pacific and the Americas. There’ll also be a Discord server where you can talk with participants and the support team any time you like. Now <a href="https://holochain.org/dev-camp">go and sign up</a>!</p> Holochain In Action: Composability in the real world <p>During today’s AMA, the <a href="https://youtu.be/G9Q05C-Gv6A?t=2676">conversation turned to composability</a>. The developers among you are familiar with that term, but for those of you who aren’t, it means “the ability to easily glue chunks of software together to make new things”.</p><p>Why do we care about this? Highly composable software modules, which try to do only one thing and do it well, can unleash an explosion of creativity among the developers who find them and start playing with them.</p><p>It sounds like a good way to build software, doesn’t it? We think so too, and so do many of the developers who build with Holochain.</p><blockquote>“The composability of a Holochain application is a very fundamental thing about it, so [during Dev Camp] we will cover the architectural things that follow from it: how do you build applications differently, knowing that they can be composed from so many different parts?”<br>—Nastasia Emelianova, Dev Camp 8 lead organiser</blockquote><blockquote>“This is one of those features or capacities of the framework that stands to accelerate what’s possible in app development. [Knowing that Dev Camp will get that out] in a way that’s intelligible [to developers] early enough so that they’re not doing it the hard way, but actually learning from the get-go, that you can lean on the expertise of others and the things that others built — that’s what I’m super excited about.”<br>—Mary Camacho, Holo executive director</blockquote><p>The latest Holochain In Action session, number 18, takes a deeper look at the <a href="https://github.com/eyss/elemental-chess">Elemental Chess</a> hApp. This time it looks at how the app is actually just a collection of composable modules — <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/profiles">profiles</a> to allow players to give themselves human-readable names, <a href="https://github.com/eyss/invitations">invitations</a> to allow them to invite each other to a game, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/elemental-chat/tree/develop/crates/joining_code">joining_code</a> to manage access to game spaces, and <a href="https://github.com/eyss/hc-turn-based-game">hc_turn_based_game</a> which is the engine that powers the games. On top of this are a zome that actually <a href="https://github.com/eyss/elemental-chess/tree/main/dna/zomes/chess">implements the rules of chess</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/eyss/elemental-chess/tree/main/ui">UI</a> that brings it all together.</p><p>Their exploration of hc_turn_based_game shows the power of composability — when all the heavy bits are already built, it becomes quick and easy to build a new game. They’ve already done tic-tac-toe, and I hear they’re working on Elemental Go (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)">game</a>, not the <a href="https://golang.org/">programming language</a>) next.</p> Subscribe to blog posts by email! <p>Yeah, it’s kind of old-fashioned, but email newsletters are also kind of cool again.

 “Our v9.4 was built entirely in-house by our incredibly talented development team, and provides the best possible experience for our customers and their users in this new digital identity frontier.” – Kevin Alan Tussy, CEO, FaceTec 



  



<p><a href="https://www.facetec.com/">FaceTec</a> has enhanced its biometric SDK platform with new capabilities, giving developers the chance to build even more secure and functional identity verification solutions.</p>



<p>The company is renowned as one of the leading providers of biometric identity solutions. With selfie onboarding and face-based authentication enjoying booming popularity, <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facetec-q2-revenues-jump-293-year-over-year-080503/">FaceTec stands out</a> thanks in part to its 3D face mapping technology, which delivers superior imaging and biometric recognition in comparison to the many 2D solutions on the market.</p>



<p>Now, FaceTec is looking to help developers working with its biometric solution to create even better end products with its enhanced Software Development Kit.</p>



<p>One of the biggest new features of version 9.4 is support for NFC chip scanning. Among other things, this will enable mobile identity solutions to read the data on ePassports featuring embedded chips and other such smart identity documents. The SDK also now supports barcode scanning, further enhancing the ability of developed products to interface with other documents.</p>



<p>The other big new feature is Optical Character Recognition (OCR), allowing mobile identity apps to read the text information on the photo IDs they scan. The SDK offers OCR language support for Latin, Cyrillic, and version 9.4 adds Arabic. In addition to allowing customers to easily create their own ID OCR templates, the FaceTec OCR Template Creator already supports more than 500 existing official photo IDs.</p>



<p>Beyond that FaceTec says the SDK offers faster and smarter auto-capture of photo IDs, and improved stability in the 3D FaceScan and ID Scan processes.</p>



<p>In a statement announcing the upgrade, FaceTec CEO Kevin Alan Tussy emphasized the SDK’s utility in the emerging mobile ID space. The past few years have seen the emergence of digital identity solutions designed to create mobile-based versions of official identity documents, with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/apple-confirms-biometric-onboarding-mobile-id-79032021/">Apple having recently revealed</a> that it plans to launch its own mobile driver’s license and state ID solution as early as this year.</p>



<p>“With the emergence of digital ID documents and mobile driver licenses (mDLs), we will all have the option to use our mobile devices as our official IDs quite soon,” said Tussy. “And while, of course, we want that convenience, to make the process secure we need to ensure that only the legitimate person can possess that Digital ID by authenticating them as the correct human user. Our v9.4 was built entirely in-house by our incredibly talented development team, and provides the best possible experience for our customers and their users in this new digital identity frontier.”</p>



<p>The new features of version 9.4 of the SDK platform are now available for free to all existing FaceTec customers.</p>

<p>Another Chinese card manufacturer is developing a cold wallet with a fingerprint sensor from <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/idex-sensors-used-goldpac-digital-wallet-73202101/">IDEX Biometrics</a>. The Cold Wallet Visual Payment Card is geared toward China’s Digital Currency/Electronic Payment (DC/EP) scheme, and will allow cardholders to authorize digital payments with fingerprint authentication. &nbsp;</p>



  



<p>The company making the Cold Wallet Visual Payment Card is the Union Smart Card Co., which is based in Shenzhen. Once completed, the wallet will reach the public through partnerships with six major Chinese banks, all of which are collaborating with Union Smart to create an offering that fulfills the objectives of the DC/EP program.</p>



<p>In that regard, the card will have Bluetooth and NFC capabilities, and will feature a keypad and a display that make the card more user-friendly. The wallet will also have extra storage space, and will be manufactured through a cold sealing process. The goal is to deliver a comprehensive digital currency product that can support payments both online and in-person.</p>



<p>According to IDEX, the cold wallet will raise DC/EP inclusion because it will serve as a physical alternative to mobile wallets and allow people who do not have a smartphone to participate in the digital currency scheme. China has indicated that it wants to be the first major economy to move to a <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/mastercard-offers-full-support-digital-currency-in-bahamas-022607/">digital currency</a> environment, and is planning to roll out the DC/EP program in time for the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022.</p>



<p>“The central bank intends to provide inclusive, easy-to-use, digital central bank currency for all people, and this product will be particularly effective in serving the needs of those in rural areas and underserved groups,” said Union Smart CEO Jiang Kai. “Our new&nbsp;Cold Wallet Visual Payment Card&nbsp;is the most complete and easy-to-use cold wallet solution available.”</p>



<p>“We are pleased to be partnered with Union Smart in the development of this device, which should expand secure and convenient access to the DC/EP initiative across China,” added IDEX CEO Vince Graziani.</p>



<p>IDEX sensors have already been featured in DC/EP wallets from the <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/idex-sensors-used-goldpac-digital-wallet-73202101/">Goldpac Group</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idexs-trustedbio-sensor-appear-chutian-dragons-chinese-digital-currency-wallet-050606/">Chutian Dragon</a>. <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/another-new-customer-opts-idex-sensors-secure-experimental-digital-rmb-wallets-061802/">China Construction Bank</a> and the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idex-provides-fingerprint-sensor-chinese-digital-currency-trial-021607/">Postal Savings Bank of China</a> have also used IDEX tech in hardware wallets for the country’s Renminbi digital currency.</p>

<p>The Illinois First District Appellate Court has issued a ruling that sets clearer guidelines for <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/trio-tech-giants-latest-on-receiving-end-bipa-cases-071704/">those filing a civil suit</a> under the Biometric Information Privacy Act. The ruling comes from a three-judge panel in Chicago, and specifically concerns a dispute between the Black Horse Carriers trucking company and a pair of former Black Horse drivers.</p>



  



<p>The drivers had filed their initial suit in 2019, alleging that Black Horse had violated BIPA by gathering and storing their fingerprint data without the proper consent. They also accused Black Horse of unlawfully sharing that biometric data with a third party timekeeping company.</p>



<p>For its part, Black Horse moved to dismiss the case on procedural grounds. BIPA does not provide a statute of limitations for biometric cases, and instead refers to the existing Illinois Code of Civil Procedure. That code lays out a one-year statute of limitations for issues of slander, libel, and unlawful privacy disclosures, and a five-year statute of limitations for all other civil matters.</p>



<p>Black Horse claimed that the plaintiff’s complaint was moot because it described an unlawful disclosure violation, and detailed actions that occurred more than a year before the suit was filed. A state judge disagreed with that assessment, and applied the full five-year statute of limitations to the case.</p>



<p>The appellate court, on the other hand, decided to split the difference. The judges ruled that Black Horse’s sharing of information with the timekeeping company met the legal definition of publication as a private communication between two parties, and was therefore subject to the one-year statute of limitations. However, they said that the same was not true of the consent and data retention violations, which was more of an internal transgression.</p>



<p>In doing so, they settled one of the primary procedural debates of the BIPA era. Plaintiffs have five years to bring a legal action against a company that unlawfully collects or stores biometric data, and one year to bring a suit against a company that simply shares data improperly. The Black Horse plaintiffs, meanwhile, can now move forward with that part of their case.</p>



<p>The ruling comes shortly after a separate District Court decision that determined that <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/judge-rules-bipa-protections-extend-products-built-with-ill-gained-biometric-data-041909/">BIPA laws still apply to products</a> built with biometric data, even if a company is not selling the data itself. BIPA lawsuits have led to several major settlements in the past year, with <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/tiktok-reaches-92-million-settlement-bipa-lawsuit-022605/">TikTok</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/facebook-returns-increased-settlement-bipa-case-072301/">Facebook</a> agreeing to pay $92 and $650 million in class action lawsuits, respectively. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is trying to use facial recognition to identify people crossing in a vehicle at a US land border. To that end, the organization is piloting an expanded Simplified Arrival system at the Anzalduas International Bridge Port of Entry in Texas.</p>



  



<p>The Simplified Arrival program uses facial recognition to match a traveler to an image (such as a passport or visa photo) being stored in a Department of Homeland Security database. The program has <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/cbps-biometric-screening-system-lands-honolulu-airport-050701/">already been deployed at air</a>, sea, and land ports of entry all over the country, but has thus far been restricted to the pedestrian lanes at land border crossings.</p>



<p>The new pilot program will use facial recognition cameras in vehicle lanes to take a photo of every single person sitting in the car. Those photos will then be cross-referenced with the Simplified Arrival database to speed up the screening process and help border agents make a clearance decision when the car gets to the gate.</p>



<p>The cameras will only be installed at two vehicle lanes during the pilot. Those lanes will be clearly marked, so drivers will be able to choose another lane and opt out of the facial recognition scan if they do not want to participate in the pilot. Those that do so will still need to submit their travel documents to an agent for a standard check.</p>



<p>At the moment, CBP is not sure how well the system will perform when applied to people in cars. The pilot will run for 120 days, at which point CBP will evaluate the system and plan its next steps accordingly. The agency will specifically be looking at the quality of the images captured with the system, and its ability to match those images to a face on file.</p>



<p>As always, images of US citizens will be deleted after 12 hours, while those of foreign nationals will be stored indefinitely. Simplified Arrival has recently been installed at pedestrian crossings at land borders in <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/cbp-brings-simplified-arrival-calexico-land-border-022501/">California</a>, <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/simplified-arrival-debuts-douglas-naco-land-borders-arizona-030202/">Arizona</a>, and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/cbp-brings-biometric-border-control-to-washington-land-crossings-707022/">Washington state</a>.</p>

<p>The European Parliament has addressed the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/european-commission-drafts-restrictions-on-ai-biometrics/">European Commission’s draft proposal</a> for a new Artificial Intelligence Act, which was released in April. The new Parliament report comes courtesy of the agency’s Policy Department for Citizens’ Rights and Constitutional Affairs, and suggests that the law does not do enough to ensure the ethical use of AI-powered public identification systems.</p>



  



<p>With that in mind, the report goes on to argue for the inclusion of several amendments that would more strictly limit the use of AI technologies. Most notably, Parliament asked legislators to ban the use of surveillance systems in private homes and workspaces, and called for periodic reviews of the list of banned practices as new technologies emerge. It also pushed for a new section that provides more detail about those restricted applications.</p>



<p>In that regard, the report expressed particular concern about remote identification systems that can identify members of the public in real time. That includes biometric identification systems that use technologies like face or gait recognition. The original Commission draft prevents the police from using a real time surveillance network, but does allow law enforcement and border agents to use facial recognition to investigate serious crimes.</p>



<p>The Parliament report seems to ask the Commission to close some of those loopholes, or to at least provide more clarity about what is and is not allowed. In doing so, the report calls for greater transparency about how biometric systems are used, how conclusions are reached, and what kinds of technologies are admissible in court. Those provisions could <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/council-europe-asks-countries-prohibit-face-based-profiling-technology-012904/">prevent organizations from using biometric inferences</a> while making certain kinds of decisions.</p>



<p>Parliament also wants the Commission to provide clearer definitions for biometric inferences and biometric data. Finally, the report requested new guidelines for automated consent management procedures to make it easier (and safer) for people to opt into biometric applications and services should they so wish to do so.</p>



<p>The broader goal is to ensure that any AI systems that do get used in Europe do not infringe on the civil liberties of the European public. Parliament backed the Commission’s efforts to regulate AI technologies, but felt that more rigor was needed to achieve those ends. As a result, Parliament’s report echoes statements from the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/european-watchdogs-push-stricter-facial-recognition-ban-062103/">European Data Protection Board</a> and the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/european-data-protection-supervisor-calls-full-facial-recognition-ban-042705/">European Data Protection Supervisor</a>, both of which have argued that the Commission’s original draft proposal is too lax on the subject of facial recognition.</p>

<p>The first on-chain decentralized exchange on Solana with permissioned access based on digital identity, Solrise DEX Pro, launches today.</p>



<p>LONDON and SAN FRANCISCO (Sept. 23, 2021) — <a href="https://solrise.finance/">Solrise Finance</a>, a Solana-based decentralized investment platform, and Civic Technologies, a leading innovator in digital identity solutions, have partnered to launch the first on-chain decentralized exchange on Solana with permissioned access based on digital identity. With growing regulatory scrutiny, a permissioned DEX sets the stage for more checks and balances within the DeFi ecosystem.</p>



<p>“This is our way of bridging the world of institutions to DeFi without resorting to centralization, thanks to Civic,” said Filip Dragoslavic, Co-Founder of Solrise. “With Solana already being the most familiar DeFi ecosystem for traditional finance, we expect to become one of the primary hubs for institutions that wish to jump into the ecosystem.”</p>



<p>The new DEX, named Solrise DEX Pro, is built on Project Serum, an on-chain decentralized exchange that utilizes Solana’s throughput to offer a traditional order book experience. Civic Pass, Civic’s identity verification for DeFi or any dApp, and Solrise DEX Pro together create a permissioned environment that is more suitable for institutional players. Solrise DEX Pro will receive support from one of the largest digital asset firms in the space, Alameda Research, a key investor in the Solana ecosystem. The firm will be providing initial liquidity for the DEX as well as ongoing support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though permissionless access is considered a core principle of DeFi, the concept is often at odds with the goals of large capital allocators. These institutional investors would like to participate in the DeFi ecosystem, but must meet specific regulatory requirements in order to do so. The introduction of Solrise DEX Pro allows the Civic and Solrise teams to create a parallel ecosystem for institutional players, which are able to tap into the larger ecosystem of Solana on-chain liquidity, while staying in a familiar and permissioned environment. The platform is designed to complement existing permissionless DeFi structures rather than to replace them.</p>



<p>“A permissioned DEX paves the way for more participants in the DeFi ecosystem, including institutional investment,” said Chris Hart, CEO of Civic. “We’re building technology that thoughtfully protects individuals, their digital identities and our new financial systems. In Solrise, we’ve found a partner that shares our values and is working with us to set a higher standard that will ultimately benefit the broader industry.”</p>



<p>Civic provides a KYC solution, through Civic Pass, that a dApp provider can use as an input to their compliance program. Solrise DEX Pro uses Civic Pass to determine which participants meet their rigorous standards for verification prior to allowing them the ability to trade. From Solrise DEX Pro, users are guided to use Civic’s identity verification technology solution. Once the user has completed the Civic Pass screening process, Solrise DEX Pro will use the results of the screening to allow trades on the DEX.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Investors may use <a href="http://dex.solrise.finance">Solrise DEX Pro</a> immediately and also <a href="https://youtu.be/k5AbYcKlBKo">watch a demo</a>. The DEX is available to qualified users, which excludes users in the United States and sanctioned countries.</p>

 Interview Introduction <p>In the installment of the XTZ.News “Tezos Dev Series”, <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/">Gravity</a> offers a Q&amp;A with our Lead Engineer, François&nbsp;Guérin.</p><p>In this Q&amp;A, François shares his insights on the Tezos ecosystem and his experience developing Gravity’s decentralized identity protocol on&nbsp;Tezos.</p><p>François, can you start off with a short intro about yourself and your work at&nbsp;Gravity?</p><p>I’ve been the Lead Engineer at Gravity for the last two and a half years. After getting a Master’s degree in Math, Computer Science and Cryptography, my first experience with blockchain was as the Blockchain Tech Lead at Aubay France, where I implemented a private blockchain within a compliant document certification application.</p><p>Now, I manage the technical team at Gravity, which includes an IT Development Manager and Frontend Developer. At Gravity, we leverage blockchain technology to build trusted digital identities.</p><p>Users and small businesses leverage Gravity to safely share their personal data to access services such as financing, humanitarian aid, employment, and government services. International organizations and institutions use Gravity to efficiently collect verifiable data for improved service delivery, interoperability and&nbsp;impact.</p><p>As the Lead Developer, a big part of my role is to build Gravity’s decentralized identity protocol and blockchain architecture on&nbsp;Tezos.</p><p>I’ve also worked to deploy a decentralized credential repository and have Gravity’s decentralized identity protocol recognized by W3C standards as a <a href="https://twitter.com/gravityID_earth/status/1382325329277124608?s=20">W3C decentralized identity verifiable credentials standards implementation</a>, ensuring that our protocol is more scalable, standardized and transparent.</p><p>Why are you interested in blockchain?</p><p>I like that with blockchain, there’s a direct application of my studies with this intersection of math, cryptography and computer&nbsp;science.</p><p>Blockchain is also a technology that’s still somewhat “new” for a lot of people, and it’s constantly evolving. I like that there’s a lot that you can learn from and bring to the blockchain tech community.</p><p>What has been your experience developing on&nbsp;Tezos?</p><p>With Tezos, it’s really exciting as an engineer to be challenged to innovate and develop in a space that’s always evolving and growing. I have experience with smart contract development using Michelson, the native language for smart contracts.</p><p>I’ve also had the chance to implement Gravity’s own version of the <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/gravity-glossary/#gravity-protocol">Tezos DID Method</a> and <a href="https://www.gravity.earth/gravity-glossary/#gravity-protocol">DID Manager</a>, which are key components of our decentralized identity protocol on&nbsp;Tezos.</p><p>A DID Method is the mechanism by which a particular type of decentralized identifier (DID) and its associated DID document are created, resolved, updated and deactivated.</p><p>The Tezos DID Method specifies how Tezos can be used for DID creation and management, compatible with the issuance, storage, and verification of Verifiable Credentials. DID Managers are smart contracts on the Tezos blockchain that implement the Tezos DID method’s specific on-chain functionalities.</p><p>What tools do you&nbsp;like?</p><p>Personally, I like spoons. No, but really, I like Taquito. Each Tezos node exposes an http API so we can access them. Taquito wraps an http client in order to access the http API in a more convenient way.</p><p>What do you find most valuable about developing on Tezos compared to other blockchains?</p><p>I think the Tezos ecosystem’s focus on formal verification of smart contracts and on-chain governance is extremely important. And compared to Ethereum and Bitcoin, Tezos is cheaper, more efficient and better for the environment. Because Tezos is a liquid-proof of stake protocol, it also consumes less resources than the proof of work of other blockchains.</p><p>For me, elliptic curves are something that you don’t typically see as a developer. As someone with a math background, I see the importance of having a strong cryptographic mechanism, which Tezos offers. Because the language is extremely cryptic, it also allows developers to have greater control over what we’re developing.</p><p>What Tezos projects are you most excited&nbsp;about?</p><p>Everything is interesting, but I really like TZIP-16! It’s powerful, and you can have what we call “views functions” attribute getters and meta-data. It’s not only the smart contract, you also have this upper layer that allows you to have off-chain data.</p><p>It was great when I worked to integrate Gravity with the TZIP-16 standard. With this <a href="https://twitter.com/gravityID_earth/status/1374401827664400395?s=20">TZIP-16 implementation</a>, now we can provide off-chain metadata during the resolution of DID Documents from&nbsp;DIDs.</p><p>What do you hope to see from the Tezos ecosystem in the&nbsp;future?</p><p>If something like OpenTimestamps appears on Tezos, it would be really exciting!</p><p>What’s on the horizon for&nbsp;Gravity?</p><p>Most people know about Gravity’s work with organisations like the UNDP Turkey, the Kenya Red Cross and the DIGID Project consortium of NGOs to leverage decentralized identity for improved humanitarian action (check out the <a href="https://medium.com/gravity-earth">latest case studies on our Medium blog</a> to learn&nbsp;more).</p><p>As we continue to deepen our work in the humanitarian space, Gravity is also focusing on building out our supply chain finance (SCF) use case. In fact, we just <a href="https://youtu.be/AhiKZUa__5o">released a new video</a> to share how our digital ID solutions for supply chain financing work.</p><p>The idea is that our SCF solution builds trust among financial service providers, merchants and suppliers to unlock greater financing opportunities for all stakeholders.</p><p>Our tech team is really excited to be developing this solution, which uses decentralized ID and blockchain technology to enable small business merchants to create trusted financial identities using digital ID wallets that can give them access to affordable working capital and help them grow their businesses.</p><p>As an engineer, it’s awesome to keep building technology that can be leveraged for different real-world use cases and have such a big impact on people’s everyday&nbsp;lives!</p><p>To learn more about Gravity, follow us&nbsp;today!</p><p>Gravity is an ID2020-certified digital ID solution that empowers individuals, international organisations, and governments to create trusted decentralized identities that are private, portable, and persistent.</p><p>Our vision is to build human-centered digital ID solutions for easy, transparent, and secure data sharing for all people, anywhere in the world.

			<p>Luxembourg, 23rd September — Tokeny Solutions has announced the recognition of the T-REX protocol as ERC3643. The open source suite of smart contracts enables the issuance, management and transfer of permissioned tokens and is already used by large financial institutions to tokenize real-world assets.</p>
<p>The Ethereum community has officially merged the T-REX protocol in its GitHub repository of EIPs as ERC3643, making it an official standard for permissioned tokens. The ERC3643 allows actors in capital markets to interact with DeFi and the broader digital assets market in full compliance.</p>
<p>Amidst its continued explosion in growth this year, regulatory bodies around the world are getting ready to clamp down on the DeFi space. According to DeFi Pulse, in the first half of 2021, the total value locked (TVL) in the space by users grew from $25bn to $70bn, almost 180%. With this in mind, the space has now firmly caught the attention of regulators, and their focus will be turned to any actor not following regulatory obligations.</p>
<p>The ERC3643 allows actors wishing to interact with digital assets to ensure their activities remain compliant with global regulatory requirements. Since its inception in 2018, the standard has been used to issue security tokens worth over $8.5 across in 180+ jurisdictions via the T-REX platform. It does this through the use of permissioned tokens and digital identities, i.e. tokens that can only be sent or received based on the verified credentials of investors.</p>
<p>These tokens are fully controllable by their issuer and can be recovered even if the private key of the wallet holding them is lost, as the ownership of the assets is guaranteed by digital identity. In the same way, the ERC3643 can represent cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fiat currencies and NFTs to ensure compliance and ownership for both investors and responsible entities.</p>
<p>ERC3643 is compatible with the well-known ERC20 standard, enabling interoperability with any wallet of the Ethereum ecosystem. Also, it can be deployed on any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchains, sidechains and Layer 2 solutions. Concerning security, the standard has been audited and confirmed by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky. Meanwhile, the ERC3643 is licensed under CC0 1.0, allowing developers and companies to contribute, copy, modify, distribute and develop the standard.</p>

		 
	 
    It’s been more than three years since we started the development of the T-REX security token protocol. We are extremely excited that the interface has been recognized as ERC3643 and merged into the EIP repository on GitHub. It is now the go-to standard for those issuing security tokens on public blockchains.  Joachim LebrunHead of Innovation at Tokeny Solutions       As the DeFi space continues to grow in both size and also maturity, the need for compliance will continue to rise in importance. Investors need protection, and issuers need to know who they are dealing with, and this is exactly what the ERC3643 does. We’re delighted to take this role in the industry, and continue to build the space’s credibility by allowing actors to remain compliant.  Luc FalempinCEO at Tokeny Solutions

<p>Introduction: The Amalgamation Of Democratic Governance Within AERGO: Pikkle’s Purpose And How It&nbsp;Works</p>Pikkle Is The First Blockchain Based Voting And Global Viewer Participation Platform Built On&nbsp;AERGO<p>It is evident that the democratic process hasn’t been perfected since its inception in ancient India and ancient Athens and it is time for that to finally change 2500 years since its inception. With innovations in immutable and transparent technology, brought on by the blockchain, we as a society have the opportunity to revolutionize the democratic process to promote an equitable environment for egalitarian populism. On the AERGO blockchain exists a voting platform that has been utilized by the Korean Broadcasters Association, an institution that has existed since 1974 with over 40 members of the organization nationwide in South Korea. Pikkle aims to solve numerous issues that plague the democratic process which include: cost inefficacy, voter targeting and fraudulent ballot counts. Pikkle has also identified a major dilemma that has only existed for the last 20 years, with the advent of social media where internet titans can easily manipulate and influence voter participation for the political intent of the platform itself. Pikkle aims to solve that stagnation of democracy and resuscitate the virtue of democratic egalitarianism.</p><p>Pikkle operates in a seamless manner where individuals who aren’t adept in the realm of blockchain can utilize this application without even realizing it operates on a blockchain. Pikkle collects users views and assists in their decision making through an app service instead of the traditional cold calling and electioneering paradigms that have persisted in the 20th century into the 21st. Through the immutable and transparent technology known as blockchain, in this case, AERGO, Pikkle aims to prevent stakeholders and platform titans from interfering or manipulating voters; its main vision is to create an equitable environment for all participants. This holds true to the value of its name “Pikkle” a direct amalgamation of the two works “Pick” and “People.”</p><p>Data Analysis: Pikkle In Action: AERGO’S Promotion Of The Democratic Process</p>Blockchain Is The Next Step In The Democratic Process And Through Analysis, We Can See This In Action With&nbsp;Pikkle<p>Democracy cannot truly be tested for equity without its fair share of data analyst on the basis of actual egalitarian populism through actual elections. At AERGO and Blocko, it is evident that these sister companies understood well that “so-called experts” were not making fair evaluations on the basis of social media cultural voting. It is evident that internet decisions are based on the cultural and political bias’s of the platform itself, and in recent years, many social media platforms, specifically Twitter and Facebook, have been accused of politically drawn motives in the last three American elections. Pikkle resolves such a notion with a dynamic solution: make it impossible for votes to be tampered with by recording all voting results in real-time on the AERGO public blockchain (not private) while simultaneously eliminating high costs of voting that can incur when consolidating government entities and ballot counters, promoting monetary and equitable efficiency. Now the main question is, although all of this sounds incredible, has it been used and proven effective as an application, and the simple answer is, yes, absolutely, numerous times within the Seoul Drama Awards hosted in South&nbsp;Korea.</p><p>Data Analysis Continued: The Ceremonial Events That Utilized Pikkle: The Democratic Voting Paradigm Of The&nbsp;Future</p>Did You Know That Pikkle Has Been Utilized In One Of The Most Prominent Media Events In Asia, Specifically South&nbsp;Korea?<p>Talk is cheap, and action creates value and vision, and Pikkle does just that. Pikkle was utilized in the Seoul Drama Awards that had a widespread affect throughout South Korea and into neighboring nations as well and it is important to highlight the importance and wide-spread participation that this event created. It is incumbent to realize the immense amount of votes that incurred that Pikkle has created in in just a short amount of time since its inception and you will be shocked with the amount of total votes that occurred with Pikkle. I’m sure you’re curious to see the numbers, and we will get there shortly I&nbsp;promise!</p><p>Pikkle is a world-wide phenomenon that isn’t exclusive to AERGO’S country of origin, South Korea and has garnered a foothold in not only East Asia, but South East Asia as well. The Seoul Drama Awards Korean Drama Award was a celebration of the Best Male and Female Actors, the Best Picture and the Best Theme Song. This was a South Korean event and proves the point that Pikkle has a dominant foothold in its home nation as a blockchain alternative to traditional voting mechanisms. The Korean Broadcasting Awards Popularity Award highlighted the Best Entertainment, Actor and Singer Category and the Korean Broadcasting Grand Prize For Best Picture surrounding Variety TV, Entertainment TV, Music Composition TV and Drama TV also utilized Pikkle! Pikkle was also utilized in the 48th Annual Korea Broadcasting Award Show! On the main website, you can see at the top that it specifies, through the utilization of Pikkle “Who will win the Popularity Award at the 48th Broadcasting Awards, vote right&nbsp;now.”</p><p>The 48th Annual Korea Broadcasting Award Show and the awards thereof are the most prestigious in the entirety of the entertainment industry in South Korea; did you know that the South Korean President himself directly announces the opening speech for the ceremony. This is a massive feat that cannot be overstated. This event has created a newly established popularity award section to be awarded by the general public beginning this year! BTS, also known as the BTS who has associated and worked with prominent DJs such as Steve Aoki. Fun fact, the BTS have sold over 20 million albums and is the best selling artist in Korean history and have been named in the “Top 100 People In The World.” They have been featured on TIME Magazine and have received numerous awards such as six American Music Awards, nine Billboard Music Awards, 24 Golden Disk Awards, and nominations for a Grammy! BTS became the youngest ever recipients of the Order of Cultural Merit award from the President of South Korea due to their contributions in spreading Korean culture. BTS specified, that they were so moved by the new Popularity Award that they said “I heard that the Popularity Award was made for the first time at this awards ceremony, and I'm grateful that I'm the first winner.” Kim Sun-ho a Korean Actor best known for his work in the television series “Start-Up” and Kim So-hyun who became the youngest actress to achieve the most followers at her age, approximately 10.1 million followers were also presenters as well! Now how does Pikkle play into this prestigious event, well, Pikkle was used in the voting for the newly created Popularity Award and also, directly influenced its inception as a category of&nbsp;award!</p><p>Participation In The Democratic Process: The Totality Of Users Under&nbsp;Pikkle</p>Sometimes I Ponder, With The Immense Amount Of Numbers I Am About To Convey, How AERGO Hasn’t Shaken Hands With The Statue Of&nbsp;Liberty<p>Data analysis that was collected in this study on Pikkle’s awareness and utility was on the basis of regional information. The event had a staggering amount of users spanning five different nations from East and Southeast Asia. In totality, the Seoul Drama Awards Asia Star Award garnered over 2.5 million votes, basically 1 million more than the residential population of Manhattan. Of the tallied information, approximately 12,396 votes were cast from Taiwan, 2,700 from Indonesia, 136,443 from China, 18,735 from Japan and 2,323,077 million from Thailand. That is already 2,493,351 votes spanning five nations, an outstanding feat of regional importance! The Seoul Drama Awards Korean Drama Award garnered 625,269 votes for Best Male Actor, 834,630 votes for Best Female Actor, 583,212 votes for Best Picture and 1,627,728 votes for Best Theme Song. This event brought in 3,670,839 votes. To add to the prestige of these numbers, Pikkle was also utilized in the Korea Broadcasting Awards Show, specifically in the newly formed Popularity Award! The Korean Broadcasting Awards Popularity Award garnered 127,059 for Best Entertainer, 553,437 for Best Actor, and 1,118,006 in the Best Singer Category. Do the math my friends, that’s another 1,868,006 votes! Lastly, the Korean Broadcasting Awards For Best Picture brought in 3,418 votes for Variety TV, 2,594 for Entertainment TV, 1,177 for Music Composition TV, and 4,547 votes for Drama TV. A total of 11,736 votes were cast. TNow do the math, in total, Pikkle enabled 8,044,428 votes, a staggering feat!</p><p>The Affect On The AERGO Mainnet: No Problem At&nbsp;All!</p>The AERGO Blockchain Handled These Events Like A Champion!<p>During the event, a total sum of 2.7 million transactions occurred on AERGO during the voting period, which is the largest number of cases in which the AERGO blockchain has been utilized. This data proves that AERGO can withstand over 200,000 transactions a day and 3 events per second. In large-scale of things, specifically surrounding the real-time voting that occurred resulting from these events, where records are lost due to a large number of concurrent viewers, the AERGO mainnet blockchain had stable data processing without any loss whatsoever even in cases with up to 70,000 concurrent users, 16 awards at 4 awards. In the category voting, a total of 8 million votes were successfully counted, and the maximum number of votes in a single category was 2.32 million; the AERGO blockchain, through these events, has proven itself as an extremely capable and effective blockchain platform that can handle hundreds of thousands of transactions per-day. There was only a slight issue that occurred due to the nature of blockchain, not because of any issue with the AERGO mainnet itself. Resulting from the immutable feature of blockchain technology, when the initial organizers requirement to involve as many users as possible were set, they could not be changed in the middle of the voting process. The AERGO team understood this greatly, and intends on utilizing this process for future voting cases to emphasize the importance of setting initial requirements before utilization.</p><p>Conclusion: Pikkle, The Future Of Democratic Function</p>Pikkle Is A Blockchain Voting Platform That Will Only Expand Its Utility In The Future So Stay&nbsp;Tuned!<p>Based on the results of the utility of this application in accordance to the amount of votes that were cast, it is evident that Pikkle has solidified its ability as a unique and expansive blockchain voting platform that is here to stay, and will only grow substantially in the future. When it comes to applications, peak user experience is necessary to cause a “peak of interest” and there are many functions in the works for Pikkle. Pikkle is not going anywhere, Blocko isn’t going anywhere and neither is AERGO and these statistics prove that&nbsp;notion.</p><p>Disclaimer: Cryptocurrency investing and gambling requires substantial risk, do not invest or gamble more than you can afford to lose!

<p>Refinements to Ocean’s access control setup for enterprise-grade use cases. Permissions enable you to restrict access to publishing and consuming in your fork of Ocean&nbsp;Market</p> 1.1 Introduction <p>A large part of Ocean is about access control, of the decentralized variety. Ocean’s baseline approach is datatokens: a consumer can access a resource (e.g. a file) by redeeming 1.0 of the datatokens for that resource. Datatokens follow the <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/">ERC20 standard</a>.</p><p>Enterprises and other users often need more precise ways to specify and manage access. Consider a medical data use case, where only an appropriately credentialed EU researcher can browse available medical datasets, or download the datasets themselves. Or what if one wanted to restrict to employees of a specific country, or consortium, region, or a combination thereof? Questions like this were often asked by our enterprise collaborators.</p><p>This means Ocean must address how to control access more precisely, at these two&nbsp;levels:</p>  Marketplace-level fine-grained permissions for browsing, publishing, etc within a marketplace frontend  Asset-level fine-grained permissions on consuming the asset&nbsp;itself  <p>Ocean now has support for&nbsp;both.</p><p>This article is organized as&nbsp;follows.</p>  The rest of Section 1 describes the high-level approaches for (1) and (2), and how they reconcile with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and datatokens  Section 2 gives details on marketplace-level fine-grained permissions  Section 3 gives details on asset-level fine-grained permissions  Section 4 concludes on fine-grained permissions   1.2. Market-Level Permissions: Overview <p>Back to the medical data use case: only an appropriately credentialed EU researcher can use the marketplace data. How to specify who can access&nbsp;it?</p><p>A first idea would be to have a list of all the “allowed” people. But this has problems. Imagine an enterprise publishing 1000 data assets, and for each asset having a list of all its employees. If someone new is hired, they’d have to update all 1000&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Fortunately, there’s a cleaner way. Access is based on a role, specified as a credential. E.g. “is an employee of x”. To continue the example above: new hires might get the credential when they join the company. Since they have the credential, they have permission. That’s it&nbsp;:) This credential-based approach is known in the data industry as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control">Role-Based Access Control</a>&nbsp;(RBAC).</p><p>For market-level permissions, Ocean implements RBAC via an “RBAC server”. It implements restrictions at the user level, based on the user’s role (credentials).</p><p>The RBAC server is run &amp; controlled by the marketplace. Therefore permissions at this level are defined by the marketplace.</p> 1.3 Asset-Level Permissions: Overview <p>Let’s go back to the medical data use case, where only an appropriately credentialed EU researcher can download the datasets themselves.</p><p>How do we handle this? There’s a&nbsp;tension:</p>  Datatokens on their own aren’t enough — it would mean that anyone with 1.0 datatokens could access that&nbsp;data.  Yet we want to retain datatokens approach since they enable Ocean users to leverage existing crypto infrastructure to get data wallets, data exchanges, data unions, and more out-of-the-box. The thousands of man-years of effort dedicated to create these crypto tools can be used directly as tools for a data ecosystem.  <p>We can resolve this tension by drawing on the following mental&nbsp;model:</p><blockquote>Imagine going to an age 18+ rock concert. You can only get in if you show both (a) your concert ticket and (b) an id showing that you’re old&nbsp;enough.</blockquote><p>We can port this model into Ocean, where (a) is a datatoken, and (b) is a credential. The datatoken is the baseline access control. It’s fungible, and something that you’ve paid for or had shared to you. It’s independent of your identity. The credential is something that’s a function of your identity or your roles in society (the RBAC&nbsp;stuff).</p><p>Ocean now supports fine-grained permissions for asset-based access control. Here’s how: a consumer can only access the resource if they have 1.0 datatokens and one of the credentials in the “allow” list of the&nbsp;DDO.</p><p>Ocean also has complementary deny functionality: if a consumer is on the “deny” list, they will not be allowed to access the resource. The rules combine as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>Access = allowed — denied.</p><p>Allowed = everyone by default, or allow list if it has&nbsp;entries.</p><p>Denied = entries in deny&nbsp;list.</p><p>Initially, the only credential supported is Ethereum public addresses. To be fair, it’s more a pointer to an individual, not a credential; but it has a low-complexity implementation so makes a good starting point. For extensibility, the Ocean metadata schema enables the specification of other types of credentials like W3C Verifiable Credentials and more. When this gets implemented, asset-level permissions will be properly RBAC&nbsp;too:)</p><p>Since asset-level permissions are in the DDO, and the DDO is controlled by the publisher, asset-level restrictions are controlled by the publisher.</p> 2. Marketplace-Level Permissions: Details  2.1 Outline <p>This feature is specifically designed to work in forks of <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">Ocean Market</a> and is not required. We have not enabled them in Ocean Market itself, to keep Ocean Market open for everyone to use. On the front end, the permissions features are easily enabled in a fork of the market by setting environment variables. On the back end, the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">RBAC server</a> can be deployed and maintained specifically for your&nbsp;project.</p><p>The primary mechanism for marketplaces to restrict their users’ ability to publish, consume, or browse is the role-based access (RBAC) control&nbsp;server.</p><p>Figure 1 shows how the market interacts with the RBAC server to validate the user's permissions. When a user connects a wallet to the market, a request is made to the RBAC server to establish if the user has permission to browse the market. The RBAC server retrieves the user’s role from the mapping in keycloak (or alternatively user-role mappings can be stored in a JSON) and then responds with “true” to the market if the user has the correct role for browsing.</p>Fig 1. The market requests permissions from the RBAC&nbsp;server<p>The RBAC server defines four different roles:</p>  Admin  Publisher  Consumer  User  <p>Admin / Publisher</p><p>Currently, both users with either the admin or publisher roles will be able to use the Market without any restrictions. They can publish, consume and browse datasets.</p><p>Consumer</p><p>A user with the consumer role is able to browse datasets, purchase them, trade datatokens and also contribute to datapools. However, they are not able to publish datasets. If they visit the publish page, they will see an error that explains they don’t have the required permission.</p>Fig 2. Viewing the market without the publish permission<p>Users</p><p>Users are able to browse and search datasets but they are not able to purchase datasets, trade datatokens, or contribute to data pools. They are also not able to publish datasets.</p>Fig 3. Viewing the market without the consume permission<p>Users without a&nbsp;role</p><p>If a user attempts to view the data market without a role, they will not be able to view or search any of the datasets.</p>Fig 4. Viewing the market without browse permission<p>No wallet connected</p><p>When the RBAC server is enabled on the market, users are required to have a wallet connected to browse the datasets.</p>Fig 5. Connecting a&nbsp;wallet 2.2 Mapping User to&nbsp;Roles <p>Currently, there are two ways that the RBAC server can be configured to map user roles to Ethereum addresses. The RBAC server is also built in such a way that it is easy for you to add your own authorization service. The two existing methods&nbsp;are:</p>  Keycloak  JSON  <p>If you already have a <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/">Keycloack</a> identity and access management server running you can configure the RBAC server to use it by adding the URL of your Keycloak server to the KEYCLOAK_URL environmental variable in the RBAC&nbsp;.env&nbsp;file.</p><p>Alternatively, if you are not already using Keycloak, the easiest way to map user roles to ethereum addresses is in a JSON object that is saved as the JSON_DATA environmental variable in the RBAC&nbsp;.env file. There is an example of the format required for this JSON object in&nbsp;.example.env</p><p>It is possible that you can configure both of these methods of mapping user roles to Ethereum Addresses. In this case, the requests to your RBAC server should specify which auth service they are using e.g. “authService”: “json” or “authService”: “keycloak”</p> 2.3 Default Auth&nbsp;service <p>Additionally, you can also set an environmental variable within the RBAC server that specifies the default authorization method that will be used e.g. DEFAULT_AUTH_SERVICE = “json”. When this variable is specified, requests sent to your RBAC server don’t need to include an authService and they will automatically use the default authorization method.</p> 2.4 Deployment <p>The RBAC server is a node.js express application and needs to be deployed specifically for your project. The easiest way to set up the RBAC server is inside a docker container, instructions for getting setup can be found in the <a href="https://market.oceanprotocol.com/">GitHub&nbsp;repo</a>.</p> 3. Asset-Level Permissions: Detail  3.1 Outline <p>Allow and deny lists are advanced features that allow publishers to control access to individual data&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Publishers can restrict assets so that they can only be accessed by approved users (allow lists) or they can restrict assets so that they can be accessed by anyone except certain users (deny&nbsp;lists).</p><p>The general idea is to have “allow” and “deny” lists in an asset’s DDO, where each entry is an Ethereum address. Ocean Provider uses this information to decide whether to give&nbsp;access.</p><p>Allow and deny lists are not enabled by default in Ocean Market. You need to edit the environmental variables to enable this feature in your fork of Ocean Market. To enable allow and deny lists add the following environmental variable to your&nbsp;.env file in your fork of Ocean Market: GATSBY_ALLOW_ADVANCED_SETTINGS=”true”.</p> 3.2 Advanced&nbsp;Settings <p>Once the advanced settings have been enabled, you will see a new “Edit advanced settings” section on the asset details page. To use allow or deny lists you need to navigate to your data asset and click on “Advanced Settings”.</p>Fig 6. Advanced&nbsp;Settings 3.3 Add address to allow&nbsp;list <p>In order to add a user to an allow or deny list, you need to first know their Ethereum address. You can then enter the address of the user into the input section and click the “ADD”&nbsp;button.</p>Fig 7. Add address to allow&nbsp;list 3.4 Removing a user from an allow or deny&nbsp;list <p>To remove a user from an allow or deny list you can click the cross next to their Ethereum&nbsp;address.</p>Fig 8. Removing a user from an allow or deny&nbsp;list 3.5 Submit changes to allow or deny&nbsp;lists <p>Any changes you make on the advanced settings page need to be submitted and signed in a transaction. To do this, first, click the “SUBMIT”&nbsp;button.</p>Fig 9. Submit changes to allow or deny&nbsp;lists 3.6 Sign Metamask transaction <p>Next, you will need to sign the transaction in Metamask, or the wallet of your choice. If you have any difficulties signing the transaction, refer to our <a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/metamask-setup/">guide on setting up Metamask</a>.</p>Fig 10. Sign Metamask transaction<p>When the process of updating the allow or deny lists is complete you will see a success&nbsp;message.</p>Fig 11. Update allow or deny list&nbsp;success 4. Conclusion <p>Ocean is a tool for decentralized access control. Its baseline approach is datatokens, where a consumer can access a resource for 1.0 datatokens.</p><p>Based on feedback from our enterprise collaborators, we have introduced functionality for more fine-grained permissions:</p>  Marketplace-level fine-grained permissions for browsing, publishing, etc within a marketplace frontend. It’s implemented via an RBAC Server. Permissions are controlled by the marketplace operator.  Asset-level fine-grained permissions on consuming the asset itself. It’s specified by the “allow” and “deny” fields in the DDO. Permissions are controlled by the publisher.  <p>Thanks to everyone who helped to contribute to this article, and especially the technology that this article describes: especially the Ocean core software team and our enterprise collaborators who have been so valuable in shaping this&nbsp;feature.</p><p>Follow Ocean Protocol on<a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol"> Twitter,</a><a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community"> Telegram</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/"> LinkedIn</a>,<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/"> Reddit</a>,<a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol"> GitHub</a> &amp;<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/newsletter/"> Newsletter</a> for project updates and announcements.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello, and thanks for joining. Today, we talk about the role of identity in financial inclusion. And for that our special guest is Amit Sharma. He has engaged in a myriad of roles that intersect financial markets, risk management, regulatory compliance, and international development. He is the Founder and CEO of FinClusive, a hybrid financial technology and regulatory technology FinTech, RegTech company dedicated to financial inclusion.</p>
<p>Prior to FinClusive, Amit worked on both the public and the private sectors, including the empowerment capital, Mitsubishi UFJ, and at the US Treasury Department first, at the inception of the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, TFI, and later as a Chief of Staff to the Deputy Secretary and advisor to Treasury’s Senior Team Under Secretary Henry Paulson.</p>
<p>Hello, Amit.</p>
<p>Amit Sharma: Hello, how are you today?</p>
<p>Oscar: Very good. It’s a pleasure talking with you, Amit.</p>
<p>Amit: It’s great to be here. Thank you for having me.</p>
<p>Oscar: Great. So Amit, let’s talk about digital identity. And of course, the first thing we want to hear from our guests is the journey. Please tell us your journey to this world of digital identity and also FinTech.</p>
<p>Amit: Sure. Thank you for that. You listed a little bit on the intro of my bio. I have had the good fortune of being in the development sector. I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Asia. I did development work in Asia as well as in South America. After the tragic events of September 2001, I had the opportunity to join the US Treasury Department, at the time at the inception of what became really a third of the department’s efforts to combat illicit finance, both the US and the global anti-money laundering financial crimes compliance space.</p>
<p>We were looking at ways to understand financial movements to go after bad guys, terrorists’ financiers, drug traffickers, organised criminals, understanding how they move money in the financial system. And secondly, trying to create defensive mechanisms so that banks, nonbank financial institutions can protect themselves and their customers from that exploitation. So, many rules and regulations were formed during that time.</p>
<p>I had the good fortune of then moving up to what’s called the front office and working with the senior team at the Treasury Department, really in the early phases of the financial and credit crisis in 2008, and working with international governments, as we thought through how to stem that crisis, and really the broader risks in that vein.</p>
<p>After four or five years at the Treasury Department, I realised as a financial regulator I wanted to get into the belly of the beast and into the global banking space, really understand it from the ground up, and I joined a global bank called Mitsubishi, Mitsubishi UFJ Securities. I was working with the heads of the global markets group, I ran the New Products division, and really saw first-hand how global banking on the commercial investment banking side really depended on a lot of outdated technology and policies and procedures. And it was really during that time that we started to see the early technology innovations a la FinTech in payments and credit, in lending, in products, in services, but also in risk and compliance – regulatory technology.</p>
<p>And as institutions started to think about how to innovate and become more modern in their technology stack, it really provided an opportunity to see where and how financial services could be brought to the masses. And it was around that time, toward the end of my time at Mitsubishi, where I joined a group of senior financial regulators, bankers, technologists. And we did a study under the Center for Global Development around de-risking and basically found that anti-money laundering and regulatory compliance growth over the course of many years really forced many financial institutions to make a false and binary choice in that they looked at certain segments of the economy: low-moderate income, global remittances, non-profit work, international correspondent banking, and how many traditional financial institutions basically said – as regulatory compliance measures grow, they were forced with this choice to include several of these segments of our economy or exclude them because either they were too high a perceived compliance risk, or unprofitable, or both, and they began to de-risk. And that was never the intention of the growth in financial regulatory compliance. Instead, we had to focus on financial inclusion.</p>
<p>And this was really the inception of FinClusive and why we founded FinClusive. Number one, the growth of more disruptive, alternative financial services products that are being brought to the marketplace, a la FinTech companies, and decentralised applications, virtual assets service providers, those in the crypto space, providing solutions that really brought financial access to products and services to that last mile, to low-moderate income, the globally underbanked, unbanked, but really small businesses and non-profits and others, including FinTech companies and crypto companies themselves being viewed by traditional banking as high compliance risk.</p>
<p>So we set out to solve that by doing two things. One, really modernising regulatory compliance because it had grown into its own sector and the average institution, whether you’re a small credit union, or a global FinTech, or a large multinational bank, we’re spending upwards of 25-30 plus percent of their operating budget on compliance. And we knew we could modernise that but change the ethos of compliance from a more exclusionary tack to a much more inclusionary tack. We didn’t have to have that false binary choice of either including those segments of the economy versus financial system integrity. We could actually create security, system integrity, consumer protection, as well as engage more segments of the economy that had been excluded or marginalised from financial services. And digital identity is central to that.</p>
<p>When we look at the billion people or more on the planet that are not born with an official identity, how do they access financial services? And highly regulated industries, like financial services, like healthcare, and others, require the ability to verify and validate those individuals, what we call traditional ‘Know Your Customer’? And so we set out to solve that broader challenge by streamlining and modernising compliance and partnering with institutions by enabling FinTech applications and regulatory technology applications to really drive a more inclusive economy. And by bringing more modern digital identity solutions to both individuals and businesses, we could provide greater access and provide the essential privacy protections, consumer protections in tandem. And that’s really what FinClusive is all about. In some ways, we’re trying to rectify a bit of the overreach from a regulatory compliance perspective that we had initiated, and really go to the intent, which is a safe and accessible and inclusive economy for all. That’s the core of FinClusive.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it’s a super interesting journey you have had, of course, from public sector, private sector. And now today, you are in the entrepreneur side, with a super important mission about financial inclusion with FinClusive, and you already started illustrating what you are doing. If we go to a broader idea about what is this role? We’re talking about this role of digital identity in financial inclusion. You mentioned already 1 billion people without IDs, it’s actually I think you are the second guests in this podcast who mentioned that, and it strikes me every time I hear that number. It’s really unbelievable. Please tell us about what is the role of digital entity in financial inclusion first of all, for the individuals.</p>
<p>Amit: Sure. On the individual side, absolutely, 1 billion people that don’t have just legitimate identity. But beyond that, many jurisdictions, many countries continue to rely on quite antiquated paper-based forms of identity, hardcopy forms of identity. And as the broader community, and I mean globally, increasingly is digitising, the digitisation of our economy, we buy more of our products and services, basic everyday needs, groceries, to paying our utility bill, to accessing education and even health services and the like online.</p>
<p>And so we need to be able to create an environment where digital forms of identity can be verified and validated. And that has been challenging, you know, the broader identity fraud landscape is pretty high. And in fact, within the financial services space, the US Federal Reserve has reported that synthetic identity fraud, in other words, fake names associated with real individual identity numbers, like personal passports and driver’s licenses and social security numbers and that like, that’s costing US financial institutions alone, over 6 billion annually. It’s one of the largest growing types of financial crime in the US and globally, certainly.</p>
<p>And so, it’s not just the 1 billion that don’t have a specific form of identity. It’s really the number of folks that do have those identity stores and you have two parts of this challenge. One, the exploitation of otherwise less secure, more antiquated forms of identity. And secondly, the digitisation of our broader economy that requires that we have digital forms of identity that both allow us to verify and validate someone is who they say they are. But then we can also ensure that when we engage in services like finance, we are in fact, knowing our customer, KYC, which is a central part of the broader regulatory compliance ambit.</p>
<p>All of the anti-money laundering requirements for banks, non-bank financial institutions, and now the growing FinTech sector, the growing crypto sector, they are obligated to know who they’re dealing with. So KYC and KYB is central to the engagement of those sectors, of those parts of the economy, of those individuals and households that struggle to obtain and maintain that access.</p>
<p>And so, this problem set extends well beyond the 1 billion people to the number of folks that have IDs that really need to be able to both protect essential privacy controls, make sure that they are not also subject to fraud, manipulation and abuse. And importantly, ensure that financial services providers, at least that’s the domain that we look at, that personal identity is also in tandem with the protection of that personal identifying information.</p>
<p>The good news is that today, we have greater technology capabilities today to enable both privacy protections, as well as access through verification and validation without that compromise. Now, what we need to do is ensure that the regulatory and legal frameworks that enable these digital identity solutions to also take hold. And these will have tremendous applications the world over from refugee crises that we are seeing growing over time in places like Latin America, Africa, Asia. We’re seeing this unfold in front of our eyes in places like Afghanistan, with the crisis there as well.</p>
<p>So whether it’s a disaster recovery, or humanitarian-related issue, or a political-related issue, corruption-related issues, these issues around digital identity as a solution to allow us to verify and validate, know who our customers and our beneficiaries are, so that we can provide access, but also engage in providing tools and services that truly financially empower those individuals. So it’s a far-reaching problem but we have greater technology today to help solve that problem than we had before.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, indeed. And it’s great to hear that the technology is here and is being used, and soon is going to be used more in services. Now, turning into the organisations, entities, companies, tell us the other side of this financial inclusion, but for the organisations.</p>
<p>Amit: Absolutely. I’m glad that you’re drawing that distinction. And you heard me reference KYB, Know Your Business. Know Your Customers, individuals, is absolutely very important. What folks sometimes tend to forget is that when we look at financial inclusion, we tend to focus on the two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half billion people and largely low-moderate income, like the global poor, as lacking access or sustainable access to financial services. But that is just scratching the layer.</p>
<p>When we really think about the access channels that really provide financial empowerment, we have to look at businesses, legal entities as well. Many small and medium enterprises equally struggle to engage in lending, in credit and other forms of basic financial services to grow their businesses. And this is hugely debilitating, because if you think about approximately 90 plus percent of global businesses are small and medium enterprises – 90 plus percent.</p>
<p>In the United States, note that in one of the richest countries in the world, 99% of all US companies are categorised as small businesses. And many of these organisations are 1, 2, 3 person entities that rely on personal credit history, personal background checks, personal financial history that enables them to access financing. And so, this is the engine of job creation in the world is small business. We have to be able to enable those organisations to access essential financial services and products to grow those businesses and thrive. So it’s a huge economic empowerment challenge in this regard.</p>
<p>Now, other legal entities are equally challenged. Non-profits and NGOs, non-governmental organisations, that are responsible for the support of many, many, many worthy humanitarian and other activities that either governments or the private sector have not been able to fill. Those NGOs and NPOs have been categorised by many financial services companies, traditional banks, as high compliance risk. And quite frankly, global regulators, the US included, have historically categorised these organisations as potentially exploitative for terrorist financing and money laundering.</p>
<p>And when you say this out into the general public, of course it puts traditional banks, who are highly regulated, under the scrutiny of these regulators to say, “Look, I don’t want to have undue scrutiny. I’d rather not do business with them at all.” And so, legal entity verification and validation, from small businesses to non-profits to even global corporate is hugely, hugely challenging. Global corporates, even with multiple what we call beneficial owners, multiple significant parties that control that organisation, there are now obligations for a financial services company to ensure that they not only know and validate the legitimacy of the organisation itself, its status and certification as a corporate entity or a small business or LLC.</p>
<p>Also, if they’re a money service business, are they appropriately registered? If they’re a FinTech company or a virtual asset service provider, do they have the appropriate licenses? Have we done the background checks of the owners of that company because they have a fiduciary responsibility? And unfortunately, legal entities themselves have been created to exploit financial services and systems, right, for these money laundering and other illicit activities. So, legal entity verification that leads to Know Your Business, KYB, is long overdue for a modernisation as well.</p>
<p>This is where we get excited about the good work that the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation is doing. We have, as you know, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/news-events/finclusive-validation-agent-gleis/" title="partnered with Ubisecure and RapidLEI and GLEIF">partnered with Ubisecure and RapidLEI and GLEIF</a> to be an issuer and <a href="https://rapidlei.com/gleif-validation-agents/">Validation Agent</a> of <a href="https://rapidlei.com/faq/what-is-a-legal-entity-identifier-lei/">Legal Entity Identifiers</a>, backed by that compliance data so that financial services all over the world can understand the legitimacy of these organisations and engage them to provide essential products and services.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as we go to an increasingly peer-to-peer financial services environment, where merchants and individuals are engaged together, where businesses are engaged directly with each other without a specific financial intermediary, reinforcing the legitimacy to each other is hugely important. And so therefore, the KYB scenarios that require digital applications for legal entity verification and validation are immensely important. And it’s a massive pain point for financial services all over the world. And both addressing the exploitation and security issues, as well as the inclusion issues for businesses themselves, will go a long way to drive ultimate economic empowerment, especially as I said earlier, that is the true engine of economic growth all over the world.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. And also one of the stats you mentioned, the 99% of the companies in the US is small business.</p>
<p>Amit: That’s right. And that’s the engine, right. The job creators aren’t the big multinational companies. The job creators are small businesses, entrepreneurs that are starting their businesses and local shops, whether they be tech-enabled, non-tech, they have to have a form of legitimacy, and it’s often on the back of one or two or three individuals to be able to create.</p>
<p>And so, legal entity verification, legal entity digital identities, are equally as important as the individual identities because they form the gateway to be able to access essential and critical financial services. It’s a larger challenge. And so when we think about financial inclusion, we tend to only think about the unbanked or traditionally poor, low-moderate income. And really the challenge is much more wide reaching when you consider legal entities like non-profits, small businesses and others.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, you have illustrated pretty well the problem in the individuals and in the organisations and how they’re very linked to each other. No surprise, of course. Please tell us now how, in particular, your company FinClusive is solving these problems.</p>
<p>Amit: So FinClusive, as you pointed out in the beginning, we’re a technology company. We look at the rapidly evolving financial services landscape, and we see some challenges, but we see them as tremendous opportunities to drive financial inclusion. There’s a growth in more decentralised alternative financial services providers out there. The growth in financial products and services is not really happening in the traditional banking sector. It’s happening in the financial technology sector, the nonbank financial institutions like crypto or virtual asset service providers, peer-to-peer applications, blockchain-enabled networks that allow individuals, households, businesses to send value via tokens or cryptographic means to each other without any intermediary involved. These have tremendously huge opportunities to drive inclusion.</p>
<p>Now, as that happens, the need to address the essential KYC and KYB elements are incredibly important. And so, we have built our technology to enable FinTech companies, money service businesses, crypto companies to effectively partner with banking institutions, because at the end of the day, if you want access to insured deposits, you have to touch a bank. If you want access to what at least is today and for the near term, the largest payment rails on the planet, wires and SWIFT transactions and the like. You need to be able to engage with the bank.</p>
<p>And so, that’s the core service that we provide. We provide that linkage between the crypto and alternative value transfer and payment spaces with the traditional payment spaces and traditional banking. Now we do that with a foundational compliance as a service platform, which effectively brings a number of best-in-class services for the anti-money laundering and regulatory compliance requirements that financial services of all types must comport with. And it has often been very piecemeal, you have one provider for Know Your Customer, another provider for document management and verification, another provider for sanction screening and background checks, another provider for reporting.</p>
<p>What we do is bring many of those capabilities in one workflow, one full stack approach that is fully API enabled so it can be plug and play to a FinTech company in Latin America, a crypto exchange in Asia, a money service business in Africa, a non-profit or crowd funding platform in Europe, or even the most traditional bank. And so, by creating that as a foundation, we believe that Compliance-as-a-Service and compliance itself can be and is critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>This is where the incorporation of modernised identity management systems is hugely important. So we have, like I said, <a href="https://www.ubisecure.com/news-events/finclusive-validation-agent-gleis/" title="partnered with Ubisecure and RapidLEI">partnered with Ubisecure and RapidLEI</a>. We’re excited about the partnership. We’re a Validation Agent and issuer that can provide Legal Entity Identifiers that are backed by full compliance data. Every individual that comes to our platform and is KYC checked is given a unique digital credential backed by their compliance data. And what that does is it protects their underlying personal identifying information, but allows the verification and validation of the requisite checks so that organisations of all types so that financial institutions and intermediaries that are engaging with each other, whether it’s peer-to-peer, or via a central intermediary, can do that verification and validation very fast, efficiently and cheaply.</p>
<p>With the LEIs, we can go even further and provide the engagement for organisations to have a legitimacy of their legal enterprise when interacting with each other. It legitimises them interacting with each other, which in an increasingly peer-to-peer world is hugely important for security and trust. And we create these enablers of trust by the implementation of the LEIs for small businesses, non-profits that are engaging many organisations for financial services and products, whether it’s payments or accounts or otherwise lending and credit products and the like, we bring that sense of legitimacy and efficiency.</p>
<p>The other piece of this that is so strong and powerful is that it brings a standardisation, a common set of standards help bring common understanding, both between those organisations that need that legitimacy, and it reinforces the commercial and personal engagements, especially when we are interacting in a financial or economic money transfer way – that requires trust. So LEI is truly help enable the trust between those counterparties and enable the verification, validation and security elements when multiple financial services providers are engaged, where they can say “Yes, I can verify and validate that that organisation is completely legitimate, that the compliance elements, the Know Your Business and Know Your Customer elements are verified, and that my extension of products and services are now going to – number one, the intended parties, but number two are going securely to those that had been verified and validated.”</p>
<p>So that’s how we have incorporated the Validation Agent program. We’re excited about the ongoing modernisation of verified Legal Entity Identifiers as well, where we can provide those digital credentials so that organisations of all types can engage with the global financial services economy, wherever located in ways that are both secure, and verifying for their own engagement between each other. That’s what’s exciting.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it sounds really exciting. And again, in one of the explanations you just gave that let’s say one of your customers, one FinTech, one organisation that wants to have the checks, they have so many different checks, given by different providers, traditionally some of them might be even manual so it’s, of course, the value proposition that you are offering now, sounds super solid. And plus, the addition of the LEIs in this workflow sounds super solid in what we need.</p>
<p>Amit: Well, absolutely. And I’ll say the excitement about this is that this is a long time coming. And I think now we have the technology to enable this environment in ways that we didn’t 5, 10 plus years ago. Remember that highly regulated industries are bound by the laws that the particular regulator must provide. And when doing so, we need to remember that highly regulated industries like financial services, like healthcare, like education, are bound by laws in that jurisdiction and identity management is equally the same for financial services KYC, KYB. And so the rules governing US institutions may differ from rules governing European institutions, African institutions, LatAm, their individual countries in those continents have different rules.</p>
<p>So standardisation is very important in a now modernised and globally connected world. Today, I don’t have to technically go through any intermediary and I can send money from me to you in Europe, peer-to-peer. So what specific regulation are we covered by is it the US, is it the Euro zone? We have to have a common set of standards. The proponents of the LEIs really believe in that common and standardisation. That’s what’s exciting about this. And the technology now, with verified LEIs, with Validation Agents that can issue and validate the Legal Entity Identifiers themselves. And from our standpoint, be able to back that by the underlying compliance data, the data checks, the background checks, the monitoring, so that we can protect the system from abuse, that’s critical. And now we can put them together.</p>
<p>And so, that common set of standards should be purported worldwide. And as we do that, we create that sort of trust economy, using the technology today to both protect the privacy elements of the individuals and entities, while also being able to create a trust framework to verify and validate that who we are dealing with is exactly who we intend to deal with. And that should span every jurisdiction because we do not live in a country-defined world now. We live in a global community,</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. Very unified world we live, definitely. Thanks a lot for explaining all these challenges and how you are solving this problem. I would like to close this with a final question. For all business leaders that are listening to us right now, what is the one actionable idea that they should write down on their agendas today?</p>
<p>Amit: That’s a great question. I’ll go back to sort of the beginning where you asked me a little bit about my background. Like I said, I’ve had the real opportunity and blessing to have worked in government, worked in the private sector, in banking, and otherwise. I have had the opportunity to work in the development and NGO sector. And all of those sectors play an important role to driving sustainable development and growth in our economy globally.</p>
<p>Often, we tend to look at these other sectors antagonistically. If we’re in the private sector, we look at regulators and policymakers as hinderances to our ability to grow. When we’re a regulator or a policymaker, we look at the innovation that happens in the private sector. And we say, “Wait a second, we need to put some constraints and rules to ensure that that innovation does not lead to exploitation of individuals and entities.” And then we look at the NGO sector providing essential services where private sector solutions and government solutions are not filling that void.</p>
<p>All of them matter. We must take an ecosystem approach of diverse experience and expertise to move the needle. Driving real impact commercially, economically requires that we bring all of those assets to bear to provide solutions for the global economy. And so that means we have to put aside this antagonism between sectors and really embrace that diversity of experience and expertise, because all of them are required to find collaborative solutions to drive real impact and changes in our broader society and our economy.</p>
<p>When we can do that, we really embrace inclusivity, not only to address safety and security issues. They are just not binary choices. We can drive inclusivity, as well as safety and security in tandem. And the only way to do that is that we embrace an ecosystem approach through our individual companies. We will not be the only provider of a solution. We must work with each other to provide those solutions that will be scalable, and sustainable.</p>
<p>So if there’s any lasting comment I would make, I would just say that when it comes to the diversity of your internal teams, to just even the engagement of partners and counterparts, is to look at the whole segment of our economy, from the NGO and development sector, to the government and public sector to the private sector and the innovation that happens there. All of those required to move together to really shape change.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I couldn’t agree more. Thanks a lot Amit for this conversation. Please tell us how people can be in touch with you or follow you if they would like to hear more.</p>
<p>Amit: Fantastic. I invite any and all that want to contribute to this broader mission. We certainly are trying to do so. We are working with a number of organisations to create best practices in a framework for global finance in this alternative and sort of decentralising economy. It’s called <a href="https://finclusive.com/rulebook">The Rulebook</a>. We have more on those frameworks as well as our products and services and our partners at our website – <a href="https://finclusive.com/">finclusive.com</a>.</p>
<p>You can also connect with us via email, just writing in <a href="mailto:contact@finclusive.com">contact@finclusive.com</a> or <a href="mailto:info@finclusive.com">info@finclusive.com</a> to learn more.

So please reach out to us on any one of those channels and we would love to connect and see how we can collaborate to advance these common objectives.</p>
<p>Oscar: Thanks a lot Amit and all the best.</p>

 An introduction to Web3 and Ontology’s role in the coming Web3&nbsp;era! <p>We’re currently in the midst of a very exciting transition phase from Web 2.0 to Web&nbsp;3.0.</p><p>But what is Web 3.0? How does it differ from Web 2.0?… And what ever happened to Web&nbsp;1.0?</p><p>This article should clarify a few things and help you understand how Ontology fits into the exciting world of Web&nbsp;3.0.</p> From Web 1.0 to Web&nbsp;2.0 <p>Let’s lay the groundwork for Web 3.0 by first describing Web 1.0 and Web&nbsp;2.0.</p><p>Web 1.0 was the first version of the worldwide web developed in the 1990s. Content was static, meaning users could only passively consume content rather than interact with&nbsp;it.</p><p>Web 2.0 changed&nbsp;this.</p><p>Our current web infrastructure is characterized as Web 2.0. It is the web we’re most familiar&nbsp;with.</p><p>Web 2.0 enabled the rise of social networks (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) and other sites (YouTube) that users could interact&nbsp;with.</p><p>These platforms brought with them many many benefits. They allowed people to share information and communicate in unprecedented ways. No longer were people dependent on legacy media to obtain and interact with news and entertainment. That said, platforms built on top of Web 2.0 infrastructure are not without their drawbacks.</p> Limitations of Web&nbsp;2.0 <p>Every time we interact online, the platforms we use collect data about&nbsp;us.</p><p>This can be anything from email addresses, video preferences, to the topics we follow on&nbsp;Twitter.</p><p>These mass swaths of data are gobbled up by Big Tech and monetized — often without our knowledge.</p><p>Not only is this business model a threat to our privacy, it creates security&nbsp;risks.</p><p>Online platforms store their data on centralized servers that are vulnerable to security breaches. Millions of users have had their data exposed&nbsp;online.</p><p>So, how do we solve this&nbsp;problem?</p><p>This is where Web 3.0 comes&nbsp;in.</p> Web 3.0 &amp;&nbsp;Ontology <p>Ontology is a high performance, public blockchain providing Web 3.0 infrastructure through its decentralized identity (DID) and data solutions.</p><p>Importantly, Ontology is a highly interoperable blockchain, supporting cross-chain transactions and Layer 2 solutions (e.g. Polygon).</p><p>Ontology utilizes a universal multi-virtual machine solution, being the first chain to support NeoVM, NativeVM and Wasm in&nbsp;2020.</p><p>This year, support for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) was&nbsp;added.</p><p>After our EVM testing is complete, Ontology will become the first public chain to support a total of 4 virtual machines.</p><p>Ontology has provided decentralized solutions in several sectors including mobility, inventory management, marketplace, corporate data attestation, copyright, and smart banking. Ontology is also collaborating with Chainlink, Polkadot, Waves, Neo and NEAR Protocol.</p> Web 3.0 &amp; Decentralized Identity <p>To recap, users currently have very little control over how their data is stored and utilized.</p><p>Ontology’s decentralized identity (DID) framework, <a href="https://ont.id/">ONT ID</a>, is different.</p><p>With ONTID, you decide who can access your private data. ONT ID allows you to verify credentials, whilst protecting your data and privacy. You can verify anything from passports to national IDs and social media accounts.</p><p>You can create an ONT ID now by <a href="http://onto.app">downloading ONTO Wallet</a>, Ontology’s DID, cross-chain wallet.</p> ONTO Wallet: The Crypto Wallet Equipped for the Web 3.0&nbsp;Era <p>We’ve talked a lot about the coming Web 3.0&nbsp;era.</p><p>But in certain respects, it’s already&nbsp;here.</p><p><a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a>, Ontology’s decentralized cross-chain wallet, is your gateway to Web&nbsp;3.0.</p><p>With ONTO, you can manage your crypto, data and identities all in one&nbsp;place.</p><p>When you <a href="http://onto.app">create an ONTO Wallet</a>, you receive an ONT ID, Ontology’s decentralized identity framework.</p><p>Once you have your ONT ID, you can start verifying credentials (e.g. passports, social media accounts) to build your digital identity.</p><p>The beauty of ONT ID is that you, the user, decide who has access to your verified data. This is what makes ONTO and ONT ID part of Web 3.0. They are decentralized solutions and thus do not depend on centralized platforms.</p><p>Like Ontology, ONTO is highly interoperable, supporting 14 blockchains and hundreds of decentralized applications (dApps).</p><p>Many of these<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/dApps?src=hashtag_click"> dApps</a> specialize in decentralized finance, including <a href="http://wing.finance">Wing Finance</a>, a credit-based, cross-chain DeFi platform.</p> Decentralized Finance &amp; Web&nbsp;3.0 <p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) has given people all over the world the opportunity to build&nbsp;wealth.</p><p><a href="http://wing.finance">Wing Finance</a>, Ontology’s credit-based, cross-chain DeFi platform, allows users to lend and borrow assets in order to earn&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>One problem with traditional DeFi projects is a lack of infrastructure necessary to build decentralized reputations.</p><p>In addition to decentralized identity, the transition to Web 3.0 requires a decentralized credit&nbsp;system.</p><p>This is where Ontology’s <a href="https://www.ocredit.io/">OScore</a> comes&nbsp;in.</p> OScore: Bringing Credit to&nbsp;DeFi <p>OScore is a decentralized credit score that helps you avoid over-collateralization when borrowing assets on Wing, earn WING rewards, and protect your&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>OScore combines on-chain activity (e.g. transaction histories, verified credentials) and creates a score to represent a user’s standing on the blockchain.</p><p>You can start developing your OScore now by creating an <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO&nbsp;Wallet</a>.</p> Data Management in the Web 3.0&nbsp;Era <p>This article began by explaining the difference between Web 1.0, Web 2.0 and Web 3.0, before describing how Ontology and its decentralized products including ONT ID, OScore, ONTO Wallet and Wing Finance move us closer to the Web 3.0&nbsp;era.</p><p>Finally, we’ll touch on <a href="http://sagamarket.io">SAGA Protocol</a>.</p><p>As mentioned above, we often don’t know how our data is used once it makes its way&nbsp;online.</p><p>Centralized platforms are built around their ability to harvest vast quantities of data that is then monetized.</p><p>SAGA Protocol seeks to change&nbsp;this.</p><p>SAGA is a decentralized data marketplace powered by the Ontology blockchain.</p><p>Rather than paying a centralized platform to gain access to user data, SAGA offers enterprises a decentralized alternative where the data providers remain in control of the data they&nbsp;share.</p><p>SAGA allows users to both own their data and monetize it in a fair, safe, and secure&nbsp;way.</p><p>We see the decentralization of data as an essential step on the road towards Web 3.0 and are very excited to share more about SAGA as it&nbsp;matures.</p> Summary <p>To reiterate, this is a very exciting time in the tech world. The transition to Web 3.0 is likely to be as impactful, if not more so, than the move from Web 1.0 to Web&nbsp;2.0.</p><p>Ontology is proud to be part of this rapidly changing landscape and is looking forward to sharing more technological developments in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>How Verifiable Credentials can transform your business</p><p>Dock’s API allows you to easily issue, verify, manage, and revoke verifiable credentials and decentralized identities. PDF certifications can be easily forged meaning online diplomas and certifications are becoming less valuable. Dock has built a decentralized network on which organizations can create their own identities, and use these identities to issue credentials that can be cryptographically verified. </p><p>This approach removes the manual verification steps from the process of issuing and handling non-verifiable credentials and saves an organization heaps of time. Verifiable Credentials also stop any fraudulent activity and ensure all credentials on a digital wallet are genuine. </p><p>With hundreds of organizations offering online courses, businesses must work to set themselves apart from the competition. Verifiable Credentials allow LMS organizations to produce unique certifications tailored to each individual and stop any fraudulent activity. Millions of people sign up for online courses daily. With most free online courses, everyone, whether they’ve attended or not, receives a certificate verifying they have completed the course. According to a study carried out by <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/11/thousands-of-people-sign-up-for-online-classes-they-never-end-up-taking/281709/">The Atlantic</a>, two-thirds of people who sign up to take an online course do not show up. For others who don’t sign up but want to claim the accomplishments, the PDF certificate can easily be copied and imitators can fake their accomplishments. With this, online diplomas and certificates have lost their credibility. </p><p>Bring back the quality of your online courses by integrating with Dock’s API and issue unique Verifiable Credentials, which can be instantly issued and verified. </p><p>The current process; pitfalls and improvements</p><p>A candidate signs up and completes an online course, or they sign up and do not attend.</p>  Once the course has finished, they receive a PDF certificate which can be shared on social platforms such as LinkedIn, and be sent as an email attachment to a workplace or to whom it concerns.  <blockquote>An impersonator can recreate this PDF documentation and fake the credentials. A person who signed up and did not turn up can still gain this credential when it was not earned.</blockquote>  The credentials of this certificate sit with the issuing body, being your company. To verify the authenticity of the documentation, the verifier must contact the issuing body and certify a person’s completion of the online course.  <blockquote>The process of finding contact information for the issuing body, reaching out to verify the accreditation, and waiting for a response can take weeks and months to do. </blockquote><p>With Dock’s API, an organization can create a decentralized identity and use these identities to issue credentials. The certification is held within the recipient's digital wallet and can be conveniently shared with whomever they desire. The verifier, recruiter, or employer can view these credentials and certify their authenticity. This process of issuing and verifying a digital credential is instant and saves organizations heaps of time. It also ensures the certifications held on one’s digital wallet are all genuine.</p><p>Issuing Verifiable Credentials via Dock’s API will increase attendance rates and make your course more premium. Market your online course as elite with unique Verifiable Credentials which cannot be impersonated. </p><p>Take your business into the future</p><p>Whether you’re an organization that offers free online courses and are looking to go more premium, or if you charge for your online course and want to differentiate yourself from the competition, Dock’s API will take you to that next step. </p><p>Book a <a href="https://calendly.com/d/zp6v-mk5m/free-consultation-with-dock">free consultation</a> with our experts and we’ll get you set up in no time.<br></p>

 GiD Report#178 — The WSJ’s FB investigation and Gary Gensler’s Senate testimony <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-177-should-coinbase-litigate-to-innovate-3213b882c583">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week:</p>  The WSJ FB&nbsp;expose  Gary Gensler’s Senate&nbsp;hearing  The future of NFTs and&nbsp;DeFi  Stuff happens   1. The WSJ Facebook expose that everyone’s talking&nbsp;about Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Photo: Fortune Live&nbsp;Media<p>Throughout Facebook’s lifetime, we’ve seen a consistent pattern of behavior that goes something like&nbsp;this:</p>  Facebook does something bad that stirs up controversy. In the early days, it was typically about privacy or security. These days, that controversy has expanded into human/cultural/social impact, moderation, democracy, monopoly power (and its abuses),&nbsp;etc.  Facebook acknowledges the issue, pledges to fix it, and promises the company will “do the right thing” — whatever that might&nbsp;be.  Some time passes, the news cycle moves on, and Facebook never really addresses the&nbsp;problem.  <p>That playbook worked for years — as the budding social network grew from scrappy startup to post-IPO Big Tech behemoth.</p><p>A series of investigations from the WSJ suitably called <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">The Facebook Files</a> more or less reveals that&nbsp;fact:</p><blockquote>Facebook Inc. knows, in acute detail, that its platforms are riddled with flaws that cause harm, often in ways only the company fully understands. That is the central finding of a Wall Street Journal series, based on a review of internal Facebook documents, including research reports, online employee discussions and drafts of presentations to senior management.</blockquote><blockquote>Time and again, the documents show, Facebook’s researchers have identified the platform’s ill effects. Time and again, despite congressional hearings, its own pledges and numerous media exposés, the company didn’t fix them. The documents offer perhaps the clearest picture thus far of how broadly Facebook’s problems are known inside the company, up to the chief executive himself.</blockquote><p>For most people, it’s probably not the most surprising revelation.</p> Relevant:   <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039">The Facebook&nbsp;Files</a>  Via <a href="http://global.id/carolyn">/carolyn</a> — <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-files-xcheck-zuckerberg-elite-rules-11631541353">Facebook Says Its Rules Apply to All.

The other big news of the week: Gary Gensler’s Senate&nbsp;hearing <p>Not much new here if you’ve been following the newsletter. Gary Gensler doubles down on his crusade against crypto, in particular, targeting crypto exchanges.</p><p>From <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/sec-gary-gensler-crypto-regulation-exchanges-coinbase-securities-lending-2021-9">his Senate testimony on the&nbsp;subject</a>:</p><blockquote>“I’ve suggested that platforms and projects come in and talk to us. Many platforms have dozens or hundreds of tokens on them,” Gensler&nbsp;said.</blockquote><blockquote>“While each token’s legal status depends on its own facts and circumstances, the probability is quite remote that, with 50, 100, or 1,000 tokens, any given platform has zero securities.”</blockquote><blockquote>He added: “Make no mistake: To the extent that there are securities on these trading platforms, under our laws, they have to register with the Commission unless they qualify for an exemption.”</blockquote><p>Felix Salmon <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-capital-4d8d56a5-e785-44a8-82ad-008a4fad8354.html">provides some sober analysis</a>:</p><blockquote>State of play: Few if any U.S. crypto companies can say that they are regulated by the SEC or any other national regulator. Most of them are regulated at the state level, as money transmitters.</blockquote><p>…</p>  The SEC complains that crypto companies like Coinbase don’t come to it for regulation. They should do so, says Gensler, because those companies deal every day in tokens that can be considered securities, and a thumbs-up from the SEC would confer a degree of legitimacy that would be extremely reassuring to investors both small and&nbsp;large.  The crypto companies, on the other hand, complain that they can’t stand still waiting for regulatory approval on the basis of decades-old securities laws, while the rest of the world leaps ahead with innovations like distributed exchanges — smart contracts where it can be hard to even find a corporate entity to regulate.  <p>…</p><blockquote>The bottom line: The bigger the money, the more the demand from conservative investors for clear rules and regulations. “The DeFi guys want the TradFi money, but they don’t want the rules,” Ledger’s Joel Edgerton said at the Blockworks conference, contrasting crypto-based decentralized finance with dollar-based traditional finance. “It doesn’t work like&nbsp;that.”</blockquote><p>Nice timing then for Coinbase to <a href="https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1438247595877416962">look to offer futures and derivatives trading</a>.

<p>Vous possédez des UNIK sur Unikname Network et voudriez les sortir sous la forme d’une autre crypto ? Vous avez des ETH, des BTC, des BNB… et vous préféreriez avoir des UNIK pour utiliser les services de la Plateforme SSI Unikname ou participer à la vie du réseau ?</p>
<p>Bonne nouvelle, les équipes Unikname développent actuellement des Bridges pour que le token UNIK devienne un token multichain !</p>
<p>Mais qu’est ce qu’un bridge entre deux blockchains ?&nbsp; Comment est-ce que cela fonctionne en général et comment fonctionnent les bridges avec Unikname Network ? Quelle sera la première blockchain interconnectée avec notre réseau ? On vous dit tout !</p>
</blockquote> 
			  
				
				
				 <p></p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Qu’est-ce qu’un Bridge entre deux blockchains ?  
			  
				
				
				  Pourquoi contrsuire des bridges ?  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Le but des bridges est de permettre l’utilisation d’une crypto donnée sur une blockchain à priori incompatible. Par exemple, les BTC, ETH et BNB ont longtemps vécu dans des écosystèmes hermétiques les uns aux autres. Or depuis quelques années avec la mise en place de bridges cross-blockchain, il devient possible d’exploiter ces cryptos dans les différents écosystèmes des unes et des autres.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>En effet, les bridges permettent aux tokens natifs d’une blockchain de devenir multichain. Les tokens à échanger sont verrouillés sur leur blockchain native, et ils sont forgé sur la blockchain de cible sous une forme particulière que nous détaillons par la suite. Ces programmes établissent ainsi des canaux d’échanges de token d’une blockchain à une autre en utilisant des smart-contracts pour surveiller les transactions spécifiques reliant les réseaux entre eux.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>Aujourd’hui, les tokens natifs d’un grand nombre de réseaux peuvent être impliqués dans les transactions sur de multiples blockchains.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Les dessous des bridges  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Pour transférer des tokens, le bridge va donc les verrouiller sur la blockchain de départ, et les forger sur la blockchain d’arrivée. Ces nouveaux tokens émis par le bridge ne sont pas exactement les mêmes que les tokens de départ : il s’agit d’une version embalée dans un format exploitable sur la blockchain de destination. On appelle ces nouveaux tokens des Peg.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>Il n’est possible de créer des Peg que sur les blockchains comme Ethereum ou la Binance Smart Chain, capable de gérer des smart-contract.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>L’interconnexion des écosystèmes se fait donc via des réseaux spécifiques, permettant de connecter une blockchain manipulant des smart-contracts à n’importe quelle autre, et donc par rebond, à connecter entre elles toutes les blockchains, qu’elles permettent l’écriture de smart-contracts ou non.</p> 
			 
			  
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Pour faciliter le développement communautaire de bridges, des standards de Peg ont émergé. On retrouve par exemple le standard des tokens ERC20 sur le réseau Ethereum, celui des tokens BEP20 sur la Binance Smart Chain, et il en existe encore bien d’autres.</p>
<p>Le réseau bitcoin ne permettant l’écriture de smart-contract, il n’existe pas de Peg sur la blockchain bitcoin. En revanche, il existe des PegBTC sur un grand nombre de réseaux.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>Comme la génération d’un Peg sur un réseau cible correspond à la suppression d’un token natif sur la blockchain de départ et inversement, il n’y a pas de création de supply. Il s’agit plutôt de transferts de tokens d’un réseau vers un autre selon un smart-contrat assurant l’équilibre des flux. </p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Les bridges de Unikname Network  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Résolument décentralisé et ouvert à l’ensemble de la communauté blockchain, Unikname s’ouvre au reste du monde des cryptos en établissant ses propres bridges avec différentes blockchain équipées de smart-contract.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Le UNIK, un token cross-blockchain  
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			  
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Le projet Unikname Network est résolument tourné vers l’interopérabilité. De la même façon que les UniknameID sont des identifiants décentralisés conçus pour être multi-plateformes, les tokens UNIK doivent être utilisables sur de nombreuses blockchains.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Unikname travaille donc sur le développement de plusieurs bridges et le premier connectera Unikname Network au réseau Ethereum. Il sera disponible peu de temps après l’<a>Initial Dex Offering</a> (IDO) du projet Unikname. Il sera très prochainement possible de transformer ses UNIK en ETH et inversement, en passant par le premier PegUNIK jamais émis, qui sera donc un token ERC20. Les nouvelles avancées seront communiquées sur le canal <a href="https://t.me/Unikname_network">télégram </a>de Unikname.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Un premier bridge bientôt disponible  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Cette connexion entre le réseau Ethereum et le réseau Unikname fonctionne comme nous l’avons décrit ci-dessus : il existe une relation entre le nombre de PegUNIK disponible sur Ethereum et le nombre de UNIK destiné aux échanges sur Unikname Network qui est de un pour un.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Convertir ses ETH en UNIK  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Lorsqu’un utilisateur souhaite convertir des ETH en UNIK, il doit d’abord acheter des PegUNIK en ETH. Cet échange à lieu sur le réseau Ethereum selon le cours du UNIK. Il va ensuite demander la conversion de ses PegUNIK en UNIK. Pour cela, il va utiliser le bridge Unikname. Ce bridge va alors s’activer, et brûler, c’est-à-dire détruire définitivement, l’ensemble de PegUNIK à convertir. Simultanément, le même montant de UNIK va être déverrouillé sur le crypto-account&nbsp; de séquestre Unikname et envoyé sur le crypto-account Unikname de l’utilisateur. Ces flux ont lieu sur le réseau Unikname Network.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 <p>La balance PegUNIK / UNIK est bien restée à l’équilibre, il n’y a pas eu de création de monnaie. En revanche, l’utilisateur a converti ses ETH en UNIK, et il peut maintenant disposer des services de la Plateforme SSI Unikname et prendre part à la vie du réseau.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Convertir ses UNIK en ETH  
			  
				
				
				 <p>À l’inverse, il est possible de vouloir convertir ses UNIK en ETH pour les utiliser sur le réseau Ethereum ou pour les trader. Il faut activer le bridge dans l’autre sens.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>Lorsque l’utilisateur déclenche la conversion, il envoie les UNIK à échanger dans le crypto-account de séquestre Unikname pour les verrouiller. Ensuite, des PegUNIK sont forgés sur Ethereum et envoyés dans wallet de l’utilisateur. Il est maintenant libre de les convertir en ETH et d’en disposer comme il le souhaite.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Pour en savoir plus<br>  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Sur Unikname Network, plutôt que de brûler et de forger des UNIK, un crypto-account de séquestre à été mis en place. La création de supply sur le réseau est extrêmement limitée depuis l’entrée de la token économie dans sa <a href="https://www.unikname.com/en/discover-unikname-network-episode-3-supply-heading-into-phase-2/">Phase 2</a><a href="https://www.unikname.com/en/discover-unikname-network-episode-3-supply-heading-into-phase-2/"></a> et la création ou la suppression de token à chaque échanges compliquerait la compréhension du réseau.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>L’adresse de ce crypto-account de séquestre est publique et n’importe qui peut vérifier via l’<a href="https://explorer.unikname.network/">explorateur</a> Unikname Network<a href="https://explorer.unikname.network/"></a> que les seuls UNIK qui y entrent ou en sortent correspondent bien à du forgeage ou de la destruction de PegUNIK sur Ethereum.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>Comme pour l’enregistrement de n’importe quelle transaction sur la blockchain Ethereum, les échanges ETH ↔ PegUNIK et PegUNIK ↔ UNIK génèrent des frais qui sont entièrement à la charge de l’utilisateur.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Conclusion  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Le UNIK, bien que token natif de Unikname Network est un token multichain. Grâce à un système de bridge, il est possible de l’utiliser sur un grand nombre de blockchains, ou de convertir les cryptos les plus courantes en UNIK sur le réseau Unikname.</p> 
			  
				
				
				 <p>Les bridges développés par&nbsp; les équipes Unikname garantissent un équilibre dans le nombre total de UNIK en circulation. Lors d’un échange entre deux réseaux, il n’y a ni création ni destruction de token. Les règles de gestion de supply de Unikname Network restent inchangées, c’est l’horizon du UNIK qui s’est agrandit.</p>

It is a core part of the DECODE tech stack for Smart Cities and it makes it easy to understand the complexity of data transformation while being compatible with any platform, including Legacy Infrastructure. We make Crypto for Citizens and we make it Open Source.“</p>



<p>Each member of this consortium gathers together a mature experience developing and deploying industrial standards, as well as facilitating open source community adoption of technologies, including the presence in major blockchain standardisation initiatives such as ISO TC/307, INATBA, W3C and Sovrin.</p>



<p>The combination of blockchain-specific hardware solutions for critical infrastructures, developed by RIDDLE&amp;CODE, will help turn data sources into trusted ones and lay the foundation for EBSI’s automated processes and scalability. The combination of InfoCert’s leadership and scale when providing services for digital trust, security and identity management complying with standards will allow Europe to adopt mature blockchain solutions to mission-critical environments.</p>

<p>Quote from the consortium members:</p>



<blockquote><p>“The consortium’s unique combined understanding of cryptography, blockchain and identity technologies as well as its global market positioning, give us the tools and the strength to bring EBSI to the next level. We are truly excited to embrace the policy makers, the businesses and the developers into an inclusive community, to fuel their ideas and products into the European Union’s blockchain.” </p>Andrea D’Intino (EBSI Project leader, Dyne.org)</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>“The blockchain landscape diversifies into layer one and layer two technologies. Layer one is used for attesting values and identities with a small transaction payload and low frequency. Layer two is used for high-volume, low-value, day-to-day transactions. Then, there is the neglected but important layer zero, where blockchain meets products and goods of the physical world. This is exactly where RIDDLE&amp;CODE contributes to EBSI.” </p>Thomas Fürstner (Founder &amp; CTO, RIDDLE&amp;CODE)</blockquote>



<blockquote><p>“Being involved in shaping the future EU blockchain infrastructure not only makes us extremely proud, it also could have an important strategic impact on our reference market. An EU blockchain infrastructure could represent the backbone on which EU Trust will be built in the future.” He further commented: “InfoCert, as the leading Qualified Trust Service Provider in the EU, aims to further strengthen its thought leadership role in a constantly evolving market. InfoCert has an impressive track record in building innovative solutions and an ambitious R&amp;D program focused on Digital Identity and Digital Trust. It includes the exploitation of emerging technologies, among which blockchain is one of the most promising. Our partners have tremendous technical competencies in distributed ledger technologies, while InfoCert has very distinctive expertise in building Trust Frameworks. Joining forces was natural and proved to be crucial in the success of our consortium.“</p>Carmine Auletta (Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer, InfoCert – Tinexta Group)</blockquote>

<p>18-Month Plan Towards a Fully-Decentralized and Long-Term Sustainable Grants&nbsp;DAO</p> 1. Introduction <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-oceandao-efe9ed681b84">OceanDAO</a> <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-roadmap-update-mid-2021-3ea6ba80795d">is</a> a community-curated grants DAO that is key to Ocean’s long-term sustainability. We aim for OceanDAO to be fully decentralized by the end of 2022, with the future up to the Ocean ecosystem. This post describes how we plan to get&nbsp;there.</p><p>The rest of this post is organized as&nbsp;follows.</p>  Section 2 gives an overview of past to future. It reviews how OceanDAO started from a small number of teams, and has grown and evolved since. It also outlines a future of greater scale, stability, and decentralization  Section 3 elaborates on target&nbsp;outcomes  Section 4 reviews tools towards the target&nbsp;outcomes  Section 5 gives the specific roadmap, quarter by quarter to the end of&nbsp;2022  Section 6 concludes.   2. Overview, from Past to&nbsp;Future  From 0-&gt;1 (The&nbsp;Past) <p>Based on the <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">Web3 Sustainability Loop</a> design, it has been operational since Q4 2020. In early 2021 we published our <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-roadmap-update-mid-2021-3ea6ba80795d">2021 Q1/Q2 roadmap</a>. It outlined several key challenges; candidate solutions; and a cohesive plan to move forward. By <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-round-7-results-92c567d6d540">Round 7</a> (late summer 2021) we had delivered on the plan’s&nbsp;targets.</p><p>Let’s review the major&nbsp;items.</p><p>In early summer 2021, we introduced a variety of changes in order to scale out OceanDAO. These three mechanisms together enabled the DAO to improve funding and gather sufficient capital efficiency to enable positive&nbsp;growth.</p>  Granular Y/N voting enabled each project to be more thoroughly curated.  Variable funding enabled both small and large projects to easily access&nbsp;funding.  Burning the remainder of funds not granted, introduced an ROI&nbsp;floor.  <p>The impact of these updates has been significant. Internal processes to execute the monthly operations have steadily improved, and are beginning to scale out. Most importantly, projects have been able to increase their ability to access funds, and funds have been burned by the DAO as expectations from contributors continue to increase.</p> To 1-&gt;N (The Future — Scaling) <p>Where to from here? The overall goals are to scale funding, retain average ROI &gt; 1.0 (necessary for growth), and to fully decentralize. We want successful community teams to access greater funding in order to scale aggressively. We want internal OPF teams to eventually be funded by the DAO, eroding differences between “core” and “community”. All teams that are delivering should feel “safe” with stable / reliable funding; so we need to update voting systems towards less volatile outcomes. To access greater funding, DAO projects need to more easily report updates and metrics, while voters should be able to improve efficiency by more effectively navigating this data. When voters are able to easily understand ROI, and projects can measurably prove fundamental outcomes, then funding can grow with impunity.</p><p>To summarize, the focus for OceanDAO in 2021–2022 is stability, scale, and decentralization.</p><p>We’ve already started in the stability and scale path as teams can now request larger amounts of funding, an increase from $20K cap to $50K (as of R10), adjustments to the funding distribution were also implemented to continue growing the number of returning teams contributing in OceanDAO. The introduction of a reporting process to maintain good standing will help participants reconcile their deliverables and outcomes for the DAO. Decentralized teams such as Ocean Pearl, are working on a comprehensive UX to bring the underlying mechanisms to&nbsp;life.</p><p>These are near term approaches to improve stability, scale, and decentralize. Let’s discuss the strategy more rigorously for longer time&nbsp;periods.</p> 3. Target Outcomes 2021–2022 <p>During the summer of 2021, the OceanDAO team continued identifying a wide range of challenges while identifying forward-looking solutions to achieve our growth and sustainability goals. Stability, scale, and decentralization were key concepts identified. The following outcomes emerged as North Stars, directing the evolution of the&nbsp;DAO.</p><p>Stability</p>  OceanDAO needs to have sustainable voting and funding systems to enable existing DAO and OPF teams to be funded by the&nbsp;DAO.  Grantees should signal progress to the DAO in a consistent manner, while incentivizing projects to reach completion.  Whale voting and the impact of onboarding new projects, should be softened.  <p>Scale</p>  An UX that reflects the underlying mechanisms and supports the growing OceanDAO ecosystem needs to be&nbsp;built.  A snowball effect of new projects and proposals entering the&nbsp;DAO.  Multiple funding tiers should be introduced to facilitate the scaling of a wider range of projects.  New methods to calculate and report ROI to reduce friction, and introduce new funding mechanisms.  <p>Decentralization</p>  Automate grants program process to reduce overhead and human interaction.  Decentralize grants program and funding distribution to enable new web3 functionality and interoperability to be developed.   4. Candidate Tools <p>With these outcomes defined, we identified many candidate tools to help drive these outcomes. Here are several promising ones, grouped by the target outcomes of Stability, Scale, and Decentralization.</p><p>Stability</p><p>Stability enables a stream of continuous funding for OceanDAO teams, aligning projects towards delivering outcomes, while improving proposal and voting efficiency.</p>  Voting and Funding Stability. Conviction Voting for more stable funding available to support larger teams. Shift over internal OPF teams to be funded by the&nbsp;DAO.  Systems of accountability. Implement “Standing”. Teams submit updates to reconcile their grant deliverables. Integrate a decentralized dispute mechanism to remove OPF as a Certificate Authority. DAO can easily identify teams that are in good standing. Projects need to complete deliverables before applying for more&nbsp;funding.  Soften whale voting and activity. Implement Quadratic Voting. Group all proposals under a single ballot. Full voting power can only be deployed once towards New and Existing&nbsp;teams.  <p>Scale</p><p>Scale delivers important mechanisms that drive Ocean bottom-up initiatives. By improving ROI transparency and expanding funding tiers, OceanDAO can deliver funding more effectively. As incoming proposals snowball and the DAO grows in size, improvements to the UX will make significant impacts to every participant.</p>  Ocean Pearl. Define initial UX requirements and make them transparent. Formalize OceanDAO tech stack + FE/BE layers. Integrate Pearl team into Zenhub. Improve design and roadmap transparency. Decentralize FE.  Expand funding tiers. Add lower and higher funding tiers. Make it easier for smaller projects to access funding. Increase the ceiling to fund larger teams. Increase transparency of each&nbsp;layer.  Improve ROI transparency. Implement project standings. Develop new metrics and KPIs to report ROI. Improve FE/reporting systems.  Grant Proposals “snowballs”. Develop new growth strategies. Build relationships with universities and other institutions. Implement DAO Week. Launch proposal referral program to incentivize virality.  <p>Decentralization</p><p>Decentralization transforms manual processes into automated &amp; scalable systems enabling further DAO decentralization with projects like Pearl. It enables us to better leverage <a href="https://medium.com/1kxnetwork/organization-legos-the-state-of-dao-tooling-866b6879e93e">emerging Web3 / DAO&nbsp;tooling</a>.</p>  Automate grants program. Write grants program into code and reduce ongoing overhead. Remove human interaction. Integrate Pearl&nbsp;data.  Decentralize grants program. Make grants web3 native. Decentralize fund distribution. Integrate systems like Kleros to decentralize conflict resolution while leveraging the right mechanisms.   5. Specific Plans By Quarter 2021–2022 <p>With Stability, Scale, and Decentralization oriented outcomes, the OceanDAO Product Team did extensive planning. We reconciled this with internal challenges, community expectations, governance best practices, and the latest DAO&nbsp;designs.</p><p>Below is the result, for our 2021–2022 plans, organized quarterly. These plans support these three DAO pillars, and in turn (we hope) help to drive the outcomes. We also reserve the right to change our plans based on learnings in the rapidly evolving DAO environment.</p><p>The plans focus on OceanDAO products; dovetailing these are extensive activities in voting, funding, and communications towards the 2021–2022 OceanDAO&nbsp;goals.</p> Summary <p>This image summarizes the aims per quarter. It includes outreach (row 1), monthly ops (row 2)&nbsp;, and product work (remaining rows). The following subsections elaborate on product work, per&nbsp;quarter.</p> Q3 2021&nbsp;Targets <p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q3/2021. In fact, good news: the end of Q3 2021 is near; we can report that these are already complete. Highlights are automating the grants process, expanding available funding, and aligning&nbsp;Pearl.</p>  Project “Standings”. Give a means for <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">teams to report their grant deliverables</a>, so the DAO can better understand how well a team is delivering on its target outcomes. This helps align every participant towards ROI &gt; 1.0, and reduces friction across the DAO. It’s a foundational element about team track record, on which future features can&nbsp;build.  Automate via DAOBot. This is an activity to migrate grants ops from being done by hand to being executed by code. Proposals are deployed automatically, winners are calculated and reported on time, and the schedule is executed as intended. Anyone can <a href="https://github.com/oceanprotocol/DAOBot">read the code base</a>, or <a href="https://airtable.com/shrvk1ENKwlG8vOBL">visit the Airtable configuration</a>, to see what is being designed and deployed.  Ocean Pearl Alignment. The Pearl team is building a high-quality webapp to encompass key OceanDAO tasks, such as reviewing projects. They are working closely with the OceanDAO Team to align Pearl product goals with OceanDAO goals, and planning that results from it. This has improved transparency between teams and early communication around new features, while Pearl works towards onboarding initial&nbsp;users.  Expand Available Funding: add $50k tier. The new mechanisms to increase transparency on team track record give the opportunity to raise the funding cap for teams that are delivering. So for round 10 we expand the ceiling to $50k for projects that have completed &gt;= 3 proposals, with more to come in the&nbsp;future.   Q4 2021&nbsp;Targets <p>We have the following goals for Q4/2021. The highlights include improving ROI measures, referrals, and softening whale&nbsp;voting.</p>  Easier for Teams to Calculate ROI. OceanDAO must handle softer and squishier goals, complementing the extreme precision of Ocean Data Farming. However, toward the “ROI &gt; 1” goal, we can still make it easier for teams to report metrics, by providing them with more off-the-shelf tools. That’s the aim&nbsp;here.  Referrals to Drive proposals. To continue growing, we must increase the number of proposals and new teams entering OceanDAO. The tactic here is to incentivize the DAO community to get New Teams to submit proposals that receive&nbsp;funding.  Ocean Pearl Integration. Pearl is scheduled to be further integrated in Q4. OceanDAO teams will be able to register, update, and submit their proposals to the grants program through&nbsp;Pearl.  Soften Effect of Whale Voting. Voting should reconcile skin-in-the-game (1-token 1-vote), with democratic ideals (people having sufficient voice). The Quadratic Voting (QV) mechanism balances these. We will implement it here, plus initial Sybil protection (needed once you go beyond 1-token&nbsp;1-vote).   Q1 2022&nbsp;Targets <p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q1/2022. The highlights are launching a stable funding stream to make it safer to work in OceanDAO long-term.</p>  Stable / reliable income via Conviction Voting (CV). We want to make it feel “safer” to work for OceanDAO over longer time frames. This is critical to long-term ecosystem health. The general idea is to soften monthly binary yes/no funding outcomes. The specific approach is <a href="https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-34019bd17b10">Conviction Voting</a>&nbsp;. CV gives an effect of a “lowpass filter” over time: a voter’s weight on a project depends on their amount staked and length of time staked into the project. The overall setup is: OceanDAO would have two funding tracks: monthly “batch” voting (status quo), plus “continuous” voting (CV). CV funding allocations will start small, and increase based on learnings / feedback. ROI &gt; 1.0 will be a key constraint in the CV track&nbsp;too.  Refine Ocean Pearl. Keep working with Ocean Pearl team to support more OceanDAO user stories. This is a prerequisite to full decentralization.   Q2 2022&nbsp;Targets <p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q2/2022. The focus will continue to be around Conviction Voting to improve the overall&nbsp;system.</p>  Refine “stable / reliable income”. The “batch” voting track has been evolved and refined for the better part of a year, to get continually better at serving the community. We expect similar for “continuous” (Conviction Voting) track. Accordingly, this roadmap allocates two quarters worth of work to arrive at a CV system that we’re sufficiently comfortable with in order to scale&nbsp;funding.  Decentralize Dispute Resolution. Currently, disputes on team “standing” are handled via community discussion, with the OceanDAO core team as the final arbiter if needed. The latter is centralized; fortunately it hasn’t been needed yet. To be fully decentralized, OceanDAO needs to decentralize this. Kleros decentralized arbitration is one way. Approach or timing is subject to&nbsp;change.  Refine Ocean Pearl. Keep working with Ocean Pearl team to support more OceanDAO user&nbsp;stories.   Q3/Q4 2022&nbsp;Targets <p>We aim to complete the following by the end of Q3/2022 &amp; Q4/2022. The focus will be shifting existing systems into a web3 native stack, that may interoperate between other contracts and primitives.</p>  Decentralize OceanDAO. Here, we do all remaining things for the DAO to be fully decentralized. This includes decentralizing some ops tasks like “filter projects for voting” and final transfer of funds to teams. There will likely be more&nbsp;tasks.   6. Conclusion &amp; Looking&nbsp;Forward <p>Until recently, OceanDAO focused on getting initial product-market fit (0-&gt;1) using some <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/oceandao-roadmap-update-mid-2021-3ea6ba80795d">key components and mechanisms</a>. Those are now in place. The aim now is to scale in traction (0-&gt;1) along with improving stability and becoming fully decentralized. This article summarized how we plan to achieve&nbsp;that.</p><p>We aim for OceanDAO to be fully decentralized by the end of 2022. At this point, there will no longer be a distinction between “community” and “core” teams, it will simply be the Ocean ecosystem. Future improvements will be up to anyone in the ecosystem. Some teams may be chasing their own business models, such as a product for a given vertical (e.g. DeFi) or for a particular user base (e.g. Gaia-X). Others may do “public goods” work for the benefit of the ecosystem. The OceanDAO voting community can vote to bias funding towards what they feel will help drive growth the most.

   In more&nbsp;news&nbsp;on national&nbsp;privacy laws, post-Brexit Britain is using its newfound freedom from the EU to set its own data privacy regulatory agenda.

<p>In more&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/09/china-us-recognize-national-security-risks-of-surveillance-capitalism/">news</a>&nbsp;on national&nbsp;privacy laws, post-Brexit Britain is using its newfound freedom from the EU to set its own data privacy regulatory agenda.</p>



<p>According to the country’s culture secretary,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/26/uk-to-overhaul-privacy-rules-in-post-brexit-departure-from-gdpr">Oliver Dowden</a>, Britain could put an end to&nbsp;“irritating cookie popups and consent requests online,” and set new rules based on “common sense, not box-ticking.” New Zealand’s highly regarded privacy commissioner, John Edwards, has been appointed information commissioner to lead the change.</p>



<p>But while Britain plans to move away from the&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>&nbsp;with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/26/uk-to-overhaul-privacy-rules-in-post-brexit-departure-from-gdpr">“world leading data policy,”</a>&nbsp;any new rules it sets will still need to protect EU-to-UK data transfers.</p>



<p>It appears that Britain wants to revert to a data protection or privacy framework that is not as strict as the GDPR and will try to redefine the appropriate balance between individual and commercial interests. Every country has a slightly different spin on that based on their history and how they arrived at their law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A new British data privacy law could look more like the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/the-california-consumer-privacy-act-and-why-you-must-still-keep-control-of-your-personal-information/">CCPA</a>. It will be interesting to see where it lands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Da oggi tutti gli utenti Legalmail avranno la possibilità di attivare gratuitamente l’autenticazione a due fattori per l’accesso alla propria webmail, aumentando ancor di più il livello di sicurezza del proprio account di Posta Elettronica Certificata.</p>



<p>InfoCert, con Legalmail, è il primo provider PEC a offrire ai propri utenti la sicurezza aggiuntiva dell’autenticazione a doppio fattore, che sarà presto uno standard comune verso la convergenza alla PEC Europea. Ancora una volta InfoCert si conferma come provider di riferimento in tema di sicurezza e innovazione per i propri clienti.</p>



 Cos’è l’autenticazione a due fattori? 



<p>L’autenticazione a due fattori o autenticazione forte (dall’inglese Strong Authentication) è oggi uno dei sistemi di protezione più sicuri per i nostri account.&nbsp;Consiste nell’aggiungere un secondo fattore di autenticazione alle classiche User e Password, come, ad esempio, un OTP, un Token o una notifica sul proprio Smartphone. Questi elementi devono essere indipendenti tra loro, in modo che un’eventuale violazione di uno di essi non comprometta l’affidabilità degli altri.</p>



 Attiva l’autenticazione forte sulla tua Legalmail con MyInfoCert 



<p>Gli utenti Legalmail possono attivare l’autenticazione forte in completa autonomia nel menu impostazioni della propria webmail. Per abilitare il doppio fattore sarà necessario scaricare e attivare l’App MyInfoCert, e collegarla al proprio Account PEC. MyInfoCert, l’innvoativa applicazione di InfoCert già utilizzata per l’autenticazione di Livello 2 per SPID, grazie al sistema di notifiche smart ed al riconoscimento biometrico di impronta digitale o del volto, rafforzerà le difese della propria casella da accessi indesiderati.</p>



<p>MyInfoCert è disponibile per sistemi operativi Android, iOS e Harmony OS.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/reinwarth">Matthias Reinwarth</a></p><p>As social beings, people interact with their environment, whether as citizens of a state, as employees of a company or as contractual partners (customers, insured persons) with a company in the private sector. Even if a large number of such transactions can take place anonymously (coffee to go on the way to the office in the morning does not require identification), proof of identity or the reliable assurance of a particular characteristic ("of legal age," "fully vaccinated") is often indispensable.</p>
<p>From a functional and technical point of view, a distinction must be made between different steps. Identification, i.e., the one-time onboarding of a real identity into an identity ecosystem, is usually performed only once per ecosystem, but can be very time-consuming and expensive. The reward for this procedure is simplified authentication, i.e., more or less portable, rapid proof of this identification in the form of an ID card or access to a technical system. Depending on the character of the identity ecosystem (state, bank, insurance company), the stored attributes of an identity are also updated subsequently in order to reflect ongoing developments.</p>
 Between KYC and least disclosure 
<p>In many cases, a more comprehensive knowledge of the identity and its characteristics will be necessary (for example, when signing) a credit agreement. But in many cases, reliable proof of only a few, specific characteristics is quite sufficient. Permission to dance in a club after a certain time depends on a defined age (name and exact date of birth are irrelevant here). The same applies to the purchase of cigarettes or alcohol.</p>
<p>But even critical characteristics that are not necessarily everyone's business must be verifiable to third parties in individual cases without disclosing an excess of detailed information. Discounted admission to a museum as a pupil or student does not require disclosure of the respective university or course of study. It must be possible to prove an unspecified disability in order to acquire cheaper tickets for public transport without disclosing medical details.</p>
 Regaining trust in assured identities is essential 
<p>No matter whether it is about secure identification or the proof of individual properties. The reality for all of us is that comprehensive and universally applicable policies and mechanisms do not exist for this very purpose; trust in digital identities has been profoundly destroyed in a time when identity fraud and weak authentication are our daily reality.</p>
<p>Trust in digital identities is difficult to achieve outside of individual silos and islands. In addition to nation states as issuers of digital identity credentials in the form of an electronic ID card or passport, the financial industry in particular, i.e. banks and insurance companies, has already made a strong showing in this regard. The reasons for this commitment on the part of the financial sector are obvious: money is at stake here, and trustworthy identities are the basis for any interaction between customers and institutions. The same applies to other industries, such as telecommunications providers.</p>
 Federating beyond the silo has proven difficult 
<p>Beyond the use in just one specific industry, trustworthy issuers of identity proofs (verifiable credentials) have recently been found, which can then provide identities and their properties for many business processes. However, again depending on the region or country, take-up (and thus usability) often does not reach a critical mass.</p>
<p>Two dimensions are essential: In addition to the highest possible trust in the identities and their properties, it is about their scope and usability. This is an unsolved problem to date, because while the trustworthiness of the identities is a central challenge for the individual identity ecosystems which is also solved in the respective silo, their focus is naturally on their own customers/citizens in the first approximation. Interoperability is not a core business. This massively limits identity reach as the second relevant dimension.</p>
 Putting the pieces together at a global scale 
<p>Concepts, standards and technologies would be available here and now, tried and tested, and we use them every day in online shopping or in our professional environment, but they are always reduced to individual walled gardens.</p>
<p>This is where the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-sakimura-leibbrandt-introducing-gain">Global Assured Identities Network (GAIN)</a> comes in, first publicly announced at EIC 2021 in Munich. More than 150 globally recognized experts in the identity environment have brought together their expertise from a wide variety of fields to elevate trust and reach in identities to a global level. Starting from (but not limited to) the financial industry, which has proven to be able to confidently provide identities for your business models, concepts are defined and tested here to enable interoperability for identities from all participating institutions.</p>
<p>End users obtain identities from an institution (bank, government, telco) that certifies them. By federating these, GAIN provides a reusable, trusted identity that they can use against a variety of relying parties/service providers, i.e., government agencies, but also institutions and commercial entities in a self-determined and controlled manner. In line with the concept of verifiable credentials, only those attributes are used that are required for the purpose of a transaction, i.e., proof of age or simple proof of identity without disclosing other attributes.</p>
<p>The complexity of this network, which is global by definition, is hidden by the fact that GAIN, as a network, knows the respective identity providers for the end users and mediates communication with them. Different architectures are spanned, the varying assurance level of different identities and providers is taken into account, and global interoperability is enabled. A variety of positive outcomes could be achieved, including basic increase of trust in identities, simplified on-boarding of customers and clients for arbitrary services, provision of under-banked communities with resilient identities, e.g. based on telecommunication identities (which have already taken over this role in many regions, but without further interoperability), reduction of fraud, but especially also the increase of a person‘s individual sovereignty in handling his/her identity data in the respective transaction (minimal disclosure).</p>
 Call to action: Proving viability and achieving a critical mass 
<p>The concept is promising, but until a "Login with GAIN" via the identity at my own bank or with my ID card for fast and trustworthy onboarding is available in addition to the "Login with Google/Apple/Facebook" button, a lot still has to happen.</p>
<p>Proof of value and a high level reach are the next steps. Rapid and widespread adoption by the financial industry worldwide, but also beyond, for example by eIDas solution providers or telecom companies, is imperative and essential.</p>
<p>The presentation of the network on the occasion of the EIC therefore also focused on the call for participation in this network, starting with a proof of concept soon. Interested parties are invited to take a look at the <a href="https://www.iif.com/Portals/0/Files/content/Innovation/09_13_2021_gain_digital_trust.pdf">compact white paper</a> as a first reading and introduction. The implementation has already started, interested Identity Information Providers are called to register and to interoperate promptly. Technical, organizational and legal framework conditions are roughly outlined, but in particular also possible business models and benefit aspects are documented. GAIN offers a highly exciting perspective for a global network of assured and trusted identities. The task now is to quickly implement a critical mass in order to prove the real benefits at scale.</p>

So we’re using the technology we’ve built, especially our citizen engagement platform Inclued, to help people get involved with projects that interest them and where they want to improve specific services — and for researchers to find, invite and communicate with these interested individuals.</p><p>The technology allows people to gather information about themselves and to keep it safe and secure in their own personal data store. They can let service providers see details about them — for example their age, the area they live in, if they have a disability and so on — without the service provider knowing who they actually&nbsp;are.</p><p>Service providers can then send secure messages to the sorts of people whose input they need to make their services better, asking them if they would like to take&nbsp;part.</p><p>As part of this work, we will also ask people about their motivations for taking part. For example, is it because they have felt particularly frustrated about an experience, because of a general desire to contribute, because it’s interesting, or perhaps because they can earn some extra&nbsp;cash?</p><p>By getting the right insights and improving the way information is shared — in a way which protects people’s privacy and puts them in control — we believe more people will want to get involved in shaping the services they use to improve the quality of these services. At the same time it will cut the cost of finding people who want to take part: especially people whose needs or views don’t fit into the pattern of the majority of ‘mainstream’ service&nbsp;users.</p><p>The initial work for this was funded as part of delivering a <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/connecting-citizens-and-government-for-better-designed-services-9b58205185ce">CivTech sprint challenge</a>, which responded to the published challenge: “How can technology be used to engage citizens in designing Digital Public Services?” This next step brings these tools fully to life and makes them available to user researchers and service designers across the Scottish Government working on public services and the citizens they engage&nbsp;with.</p> What the tools&nbsp;do <p>Specifically, the tools help citizens:</p>  List details about themselves, including their preferences, so that these details are kept private and under their control, but can also be shared with others if the person wants&nbsp;to,  Apply for and connect to services without having to fill in&nbsp;forms,  Re-use information about themselves many times over in different circumstances, so they don’t have to keep repeating themselves when dealing with a different service,  Review projects they have been invited to and request participation in projects that they would like to take part&nbsp;in,  Provide safe and secure messaging between themselves and service providers.  <p>Meanwhile, subscribers can:</p>  Create projects,  Invite citizens to participate,  Streamline and make consistent a lot of routine administration,  recruit citizens based on the criteria needed without citizens needing to reveal these often protected characteristics,  gain an overview of all design projects, including metrics like participants’ feedback,  view a showcase of present and past projects in the same organisation, so they can better maintain and share best practice and past learning.  <p>We are really excited to be contributing to this project, which takes us another step towards our mission of putting citizens at the centre of services that genuinely work for&nbsp;them.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/supporting-citizen-participation-in-the-design-of-public-services-d3a56e6aa97">Supporting citizen participation in the design of public services</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>The UK Gambling Commission set out new regulations in May 2019 in an aim to make gambling safer and more fair for users. A key focus of this was around identity verification for online gambling, with new rules enforcing that operators must verify a customers age before they deposit into an account, gamble using their own money or a free bet bonus, or access “free to play” versions of gambling games.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, the commission has encouraged operators to consider using AI-Powered Verification applications. These applications aim to solve the challenges created by these new regulations by streamlining the verification process and making it faster and simpler.</p>
<p>The easiest way to apply these applications to a platform is working with an identity verification partner with experience in gaming. Here are the key factors to keep in mind when looking for an ID Verification partner:</p>
 Due Diligence&nbsp; 
<p>It’s vital to do your due diligence and make sure an identity verification partner is the best choice. This comes in the form of experience: just because a service, like AI-Powered Verification, is new, doesn’t mean the company behind it should be new too.</p>
<p>It’s vital to work with a company that has the experience and can show they know how to deliver a flawless product, as well as have a detailed background working within the market.</p>
 Honesty and Trust 
<p>Honesty and trust are two vital elements when dealing with suppliers, but it can be difficult to find in an undeveloped industry. Currently, there’s no perfect solution to the challenges that come with ID verification, so the best partners are ones that will admit their shortcomings and be transparent with their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>The role of an ID verification partner is to assist you with mitigating risk, as well as outline the limitations of the technology. You should be looking for a provider that is open and not only assists you, but also raises the bar around your compliance responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>
 Security&nbsp; 
<p>Security is a business-critical factor that is sometimes overlooked when discussing advances in technology. However, RagTech sees rapid evolution and, thus, security around protecting data and privacy should be a key focus – a non-negotiable element of a partnership.</p>
<p>It will be vital to discuss the level of security that is offered by an ID verification partner, as it is something that is crucial for your most valuable asset, the customers.&nbsp;</p>
 Support 
<p>Whether a company is a startup or a well established vendor, the key behind their success will be the implementation of an idea, rather than the idea itself. That’s why it’s vital to find a partner that has a solid team behind them, that will deliver a service successfully, as well as share in-depth plans, detailing how they will deliver on their promises.&nbsp;</p>
 Engagement With the Regulators 
<p>When it comes down to it, betting service relies on the regulators. Their acceptance of your service and ID verification applications can make or break your approach to compliance. Your partner should be just as interested in this area as you are and should be constantly providing support with the regulators. If they don’t show a clear interest in this, then you should ask yourself if you are engaging with the correct solution.&nbsp;</p>
 Global Scalability 
<p>As we all know, compliance is the most expensive and complex part of a gaming company’s operation and businesses grow and expand into new markets, the cost and complexity only increases.</p>
<p>This means it’s vital to have an ID verification partner that is able to scale up and address multiple jurisdictions and competing compliance regimes. Working with a partner that is able to do this will minimise growing pains, especially one that is able to apply their solutions globally.&nbsp;</p>

 Organising #BeyondtheRules at Dark Matter Labs — 2/4  Compounding learning and constructing legibility <p>This piece was authored by a member of the Dark Matter Labs team based in the UK as part of the #BeyondtheRules project and, as such, is written in British English and has particular references to contexts in the&nbsp;UK.</p><p>This blog was written in September 2021 and reflects our learning at that&nbsp;time.</p> Our Context <p>In a context of climate breakdown and technological disruption, Dark Matter Labs works to accelerate societal transition towards collective care, shared agency, long-termism and interconnectedness. We focus on the dark matter — the invisible structures responsible for producing the majority of the world around us, from policy and regulation to finance and data, governance and democratic participation, organisational culture and identity.</p><p>Our context as an organisation, and from which the learning that we share here is anchored, is largely defined by&nbsp;being:</p>  Mission-led  Focused on discovery and&nbsp;learning  International with a planetary view  Primarily virtual  Evolving constantly  <p><a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-e59e4f5dd32f">Blog 1</a> in this series shared more information on our context and current structure.</p><p>In this 4-part blog series, we share how we have been building the organisational infrastructure for this work and what we are learning as we go. This blog focuses on how we are organising to navigate complex, emergent&nbsp;work.</p><p>In <a href="https://darkmatter-labs.medium.com/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-e59e4f5dd32f">blog 1</a> we discussed how we are a learning-based organisation — we enter most of our work not knowing the outcome — and sitting with uncertainty, complexity, and emergence is in every part of our fabric. Indeed, our own ‘dark matter’ and the organisational infrastructures that we build to shape how we show up together is also emergent. We are each constantly taking on and shedding roles; alongside, our projects and who works on them regularly shift and change as does the scope and nature of those projects and how they collaborate towards broader missions. Aside from our shared intention, there is little in how we work that is&nbsp;fixed.</p><p>This allows our work to genuinely reflect the complex emergence of our reality and for us each to autonomously follow what we see is needed to fulfil our missions, which is constantly evolving. This way of organising can create significant challenges for people to navigate themselves through the many moving parts of these systems (blog 3 will share more on our system of self-management, which is a needed complement to&nbsp;this).</p><p>We are learning (at times through moments of pain) about the need and means&nbsp;to:</p>  actively and intentionally construct (because it is indeed a social construct and takes work to build) just enough legibility of the system — in a way that updates itself as the system&nbsp;moves  and actively compound learning across that&nbsp;system  <p>These crafts play a role in liberating each of us to do our work incrementally well, enabling a shared wisdom that is beyond what any of us can reach on our&nbsp;own.</p><p>How we do this takes different forms and is constantly under development. Some of these forms we describe&nbsp;below.</p> Compounding learning <p>We use the word ‘compounding’ intentionally to nod to the difference between learning — which can involve somebody learning something and/or sharing that with somebody or many others — and the compounding of learning* — which involves different learning coming together to create a new augmented level of shared understanding as a&nbsp;result.</p><p>Creating the conditions for this type of learning is a craft and one that we recognise to be among the most important for working in complexity and emergence, especially as an international team. In doing this, building a plural peer community of interest and practice, mutual accountability, collective credibility, and shared capabilities unlocks a bigger potential for impact than any of us would be able to individually. More about the theory of that in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/beyondtherules-e3ab44f0dc3">this&nbsp;blog</a>.</p><p>*Distinct from the definition of compound learning described <a href="https://medium.com/personal-growth/compound-learning-the-most-powerful-tool-for-acquiring-skills-faster-123e14f9f9d9">here</a> as used by Warren Buffet. There may be others who speak of this way of understanding compound learning that we are not yet aware of — if you are we would love to hear about&nbsp;it.</p> DM Downloads <p>DM Downloads is a bi-weekly virtual space curated to compound learning across similar or complementary lines of work across the ecosystem.</p><p>The topics are identified by the session curator, who considers the cross-cutting frameworks of DM (practices, missions, deep code innovations etc) and makes a schedule according to how advanced or ready each one is to present new material, how strategic it is to have some conversations based on some upcoming opportunities or developments, as well as their potential for cross-pollination. The schedule is shared, open for comment and suggestions.</p><p>The structure of the Downloads is:</p>  Introduction by the&nbsp;curator  Presentations from people working on this topic (circa 5–7 mins each, held by a time-keeper), sharing what they have been doing and learning in the&nbsp;work  An open discussion for them to share what comes up in hearing each others’ work, and for the wider group to share questions, thoughts and&nbsp;ideas  <p>We write up the key takeaways shared and discussed for a broader audience through our ‘DM Notes’ series on our <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/">provocations page</a> to share them more widely and invite interaction (part of our practice of Working Out Loud — see more on this&nbsp;below).</p><p>The leap in shared understanding of our work is noticeable following the launch of these spaces. This is evident in their attendance (normally at least half the team), the high levels of the team watching (and watching back) the recordings as well as the internal appreciation expressed after each one. DM Downloads are also becoming an essential tool in giving new DM members a quick overview of some practices that might relate to their work in their onboarding.</p> DM Debates <p>DM Debates is a new bi-weekly open forum for discussing and developing some of the core assumptions we hold in our work and as an organisation — whether this isour stance on universal basic income or the philosophical dilemmas of a tree having self-sovereignty.</p><p>The topics are organised by people nominating and voting for topics they’d like to discuss — those with more votes are debated first. The format involves two (self-nominated) people who propose alternative viewpoints to the question, followed by an open (self-facilitated and self-moderated discussion) with 5 points of view per person as a loose guide. The speakers can comment on the discussion at the end and somebody self-nominates to capture the main points and relay them back at the end. One person captures the core points discussed and relays them back in summary at the end of the&nbsp;session.</p><p>Both our Debates and Downloads are org-wide optional spaces for anyone interested to join. They are recorded and shared so that people can also watch them in their own time or read the presentations, according to their preference.</p> Gatherings <p>Nothing can match the impact that gathering together in a relaxed way has on our sense of learning, connection and understanding. Now that we are 55 or so people across 15+ countries the actual logistics of this is huge; a central group plays a role to help consider logistics and structure of how we gather, involving people across DM in the&nbsp;process.</p><p>Within a pandemic and in the context of climate breakdown, we are still working out the degree of face to face / hybrid / virtual that we will need to balance (recognising that these decisions have important implications).</p><p>In August 2021 we held a hybrid gathering where we gathered across 7 geographical clusters local to the team over four days. By that&nbsp;time:</p>  The team had not physically met since December&nbsp;2019  In that time the makeup of the team had changed significantly, we had almost tripled in size and the majority of DM people had not met more than one other DMer in&nbsp;person.  We had run a series of virtual Gatherings which had strived to test the limits of what can be achieved to build cohesion and legibility across the organisation in the virtual space during the first 18 months of the Pandemic.  <p>We knew it was such an important moment for learning how we might do this going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>We approached the challenge of working with different time zones&nbsp;by:</p>  Splitting the time table for everyone between the same synchronous and asynchronous sessions. So for 6 hours every day the team were connected together for all team sessions (Europe Morning, Asia Evening) and the other 18 hours were for each cluster to connect with each other and work together on topics set in the synchronous times from that&nbsp;day.  A central group orchestrated the schedule and logistics, while clusters led their local schedules and activities.  We nominated both Facilitators in each cluster to ensure timekeeping during the synchronous times of day and host content related conversations in asynchronous time and ‘Ministers of fun’ who were responsible for ensuring the team were making enough time to decompress, connect with each other, rest and eat well across the programme.  <p>Things that worked&nbsp;well</p>  Meeting people physically was the highlight for everyone (a feeling of belonging, connection, and a better understanding of DML and the “gorgeous human beings” / brilliant minds that make up the&nbsp;team:)  Quality of the content delivered was high and the subjects we chose were good for the time (The opportunity to learn more about DML as an organisation -history, finance, etc — and community -shared values, aspirations etc)  Overall flow of the gathering, the balance of synchronous and asynchronous time, roles different people played, quality of content in sessions (Mix of online and offline. Time spent together in clusters. Mix of lofty but fiercely practical. Range of voices. Time for conversation and exploration. Ways to capture the pulse of the org. Great&nbsp;hosting)  <p>Things that we can learn and develop going&nbsp;forward</p>  The quantity of content was very high and people felt compressed - in future, presentations move into videos that we watch&nbsp;offline  Overall, participants requested more together time for sharing experience, exploring more personal topics to open space and breakout conversations on the content. In future, more time for open space or chance for people to follow their own&nbsp;energy  Clusters experienced the gathering in quite different ways according to factors like group size. In future, more training / better equipped/briefed local facilitators with more sessions delivered by them in the local context to be responsive to the nuances of each&nbsp;cluster.  <p>We intend to move&nbsp;towards:</p>  As all team physical gatherings become less and less likely we are looking to how do we both drive down the impact of the team convening, running them with minimal to no flights and making them a more regular fixture as a part of our organisation’s rhythm and practice.  This is all part of a flow and rhythm that includes DM Downloads, DM Debates, All team Critical Sessions and Project team site visits/pop up studios where there is an emphasis on working in person, in groups, on work, that has been set free by everything else around&nbsp;it.  Physical gatherings can then be focused on spaces to connect deeply with each other, reflect, deliberate, work together and&nbsp;play  The clusters in Malmö, Sweden; Jeju, South Korea; Reading, UK; Venice,&nbsp;Italy Working Out Loud and Declaring Assumptions <p>According to <a href="https://www.toolshero.com/personal-development/working-out-loud/">this Tools Hero&nbsp;article</a>:</p><blockquote>“the concept of Working Out Loud was first described by Bryce Willians. In 2010 he published the blog post ‘When will we work out loud? Soon!’ on his blog The BrycesWrite. When he came up with the concept, he proposed the following simple formula for&nbsp;WOL:</blockquote><blockquote>Working out loud = observable work + narrating your&nbsp;work</blockquote><p>Later the concept would be expanded upon by John Stepper. Today Stepper advocates the effectiveness of the concept worldwide. In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpjNl3Z10uc">TED Talk</a>, he stated that with WOL, he was stimulating a worldwide movement.”</p><p>Similarly, for us working out loud means declaring your work and, in particular, declaring/narrating the assumptions behind the direction that you are taking, so that the wider system&nbsp;can:</p>  See the direction you are going in (and when we are all doing this, sense how the system is moving and&nbsp;fluxing)  Learn from your findings and assumptions and how you act on&nbsp;them  Give you useful comments, feedback or thoughts to help&nbsp;you  <p>We use Slack as our main day-to-day communication channel to assist this&nbsp;process.</p>  Each team member posts a brief daily update in Slack’s org-hq channel on roughly their work of the day (some focus on what they are looking to learn, or questions they are sat&nbsp;with)  We declare wider decisions and their reasons into relevant slack channels, depending on their&nbsp;scope  Example of Working Out Loud in Slack&nbsp;posts<p>Part of the art of this is learning how to work out loud without creating information or task overload or overwhelm. This is nuanced for each person and there are many factors balanced in doing this, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Our hq posts per person are 1 per day only, to keep manageable  Slack channel posts focused on declaring and sharing decisions and assumptions kept to what is needed and posted only where needed (inc using Slack group tags so that messages reach the right&nbsp;people)  More detailed records stored on Notion, optional for people to&nbsp;access  Each team member individually managing their notifications, blocking out their schedule as needed for undisturbed time and practically managing their time and space (with training on prioritisation and time management to support that and tech support for information management)  <p>This area warrants a blog in itself so this just nods to some of the considerations in how we make these critical practices manageable.</p> Constructing Legibility <blockquote>“…in today’s world we find ourselves far from shore where things are uncertain, complex, and dynamic. As we all learn the practice of strategic design by doing, and collectively establish the field, legibility is the key. Trailblazing, here, is about going out of your way to make your path&nbsp;legible.</blockquote><blockquote>That means always leaving a few lanterns floating on the water to share not just where you went, but how you got&nbsp;there.”</blockquote><blockquote><a href="http://helsinkidesignlab.org/pages/posters.html">Helsinki Design&nbsp;Lab</a></blockquote><p>Navigating a dynamic, ever-changing environment and making personal choices that have reference to these different levels of consideration is complex. As the degrees of complexity increase, it has become clear how autonomy in this system — without finding the system navigable — can be debilitating. It can be, for example, particularly debilitating for those who typically work with high responsibility-taking (for example, the people who wrap up all the loose ends, think through the details and thrive in clear logic and clarity).</p><p>We have been developing scaffolding to help us to see the ecosystem of people within DML, their roles, ambitions, ways of working and how these link to our contract, finances and missions, in ways that enables a broad variety of personality types to confidently embrace their autonomy.</p> Roles and responsibilities <p>At DM, a role is not a job title; it is an area of responsibility that serves a purpose. Each of us will regularly change (pick up, hand over, build new) roles so that we can be responsive to situations at hand. Early in 2021, we were starting to feel the impact of not having a legible system for who was holding which roles at any given time and the responsibilities they entailed, which we recognised was bringing a range of risks, including:</p>  *Stepping on each other’s toes*<br>Wait, you’ve already been working on this? Me&nbsp;too.  *Spreading that energy marmalade too thin*<br>Not sure how I got here, but I have way too many responsibilities at the&nbsp;moment  *Things falling between the cracks*<br>Oh, I thought YOU were doing&nbsp;this?  *Unknown Skills Spectrum*<br>How do I find someone with a specific skill or expertise?  *Lost and Stuck*<br>I don’t see clear pathways to grow and develop in the organisation  *Unknown Capacity*<br>How do I estimate the capacity of people? I need help&nbsp;now.  <p>As we now reach over 50 people, creating just enough shared legibility is one of our most important crafts for the DM team to self-navigate this ever-moving decentralized system.</p><p>A group within DML has been working on how we can each codify (in a decentralised way) our roles and responsibilities in a way that reflects its dynamic evolutionary nature. The approach thinks about roles are cards that we hold at any given time (a role played within a mission, a project or a team), some of which we may put down and pick up over time. Each role card has a description of the role and an overview of its responsibilities both to and from other roles (described by the cardholder or a former holder). Alongside this people can declare which cards they hope to put down or wish to pick up in the future, so that those building future projects or building teams for new projects can spot patterns, see who might be interested and can reach out to each other to&nbsp;discuss.</p><p>This role cards system is currently being developed and trialled.</p>Screenshot from a Miroboard where the DM team identified and described their role&nbsp;cardsScreenshot from a Miroboard where the DM team identified responsibilities and accountabilities between their role cards and&nbsp;others’<p>Being able to visualise the current and upcoming capacity of team members is an important aid to this in helping us&nbsp;to:</p>  Spot when people are over-capacity and provide them with care (care is not one person’s role, this is in all of our&nbsp;roles)  Recognise when people may (or may not) have upcoming capacity so that people can navigate whether to invite them to join a piece of&nbsp;work  Get a sense of the patterns that play out and if there is anything we need to be collectively aware of or address in those&nbsp;patterns  <p>This area of work intersects with ‘external rules’ (e.g. regulation) that are part of the systems that we work in.&nbsp;Namely:</p>  Transfer pricing calculations (these are transfers between legal entities that are required to meet international tax law, e.g. where a team member works significantly on a piece of work contracted by a legal entity that they are not paid&nbsp;from)  Project reporting (where a breakdown of personnel cost or time spent is required as part of our contracts)  <p>We seek to collate and fully comply with this information whilst not being driven by it. The current system being trialled involves each DM team member indicating their capacity across their projects per month on their personal Nation page, information which is then drawn through synced or shared databases to create an overview of shared capacity per project and per mission over time. Whilst we recognise that using an FTE and capacity approach is less than ideal, at this stage it fulfils a need for shared information that assists us to navigate our way through the system whilst we work towards an alternative approach in the&nbsp;future.</p> DM missions portfolio <p>Constructing legibility about the missions that we are working towards and the work that we do towards them is another area that we have focused significant energy to this year. This has been covered by a few blogs recently, including<a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/organising-beyondtherules-at-dark-matter-labs-e59e4f5dd32f"> blog 1 of this series</a> (section: ‘Led by Planetary Missions’) and this <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/dm-note-5-50e46540dd05">DM Note</a> on Mission Holding at&nbsp;DM.</p> Centers and&nbsp;horizons <p>One of the difficult practical things about working in emergent systems is when to draw a line around an enquiry or the scope of our work. Most of the questions that we explore are interconnected, complex questions and as inquisitive people who want to do things well we have a cultural tendency to overwork as a result — e.g. what we might have been envisioned as a short enquiry becomes an expansive systems map and forum. It is hard to be true to the topics we explore whilst trying to artificially bound them (and indeed is problematic in many ways to do so); and yet, not bounding them can result in overwork by the team and overburdening ourselves in partnerships (and partners perhaps wondering why we keep broadening the&nbsp;remit).</p><p>Recent conversations have included thinking early on about where the horizons are for our work. Recognising that a horizon is not a boundary or an end, only the limit of what we can perceive (and that this horizon shifts depending on where we are), by considering the horizons to a piece of work we can identify how wide we intend to focus attention. Alongside, if we can identify the centres of our enquiries — the questions that sit at the heart of what we are trying to discover — then that horizon can be informed by distance from the centre and help to ground where energy is focused. This is an idea more than a practice, at&nbsp;present.</p> Manuals of&nbsp;Me <p>The iterative dynamic nature of our organising requires us to all have strong skills in self-management, much of which means the ability to build good relationships. Since this is such a critical part of our work we have a part-time team member focused specifically on supporting these team capabilities, running internal training on holding boundaries, building relationships, giving and receiving clean feedback, time management, etc.</p><p>This is complemented by team members building a Manual of Me, outlining how they like to work, what roles they like to play, hours they like to work, things that help us to understand them so that we can all get better at navigating each other. This becomes an incredibly valuable resource at the point of groups newly working together and discovering what it means to work together&nbsp;well.</p>Screenshot of Manuals of Me in our shared&nbsp;Drive<p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/dmls-manual-of-us-d41b1c235869">Read more here</a> on how we think ‘Manuals of We’ can help partners to navigate each other during collaborations and example of one that we made for one of our partnerships.</p> Wielding tech <p>Tech plays a really important role in this area of our work, helping to build efficiency and simplicity in what might otherwise be hugely cumbersome. Our Tech and Tools group does incredible work finding ways that tech can create shortcuts through what already exists (rather than detours, creating extra work). The main platforms that we use currently are:</p>  Notion: as a shared database, project and info management space  Slack: for direct communication, updates and&nbsp;sharing  Google Workspace: for meetings, shared folders, shared documents (presentations, spreadsheets etc), shared calendars and emails (which is mainly for external communication)  Miro: for ideation and sense-making  Alongside Kumu, Adobe, Airtable, Discord, Loom and&nbsp;others  Screenshot from a recent Tech and Tools meeting on tool integrations<p>The tech and tools group learn how to wield these tools and to integrate them in a way that maximises our shared efficiency and supports the wider team to upskill. For example, our shared financial dashboard on Notion draws through information from finance meeting notes (using synching blocks) and forecasting spreadsheets (using integrations) to create an internal dashboard for the whole team to view our financial situation and considerations. The userface presents on the information useful but draws it from existing information in our systems, meaning that there is no additional work required for the finance team to maintain&nbsp;it.</p>Screenshot from recent Tech and Tools presentation discussing some of our key upcoming legibility and learning plans of&nbsp;work<p>In blog 3, we will look at how we are working towards a distributed system of governance through self-management, legal stewardship and other means. It looks at the platform of deep care, security and safety required for&nbsp;this.</p><p>If you would like to receive updates (every few weeks/months) about the #BeyondtheRules project you can do so via <a href="https://dark-matter-labs.typeform.com/to/jpm8rdp1?typeform-source=provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">this short form</a>.

 Ontology’s Chief of Ecosystem Partnerships Presents At The European Identity and Cloud Conference <p>This week, Gloria Wu, our Chief of Ecosystem Partnerships, gave a presentation at the <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021">European Identity and Cloud Conference</a> on ‘The Rise of An Identity-Native Web 3.0’. Hosted in Germany, the conference brought together leading experts from within the technology and security sectors to discuss some of the latest developments, successes, and issues in the identity and cloud spaces over the last year. Joining virtually, Gloria provided some fascinating insights into the formation of identity in the incoming world of Web 3.0, as well as commentating on how native citizens of Web 3.0 are forging their own identities and reputations. If you missed the event, don’t worry! We have put together a recap blog below, including some of the key&nbsp;points.</p><p>The evolution of human identification and reputation has had many stages. Before modernity, people’s identity was closely related to their reputation and standing within a social group. In the industrial age, this moved on to see people’s identities become influenced by their credentials on paper, therefore becoming closely linked to things outside of themselves in the form of physical verifications about their jobs, houses, tax numbers, nationalities, and much more. The first iteration of the internet allowed users to move away from paper verification and extend their identity into the digital sphere. By gaining easier access to information, their identity was changed by the ability to connect, albeit rather basically, with digital resources and virtual networks.</p><p>In Web 2.0, this was taken a step further — people began to engage more actively on the internet through comment features on websites, chatrooms and social media platforms. Our digital identities grew through increased data exchange, as we created digital footprints of our online selves. Data processing and collection became a highly lucrative resource for companies, with little to no regulation of data harvesting and its uses. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-scandal-fallout.html">Cambridge Analytica</a> scandal laid bare the dangers of this insatiable data economy which inadvertently gave big tech giants control of millions of users’ information. Indeed, it highlighted the complete lack of privacy and oversight that people have&nbsp;online.</p><p>There are a host of problems associated with identity and reputation in Web 2.0, not least the fact that people have little control over data ownership. On nearly all websites, sensitive data is required for identity verification and reputation is ultimately locked in client servers. Companies use non-transparent algorithms to collect data, leaving people unaware of how companies are using the information they share. The network effect, a phenomenon whereby a product or service gains additional value as more people use it, has led to the rise of the data economy. Companies are incentivized to collect as much information as possible about the people using their services which, of course, leads to privacy and security concerns as centralized systems no longer possess the power to keep user data safe. The fact that data pools in Web 2.0 are also highly fragmented further exacerbates the potential for issues, as there are many separate areas on the web where sensitive information can be breached, edited, or&nbsp;lost.</p><p>Web 3.0, the internet’s third iteration has begun in earnest, and now users can take back control of their digital identities by using more distributed, interoperable, and self sovereign applications. As we move into the next stage, it is essential that we revamp identity and reputation management using Distributed Ledger Technology. Decentralized identity applications built on blockchain, such as Ontology’s <a href="https://ontid.ont.io/">ONT ID</a>, can help users defend their data and privacy. Through these applications, the data owner is able to authorize access to their data. To combat the lack of a standard process to support proper valuation and trading of data, peer-to-peer, cross-platform data marketplaces can be used. Open API ensures compatibility with applications on any infrastructure and reputation ratings can also help to establish trust between&nbsp;peers.</p><p>In the real world, reputation directly influences social capital, authority, status, eligibility and access to opportunities. In the digital world, reputation manifests into profiles, hierarchies, tags, and scores that determine the privileges that are granted to users. Digital reputation scores can be created through the collation of all relevant data related to an individual. These scores can be linked to an individual’s digital identity and stored on-chain, allowing any entity within the digital ecosystem to verify information and assess that individual’s creditworthiness or reputation score. Web 3.0 would stand to benefit greatly from such protocols, which would help to verify an individual’s eligibility to enter and participate in a system in a transparent way.</p><p>Web 3.0 is starting to see the emergence of ‘massive user data’. Within an on-chain context, such data takes the form of transaction data, smart contracts, digital assets and ownership history, and much more. Off chain, it looks like in-app data from games or other apps, reviews and ratings from different platforms, user profile information from social networks, financial data, and KYC, amongst others. Web 3.0 native data, i.e. data that has maximum consistency and a minimal amount of additional components, is starting to come into play, which is helping to inform a new kind of identity and reputation. This is applicable in many different scenarios in Web 3.0. For example, when a user seeks entry to a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), they may be required to provide different types of personal data, such as proof of ownership of digital assets or social media verification to prove you are not a bot. This allows individuals to contribute to DAOs, where they can influence decision-making processes. Creditworthiness, which is used in decentralized finance to collateralized assets, also requires native data in order for users to avail of a DAO’s service provisions.</p><p>The question of whether it is better to have one reputation score for everything or multiple reputation scores for different contexts is a topic for debate. The benefits of reputation scores that can use on-chain data to reveal contributions to a certain project in the form of participation in bounty programs, development of product plug-ins, submitted proposals and governance votes are an exciting space to be explored.</p><p>Ontology enables a decentralized network environment that solves key issues of identity security and data integrity. Data sharing and productive collaboration is maximized by assuring that users can trust one another. Ontology helps to facilitate self-sovereign identity and privacy protection, data diversity, algorithmic versatility, and configurable reporting. The groundswell of momentum surrounding this area is evident in the Ontology community where we have reached over 1.5 million ONT ID users, with a diverse community spanning 30+ languages, over 190 partners, and 316 nodes in total. We are excited to be at the forefront of a new revolution for identity in Web 3.0 and are honoured that so many companies and individuals are putting their faith in our solutions to guide them into this exciting new&nbsp;era.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

			 Cyrille De Ciancio is DevOps Engineer at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p></p>
<p>My name is Cyrille De Ciancio, I’m 33 years old and I live in France near the Luxembourgish border. I started my professional career in Luxembourg as a system engineer in an international bank. After seven years working in Luxembourg, I’ve decided to move to Asia.</p>
<p>I first landed in Hong Kong where I worked for 3 years, then with my family, we decided to move to Bangkok in Thailand where we stayed for a year and a half.</p>
<p>My professional path allowed me to meet and learn how to work with people from all around the world, and it brought me valuable soft skills which are (to me) even more important than the technical ones.</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I was in Thailand when I decided to move back to Europe and look for a job. During my research, I saw a DevOps open position on Tokeny’s website and I’ve applied. From the first interview, I had a very good feeling about Tokeny, the team, its culture and its ambitions.</p>
<p>We moved forward with other interviews and a few weeks later I joined the company.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>Working at Tokeny brings me all the components I need to be professionally beaming: trust, autonomy, listening… On top of that, there are so many technical challenges which need to be tackled, together with an impressively skilled tech team, the motivation is always at a high level.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Besides new technologies, traveling and discovering new countries, different people and cultures have always been very important to me, I love it. I really like getting deep into the countryside of places I’m visiting.</p>
<p>I also love cooking but honestly I still need more practise 🙂</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p></p>
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>My dream is quite simple: I wish a long, happy and healthy life for my family and everyone else I share my life with.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>I would love to live in a world where frontiers do not matter much. A world where we would teach kids how to become happy before teaching them how to become rich.</p>

<p>The Holochain development team is moving to regular weekly releases of the Holochain conductor, HDK, and supporting libraries. These regular releases will bring incremental improvements in stability, performance, and developer ergonomics. This comes at the right time, because Dev Camp 8 is starting on September 28th – less than two weeks! Yes, it’s finally here!</p><p>This week’s release, Holochain v0.0.106, is a small one in terms of developer-facing features, bringing a new admin API endpoint for hApp uninstallation and the first iteration of a ‘web hApp bundle’ format. Along with some low-level features… just small ones, like, you know… sharding (!!!)</p><p>[ EDIT 17 Sept: The changelog has one correction; relaxed chain top ordering isn't available yet. ]</p><p>[ EDIT 20 Sept: I've added two breaking changes to the changelog; app developers take note! ]</p> Dev Camp 8: huge turnout, exciting curriculum <p>Yes, the community-led Dev Camp 8 is finally about to happen. We’ve all been astounded by the response — the organisers have received over 1500 applications from all over the world. That’s seven times more than last Dev Camp! This is a nice problem to have, but it has meant that the organisers have had to figure out how to deal with so many more participants. So they’ve taken the past couple months to strategise with the developer community and Holo organisation to make sure it’s a success for all.</p><p>It also adds some new features, which aren’t required for Dev Camp but are required for a couple of tools that will be used in Dev Camp. These tools are <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher">Launcher</a>, an end-user hApp runner, and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/create">create</a>, the beginning of a new RAD scaffolding tool. In order to support Launcher, the conductor admin API now has an `UninstallApp` endpoint and there’s a <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/973">new web hApp bundle format</a>.</p><p>To me, Launcher, create, and web hApp bundling feel like big news. They aren’t ready for prime time yet, though, so I’ll share more about them later.</p> Still time to register for Dev Camp! <p>Yes, that’s right. Even with the huge number of applications, and even though it starts in only 12 days, you can still join the Dev Camp. It’s free, the curriculum sounds really fun, and it’s got a great crew of leaders, facilitators, teachers, and mentors. It’ll last six weeks (with a break in the middle), with weekly live sessions for Europe time zones and support sessions for Asia-Pacific and the Americas. There’ll also be a Discord server where you can talk with participants and support folks any time you like.</p><p>I’ll write more about the Dev Camp next week, but in the meantime — <a href="https://holochain.org/dev-camp">go and sign up</a>!</p> Holochain v0.0.106 release notes  Sharding has landed (sort of) <p>The sharding code is all written, integrated, and ready to be turned on with a configuration setting. When it’s disabled, a Holochain conductor operates as it always has — in ‘full-sync’ mode, with every node storing a copy of every piece of data. This is how Holochain will be deployed on HoloPorts until we can test sharding further.</p><p>If you want to experiment with sharding, here’s how to turn it on in the conductor config:</p> <code>network:
    # … transport config excluded …
    tuning_params:
        gossip_dynamic_arcs: true
</code> 
<p>And if you’re feeling extra adventurous, there are <a href="https://docs.rs/kitsune_p2p_types/latest/kitsune_p2p_types/config/tuning_params_struct/struct.KitsuneP2pTuningParams.html">other gossip tuning params</a> you can play with too.</p> Web hApp bundles <p>There already is a hApp bundle format, which bundles up all the DNAs necessary for the Holochain side of a full hApp. You can use the <code>hc app</code> command, which takes a <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_types/0.0.1/holochain_types/app/struct.AppManifestCurrent.html">hApp manifest</a> file and produces a bundle with the extension <code>.happ</code>.</p><p>This new web hApp bundle and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain_types-0.0.6/crates/holochain_types/src/web_app/web_app_manifest/web_app_manifest_v1.rs">manifest format</a> (link to source code; documentation hasn’t been published yet) adds the ability to include a zip file full of web UI assets, along with the rest of the hApp, in a bundle with the extension <code>.webhapp</code>. This will be used as a common format for both Holo hosting and the Launcher.</p> Full changelog   [ EDIT: This feature is included, but a merge issue caused it to be inactive. It'll be reactivated in next week's release. ] Relaxed chain top ordering (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/939">#939</a> and<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/941"> #941</a>): If you’ve been getting <code>HeadMoved</code> errors when making lots of zome calls from your UI, this new feature could be helpful. Rather than having to call that function again if another function has beaten it, it allows you to specify that its batch of writes can be ‘rebased’ on the new chain top. This is an option for any entry logic that doesn’t require strict source chain ordering.  <code>WebAppManifest</code> and <code>hc web-app</code> (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/939">#973</a>): This is the beginning of a bundle format for hApps that contain both a DNA bundle and a web-based UI. This format will be used by both the upcoming Launcher and the Holo Hosting App.  <code>UninstallApp</code> (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/939">#969</a>): This admin API endpoint had already been stubbed out; now it’s functional. It allows hApp managers like the Launcher to completely remove a hApp.  Sharding compiled in (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/943">#943</a>): No longer hidden behind a feature flag, sharding can now be turned on with the conductor configuration parameter <code>network.tuning_params.gossip_dynamic_arcs</code>.  [ EDIT: Added to changelog 20 Sept ] Hashes are no longer serialised to Base64 strings by default; if you depend on this behaviour, add the <code>"encoding"</code> feature flag to the <code>holo_hash</code> dependency in your zome <code>Cargo.toml</code> file:    <code>holo_hash = {version = "0.0.6", features = ["encoding"]}</code>   [ EDIT: Added to changelog 20 Sept ] <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.106/hdk/prelude/struct.Timestamp.html"><code>Timestamp</code> structs have changed</a>. If your zome code or client code directly interacts with <code>Timestamps</code> and their serialised representations, you may need to do some refactoring. Otherwise, you should only need to recompile your zomes against HDK 0.0.106.  [ EDIT: Added to changelog 21 Sept ] <code><a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.106/hdk/time/fn.sys_time.html">sys_time</a></code> now returns a <code>Timestamp</code> rather than a <code>Duration</code>.   Documentation Drive follow-up: new goodies for new devs <p>A couple months ago, community dev <a href="https://github.com/Connoropolous">Connor Turland</a> instigated a Documentation Drive. (And I’m so grateful to him.) Here are three exciting things that came out of that work.</p> Updated Application Architecture <p>Of all the Core Concepts, the one I was least satisfied with was Application Architecture. I felt like it didn’t do a great job of explaining how hApps are put together and run, and Connor agreed. So he rewrote it, I massaged it and added new pictures, and now you can <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/2_application_architecture/">read the updated version</a>. If the Holochain stack never made sense to you before, it probably will now! (Also, it doesn’t talk about donuts anymore. 🍩 Hopefully this <a href="https://developer.holochain.org/concepts/2_application_architecture/#agent-centricity">more straightforward description</a> of agent-centricity is easier to understand.)</p> hApp development tutorials <p>There are two getting-started tutorials that show you, in actual code, how to create a hApp. <a href="https://github.com/holochain/happ-client-call-tutorial"><code>happ-client-call-tutorial</code></a>, written by Connor and <a href="https://github.com/jost-s">Jost Schulte</a>, shows you how to connect a UI to a hApp (in both TypeScript and Rust). There's also its companion <a href="https://github.com/holochain/happ-build-tutorial/"><code>happ-build-tutorial</code></a>, written by many in the community, that walks you through the basics of structuring, writing, compiling, and running a hApp.</p><p>[ EDIT: Previously I said Connor was solely responsible for <code>happ-build-tutorial</code>. ]</p> Holochain community wiki <p>A community knowledge repository has been sorely needed for a while. Previously, devs have had to comb through <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/">forum</a> posts, <a href="https://holochain-open-dev.github.io/blog/">Open Dev blog</a> posts, <a href="https://github.com/holochain">GitHub</a> readmes, and <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/tag/dev-pulse/">Dev Pulses</a> to find good quality information. Now there’s a place to put the best of it! The <a href="https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/wiki/wiki">community wiki</a> already has a number of great guides and howtos, and there’s always room for more contributions. It’s not technically an official resource, but the folks writing articles in there are so skilled that it’s probably more useful than the <a href="https://developer.holochain.org">official dev portal</a> right now 😊</p> Holochain In Action videos <p>Holochain In Action is a community of developers actively building on and learning about Holochain. I’ve <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/a-developer-ecosystem-in-full-bloom/#holochain-in-action-a-community-of-co-learning">mentioned them before</a>, and invited you to <a href="https://forum.holochain.org/t/about-the-holochain-in-action-category/5448">join the community</a>, but I realised that their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJwIuwkCI5HMSzHJpKys-RQ">weekly session recordings</a> really ought to be shared.</p><p>So let’s start with the most recent one, <a href="https://youtu.be/E2ISltVei38">session 17</a>. It showcases the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJwIuwkCI5HMSzHJpKys-RQ">Elemental Chess</a> hApp and dives into the code, explaining how it implements player profiles and game invitations. If you’re working on a hApp with a social component, especially a game hApp, this would be a good one to watch.</p><p>Wow! That feels like plenty for this week. I have a feeling there will be an equal amount really soon — the developer ecosystem is growing faster than I can keep up with it!</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@lc_photography?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Leon Contreras</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/campfire?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

 Interview Credify’s Director of Engineering Shuichi Nagao 



<p>Vietnam has been an attractive place for innovation and international investment, especially in the technology industry. In this article, we would like to discuss with Shuichi Nagao, Credify’s co-founder and Director of Engineering, what businesses should know about Vietnam’s Information Technology (IT) resources, especially before entering the market.</p>



<p>Before founding Credify, Shuichi had been working as a Fullstack Engineer in the FinTech space, such as payment and blockchain (Ethereum). Since 2019, he has been running Credify mainly in Vietnam. From his diverse experiences, Shuichi can share his knowledge on Vietnam’s IT industry, and how businesses can leverage these resources.</p>







 Can you tell us about yourself and your journey from a full-stack developer to co-founder of Credify? 



<p>I’m Shu, a co-founder, and Director of Engineering. I learned machine learning at the University of Tokyo and in the last year of my university I joined a start-up company that two of my classmates founded, as software engineers. Through working with real products whose page views were like millions per day, I learned web development and iOS development. Eventually, this company was acquired by a big Japanese company for a decent amount of money, which was stunning to me. You know, the two of my classmates became millionaires! More importantly, you could impact/change people’s lives!</p>



<p>I have around 50 classmates, and at least 10 people out of 50, as far as I know, are entrepreneurs or very early-stage members of start-up companies. So I was interested in running my own business at some point, however, back in 2017, I decided to work as a software engineer in a FinTech company because I wanted to deep dive into complex software development to understand how systems work well before doing something for myself.</p>



<p>When I attended a tech conference on Ethereum in Tokyo, I met Makoto Tominaga and got along with him. At that time, I was interested in a different environment to challenge myself and impressed with Makoto’s vision and his experience and we started to work together in time.&nbsp;</p>



 As the co-founder of Credify, why did you choose Vietnam as the primary market? 



<p>Frankly speaking, I didn’t see Vietnam as the first market at the very beginning. Makoto and I came to Vietnam for software development at first, as we got a partner outsourcing company in Saigon. As we had been developing the MVP in Vietnam, we saw opportunities in the Vietnamese market (regulation in Vietnam, particularly around personal information, is not as well established as that in Japan, the economy is growing rapidly, etc.) and then we started to focus on the Vietnamese market. And also, the pandemic prevented us from moving to another country.</p>







 What do you think are the similarities of emerging markets in SouthEast Asia, and particularly Vietnam, regarding their IT resources? 



<p>The number of outsourcing companies is outstanding compared to developed countries. Due to the low cost compared with the developed countries, the emerging economies tend to have many outsourcing businesses, particularly in software development. In the outsourcing IT companies, you would work on different projects with quite limited periods of time (like every quarter) and you would need to strictly follow the requirements provided by clients or business analysts (I didn’t know of this position – Business Analyst – until I had come to Vietnam).</p>



<p>That engineers in the SEA speak English was impressive. I’m from Japan and find a lot of Japanese engineers with very good engineering skills without English speaking skills (writing &amp; reading are mostly fine). I think there is kind of correlations between technical skills and English skills particularly in SEA because they need to use English to learn new technologies, while Japanese, Korean, and Chinese have more information in their mother tongue.</p>



 What are the strengths and weaknesses of Vietnam’s emerging IT sector? 



<p>Vietnam has a significantly growing economy and more and more demands of hiring from IT companies, therefore from a macroeconomic perspective, the Vietnamese talents will keep becoming stronger. Besides, the competitiveness of Vietnamese engineers is strong compared to other countries in SEA with the solid government’s support for STEM education, so leader-class engineers in Vietnam will get good opportunities to work globally.</p>



<p>As a weakness, I would say the mindset. In nature that Vietnam has quite a number of outsourcing software companies, the product-driven mindset is not easy to cultivate. If you are assigned a new product every quarter, it will be difficult to love your product. I believe that great products and services will be created by a team that is passionate about their own products and services. That being said, there are more and more new growing IT startup companies in Vietnam nowadays, which I think will change this situation as engineers can have more opportunities to work for those growing product companies.</p>







 What are the most on-demand IT services, positions &amp; skills? How can Vietnam develop to meet that demand? 



<p>Engineering Manager and Tech Lead are very competitive. If you were to launch a new office in the IT sector in Vietnam (maybe a new company, maybe a subsidiary in Vietnam as a foreign company), you would need a software engineer who can build a product and a team. It goes without saying that this person should have both strong technical skills and management skills, but how can people develop these skills? I find Vietnamese engineers tend to follow the orders and try to complete them as much as possible by the due date (of course, not everybody), however, it is significantly important to understand (and make clear) the business requirements and figure out what exactly to do as a dev team by themselves without those orders. Having this self-starter mindset and ownership will be key.</p>



 What strategy should Vietnamese business use to best leverage this human resource, especially the increasing number of new freshers graduating from university? 



<p>Two things in my opinion; mentorship and branding. Working with top talent will be incredibly important particularly for juniors and freshers to set a role model. In my experience early days as a software engineer, I did pair programming with a great performer sometimes and I often asked senior engineers many questions like how to write testable code and how to design architecture. With regards to branding, good engineers bring more good engineers but finding the first ones is tough. Building a good reputation as to what the tech team does and making output by way of publishing tech blogs or open-source will be effective.</p>



 Finally, what are the qualities/values that Credify looks for in a potential employee developer? 



<p>I do value passion and mindset to grow our products together. Technical skills are important, but I like people who are passionate about what they do and I want to work with those people. I am sure that Credify can provide people with challenging and exciting opportunities.</p>



 About Shuichi Nagao

<p>Abstract — Smart contracts are being introduced to IOTA, which has proposed an interesting take on distributed ledgers by proposing the Tangle. The Tangle promises to provide a more scalable transaction infrastructure with lower fees, potentially overcoming limitations of Ethereum and other blochain-based ledgers. Due to the current alpha state of IOTA smart contracts, the official documentation lags and it is a bit of challenge to get a working setup. To help interested developers and the IOTA community to more quickly try out smart contracts, this article describes how to set up a private IOTA network with the latest state of the software and demonstrates a workable prediction market smart contract developed in&nbsp;Rust.</p> Introduction <p>Smart contracts are codified contracts using rules and algorithms that can automatically trigger and incur electronic transactions of cryptocurrencies like Ether. The expected economic impact of smart contracts is very large as they allow for improving the efficiency of many existing business models and they also allow for completely new business models. For instance payouts of insurance contracts can be automated using smart contracts or autonomous cars could also pay tolls and parking fees automatically.</p><p>While smart contracts are already well known amendments from blockchain approaches like Ethereum, these approaches suffer from shortcomings like low throughput, and high transaction costs. For these reasons, the IOTA foundation had set out to first propose a new and more scalable transaction system based on the so called “Tangle”. Secondly, IOTA version 2.0 is currently under development, and it includes an approach to smart contracts. Smart contracts under IOTA 2.0 are promised to be built on an infrastructure that both scales well, and incurs low transaction costs.</p><p>Before the background of a promising new approach for smart contracts, I started to explore how to set up a private IOTA network for development and how to develop and deploy a smart contract on it. As the IOTA developer documentation is lagging it was quite a challenge to get a working solution. Thus, the main contributions of this article are, (1) a proper description how to set up the network and how to enable smart contracts, and (2) a fully working demonstration smart contract, which implements a simple prediction market in which multiple network participants can predict and bet on a certain outcome of an&nbsp;event.</p><p>The outline of this article is, I give (1) an overview of IOTA and the network’s smart contract integration, (2) a description of how to set up an environment for developing and testing IOTA smart contracts, (3) an implementation of a simple prediction market as a smart contract, (4) some notes and insights on IOTA and smart contracts, and (5) a conclusion.</p> The IOTA Network and Smart Contracts <p>IOTA is about a new kind of public and permissionless distributed ledger for exchanging value and data. The IOTA network has been designed to overcome the main bottlenecks of Blockchain-based distributed ledgers. Due to the organization of transactions (of value) in a chain, there is just one end to append new ones, which makes it slow. Thus, in contrast to the Blockchain-based approaches the distributed ledger of IOTA is organized in a different way. The Blockchain, which is central to Bitcoin or Ethereum for instance, is replaced by the Tangle. The Tangle connects transactions via edges in a directed (and acyclical) graph (see next figure). In contrast to the Blockchain, there are multiple nodes (representing transactions) on which new edges to new nodes, i.e., transactions, can be appended.</p>The Tangle data structure of IOTA’s distributed ledger. Green: validated transactions, White: not yet validated, Grey: new transactions. <a href="https://iota-einsteiger-guide.de/was-ist-iota.html">Source</a> (2021–09–10)<p>Beside the data structure, there are further key differences to classic Blockchain-based approaches. The consent mechanism requires no miners because all users help in validating transactions. Therefore, transactions can be essentially conducted with zero fees. The current IOTA network still requires a central coordinator, defining trusted transaction milestones, which other transactions need to reference to be also trusted. To achieve true decentralization, the planned update to IOTA 2.0 should overcome this limitation.</p><p>The key properties and key promises of <a href="https://www.iota.org/get-started/what-is-iota">IOTA</a> are of&nbsp;being</p>  highly scalable by a new data structure allowing for parallel transactions  requiring few resources and being suitable for devices and&nbsp;sensors  having zero-fee transactions  running fast transactions  finally approving messages within&nbsp;seconds  providing a distributed network, which is robust against&nbsp;attacks  <p>These properties would enable a layer of trust and a very scalable and efficient messaging system for the <a href="https://www.iota.org/get-started/what-is-iota">“machine economy”</a> with a very large amount of devices connected to the Internet. The current version of IOTA on the Mainnet is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOTA_(technology)">1.5</a>, which went live in April 2021. Version 1.5 is seen as an intermediate step in maturing the IOTA technology and proving its usability and practical value. This would form the basis for smart contracts that use the messaging capabilities of the IOTA network. Smart contracts are supposed to be introduced in version 2.0 the latest and might <a href="https://twitter.com/iota/status/1428704497992413185">be even backported to 1.5</a>. At the time of writing, smart contracts are subject to development.</p>IOTA network layers. <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer/blob/develop/documentation/static/img/protocol_specification/layers.png">Source</a> (2021–09–10)<p>The design for IOTA 2.0 foresees different layers (see figure above) that separate the general underlying messaging, transacting, and validating infrastructure from the application layer, which comprises also smart contracts, which would then use layer 1 capabilities to realize their features. A main reason for separating smart contracts into another layer is to not compromise the messaging functionality. Smart contracts run on Wasp nodes on layer 2 in connection with Goshimmer on layer 1, responsible for conducting transactions and messaging (see next&nbsp;figure).</p>GoShimmer for messaging and Wasp nodes for smart contracts in an IOTA 2.0 network. <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/wasp/blob/master/documentation/ISCP%20architecture%20description%20v3.pdf">Source</a> (2021–09–10)<p>Due to the separation of Wasp and Goshimmer, they need a technical capability to connect and interact with each other. Therefore, Goshimmer nodes contain a “txstream” plugin, which needs to be activated for connecting Wasp nodes. Smart contracts are developed in the Rust programming language. <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is known to generate very performant and memory efficient executables while preventing the developer from many classes of errors by a helpful compiler and a well-designed language. To test smart contracts and run unit tests against smart contract functionality, the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/iotaledger/wasp/packages/solo">“solo” environment</a> written in Go can be&nbsp;used.</p> Setup <p>The described setup defines a private IOTA 2.0 network you can run on your laptop. The network hosts a layer 1 Goshimmer node for messaging and a layer 2 Wasp node for running smart contracts. On this basis, the next chapter shows how to develop and deploy a smart contract to this&nbsp;network.</p> Environment <p>I used Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with latest updates and upgrades&nbsp;and</p>  installed git  installed <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">rust</a> 1.53.0 for developing native IOTA smart contracts by<br>curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs |&nbsp;sh  installed wasm-pack 0.10.0 for compiling smart contracts into “WebAssembly” binaries by<br>curl https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/init.sh -sSf |&nbsp;sh  <p>Installed dependencies for <a href="https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/blob/master/INSTALL.md">rocksdb</a> required by Goshimmer as its underlying database&nbsp;engine:</p>  sudo apt-get install libgflags-dev  sudo apt-get install libsnappy-dev  sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev  sudo apt-get install libbz2-dev  sudo apt-get install liblz4-dev  sudo apt-get install libzstd-dev  <p>Cloned and built Goshimmer 0.7.5 from the develop branch (in the version of 2021–08–16) according the following description:</p>  git clone -b develop <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer.git">https://github.com/iotaledger/goshimmer.git</a>  git checkout tags/v0.7.5  cd goshimmer  go build -tags&nbsp;rocksdb  <p>Prepared Goshimmer for transaction handling<br>Save the <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/prediction-market-smart-contract/blob/main/goshimmer/config.json">config.json file</a> to your Goshimmer directory to</p>  enable the txstream plugin, which allows Goshimmer to communicate with Wasp&nbsp;nodes  disable the portcheck plugin  <p>To check whether Goshimmer synchronizes its time and whether messaging works, open up the dashboard on your local machine by <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8081/dashboard">http://127.0.0.1:8081/dashboard</a>.

I report the design and implementation of a simple prediction market in Rust, how to build and deploy it, and finally how to use&nbsp;it.</p> Design <p>A classic example of realizing a smart contract is given by a prediction market. A prediction market is a virtual electronic market allowing to predict outcomes of future events by placing a monetary bet on a certain outcome. Such events could be sports events, political events, future prices of stocks, or other events with uncertain future outcomes. For instance, the outcome of a political election could be subject to predictions on a prediction market. A simple binary question to be answered by prediction market participants could be “Will candidate/team A win?” — with possible outcomes being “yes” or&nbsp;“no”.</p><p>Our design of a prediction market for demonstration purposes is simple. We omit a book maker and a pricing mechanism. Formally, we do not pose a question with predefined possible outcomes. Instead, market participants can bet basically on any outcome of an event with an arbitrary amount of tokens until the time for predictions is over. Afterwards, the winning outcome is determined and winning bets placed on the correct outcome receive back their share on the overall amount of tokens placed in bets. Assume, in total 700 tokens were bet on “no” and 300 tokens in total were bet on “yes”, and “yes” is the actual outcome. A single bet on “yes” with 100 tokens receives (100/300)*(700+300) = 333 tokens, making a win of 233&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>Realizing this design as a smart contract in the IOTA network allows to deploy one contract per question to be answered. The account deploying the contract is in control and has to specify the time until when bets can be placed on outcomes. The actual question to be answered has to be communicated in third party channels. Any network participant can then look up the contract and call a function to place a bet on an outcome by sending some IOTA from their wallet. Finally, after the time for predictions and bets has passed, the deploying account has to call a function to close the prediction market and to provide the actual outcome of the event and correct answer to the question. This triggers the evaluation of all bets with regard to the correct answer. Accounts with the correct answer receive the winning amount of IOTAs in a transaction.</p><p>Note that in a real world and more production-like scenario, one might consider using an <a href="https://blog.iota.org/introducing-iota-oracles/">oracle</a> to provide the outcome of an event. Oracles can stream off-chain data (about events) into the Tangle, so smart contracts can use this data in their evaluations.</p> Implementation <p>Smart contracts for the IOTA network can be implemented in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and then compiled to a <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/what/wasm">WebAssembly</a> file.</p><p>Our demonstration smart contract implemented in Rust can be viewed and cloned from this <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/prediction-market-smart-contract">repository</a>. The smart contract first exposes three functions for (1) initializing a prediction market, (2) placing a bet on an outcome, and (3) closing the prediction market for determining winners. When the contract is loaded, the mentioned functions’ implementations are made publicly available under the first string’s name, e.g., “initmarket”.</p><p>The first function should be called by the account deploying the contract for initialization. Optionally, the function can set an end time for betting using the parameter BETENDUTC, which is a date-and-time string in ISO format, assuming time in UTC. In case the parameter is omitted, bets can be placed at any time until the closemarket function is called (see&nbsp;below).</p><p>The second function allows to place a bet on a certain outcome value of an event, provided as parameter BETVALUE, e.g. “yes”. The amount to bet is the amount of IOTA sent with the function call. Bets must be placed in time before the betenddatetime has passed, which was set on initialization of the market. To save incoming bets for future evaluation to determine winners, I use two structs, defined in the beginning. That is, I define a hash map, mapping a betting account’s id to a Bet struct, which defines the amount of tokens and the outcome value of the bet. These custom structs are used instead of the built-in map offered by the context object of the function because only a proper hash map allows iterating over all keys and elements stored. As custom objects are not accommodated by the state stored in the context of the function, we need to jsonify it to produce a string, which can then be stored in the&nbsp;state.</p><p>The third function closes the prediction market and is to be called by the contract owner. Calls by other accounts will fail. The function can only be run after the specified end time has passed for predictions, and the function to close the market can be called successfully only once. The function requires a BETVALUE parameter, specifying the winning outcome, e.g., “yes”. The function runs through the stored bets, determines winning bets and the amount of IOTA coins they receive, and sends the IOTA to the wallets of the&nbsp;winners.</p> Build <p>To build the smart contract, one can pull the accompanying <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/prediction-market-smart-contract">repository</a> on github with the following structure:</p> * Cargo.toml <br>* src/lib.rs <br>* pkg/ <br>* target/ <p>The full Rust code of the smart contract is contained in a file called lib.rs. The structure and the naming of files follows standard conventions for Rust. To define dependencies of the smart contract code, the <a href="https://github.com/51nodes/prediction-market-smart-contract/blob/main/Cargo.toml">Cargo.toml file</a> reads as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>The most important dependency is wasmlib, which is the IOTA’s smart contract library, allowing to produce smart contracts as compiled WebAssembly files. Furthermore, serde is used for serializing custom state objects to json strings for storage in the smart contract’s state. chrono brings some date and time related functionality required to control the end of a prediction market.</p><p>To build the smart contract, run wasm-pack build in the directory where Cargo.toml resides. The other directories like pkg and target are created automatically in the build process. The compiled WebAssembly file is located in the pkg directory and named predictionmarket_bg.wasm.</p> Preparation <p>We proceed by deploying our simple smart contract compiled as a WebAssembly wasm&nbsp;file.</p><p>Note: please adapt the path to the wasm file if required.</p><p>./wasp-cli chain deploy-contract wasmtime predictionmarket "Prediction Market SC"&nbsp;./prediction-market-smart-contract/pkg/predictionmarket_bg.wasm --chain=predmarketchain --upload-quorum=1 -d --address-index=0</p><p>outputing:</p> uploaded blob to chain -- hash: 6wVabTkRUUGrQzEj8s4yuPC8dfaHGLsoHLXsqvveSw4hPosted on-ledger transaction BChQcWEmMptqRM1z4C9ZffTQXPebg1MMiEYENuAnV7KV containing 1 request:<br>- Request 4RkBSF6BAHgfamyJnXFy4r1YoVU9wvZ9b6uvXUjt2VWAfF5<br>Waiting for tx requests to be processed...<br>Posted off-ledger request 2JdtBzxjP4Bc6Tj2SnZPSctoYDHxuCAvPWJwn6ufMShJ6Lw <p>Now, functions can be called on the contract. First, the same wasp-cli that deployed the contract needs to call the initmarket function. There are two possibilities:</p><p>a) do not specify a specific an end date for the prediction market to simplify testing and development by this call&nbsp;./wasp-cli chain post-request predictionmarket initmarket --chain=predmarketchain</p><p>b) specify a specific end date and time for the prediction market. The iso format is used and UTC is assumed. In this way, all bets must be placed before this time and the market can be only closed after this time. Run&nbsp;./wasp-cli chain post-request predictionmarket initmarket string BETENDUTC string "2021-09-08 23:00" --chain=predmarketchain</p><p>Before placing a bet, we check the wallet’s balance with&nbsp;./wasp-cli balance</p><p>returning</p> Address index 0<br>Address: 1BAgmaSN1RYk5rbbxMK21CZo8t2zQ3EFeMwDPnMhQdQbs<br>Balance:<br>IOTA: 28653<br>------<br>Total: 28653 <p>For the deployed prediction market, we assume two possible outcomes “yes” and “no” on which bets can be submitted. To place a bet with 10 IOTA on “no”, we&nbsp;run</p><p>./wasp-cli chain post-request predictionmarket bet string BETVALUE string no --chain=predmarketchain -t&nbsp;IOTA:10</p><p>and afterwards, by&nbsp;./wasp-cli balance we see the wallet's balance reduced by 10&nbsp;IOTA.</p> Address index 0<br>Address: 1BAgmaSN1RYk5rbbxMK21CZo8t2zQ3EFeMwDPnMhQdQbs<br>Balance:<br>IOTA: 28643<br>------<br>Total: 28643 <p>We now introduce and prepare the setup for four more participants to the prediction market. Each participant requires another wasp wallet. Thus, we create four new subdirectories waspwallet2, waspwallet3, waspwallet4, waspwallet5 and copy wasp-cli and wasp-cli.json to those directories by repeating with regard to these directories</p><p>The last command initializes a new&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>In case the contract’s code is changed, it needs to be re-deployed using the first and main wasp-cli. You also need to re-deploy the chain on which the contract is deployed first. Due to the redeployment of the contract, the copied versions of wasp-cli.json (in waspwallet2 to waspwallet5 directories) miss the new address of the deployed predmarketchain chain. In this case, we need to get it back in there to be able to run bets on the same prediction market from another account. Either you noted the address of the chain when it was created, such&nbsp;as</p> activating chain nZBwoJi5q7KGk8D2cgm16PWrdM6aL2qTdCY27HHjZgrK.. OK. <p>or you perform a cat wasp-cli.json in the directory of your first wasp wallet, giving you some information like this (among other information):</p> {<br>  "chains": {<br>    "predmarketchain": "nZBwoJi5q7KGk8D2cgm16PWrdM6aL2qTdCY27HHjZgrK",<br>  }, <p>Now you need to provide this address of the predmarketchain to the new wasp wallets’ configuration files. To do this, you can run the following command for the new wallets in the respective directories (e.g. in waspwallet2 through waspwallet5 in our example).</p><p>./wasp-cli set chains.predmarketchain nZBwoJi5q7KGk8D2cgm16PWrdM6aL2qTdCY27HHjZgrK</p><p>Please adapt the chain’s actual address nZBwoJi5q7KGk8D2cgm16PWrdM6aL2qTdCY27HHjZgrK to&nbsp;yours.</p><p>Finally, all four new wasp wallets need to be funded. First, find out their address by running (for each new waspwallet subdirectory)</p><p>waspwallet2/wasp-cli address</p><p>Then, provide the funds using cli-wallet (in the directory where it resides on your computer) by&nbsp;running</p><p>./cli-wallet send-funds -amount 40000 -dest-addr 1Ah4cqMPdrDGx6Htapk7NZUxxcYHsP1C3oAugEYHVmACj</p><p>and replacing the address 1Ah4cqMPdrDGx6Htapk7NZUxxcYHsP1C3oAugEYHVmACj with the actual address found by running&nbsp;./wasp-cli balance before in the respective subdirectories (of waspwallet2 to waspwallet5).</p> Simulation of a Prediction Market <p>Now we are ready to place bets in the deployed contract’s prediction market on behalf of these four new participants. So, in the respective subdirectories we run&nbsp;say</p>  cd waspwallet2  ./wasp-cli chain post-request predictionmarket bet string BETVALUE string yes --chain=predmarketchain -t&nbsp;IOTA:100  cd&nbsp;../waspwallet3  ./wasp-cli chain post-request predictionmarket bet string BETVALUE string no --chain=predmarketchain -t&nbsp;IOTA:50  cd&nbsp;../waspwallet4  ./wasp-cli chain post-request predictionmarket bet string BETVALUE string yes --chain=predmarketchain -t&nbsp;IOTA:200  cd&nbsp;../waspwallet5  ./wasp-cli chain post-request predictionmarket bet string BETVALUE string yes --chain=predmarketchain -t&nbsp;IOTA:500  <p>Finally the contract owner (with the first wallet) can close the prediction market by running in the directory of the first&nbsp;wallet</p><p>./wasp-cli chain post-request predictionmarket closemarket string BETVALUE string no --chain=predmarketchain</p><p>In this example, the actual outcome is specified to be “no”. When running this command from a different wasp wallet’s directory, we obtain a log output on the Wasp&nbsp;node</p> You are not authorised to close the prediction market - only contract creator is allowed to close the market. <p>When successfully closing the prediction market, the Wasp node’s log&nbsp;outputs</p> CLOSEMARKET is executed:<br>the winning value is: "no"<br>total amount of bets placed on "no" is 60 IOTA<br>total amount of bets placed on "yes" is 800 IOTA<br>total amount of bets over all values: 860 IOTA<br>1FbCCHv9if3xbnRg3wJ7SY1kBFSdhNFR6Ax6haw6PhYDL placed a bet on "no", which is a WIN<br>bet amount: 10 IOTA; won amount: 143 IOTA; of total amount placed a bet on 860; where total amount per winning value: 60<br>transferring won amount of IOTA to: 1FbCCHv9if3xbnRg3wJ7SY1kBFSdhNFR6Ax6haw6PhYDL<br>1FZtVTCi2GDuQ1oMGZqpT38akLpcMiMv6a8MVKNJYYdsr placed a bet on "yes", which is not a win<br>1F81pGLKLhPb5ANFSGWQ7UPMSnPdahNZaZkgrcyaFXvpu placed a bet on "no", which is a WIN<br>bet amount: 50 IOTA; won amount: 716 IOTA; of total amount placed a bet on 860; where total amount per winning value: 60<br>transferring won amount of IOTA to: 1F81pGLKLhPb5ANFSGWQ7UPMSnPdahNZaZkgrcyaFXvpu<br>17jdFbAhWwF79fBEia6A8AYMTmMYncipaFhDTjsqUbMfp placed a bet on "yes", which is not a win<br>1BAgmaSN1RYk5rbbxMK21CZo8t2zQ3EFeMwDPnMhQdQbs placed a bet on "yes", which is not a win<br>consensus/action.go:338 postTransaction: POSTED TRANSACTION: 4Aw6PzQGkk6MFzPVAXZkz8RGiPocYxuxhA9o7qgeDN7h, number of inputs: 2, outputs: 3<br>EVENT: state was synced to block index #11, approving output: [0]4Aw6PzQGkk6MFzPVAXZkz8RGiPocYxuxhA9o7qgeDN7h<br>STATE TRANSITION TO #11. requests: 1, chain output: [0]4Aw6PzQGkk6MFzPVAXZkz8RGiPocYxuxhA9o7qgeDN7h <p>Revisiting the bets, we had placed the following ones:</p><p>Bets number 1 and 3 were on “no” and the bet was on the actual outcome “no”. So the total amount of IOTA was 860, the bets on “no” were only 60 IOTA in total. The share of bet number 1 is 10/60 and share of bet number 2 is 50/60. So, wasp wallet 1 receives 1/6 of 860 IOTA, i.e, 143 IOTA. And wasp wallet 3 receives 5/6 of 860 IOTA, i.e, 716 IOTA. Note that when transferring funds, a minimum transaction of fee of 1 IOTA is deducted from the amount to be transferred.</p><p>Note that running the closemarket function of the smart contract a second time leads to an error message in the Wasp node’s&nbsp;log:</p> the prediction market was already closed  Limitations <p>There are some limitations of the presented prediction market</p>  Only one contract per chain can be deployed because the bets are not stored per contract identification in the chain’s&nbsp;state  All bets are stored on-chain, so they are&nbsp;public  Each account (given by a wasp wallet) can place only one bet per deployed prediction market&nbsp;contract  The actual question asked by the prediction market and the possible outcomes have to be conveyed informally  Bets are against other market participants — there is no market&nbsp;maker   Insights <p>Along the way of producing this article and experimenting with IOTA smart contracts, many small insights were gained. With the hope that these insights will be helpful, I share them in the following.</p> Transaction Time <p>Running transactions in the described setup on a laptop can take several seconds when waiting for the wasp-cli commands to finish. However, they can be run asynchronously when using the wasp-cli, i.e., commands can return immediately after issuing a command. Of course, transactions can run in parallel. When running scripted wasp-cli requests, one has to take care not to create too much load on the Wasp node because otherwise requests will fail with “time out”-errors. To evaluate transaction times in a production setup on the Devnet or Mainnet, further investigations are required.</p> Transaction Fees <p>In principle fees for transactions and deployments are configurable. However, there are some minimum fees that apply such as for deploying a chain (100 IOTA), deploying a smart contract, and posting state changing requests to a smart contract (1 IOTA). With default minimum fees in mind, transaction costs in the IOTA network should be very low compared to transaction fees in the Ethereum network. Note that chain owners could also increase transaction fees.</p> Production Readiness <p>On a first shot, nothing really worked when trying to set up a private IOTA network based on public documentation. That is, one has to find workable versions of the software, find a proper configuration and parameters, and find working ways for funding wallets and deploying contracts. The IOTA 2.0 software is under development and special notice has to be taken on which versions to run and which version of the different pieces (Wasp, GoShimmer, cli) to combine. The documentation in <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/">IOTA’s repositories</a> is lagging behind the development process. However, the IOTA community is very helpful and can be reached on <a href="https://discord.iota.org/">Discord</a>. So, getting the network up and running depended digging into material on the <a href="https://github.com/iotaledger/">github</a> repositories, third party information (e.g., on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyzQwFp8SFUWHhim4PBhV75W3nLxBWZI6">youtube</a>), own experiments, and asking questions on IOTA’s <a href="https://discord.iota.org/">discord</a> server. Once the IOTA private network and the smart contract are up and running, you are ready for testing and experiments. Further steps taken by IOTA to bring the smart contract implementation and IOTA 2.0 to production readiness can be looked up in their&nbsp;<a href="https://roadmap.iota.org/">roadmap</a>.</p> Developing Smart Contracts <p>Using Rust as a language for developing smart contracts might help producing error-free and stable smart contracts because Rust is well-known for its strict and sophisticated compiler which together with the strong typing and the language design eliminates whole classes of errors common in other languages. Also, the compiler provides helpful error messages. Therefore, using <a href="https://www.innoq.com/de/articles/2020/08/smart-contracts-in-rust/">Rust can provide some advantages</a> over the Solidity language, which is usually used for developing Ethereum smart contracts. However, Rust might be unfamiliar for smart contract developers being used to Solidity.</p> Conclusion <p>This article discussed smart contracts as a new and upcoming feature in IOTA 2.0. Because IOTA has a different approach to conduct and store transactions in a more parallel way with fewer resources than Ethereum, a higher scalability and lower fees are promises that come with this approach. Our experimental setup of a private IOTA network and simple prediction market IOTA smart contract shows that it is already possible to use IOTA smart contracts for development and testing. As the process of setting up the IOTA network and running smart contracts was a bit challenging, I believe this article and example code can provide useful input and support for other developers and the community interested in IOTA smart contracts.</p><p>51nodes GmbH based in Stuttgart is a provider of crypto economy solutions. 51nodes supports companies and other organizations in realizing their Blockchain projects. 51nodes offers technical consulting and implementation with a focus on smart contracts, decentralized apps (DApps), integration of blockchain with industry applications, and tokenization of&nbsp;assets.</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://medium.com/@turfa">Majd Turfa</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@jpbu">Jan-Paul Buchwald</a> for their help in the course of developing this article, experiments, and the&nbsp;setup.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/51nodes/exploring-iota-2-0-smart-contracts-in-a-private-network-developing-a-prediction-market-c2d81988f75e">Exploring IOTA 2.0 Smart Contracts in a Private Network: Developing a Prediction Market</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/51nodes">51nodes</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  We missed commemorating our first birthday because we were simply too busy.  
			  
				
				
				 When we launched Indicio in May 2020, a global pandemic was disrupting the way we shared information. Lockdowns triggered a global migration from work to home, and centralized systems fragmented into millions of daily sign ons, access requests, and virtual meetings — many conducted on devices that were poorly protected. The curse of friction and the need to find efficient and effective ways of managing information in these new circumstances were an opportunity to rethink technology, processes, and ingrained habits—and jettison what wasn’t working.<p></p>
<p>Catastrophes have a way of resetting fundamentals, and the fundamental question we worked on was how can we trust digital data? This problem is now endemic to life because all our information is digital. The very efficiency of our communication has us trapped in a highly inefficient existential crisis. And it’s costing us a fortune in mitigation, poor user experience, fraud, and theft. Specifically, we saw four dimensions to the problem.</p>
<p>The first was how do you encode digital information with authenticity? You need to show, definitively, that it came from the source it says it did and that it hasn’t been altered. This is like the “Trinity” of trust. If St. Patrick came back as a technologist, he’d probably use a shamrock to explain how these all go together.</p>
<p>The second dimension is regulatory compliance. Yes, we see COVID health passes being used to effectively burglarize people’s private data but that just isn’t sustainable—or right. You may say, “hey, people don’t care about privacy when convenience is on offer,” but the Venn diagram of people who do care about privacy and those who detest predatory tech companies is large enough to power privacy regulation to infinity and beyond. We need to mitigate that risk—and the cost burden this compliance has created.</p>
<p>The third dimension is security. One trillion dollars. That’s the estimated cost of cyber insecurity. The cost of our collective failing here exhausts adjectives; the pressure to defend against threats is just exhausting. The stats are so grim the new paradigm in security is called “Zero Trust.” You can’t get more nada than zero. What this means is that everything must be verified as authentic and unaltered all the time. Trust nothing, verify everything.</p>
<p>The fourth dimension is resilience. A technology that solves all these problems cannot manifest in a single point of failure whether that `is a single database or a single company.</p>
<p>No matter what way you slice and dice and spin current information systems, none deliver on all these dimensions. In fact, they barely deliver on any. And when they do, they do in ways that increase the risk in adjacent dimensions. Now, think about how many digital and non-digital devices and things the Internet of Things is going to drop into these systems in the next five years.</p>
<p>That’s why we missed our birthday.</p>
<p>We were working with global enterprises to build what we call “Trusted Data Ecosystems” to answer these challenges—and then some.</p>
 How does a Trusted Data Ecosystem solve all these problems? 
<p>First, it uses decentralized blockchain technology to create an authentic digital proof of someone or something or some claim. It uses machine-readable governance to establish who counts as a trusted source for this data within an ecosystem—the rules for trust. It has the software for people to create trusted data, hold and share it, and verify it.</p>
<p>Second, a trusted data ecosystem avoids the need for third parties to store personally identifying information (PII) in order to manage verification. No more personal accounts, passwords, or logins. No more data processing compliance costs and headaches.</p>
<p>Third, if you eliminate the need for databases full of PII, you eliminate them as a security risk. They aren’t colloquially known as “honeypots” for nothing. But just as important, you now have an ecosystem system for authentic verification to meet the demands of Zero Trust. All your network assets can implement rigorous verification in a frictionless way — thanks to machine-readable governance.</p>
<p>Fourth, our trusted data ecosystems are supported by decentralized networks. You can use ours, which now has 23 nodes on five continents, you can use others, or you can have us build you your own private network. Either way, you remove that single-point-of-failure weakness. The open-source base for the technology also means that credentials can be interoperable across systems—vital when you think about using a health test proof issued in one country for travel to another.</p>
<p>On top of all this, we’ve designed our Trusted Data Ecosystems to be easily integratable into existing systems. Technological evolution should be sustainable and not a case of buying new and shinier systems every couple of years, which only creates chaos for your employees and painful costs on your books. We believe that technology should be easy to integrate, easy to update, and easy to interoperate—and an open-source base enables this kind of continuous, sustainable improvement and innovation.</p>
<p>This multidimensional value—authenticity, compliance, integrity, and resilience—coupled with being easy to integrate is what separates the Indicio approach from the rest. Our growth in 16 months—with global enterprise customers and a global decentralized blockchain network supported by 23 companies on five continents is a sign that fundamental change is coming in the way we share information. And it will arrive just in time to navigate the vast expansion of connected devices.</p>
<p>Some tech companies look to the stars; we’re changing the digital universe.</p>

 Part 3: EVM Contract Development Process&nbsp;Demo <p>Last Week, Ontology announced the official deployment of a TestNet supporting EVM and opened the EVM compatible public beta to developers around the world. At the same time, the “<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-evm-testnet-officially-deployed-now-opening-evm-compatible-public-beta-to-developers-6dddc2bdd764">Ontology Security Vulnerability and Threat Intelligence Bounty Programme</a>” was officially launched in cooperation with SlowMist, a well-known code auditing agency. The top reward for reporting a vulnerability is $12,000 in&nbsp;ONG.</p><p>In <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ontology-evm-contract-development-d3dc7183661">Part 2</a>, we introduced the tools for developing and deploying EVM contracts on Ontology, and how to use MetaMask plug-in wallets to manage Ethereum wallets. In this section, we demonstrate the EVM contract development process.</p> 4. EVM Contract Development Process Demonstration <p>Below, we use the Hardhat tool to demonstrate the complete process of developing, deploying, and testing, EVM contracts on the Ontology&nbsp;network.</p> 4.1 Environmental Preparation   Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">nodejs</a>  Install <a href="https://hardhat.org/getting-started/">Hardhat</a>   4.2 Contract&nbsp;Design <p>4.2.1 Contract&nbsp;Logic</p><p>Let’s use a red packet contract as an example, which mainly provides the following functions:</p>  Send Red&nbsp;Packet  Receive Red&nbsp;Packet  <p>Each time a red packet is issued, the value of each red packet and the number of people who can claim it must be specified.</p><p>For example, the value of a red packet is 100 tokens and the number of people who can claim it is 10. That is, there are 10 different addresses to receive a portion of the red packet. We set the amount of each red packet to be equal, that is, each address can receive 10&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>According to the above logic, we can set the following storage structure:</p><p>4.2.2 Defining Contract&nbsp;Events</p><p>In the process of contract execution, we can trace the contract execution process by adding&nbsp;events.</p><p>In this example, we design the following two&nbsp;events:</p>  When sending a red packet, the contract generates the ID of the red packet, which must be pushed to the caller through an&nbsp;event.  When receiving the red packet, you need to push an event to record the red packet ID and the number of tokens received.  <blockquote>event SendRedPacket(uint packetId, uint&nbsp;amount);</blockquote><blockquote>event ReceiveRedPacket(uint packetId, uint&nbsp;amount);</blockquote><p>4.2.3 Define&nbsp;Function</p><p>sendRedPacket</p><p>1) Send red packets.

 In the fall of 2020, the Spring team released a new experimental Spring Native project that gave Spring developers hope for faster startup times. Spring Native is all about converting your Spring applications to native executables. It leverages GraalVM to make it happen. This announcement was huge because the new kids on the block, Micronaut and Quarkus, produced native executables by default.

<p>In the fall of 2020, the Spring team released a new experimental Spring Native project that gave Spring developers hope for faster startup times. Spring Native is all about converting your Spring applications to native executables. It leverages GraalVM to make it happen. This announcement was huge because the new kids on the block, Micronaut and Quarkus, produced native executables by default.</p>
 
 
<p>I was really excited about Spring Native when I first heard about it. Its first release (v0.8.3) was on Nov 23, 2020, but I started playing with it in September 2020, probably due to SpringOne. How do I know this? Because that’s when I first tried it, and <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot/issues/192">entered an issue for the Okta Spring Boot starter</a>. I was able to get things working with Spring Security’s OAuth dependencies (instead of the Okta starter) in the waning weeks of 2020.</p>

 Branching out with Spring Native 
 
 
<p>According to VMWare Tanzu’s recent <a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/ebooks/the-state-of-spring-2021">State of Spring 2021 report</a>, a lot of people know about Spring Native, but it’s still early.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>I wrote about <a>how to build native Java apps with Micronaut, Quarkus, and Spring Boot</a> earlier this summer and included my learnings. Around the same time, I thought to myself, "it’d sure be nice if the Okta Spring Boot starter worked with Spring Native."</p>
 
 
<p>To solve this desire, I scheduled a Twitch stream with <a>Brian Demers</a> and <a href="https://joshlong.com/">Josh Long</a>. We spent 90+ minutes figuring things out. You can watch our struggles, collaborations, and ultimate joy in the <a href="https://youtu.be/8vY-9tXlCW4">video below</a>. I added a detailed table of contents to the video’s description on YouTube, so you can skip around if you like.</p>
 
 

 
 
<p>This stream originally aired on June 22, 2021. Since then, there have been a few Spring Boot releases and several Spring Native releases. And don’t forget, there was another <a href="https://twitter.com/mraible/status/1433072410182357000">SpringOne</a>!</p>
 
 
 
 
 Okta Spring Boot Starter v2.1.1 Supports Spring Native! 
 
 
<p>Today, I’m happy to announce that we’ve added our learnings to <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-spring-boot/releases/tag/okta-spring-boot-parent-2.1.1">Okta Spring Boot v2.1.1</a>; now, it only takes a couple of lines to add native support to a Spring Boot application that uses Okta.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>import org.springframework.nativex.hint.NativeHint;
@NativeHint(options = "--enable-https")</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Or, if you’d prefer a full example:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.nativex.hint.NativeHint;

@NativeHint(options = "--enable-https")
@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }
}</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you’d like to see what it takes to migrate my previously mentioned native Java + Spring Boot example from using Spring Security OAuth to the Okta starter, look no further than <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/native-java-examples/pull/5">@oktadev/native-java-examples#5</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>You can also try it out yourself with the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a>. Install it and follow along below for a quick Okta + Spring Native example.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Create a Native Spring Boot App 
 
 
<p>To create a secure Spring Boot app with Okta, run <code>okta start spring-boot</code>. You’ll need to verify your email and set a password as part of this.</p>
 
 






If you already have an Okta account, you can run <code>okta login</code> first.



 
 
<p>This command will download our <a href="https://github.com/okta-samples/okta-spring-boot-sample">Okta Spring Boot sample</a>, register your app on Okta, and configure it by adding your Okta settings to <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code>.</p>
 
 
<p>Add <code>@NativeHint(options = "--enable-https")</code> to the main <code>Application</code> class as specified above.</p>
 
 
<p>Next, edit your <code>pom.xml</code> and add the Spring Native version and classifier to the <code>&lt;properties&gt;</code> section:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;spring-native.version&gt;0.10.3&lt;/spring-native.version&gt;
&lt;repackage.classifier/&gt;</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, replace the <code>&lt;build&gt;</code> section with the XML below:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>&lt;build&gt;
    &lt;defaultGoal&gt;spring-boot:run&lt;/defaultGoal&gt;
    &lt;plugins&gt;
        &lt;plugin&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;configuration&gt;
                &lt;classifier&gt;${repackage.classifier}&lt;/classifier&gt;
                &lt;image&gt;
                    &lt;builder&gt;paketobuildpacks/builder:tiny&lt;/builder&gt;

                    &lt;/env&gt;

<p>Right after our first <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-decentralised-identity-and-financial-services-webinar-a-recap-f5cecfb8b45c">webinar</a>, we caught up with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephthompson11/">Joseph Thompson</a>, the CEO of <a href="https://www.aid.technology/">AID:Tech</a> to get his thoughts on the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity</a> (SSI) space and its impact on our society over the next few&nbsp;years.</p><p>Here are some questions we asked&nbsp;him.</p> What’s exciting about verifiable credentials? <p>Not many people today understand the importance of taking ownership of their data. But that could change over the next decade, as privacy would be the most important commodity.</p><p>As people travel more, they tend to use their data across borders, and it becomes necessary to be able to use it safely and securely.</p><p>In the EU, we have the eIDAS, which is a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/can-a-verifiable-credential-based-ssi-implementation-meet-gdpr-compliance-5039d0149ea4">regulation</a> for verifying the identity of individuals online through electronic documents.</p><p>So, I was born and brought up in Ireland and when I go to Italy or Spain or any other country that’s a part of the EU, I don’t have to bring my health data, tax credits, passport, or any other document as my identity, thanks to eIDAS. Imagine the convenience that comes with it! And that’s just from the consumer&nbsp;side.</p><p>As for Enterprises, when their consumers bring in data from other organizations in a secure way, it saves them time and money, besides increasing transparency.</p><p>This means <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">verifiable credentials</a> would make it easy for entities to trust data even on anonymous profiles and it can be massive for economies moving forward because an organization doesn’t necessarily have to know a person, just his or her data for processing. This is possible through verifiable credentials and that’s what makes it so exciting.</p><p>There are undoubtedly a lot of opportunities, provided we can resolve a couple of issues&nbsp;first.</p><p>One issue is there must be many applications for end-users. Having an identity on a network is kind of useless unless there are a ton of applications that can be accessed with that identity. So, we should be watching this space, especially blockchain, decentralized identity, and verifiable credentials for any developments that can be leveraged.</p><p>That said, there’s no doubt that there is a massive upside to <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">using verifiable credentials</a> and it’s only a matter of time before we start leveraging it.</p> What’s the best way to get the word out on verifiable credentials, privacy, and decentralized identity, and their benefits? <p>It’s a lot of marketing, and it becomes easy when you can demonstrate the benefits through <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/25-real-world-use-cases-of-verifiable-credentials-4657c9cbc5e">real-world use&nbsp;cases</a>.</p><p>First of all, the decision to <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/selective-disclosure-share-what-you-want-8ae367655b7b">share your data</a> with someone must be a personal choice that an individual must make based on the benefit of a&nbsp;service.</p><p>Take the example of the microinsurance application that we’re building now. If an individual has a trusted verifiable credential, then the same can be sent to an insurance company. For insurance companies and healthcare organizations, these credentials mitigate their risks because they can determine whether the individual can make the copayments and premiums.</p><p>For individuals, they could decide if they wanted to share their data with an insurance company to get health insurance, and if yes, which company. In other words, the end user would have complete control over their data and could determine where and how it was&nbsp;shared.</p><p>Many people who weren’t convinced first have slowly adopted it due to their personal experiences.</p><p>To create more such experiences, companies in this space have to be more solution-focused. Currently, there’s a lot of focus on the tech side of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/how-to-implement-driving-license-use-case-using-verifiable-credentials-cef928222c92">VC implementation</a>, but this should extend to a solution-centric approach to increase adoption.</p><p>While this is already happening in pockets, there has to be a holistic approach to solving a particular problem through verifiable credentials, and I believe it will happen&nbsp;soon.</p> How do you see VCs and SSI evolving in the next five years or&nbsp;so? <p>A convergence of technologies such as mobile smartphones, <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/5-reasons-to-use-an-identity-wallet-c289ba2980cf">identity wallets</a>, cryptos, and more would drive the need for trusted identities that can be shared seamlessly across different entities and use-cases.</p><p>It will also present huge opportunities for people to monetize their own data and this can drive adoption as&nbsp;well.</p><p>In all, yes, we can expect more awareness and adoption in five years because of the enormous upsides for both individuals and organizations.</p> So, what do you think are the impediments that can hamper this adoption? <p>Regulations definitely. Currently, we see a lack of clarity among lawmakers, so more awareness about VCs and their benefits could bring in more positive laws that can, in turn, foster innovation.</p> Shifting gears a bit here, what really brought you to SSI and decentralized identity? <p>Well, it all began in 2009 when I ran a marathon for a charity, but the money didn’t reach the intended recipients. I realized there was a lack of transparency in how the funds were collected and used. That was my first tryst with transparency or the lack of&nbsp;it.</p><p>In 2015, I was doing my Master’s degree in Digital Currencies and during this time, it occurred to me that the Google search engine must be converted into a transparency engine. What I mean by that is that there must be a layer of transparency in the information, so people are able to trust it&nbsp;better.</p><p>With such thoughts, I did some pilots in this space, and it soon became clear that this was a need for today’s world from government aid to welfare payments. And that’s how the whole idea was&nbsp;born.</p> Can you share some insights into the social projects you’re working&nbsp;on? <p>We’re working with the Women’s World Banking to distribute microinsurance to women in Uganda and Nigeria. We’re also partnering with the Asian Development Bank, Microsoft, and Save The Children to build verifiable credentials for parents, so they can access financial aid, education, and other benefits, and pass it to their children. We have now completed the pilot phase and we’re scaling it massively with the help of our partners.</p> What is Affinidi’s Role in the work you&nbsp;do? <p>Makes our life a lot easier as we don’t have to build the entire verifiable credentials from the base&nbsp;level!</p><p>Learn more about AID:Tech and Affinidi’s <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/affinidi-partners-with-aid-tech-exploring-new-horizons-in-digital-identity-and-verifiable-661c9e61f7e8">partnership</a>.</p><p>While this brings us to the end of this interview, we have many interesting content and events lined up.

Fintech’s biggest hivemind, <a href="https://www.money2020.com/">Money 20/20</a> is back this year from 21 to 23 of September in Amsterdam.




 




This year the event is back to a in-person event and with an immersive agenda bringing 8 groups of nearly 30 industry speakers, called Think Tanks, to discuss Fintech’s biggest challenges of today.




 “The future is trustless. What do we need instead?” 





 




<a href="https://www.meeco.me/">Meeco</a> will be present, with our CEO and Founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrynadow/">Katryna Dow</a> joining the Think Tank titled<a href="https://europe.money2020.com/whatshappening/agenda#/agenda/event/the-future-is-trustless-what-do-we-need-instead-e102-45023"> “The future is trustless. What do we need instead?”</a> on Tuesday 21, 16:00 – 17:00 CET.




 




<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dgwbirch/">Dave Birch</a> will be moderating. David is an author, advisor and commentator on digital&nbsp;financial services. He’s one of the global top 15 favourite sources of business information (Wired magazine) and one of the top ten most influential voices in banking (Financial Brand); was found to be one of the top ten Twitter accounts followed by innovators. He leads 15Mb Ltd (his advisory practice), is Global&nbsp;Ambassador for&nbsp;Consult Hyperion&nbsp;(the secure electronic transactions consultancy that he helped to found), Non-Executive Chairman of Digiseq Ltd, Ambassador for Jersey for Fintech, a member of the Governing Council of the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation (the London-based think tank) and holds number of&nbsp;board-level advistory roles. He is an Honorary President of EEMA, the European e-ID Association.




 




Joining Katryna in this panel discussion are the following speakers:




 




• <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/felixgerlach/">Felix Gerlach</a>, CPO &amp; Co-founder, Passbase Inc.




 




• <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rdasxy/">Riddhiman Das</a>,  Co-founder &amp; CEO, TripleBlind




 




• <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmalindley/">Emma Lindley</a>,  Co-founder, Women In Identity




 




• <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/louise-maynard-atem-848b2117/">Louise Maynard-Atem</a>, Research Lead,  Women In Identity




 





 




Trust is an outdated concept. We should not need trust to be able to do trade and share. Trust should be an implicit hallmark, not an explicit task. What do we need to develop to remove the need to achieve it? And what do we need instead? We need to build an environment that is safe by default. We need to shift from transactions based on the identification of the counter parties to transactions based on the strongly-authenticated credentials of the counter parties. How do we get there?




 




This and other thought provoking conversations will take place at Money 20/20. Book by Friday the 16th (CET) for early bird prices and save 500€.

<p>Since <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/intro-to-dids-for-people-5ebe620b5a15">the beginning</a> of our journey here at MATTR, decentralization and digital identity have been central to our approach to building products. As part of this, we’ve supported Decentralized Identifiers (or <a href="https://learn.mattr.global/docs/platform/core/dids/overview">DIDs</a>) since the <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/introducing-the-mattr-platform-91db4925c773">earliest launch of our platform</a>. We’ve also considered how we might give you more options to <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/did-extensibility-on-the-mattr-platform-14c73c7a798e">expand the utility</a> of these identities over&nbsp;time.</p> An important milestone <p>The W3C working group responsible for Decentralized Identifiers <a href="https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/9179">recently published</a> the DID v1.0 specification under “Proposed Recommendation” status. This is a significant milestone as DIDs approach global standardization with the pending approval of the W3C Advisory Committee.</p><p>DIDs are maturing, but so is the environment and context in which they were originally designed. With a complex ecosystem consisting of dozens of different methodologies and new ones emerging on a regular basis, it’s important to balance the potential of this decentralized approach with a realistic approach for defining the real utility and value of each <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#methods">DID method</a>. For example, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/NOTE-did-rubric-20210826/">DID Method Rubric</a> provides a good frame of reference for comparing different approaches.</p><p>Different types of DIDs can be registered and anchored using unique rules specific to the set of infrastructure where they’re stored. Since DIDs provide provenance for keys which are controlled by DID owners, the rules and systems that govern each kind of DID method have a significant impact on the trust and maintenance model for these identifiers. This is the key thing to remember when choosing a DID method that makes sense for your&nbsp;needs.</p> Our supported DID&nbsp;methods <p>In MATTR VII, by supporting a variety of DID methods — deterministic or key-based DIDs, domain-based DIDs, and ledger-based DIDs — we are able to provide tools which can be customized to fit the needs of individual people and organizations.</p>  Key-based DIDs — Largely static, easy to create, and locally controlled. This makes them a natural choice for applications where there’s a need to manage connections and interactions with users directly.  DIDs anchored to web domains — These have a different trust model, where control over the domain can bootstrap a connection to a DID. This makes a lot of sense for organizations with existing domain names that already transact and do business online, and can extend their brand and reputation to the domain of&nbsp;DIDs.  Ledger-based DIDs — These offer a distributed system of public key infrastructure which is not centrally managed or controlled by a single party. While ledgers differ in their governance and consensus models, they ultimately provide a backbone for anchoring digital addresses in a way which allows them to be discovered and used by other parties. This can be a useful feature where a persistent identifier is needed, such as in online communication and collaboration.  <p>There is no single DID method or type of DID (which at the moment) should be universally applied to every situation. However, by using the strengths of each approach we can allow for a diverse ecosystem of digital identifiers enabling connections between complex networks of people, organizations and machines.</p><p>To date, we’ve provided support for three main DID methods in our platform: <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">DID Key</a>, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">DID Web</a>, and <a href="https://sovrin-foundation.github.io/sovrin/spec/did-method-spec-template.html">DID Sovrin</a>. These align with three of the central types of infrastructure outlined&nbsp;above.</p> Introducing DID&nbsp;ION <p>We’re proud to announce that as of today we’ve added support for <a href="https://identity.foundation/ion/">DID ION</a>, a DID method which is anchored to IPFS and Bitcoin. We’ve <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/sidetree-protocol-reaches-v1-9b565cf92db3">supported the development of the Sidetree protocol</a> that underpins DID ION for some time as it has matured in collaboration with working group members at the Decentralized Identity Foundation.</p><p>With contributions from organizations such as Microsoft, Transmute, and SecureKey, <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree</a> and DID ION have emerged as a scalable and enterprise-ready solution for anchoring DIDs. The <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/decoding-the-sidetree-protocol-18d8bfa39257">core idea</a> behind the Sidetree protocol is to create decentralized identifiers that can run on any distributed ledger system. DID ION is an implementation of that protocol which backs onto the Bitcoin blockchain, one of the largest and most used public ledger networks in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Sidetree possesses some unique advantages not readily present in other DID methods, such as low cost, high throughput, and built-in portability of the identifier. This provides a number of benefits to people and organizations, especially in supporting a large volume of different kinds of connections with the ability to manage and rotate keys as needed. We have added end-to-end capabilities for creating and resolving DIDs on the ION network across our platform and wallet products.</p><p>Although DID ION is just one implementation of the Sidetree protocol, we see promise in other DID methods using Sidetree and will consider adding support for these over time as and when it makes sense. We’ll also continue to develop Sidetree in collaboration with the global standards community to ensure that this protocol and the ION Network have sustainable futures for a long time to&nbsp;come.</p><p>At the same time, the community around DID Sovrin is developing a new kind of interoperability by designing a <a href="https://hackmd.io/@icZC4epNSnqBbYE0hJYseA/S1eUS2BQw">DID method</a> that can work for vast networks of Indy ledgers, rather than focusing on the Sovrin-specific method that’s been used to date. As DID Sovrin gets phased out of adoption, we’re simultaneously deprecating standard support for DID Sovrin within MATTR VII. We’ll be phasing this out shortly with upcoming announcements for customers building on our existing platform.</p><p>If you’ve got any use cases that utilize DID Sovrin or want to discuss extensibility options, please reach out to us on any of our social channels or at info@mattr.global and we’ll be happy to work with&nbsp;you.</p> Looking ahead <p>We believe this a big step forward in providing a better set of choices when it comes to digital identity for our customers. From the start, we have designed our platform with flexibility and extensibility in mind, and will continue to support different DID methods as the market&nbsp;evolves.</p><p>We look forward to seeing how these new tools can be used to solve problems in the real world and will keep working to identify better ways to encourage responsible use of digital identity on the&nbsp;web.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global/adding-did-ion-to-mattr-vii-d56bdb7a2fde">Adding DID ION to MATTR VII</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mattr-global">MATTR</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

ETH Gas prices are too high! The growth of Urbit has been greatly hampered this year by the cost of activating planets. Join Philip Monk (`~wicdev-wisryt`) and the entire L2 team as they present the work completed to date to implement Layer 2 naive rollups. Come see a demo of the new Bridge front end, first migrating a star and spawning some planets, then activating a planet, all on L2.

This call will be a great opportunity for galaxy owners to get their questions answered for the upcoming vote on Layer 2 implementation. It will also be good for anyone in the community that wants a comprehensive look at how naive rollups will work to bring down planet activation costs. If you're technically inclined, be sure to check out [Philip's walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQdqCwYIBoU) of the naive rollup code ahead of time so you can ask questions.

<p>September 15, 2021</p>
<p>Toronto, Canada</p>
<p>The partnership between Northern Block and kompany provides organizations and users of the NB Orbit platform access to the leading global corporate register network and in turn, audit-proof company information from commercial registers, financial authorities and tax offices around the world.</p>
<p>The purpose of this partnership is to enable trust network operators to increase the authenticity of legal entities that join their ecosystem. This provides the ability to engage in business with peers with confidence, while mitigating fraud risks. Through the instant access to this primary source information, the KYC/KYB process is greatly enhanced by including official information on over 115 million companies across more than 200 countries and jurisdictions.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We see an increasing demand from clients to validate legal entity data at source. So in automating access to original corporate register records, via our partnership with kompany, we are providing an additional layer of KYC &amp; KYB security.”, says Mathieu Glaude, CEO of Northern Block.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before conducting business, companies should perform sufficient due diligence to get to better know the other entity that they’re about to transact with. However, this is easier said than done. For example, in global digital commerce, in many cases companies don’t know or meet the other entity they’re going to transact with. Therefore, enabling companies to verify whether the other party unequivocally meets their policies adds a layer of trust and comfort. Increasing the authenticity of the organizations that get onboarded to trust ecosystems inherently increases the network value and aids companies.</p>
<p>Onboarding in a self-sovereign manner to digital trust ecosystems is different than in federated models. When network operators manage a trust network and an entity connects into the network and begins transacting, it’s important to ensure that you’re getting credentials from the source issuer. This is what kompany provides via its global register network: official data and documents retrieved in real-time form their original source.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Russell E. Perry, CEO and Co-Founder of kompany: “With increasing compliance and AML requirements, the veracity and source of company data have become a central point in combating money laundering and other frauds. We are, therefore, proud to provide Northern Block clients with our unparalleled access to real-time audit-proof company information, ensuring access to company information across multiple jurisdictions and helping their clients achieve improved business efficiency.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Canada is becoming a nation of digital identity. Recently, the Government of Ontario announced their <a href="https://www.ontario.ca/page/ontarios-digital-id-technology-and-standards">technology and standard choices</a> for their Digital ID Ecosystem. Digital ID is critical to the economy. The Digital ID &amp; Authentication Council of Canada (DIACC) estimates that the potential value that trusted digital identity could bring to the Canadian economy is at least 1 percent of Canada’s GDP, or CAD 20 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Mathieu Glaude adds, “Onboarding small businesses in a frictionless manner must be made easy. We’ve asked small businesses to do so much during Covid; and now that we’re asking them to use new digital tools, we must ensure we don’t create more friction, but instead find ways to add value to their businesses. The first step is ensuring trusted interactions.”</p></blockquote>
<p>…</p>

<p>Governments are always going to be concerned about national security.</p>



<p>China’s recent&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/20/china-passes-data-protection-law/">passing</a>&nbsp;of its Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) is an example of a national government recognizing that the amount of personal data collected by non-government online services and mobile apps is at the point where it can be a rich data source for a national security adversary.</p>



<p>The risk focus has moved to private enterprise and the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-the-data-economy-and-why-should-we-care/">internet economy</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">surveillance capitalism</a>&nbsp;sector of that makes national security more challenging. China recognizes this in its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dataprotectionreport.com/2021/08/pipl-a-game-changer-for-companies-in-china/">PIPL</a>, which comes into effect on November 1, 2021. President Biden recognized it in his&nbsp;<a href="https://www.popsci.com/technology/biden-administration-initiatives-national-cybersecurity/">cybersecurity announcements</a>&nbsp;in July.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What this tells us is we’re all moving in the same direction. It’s not only us here at&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/">Anonyome Labs</a>&nbsp;but national governments around the globe that clearly see the national security risks of personal data storage, transfer and processing by private enterprise.</p>



<p>Surveillance capitalism is the root of the problem for every country. We’re fighting the same enemy, just in different wars.</p>



<p>Postscript: We’ll be closely following commentary and analysis of China’s new PIPL. At time of writing the full English translation had not been released. We&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/analyzing-chinas-pipl-and-how-it-compares-to-the-eus-gdpr/">know</a>&nbsp;the PIPL is broad-ranging, comprehensive, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.natlawreview.com/article/china-s-new-data-privacy-law-sweeping-and-serious-avoid-high-cost-noncompliance">described</a>&nbsp;as “the world’s harshest data privacy law.” It’s modelled on the&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a>&nbsp;but will be stricter in its standards and penalties. The PIPL deals with personal data from national security and public interest perspectives. Together with China’s Data Security Law and Cybersecurity Law, the PIPL forms an overarching data protection&nbsp;<a href="https://fpf.org/blog/chinas-new-comprehensive-data-protection-law-context-stated-objectives-key-provisions/">framework</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>530K USD available for sustainable data-oriented projects!</p><p>Hello, Ocean Community!</p><p>For those new, OceanDAO is a community-curated funding system directed towards projects building in the Ocean Protocol ecosystem.</p><p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/the-web3-sustainability-loop-b2a4097a36e">The Ocean ecosystem becomes self-sustainable</a> as the builders of the Web3 data economy leverage Ocean Protocol to create products, services, and resources that the community finds valuable.</p><p>Grant Funding Categories:</p>  Building or improving applications or integrations to&nbsp;Ocean  Community or developer outreach (grants don’t need to be technical in&nbsp;nature)  Unleashing data  Building and/or improving core Ocean&nbsp;software  Improvements to OceanDAO&nbsp;itself  <p>For up-to-date information on getting started with OceanDAO, we invite you to get involved and learn more about Ocean’s community-curated funding on the <a href="http://oceanprotocol.com/dao">OceanDAO&nbsp;website</a>.</p><p>The goal is to grow the DAO each round. We encourage the $OCEAN ecosystem to apply or reapply AND to vote! Thank you to all of the participants, voters, and proposers.</p> OceanDAO Round 10 Announcements and Guidelines  Round 10 Information <p>There is $530,000 USD in grant funding available in Round 10. The max request limit per proposal has now changed. Please find more details&nbsp;below:</p><p>Please Note: The amount requested is in USD, but the amount paid is in OCEAN token. The conversion rate is the market price on the Proposal Submission Deadline (October 5th at midnight GMT). This determines how many OCEAN will be awarded if a proposal is voted to receive a&nbsp;grant.</p><p>A total of $100,000, or approx. 19%, of “Total Round Funding Available” is earmarked for New Projects. Earmarked proposals are eligible for entire “Total Round Funding Available”; returning (general) grants are eligible for the remaining $430,000, or approx.&nbsp;81%.</p><p>As a builder, submit your project proposal on the <a href="https://port.oceanprotocol.com/c/oceandao/round-10/69">Round 10 Ocean Port Forum</a>. As a voter, this is where you can see all the expanded proposal details to make an informed vote decision.</p><p>Additionally, you can check out the OceanDAO <a href="https://bit.ly/Round10Proposals">Round 10 Proposal Submission Dashboard</a> to see all the proposals in one place as they are submitted.</p><p>The grant proposals from the <a href="http://vote.oceanprotocol.com">snapshot ballot</a> that meet these criteria are selected to receive their Funding Amount Requested (in OCEAN) to foster positive value creation for the overall Ocean Protocol ecosystem.</p> Project Levels &amp; Funding&nbsp;Tiers <p>To improve funding effectiveness, OceanDAO continues to increase access to funding. After the introduction of the <a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standing Dashboard</a>, teams have been working to reconcile their grant deliverables, and complete their proposals.</p><p>To continue incentivising completion and outcomes, we are introducing Project Levels, which can be acquired by Teams delivering on their grant promises. Below are the Funding Tiers accessible by projects for OceanDAO Grants Round&nbsp;10.</p>  Teams applying for their first time — $20,000&nbsp;USD  Teams who have completed 1–2 proposals — $20,000&nbsp;USD  Teams who have completed 3+ proposals — $50,000&nbsp;USD  <p>Make sure to update your Project Deliverables to remain in a good standing, and to continue accessing larger grant amounts. Important note: existing Projects will only be able to participate in the Voting process if their project is in a “Completed” or “Funds Returned” standing.</p> Project Standings &gt; 1Team-1Proposal <p>A key focus in OceanDAO is improving ROI Transparency. With the introduction of [<a href="https://www.notion.so/Project-Standing-a26be0e2054e4927ab5ab8e7bde8558f">Project Standings</a>], each project reconciles their grant deliverables and outcomes with the DAO to access greater funding. This process naturally leads teams towards reconciling their deliverables, and continue building.</p><p>Therefore, the introduction of [Project Standings] enables [1Team-1Proposal] rules to be deprecated.</p><p>This design review originated from various discussions with Ambassadors and the larger OceanDAO community. We’d like to thank the community for your continuous feedback and&nbsp;support.</p> Funding Round — Rules &amp; Timing&nbsp;Updates   Proposals Submission Deadline is October 5th at midnight&nbsp;GMT  Add OCEAN to Voting Wallet by the Proposal Submission Deadline.

We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1436049268922470417?s=20">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, led by Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community. He introduced Loot and the 3,333 limited edition <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-x-onto-wallet-3-333-limited-edition-ontology-avatars-500-ong-up-for-grabs-e58d32dc1c2">Ontology Avatars</a> campaign.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1435165949657759747?s=20">new Telegram weekly Community Call</a>, led by Astro, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He had a lively discussion with community members, focusing on the centralized identity universal login component, <a href="https://login.ont.id/">ONT Login</a>, and the batch verification solution, <a href="https://tag.ont.id/">ONT&nbsp;TAG</a>.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/humptycalderon/status/1436104508619190284?s=20">weekly DeID Summit</a>, in which we spoke about “the difference between DID and Black Mirror”. We introduced Ontology’s decentralized identity framework that enables users to control their data and decide whether a third-party can access a particular piece of information about&nbsp;them.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a> where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.  <p>Global News</p>  Ontology announced that <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/enter-web-3-0-with-ont-id-375930e78242">ONT ID</a>, its decentralized digital identity application, has surpassed 1.5 million users. The fact that over 1.5 million users have embraced decentralized identity through ONT ID reflects the significant appetite for blockchain solutions that safeguard user privacy in the midst of ongoing scamming, identity fraud, data leaks and ransomware attacks.  Ontology has officially deployed its <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-evm-testnet-officially-deployed-now-opening-evm-compatible-public-beta-to-developers-6dddc2bdd764?source=user_profile---------2----------------------------">EVM</a> TestNet and is opening its EVM-compatible public beta for developers. In collaboration with code auditor SlowMist, Ontology is setting up the Ontology Security Vulnerabilities and Threat Intelligence Bounty Programme, with a top prize of $12,000 in ONG rewards. In order to encourage community developers to quickly and easily familiarize themselves with the Ontology EVM development environment, we published <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ontology-evm-contract-development-part-1-network-details-2095f6e141e5">Everything You Need To Know About Ontology EVM Contract Development</a>.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>VentureBeat — <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/09/09/data-management-puts-enterprises-to-the-test/">Data management puts enterprises to the&nbsp;test</a></p><blockquote>The Dell survey found that most business leaders lack confidence in their data protection solutions, with 82% of respondents reporting concern that their organization’s solutions won’t be able to meet future business challenges. Even companies taking steps to overcome the hurdles say that they anticipate major headwinds. According to Dell, 58% of businesses investing — or planning to invest — in software-as-a-service apps are struggling to find data protection for&nbsp;them.</blockquote><p>ONT ID is a decentralized identity framework that complies with W3C’s recommended standards for decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials. Decentralization, self-management, privacy protection, and ease of use are the key features of ONT ID that ensure users fully control their data and identity. Ontology has been actively collaborating with a variety of partners interested in adopting decentralized solutions. At present, we have provided solutions in multiple sectors including mobility, inventory management and logistics, professional marketplace, corporate data attestation, digital content, music copyright, and smart&nbsp;banking.</p><p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>Paradigm for managing all access of everyone and everything to all resources consistently in a multi-cloud multi-hybrid environment. Policy-based, automated, consuming the current state of services &amp; infrastructure. Shifting from identity &amp; security siloes to a holistic, integrated concept. Start tactically now with CIEM, PAM, etc., but go on to strategic measures.</p>
<p>Managing identities, managing entitlements, and managing access has become way more complex than ever before, in dynamic, multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT environments. In the past, servers and applications were rather static, and entitlements too were static. But this has changed. Entitlements and access in today’s cloud environments are dynamic, just like workloads.</p>
<p>Additionally, most organizations must deal with a multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT. Different clouds, such as Microsoft Azure, AWS, or GCP, are very different in the way they deal with and manage identities, resources, access, and entitlements. With private clouds, managed IT, Edge Computing, and on-premises IT, different approaches on delivering IT are there to be managed, all different in the technology as well as the split between provider and tenant responsibilities.</p>
 Security as Code Can’t Be the Answer 
<p>However, the answer can’t be in security as code, because this would require developers to care for security (and infrastructure management), instead of setting the focus on their specialized skills and letting them work on what they are best in. The answer also can’t be in having specialized solutions for different parts of the IT environment, such as cloud-only approaches. Organizations need a comprehensive approach, covering the breadth and depth of their multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT reality.</p>
<p>DREAM takes this broader approach, beyond just cloud-focused management of entitlements and access, looking at all types of identities, workloads, and all elements of IT. Additionally, DREAM is well-integrated with SODAS and BASIS, delivering a comprehensive set of methods and models for moving to agile delivery of secure services in multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT environments.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 1: DREAM integrates security &amp; identity across all parts of multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT environments, closely aligned and integrated with service development, delivery &amp; operations as well as infrastructure management &amp; operations (KuppingerCole SODAS).</p>
 Cloud-First Approach Will not Lead to a Uniform Environment 
<p>As outlined, most organizations today have a mix of different types of IT. While “cloud first” is a valid strategy, it will not lead to a uniform environment. While the ratio of cloud workloads will (and must) grow over time, it will be multi-cloud and thus not uniform. Edge Computing appeared as a response to the need to shift workloads back closer to the on-premise environment. However, there was a reason for private clouds to appear, as well as for keeping parts of IT on-premises.</p>
<p>In manufacturing and other industries, on-premises IT will never disappear. Multi-cloud, multi-hybrid is the reality, here to stay. It will differ in the ratios of what is done where, but it will not disappear for many organizations, and the shift will be slow (slower than frequently expected) and gradual for most organizations.</p>
<p>This requires, as described in KuppingerCole SODAS (Secure Operations &amp; Development of Agile Services), an integrated approach to development, infrastructure management, operations, and security &amp; identity. DREAM focuses on the Security &amp; Identity layer within that concept and how to manage identities, entitlements, and access uniformly across the entire IT, powered by policy-based automation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 2: DREAM focuses on IAM, including CIEM, Access Governance, and PAM, as well as Cybersecurity and SOAR, and aligns with the other elements of a modern IT stack for delivering agile, secure services.</p>
 Managing Identities and Entitlements with the DREAM Approach 
<p>DREAM is an approach for managing all types of identities, both human and non-human. Human identities span everyone from the consumer to the employee, while non-human identities cover devices, things, services, resources, etc., as well as the complex relationships between the various types of identities.</p>
<p>DREAM focuses on managing entitlements and unifying this management across different environments such as the various public clouds, private clouds, VM (virtual machine) environments, and servers in traditional IT.</p>
<p>Based on a comprehensive , uniform approach, it puts identity and security in one responsibility and a unified technical solution, also enabling consistent governance across the entire IT environment. This also includes supporting modern concepts such as SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) that build on SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), and monitoring what happens in terms of security across all of IT as well as reacting to this.</p>
 DREAM Integrates CIEM, IGA, IAM, and PAM 
<p>DREAM also integrates concepts such as the evolving concept of CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management), IGA (Identity Governance &amp; Administration) as part of IAM (Identity &amp; Access Management), and PAM (Privileged Access Management) for supporting every identity, every entitlement, and the access across the entire breadth and depth of IT.</p>
<p>This requires utilizing information about the state of services, applications, resources, identities, etc. It builds on virtual repositories that gather and expose that information so that it can be analyzed – this is where AI &amp; ML come into play – and policy-based automation of the entire management of identities and security then build on these repositories.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 3: The key actions to take in delivering to the DREAM model.</p>
<p>To move forward with DREAM, the first step is – if not already done – the de-siloing of IT. Don’t treat cloud differently from on-premises or private clouds. Don’t split responsibilities. Workloads might run here or there, they will shift. For application and service delivers, you need a unified approach. You need it even more for comprehensive, strong security and efficient management of identities and access, and, last but not least, for (access) governance, complying with regulations, and mitigating risks. This initial step also requires a portfolio assessment and gap analysis, to understand what you have, what you need in addition, and what you should best retire.</p>
<p>From there, based on a vision involving the KuppingerCole models for Identity Fabrics and Security Fabrics, you need to define the target architecture, a roadmap that evolves over time, the guardrails, and the policies and processes.</p>
 Running DREAM Environments 
<p>Roll-out should be tactical and phased, focusing on fixing the critical challenges first. This might include opting for a specialized CIEM solution first (even while most already go well beyond cloud only, and beyond infrastructure entitlements only) to fix the pressing challenges of managing entitlements and access in the dynamic, volatile cloud environments.</p>
<p>But all should be done with the vision and target architecture in mind, not as tactical, isolated, non-integrated activities. DREAM will evolve continually. For more efficient management, and again being part of unification as described in KuppingerCole BASIS, this also involves shifting delivery of traditional workloads to a service model – making your traditional IT work as if it were another cloud.</p>
<p>In running DREAM environments, policy-based automation is at the core. It is about shifting to well-defined policies (proposed and optimized by AI and ML) that work on the dynamic data, instead of manual administration. This limits errors and increases speed in responding to permanent changes in the agile IT of today. It is also the foundation for governance and consistent security operations, and automated response across the IT environments.</p>
<p>Guiding principles for DREAM:</p>
 
 Business requests IT Services 
 Unified view on IT Services – one IT, across multi-hybrid, multi-cloud environments 
 Policy-based automation instead of manual administration or coding 
 Development is agile, consuming identity &amp; security APIs, delivering status/requirements back to central repositories, and to the operations management to be ready supporting new and changing applications and services 
 Automation of identity, security and infrastructure setup &amp; management 
 
<p>Our recommendation is to think beyond solutions that cover just multi-cloud, but integrate across multi-cloud multi-hybrid IT. Focus also on integration with the IAM and PAM (Privileged Access Management) infrastructure you have in place. Look at the overarching DevSecOps (<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/devsecops-sodas-secure-operations-development-of-agile-services">KuppingerCole SODAS</a>) model; and the model for agile service delivery in a modern, multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT (<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/it-for-the-digital-age-introducing-basis-business-driven-agile-secure-it-as-a-service">KuppingerCole BASIS</a>) for a comprehensive approach.</p>

We’ve all heard the refrain….no-one cares about privacy anymore. I confess, that sometimes I feel the same way, particularly when I see my own family members oblivious to what they are sharing. I’ve even done it myself. Then I realise that it’s not that they don’t care about data privacy, it’s just they don’t have any agency to do anything about it.




 




I recently gave a talk at <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2021">Kuppinger Cole European Identity Conference 2021</a> so had cause to dig into this question afresh. If the newspaper and magazine headlines are anything to go by then data privacy is still very much a live issue.




 





  





 




But what about real people? Surely there must be some examples that would help. I looked at two recent events that could act as a litmus test of public sentiment. The first was Apple’s decision as part of its update to iOS 14.5 that allowed users, for the first time, to control whether or not to allow apps to track their data.




 





  





 




Pretty convincing data but maybe it was skewed towards Apple users. Maybe if I looked at something more serious like helping to fight the Covid pandemic, I’d see a completely different picture?




 





  





 




According to the latest Edelman Trust Barometer, even fighting a Global pandemic is not sufficient reason to share data. The willingness to share data to Governments to help contain Covid has actually decreased over the last 12 months. Perhaps not surprising given how some Governments have not been too adept in handling privacy concerns<a>[1]</a>.&nbsp; Finally, I was convinced by some latest research by KPMG – <a href="https://advisory.kpmg.us/articles/2021/bridging-the-trust-chasm.html">Corporate Data Responsibility</a> – in August 2021. The research was conducted in the US but I suspect can be translated across the world. One set of statistics stood out:




 





  





 




The compelling data and research suggest that my original question now needs to be reframed. People most certainly do care about their data privacy. The question now is: how are organisations going to bridge this data privacy chasm?




 




This a real opportunity for organisations to step up and take a lead. An opportunity for organisations to action rebuilding trust and becoming data sustainable for the future. There are some immediate steps every organisation should start with:




 




• Analyse your own ethics around data collection and use. Consider implementing a code of data ethics.




 




•  Be transparent and explicit around data collection and use and do it in a way that is upfront, easy and clear for everyone to understand.




 




•  Consider using privacy enhancing technologies to anonymise data or make use of synthetic data.




 




•  Give people access and control over their data empowering them to gain value and equity by sharing.




 




People openly admit they don’t know how to protect their personal data and they are rightly peeved that organisations aren’t doing much to help.




 




Take the lead now in establishing corporate data responsibility.

<p>AERGONAUTS And KLAYswap: The Great Listing: What Does This Mean For AERGONAUTS?</p><p>AERGO, one of the largest hybrid blockchains based out of South Korea, is going to be listed on KLAYswap, a decentralized crypto asset finance protocol that enables users to provide liquidity and garner rewards. KLAYswap is a complete and automated on-chain swap protocol that operates and leverages on-chain liquidity pools. Liquidity is guaranteed through automated market making mechanisms. KLAYswap enables on-chain swap services for any KLAY or KCT-type token cryptocurrency to become a liquid provider and earn passive income from transaction fee commissions. For AERGOnauts, this enables AERGO token holders to participate in a passive income paradigm simply by utilizing the KLAYswap platform. Now how does this on-chain swap work, it is enabled through a specific innovation, known as the Orbit&nbsp;Bridge.</p><p>On KLAYswap, ERC-20 tokens can be transferred throughout the Klaytn ecosystem via a technological innovation known as the Orbit Bridge, a transparent and immutable bridge built on Orbit Chain which in return offers yield farming with assets that were previously disconnected and unable to communicate with one another before the inception of such an innovation. KLAYswap is built on one of the most prominent and secure blockchain protocols within the realm of cryptocurrency, the Klaytn ecosystem, which was created by Kakao. Kakao is one of the most publicly traded Fin-Tech companies in South Korea and has a market capitalization of approximately 30 billion dollars. KakaoTalk is utilized by over 90% of the South Korean populace and KakaoTaxi is the most widely used transportation service throughout the country. AERGO, with a massive foothold within South Korea, has been successfully able to partner with Klaytn and through this partnership, AERGO will have increased liquidity, immutability and the ability for investors to garner passive income by participating in liquidity pools on the&nbsp;network.</p>AERGO And KLAYswap: The Specifics Of The&nbsp;Event<p>The AERGO Listing: What This Means For AERGONAUTS and The Klay Community: The Great&nbsp;Airdrop</p><p>AERGO is one of the largest blockchains within South Korea, with an extremely development team that has been actively been working with KLAYswap and Orbit Bridge. Today, we’re excited to announce that AERGO will be listed on KLAYswap and an airdrop event will occur as a result of this enhancement of liquidity on KLAYswap! The KAERGO-KLAY LP will airdrop over 300,000 KAERGO tokens to all liquidity providers of the KAERGO-KLAY LP. Wallets that provide liquidity to the KAERGO-KLAY pools will be distributed KAERGO on the basis of the share ratio of that specific wallet. AERGONAUTS will notice that KAERGO is linked to the Orbit Bridge chain that enhances interoperability and communication between chains that have been integrated into the platform; this includes AERGO. KAERGO is the Klaytn version of AERGO, the native token of the AERGO platform that has been bridged over to the Klaytn ecosystem through the utilization of Orbit&nbsp;Bridge.</p><p>Participation In The Airdrop: Active Community Involvement: How And When To Connect To&nbsp;KLAYswap</p>AERGO Community Members, No Matter The Size Of Your Holdings: Can Participate In This Airdrop Based On The Instructions Below<p>The way for community members to participate in the airdrop is as follows. It is necessary to provide liquidity to the KAERGO-KLAY liquidity pool to receive the airdrop during the event period. To provide liquidity to the KAERGO-KLAY pool, you must have one of those two assets and both can be converted to Klaytn Network assets using the Orbit Bridge. The airdrop event will start on September 16th and end on October 15th and will drop 300,000 Aergo Tokens. Below is a guide to assist you with providing liquidity on the KLAYswap protocol.</p><p>Provide Liquidity To The KAERGO-KLAY Pool</p><p>This liquidity measure will depend on the coins you have in your wallet, you may choose KAERGO-KLAY as options. If you choose a singular token option, half of the deposit will automatically be converted into the other pair to be deposited into the liquidity pair.

<p>This summer, we’ve been iterating through an article intended to talk
about the success that Blockchain Commons has had working with the Wyoming
legislature to help to define a first-in-the-country legal definition
of digital identity.</p>

<p>The Digital Identity Working Group for the Wyoming Select Committee on
Blockchain meets again next week, on September 21-22, 2021. I will be
providing testimony there at 2pm MST. As a result, we’ve decided to
release the current draft of this article on digital identity and how
Wyoming has defined it using Principal Authority, with the goal of
helping to shape the agenda for digital identity for the next year,
both in Wyoming and elsewhere.</p>

<p>—Christopher Allen</p>

 

<p>In 2016, I wrote <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">“The Path to Self-Sovereign
Identity”</a>
to talk about the historic evolution from centralized identity to
user-centric identity and to define the next step: a self-sovereign
digital identity that was controlled by the user, not some third party.
In it I also offered <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/self-sovereign-identity/blob/master/self-sovereign-identity-principles.md">10 Self-Sovereign Identity
Principles</a>
which have been widely accepted by the decentralized identity community.</p>

<p>Self-sovereign identity has matured and grown considerably since, as I
chronicled in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/self-sovereign-identity-five-years-on">“Self-Sovereign Identity: Five Years
On”</a>.
There are now specifications, products, and entire companies supporting
the concept. However, recent legal efforts to define self-sovereign
identity may be just as important for catapulting it into the mass
market.</p>

 Defining Identity 

<p>Defining identity is by no means easy. That core topic could encompass a
paper much longer than this. The following are some various definitions
of identity drawn from the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot10-buenosaires/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/glossary-primer.md">RWOT
Glossary</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Identifier: A label that refers to an entity and can be used to establish or maintain an identity. For example, a name or UID.</p>

  <p>Identity: A conceptual construct that enables the differentiation between distinct entities that are individually considered to be unique, but which may possess class or group characteristics. An identity gives these entities the ability to interact as peers in collaborative or competitive ways. It is not the entity that it represents.</p>

  <p>Identity, Digital: A digital representation of an entity, managed by digital tools, over which that entity has personal or delegated control.</p>

  <p>Identity, Functional: How we recognize, remember and respond to specific people and things.</p>

  <p>SSI: Self-sovereign identity. A decentralized digital identity that does not depend on any centralized authority and whose information is portable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Digital identity is just one aspect of a complex, interconnected web of
different digital models. It’s not the same thing as identification
(where you prove you are a distinct entity with unique characteristics),
authentication (where you prove you were the same entity as before), or
personal data (which is information related to an identified or
identifiable entity).</p>

<p>Those other elements all need to be considered, but it’s digital
identity, and now self-sovereign identity, that gives us the linchpin to
do so.</p>

 Turning Digital Identity into Law 

<p>For self-sovereign identity to truly achieve international success, I
feel that it needs to not just be embraced by the technological sector,
but also to have a basis in law. In recent years, I’ve been progressing
toward that goal through work with various state and national
legislatures.</p>

<p>Collaborating with the Wyoming legislature has borne the first fruit.
This year they passed
<a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2021/SF0039">SF0039</a> on digital
identity, which the Governor signed into law and which went into effect
on July 1, 2021. It defines digital identity as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(xviii) “Personal digital identity” means the intangible digital
representation of, by and for a natural person, over which he has
principal authority and through which he intentionally communicates or
acts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So where’s the self-sovereign identity in that?</p>

<p>As with much legislation, it’s all about the careful selection of words.</p>

 Defining Principal Authority 

<p>To understand how Principal Authority relates to self-sovereign identity
requires insight into what Principal Authority is. The concept comes out
of English Common law. It appears in most Commonwealth countries but has
also found its way into the laws of other countries, including the
United States. It’s primarily used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_agency">Laws of
Agency</a>, an area of
commercial law where an agent is empowered to take on certain tasks.</p>

<p>As the name would suggest, Principal Authority first requires a
Principal: a person or entity. It then requires that entity have
Authority: some power. Principal Authority is thus the power derived
from a person or entity, which they can use or which they can delegate
out to others. When applied to digital identity, Principal Authority
says that a Principal has Authority over his identity — which is a clear
restatement of self-sovereign principles.</p>

<p>In fact, the recognition of a Principal is itself a statement of the
first of the principles of self-sovereign identity: existence. It
asserts that digital identity is always a representation of an actual
entity, who predates any digital representation, and who is also the
first and foremost beneficiary of that representation.</p>

<p>However, in drawing on the Laws of Agency, the concepts of Principal and
Principal Authority go beyond that. Because the person at the heart of
an identity has the ultimate power to control the self-sovereign digital
representation that they’ve created (and/or that they use), this means
that any others who exert Principal Authority over that identity data
are doing so only as agents of the Principal.</p>

<p>By focusing on Agency, the concept of Principal Authority also ensures
that the Principal always has the ability to revoke their delegation to
the agents whom they have temporarily offered Authority regarding their
identity. This is a requirement for other self-sovereign principles such
as portability, and it’s a real necessity in the digital world, where
we might need to delete personal data or to cancel Terms &amp; Conditions
that we signed without real, informed consent.</p>

<p>Altogether, this new definition of Principal Authority adds a lot of
nuance to self-sovereign identity, and much of that comes thanks to the
implicit incorporation of Agency.</p>

 Defining Control 

<p>In saying that a Principal has the ultimate authority to control their
digital identity, care also needs to be taken to define what that
control means. It means that a Principal has (or can delegate) the
Principal Authority to identify as that identity; to authenticate as
that identity; and to know the contents of the data held by that
identity.</p>

<p>However, any digital identity also exists as part of a larger ecosystem,
and the Principal does not have control over the larger ecosystem. They
cannot control how other entities rate, rank, or note the reputation
of their identity; and they cannot control comments, flags, or other
notes that other entities might attach to their identity.</p>

<p>Further, a Principal cannot necessarily prevent other entities from
creating new digital identities related to them, which may or may not
link to an existing identity. (Though states are increasingly
recognizing the limits of voluntary disclosure of information, digital
identity laws will ultimately never prevent a police station from
creating their own identity record related to a criminal, or a civic
authority from creating government-related identity records.)</p>

<p>In other words, self-sovereign identity, and the establishment of
Principal Authority over it, lays down boundaries for what the Principal
controls — boundaries that are much wider than those established for
digital identities controlled by third parties. However, those
boundaries still exist.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, control of a digital identity means that the Principal
can expect to maintain the continuity of that identity for as long as
they see fit, but in doing so must accept the battle scars inflicted by
interactions in a larger ecosystem that are implicit to the identity
itself.</p>

 Agents &amp; Their Duty 

<p>The ability to delegate Principal Authority, as revealed by the Laws of
Agency, may be as crucial to self-sovereign identity as the concept of a
Principal itself. It allows the empowerment of agents by a Principal —
who might be physical agents or, in the increasingly digital world,
virtual agents. But, it also institutes the core requirement that those
agents be working for the good of the Principal when they are exerting
Principal Authority over the identity holder’s identity data.</p>

<p>This concept of “duty” is crucial to the Laws of Agency. Duty requires
that an Agent only use their delegated Principal Authority as the
Principal requests, in a way that benefits the Principal, and with care
and due diligence, while frequently reporting back what they’ve done.</p>

<p>This is a notable change from the way that digital identities have been
treated traditionally. Compare that to banks, who represent you in
financial transactions, and then sell your spending data; compare that
to Facebook, who collects as much personally identifiable data and other
information as you’re willing to give them, then sells that to
advertisers; or compare it to Google, who infers personally identifiable
and demographic data based on the information you input into their tools
and the choices you make. In large part, you don’t even know what these
identity representatives and data holders are doing. In the world before
<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">Europe’s GDPR</a> or <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">California’s
CCPA</a>, you had little input into their
actions. Even now, with those early and rough attempts to protect
digital self-sovereignty, you’re typically opting-out, not opting-in —
which is barely agency at all —&nbsp;and you’re still not protected against
people who are self-serving nor those who are inferring information from
scattered pieces of data.</p>

<p>That’s because any duties currently required of the entities to whom you
grant agency over your data are quite minimal. Maybe there’s a duty of
privacy, maybe there’s a duty of safety, but in general they don’t need
to work in your best interest. That’s why we need to ensure that new
definitions of digital identity, particularly self-sovereign identity,
follow the Laws of Agency in ways that our current systems do not.</p>

<p>This sort of agent agreement needs to be part of delegation. To date,
this has been true to a limited extent with federation protocols such as
SAML and Oauth, but that needs to be extended to every person. Wyoming’s
digital-identity law is the first example of legislation that focuses on
Agency in this way, and that’s much of its power.</p>

<p>However, this isn’t a simple issue. Even with Agency-focused
legislation, we need to determine a source for duties. This article will
try to outline some of them, using not just the traditional duties of
agents, but also the self-sovereign principles themselves. However, it’s
a mere starting point, with a stronger legal foundation required.</p>

 Principal Authority &amp; The State 

<p>Before defining duties, it’s important to note one other interesting
element of Principal Authority and its foundation in Agency: it focuses
not just on a single person’s authority, but also on their ability to
delegate to and require duties from other entities. In other words, it’s
a peer-to-peer relationship; this relationship works within the context
of a state who recognizes the concept of Principal Authority, respects
its ability to enable Agency, and enforces its established duties.</p>

<p>However, though the state is involved, this peer-to-peer relationship
still lies in stark contrast to traditional property law, where property
is always in some way beholden to the state: the state might be the
original source for property, they might be able to reclaim it by
eminent domain, and they might be able to seize it through asset
forfeiture. Those ideas all run counter to the idea of self-sovereignty
— which is yet another reason that we choose to focus on the Agency of
Principal Authority, not property law, as the core legal metaphor for
self-sovereign identity.</p>

 Restating the Self-Sovereign Principles 

<p>The use of Principal Authority to empower self-sovereign identity
provides a legal foothold for many of my original 10 principles.</p>

<p>What follows is a restatement of the self-sovereign principles that
reorganizes the original ten as rights and duties that are suggested by
customs, expectations, and best practices, but which need to be better
codified to become true duties. It also proposes five additional duties
that could come from customs implicit in the Laws of Agency.</p>

<p>Together, these ideas may allow us to both better understand how to turn
the self-sovereign principles into concrete usage and also to more
easily translate them into duties bound by legislation.</p>

 The Rights of Self-Sovereign Authority 

<p>Some principles of self-sovereign identity are implicit in the idea of
a Principal.</p>

 
   Existence. The definition of Principal requires that there be a real entity at an identity’s heart. 
   Control. The definition of Principal Authority says that the Principal always retains control of an identity, within specifically defined boundaries, no matter who is holding it at a particular time. 
   Persistence. Because of their uncontested Principal Authority, a Principal may decide to have an identity last for as long as they see fit. 
   Consent. Anything that happens within the defined boundaries of the digital identity is implicitly with the consent of the Principal, who may delegate or revoke Principal Authority at any time. 
 

<p>Self-sovereign rights recognize that an identity exists to benefit its
Principal. These core principles likely derive explicitly from a
definition of digital identity such as that created by the Wyoming
legislature.</p>

 The Duties of Self-Sovereign Identity 

<p>The remaining principles of self-sovereign identity can be stated as
duties owed to a Principal by an agent who has been granted Principal
Authority over an identity for certain purposes.</p>

 
   Access. An agent must provide the Principal with access to data related to their digital identity. 
   Transparency. An agent must be open about how they will administer a digital identity. 
   Portability. An agent must make a digital identity portable upon the request of the Principal. 
   Interoperability. An agent must use standard, interoperable protocols when making an identity portable, and should also use those interoperable protocols when interacting with other identity systems. 
   Minimization. An agent must minimize the data collected, stored, transmitted, and shared regarding an identity so that it only includes data that is strictly necessary in the context of a request made by the Principal. 
   Protection. An agent must place the protection of the identity above their own needs or desires. 
 

<p>Identity duties says that agents will tell you how they’re using your
identity, use it in the most minimalist way possible, and make it easy
for you to reclaim the identity. However, legislation may be required to
turn these best practices into duties bound by law.</p>

 The Duties of Self-Sovereign Agents 

<p>The idea of Principal Authority itself suggests additional duties that
were not included on the original list of principles of self-sovereign
identity, but which are generally defined in the Laws of Agency to be
due from agents to Principals.</p>

 
   Specificity. An Agent will use Principal Authority to serve specific tasks as instructed by the Principal, or as required by Custom, and do nothing more with an identity. 
   Responsibility. An agent will serve those tasks with reasonable care and skill, with due diligence, and without further delegation. 
   Representation. An agent will act in the best interests of the Principal, without secret profit, and will not take on other responsibilities that might conflict with that. 
   Fidelity. An agent will serve those tasks in good faith. 
   Disclosure. An agent will maintain accounts and report their actions back to the Principal. 
 

<p>Agent duties say that agents will be trustworthy in their use of your
identity. These duties are more likely to implicitly be a part of any
legislation that was built atop the Laws of Agency.</p>

 Taking the Next Steps 

<p>Wyoming’s definition of personal digital identity helps us to lay more
foundation for self-sovereign identity, but it’s still just a starting
point.</p>

<p>There’s more to do.</p>

 Laws of Custom 

<p>To start with, the Laws of Agency are largely built on Laws of Custom,
which are as likely to be common law as any formally codified
legislation. When creating new laws related to self-sovereign identity,
we’ll be creating new Laws of Customs for the digital frontier, an area
that’s so fresh that the tradition of customs has been limited.</p>

<p>This creates real challenges, as we must decide what customs we want to
create and then we must develop them from common law to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customary_law">legal
customs</a> to (eventually)
codified duties. We can integrate these with the Laws of Agency, and we
can figure out how that interrelates with old common laws such as the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_(law)">Use Laws</a>. We may even need
special courts to set these common laws and achieve remedies, such as
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Chancery">Court of
Chancery</a>.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, there’s a lot of work to be done here; recognizing the
existence of a Principal and the use of delegatable Principal Authority
bound by the Laws of Agency is just a starting place. New customs, even
though understood as best practices, will not automatically become legal
duties.</p>

 Open Questions 

<p>Beyond that, I’m not a lawyer. There may be other legal elements that
can support our definition of digital identity. Are there additional
duties that we could bring in? Are there fiduciary or agency laws that
we could leverage? Are there other legal models of interest we can draw
from, such as the UNCITRAL Model Law of Electronic Commerce approach,
which says that “The actions, promises, rights and obligations of a
person shall not be denied legal validity on the sole ground they are
effectuated through their digital identity”? These possibilities need to
be studied, preferably with the help of legal experts.</p>

<p>Even once we’ve fully defined digital identity, we still must consider
how digital identity may need to be more carefully protected. Are there
ways we can give specific protection to private keys used for signatures
and to express authority? Can we protect against the theft of private
keys that might allow impersonation or false witness? Can we prevent the
misuse of digital biometric or genetic information? Can we protect
against other “crimes of authority”?</p>

<p>There’s also a flipside: digital identity should give us some new
advantages not found in traditional identity. For example, there have
always been problems with individuals with low market power being at a
disadvantage when negotiating with larger parties. Can new digital
identity laws help start to resolve that imbalance?</p>

 Final Notes 

<p>One of the most important steps going forward will be to continue
working with the Digital Identity subcommittee in the Wyoming
legislature. However, I’d also welcome discussions with other states and
nations, to ensure that we have great definitions of digital identity
that support self-sovereign identity everywhere.</p>

<p>If this is important to you too, consider <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/BlockchainCommons">supporting Blockchain
Commons</a> to make this a
reality.</p>

 

 Offering Some Thanks

Thanks to commentators who made time to talk to us about it, including
Joe Andrieu, Dazza Greenwood, and Clare Sullivan. (Our conclusions are
ours; they may or may not agree with them.)</p>

<p>Many thanks to Wyoming State Senator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Rothfuss">Chris
Rothfuss</a> who invited me
to join the Wyoming Digital Identity subcommittee and to the others
members of the Digital Identity subcommittee in the Wyoming legislature,
including Brittany Kaiser, Carla Reyes, Diedrich Henning, Scott David,
and once more Clare Sullivan and Dazza Greenwood. Thanks to their hard
work, Wyoming now offers the first definitions of personal digital
identity in the United States, laying the foundation for these
additional ideas.</p>

<p>Enterprise hiring in the time of Covid is putting greater emphasis on supporting remote on boarding of new employees. This creates new challenges for the IAM team as it is no longer self evident that new contractors and employees to show up at a physical helpdesk, provide ID and pick up their new accounts. How do you organize the remote onboarding and are there technologies and approaches that are used in digital customer onboarding and KYC processes that can be leveraged to also handle employee onboarding?<br> <br> Another important aspect is that remote working has become the norm and securing the remote connections is critical. A big part of that effort is to implement MFA at scale but in this situation how do you handle the roll out of the MFA when the users are not present in the office?</p>




<p>How do you support remote onboarding at scale?<br> How do you roll out MFA to a 100 000 people organisation?<br> What is the future for remote onboarding of contractors and employees?</p>

We will revise what Identity is at its core and what should or should not be part of it. And what about Group Membership – a ‘domain-driven’ advise how to triage roles between Identity and Authorization. All these best practices are backed by real-life experience.</p>




<p>- OAuth and its misusage as an authorization protocol<br>- Essence of Identity<br>- Difference between client authorization and user authorization in the context of OAuth<br>- Group Membership – where do roles belong?<br>- Theory backed by practice</p>

  <p>Hybrid IT environments are full of secrets, like tokens, passwords, certificates and encryption keys that open access to mission-critical information. The emergence of concepts like Zero Trust authentication, Just-in-Time access and Zero Standing Privileges suggests that these access secrets don’t need to be permanent. Instead they can be created on the fly and made to expire automatically, paving way for the future where secrets or passwords no longer need to be managed and vaulted at all.</p>
<p>SSH.COM's CTO, Miikka Sainio, explores how reducing the number of permanent secrets enterprises manage in dynamic environments improves security, operational velocity cost-efficiency. He also discusses why managing and vaulting secrets is still a necessary phase in many cases when companies adopt modern and future-proof methods.</p>

  <p>The harm that the misuse of AI/ML can have is obvious, from the ProPublica Recidivism piece from 2016 to the latest discovery of bias in facial recognition classifiers by Joy Buolamwini.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The need for tools to use AI/ML ethically is concentrated in two particular areas: transparency and fairness. Transparency involves knowing why an ML system came to the conclusion that it did—something that is essential if we are to identity bias. In some forms of ML, this is difficult. We’ll cover two tools to assist with transparency: LIME and SHAP. We’ll highlight where each of these tools performs well and poorly, and provide recommendations for utilizing them in unison where appropriate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once transparency is established, we’ll pause to evaluate potential sources of bias that would affect the fairness of a particular algorithm. Here the number of tools available is far-reaching. We’ll start with an explanation of bias metrics, explaining the roles that true/false positives and true/false negatives play in calculating various accuracy metrics. The basics of fairness established, then we will explore various tools used against a few, publicly available sample ML implementations. Tools in this review will include: Aequitas, AIF360, Audit-AI, FairML, Fairness Comparison, Fairness Measures, FairTest, Themis™, and Themis-ML.

  <p>This presentation combines the findings of a doctoral study into security automation in the financial sector with real-world experiences in implementing security automation. The research focused on strategies financial institutions need to reduce the gap between the attacker's time to compromise and the defender's time to detect and respond. Learn from the experiences of companies that have implemented or are implementing security automation. This session will look at what to expect from security automation (and what not to expect), how to decide what to automate, strategies to help ensure a successful security automation program, and lessons learned from success and failure.</p>

  <p>As organizations expand their cloud footprint to accelerate innovation and digital transformation, increased security risks pose an imminent and elevated threat to their growing cloud presence. The market is overwhelmed with numerous security technologies, approaches and frameworks for securing an organization’s cloud adoption journey, but security leaders and architects must meticulously assess the security risks associated with their cloud usage, migration patterns and digital interactions with customers, employees and partners to suite their business requirements and cloud security priorities.</p>
<p>Identity and Access Management (IAM) remains one of the key security disciplines to support digital transformation and cloud adoption objectives, by not only providing a secure identity and access foundation for the user, device and cloud-service types but also by offering additional cloud-specific security provisions that include cloud access management, cloud entitlement management, cloud privileged access and cloud access governance to its evolving technology portfolio.</p>
<p>In this session, we will discuss the important security tenets of an organization's cloud adoption program and how effective IAM architecture and planning can help navigate CISOs and security leaders through their cloud adoption journey.</p>

  <p>Picos (persistent compute objects) are an actor-model programming system with long-term persistent state. Each pico also has persistent identity and availability for a cloud-native developer experience. Picos are DIDComm-enabled agents supporting SSI. Consequently, picos are capable of running specialized application protocols for any given workflow in a secure, cryptographic environment. The architecture of picos makes them independent of the runtime they executed on, holding out hope of a decentralized SSI agency. This talk introduces picos, demonstrates their DIDComm capabilities, and presents a roadmap for building a decentralized SSI agency, independent of any particular organization.</p>

<p>Access Management is a crucial capability in the IT infrastructure of any Enterprise. But it is even further crucial, when the whole application landscape is integrated, i.e., more than 1,800 applications used by millions of users. Back in 2017 we modernized the existing access infrastructure and set up ForgeRock as its successor on-premises in our data center. With rising demands regarding availability, scalability, and support for market-specific customizations, as well as more products and applications are going to the cloud, it became increasingly clear that project will have to cloudify its infrastructure and application stack. The future setup should follow modern paradigms like GitOps, Everything as Code and making use of highly automated processes based on Service Layers, all whilst keeping the integrated applications up and running and migrating the product stack to the AWS (Amazon Web Services) cloud.</p>
<p>Key Takeaways:</p>




<p>- How does a target architecture look like<br> - What challenges will appear when it comes to the migration<br> - How to ensure the migration to the cloud, whilst minimizing the effect for all integrated applications</p>

  <p>The reason to use biometrics as a form of identity is because they are unique, unchanging and are the one direct and unequivocal link to an individual. But what if these identifiers are compromised? This is not a hypothetical scenario as the U.S. Office of Personnel Management breach sadly taught us several years ago. For years, this has been a conundrum in the world of biometrics - to store the data in a centralized system that has to be protected or choose device-based biometrics that are not linked to a vetted physical identity. In this never-ending loop of having to choose between privacy and security, we as a society have ended up with neither. This is about to change.<br><br>There are multiple forces now converging, that are driving serious attention and urgency to solve this problem as never before - continued, massive data breaches, skyrocketing use of biometrics and the emergence of far-reaching privacy and data protection laws that put the onus on protecting personal data on the private sector.<br><br>Owning personal data, and especially biometrics, has become a hot potato. Noone wants to hold it, but it is necessary for doing business. Consumers on the other hand are asking for more control. As a result, we are seeing new frameworks emerge, frameworks that go beyond blockchain and take into account the need for holistic, decentralized identity management that binds a rooted identity to a trusted authentication key that cannot be stolen, lost or circumvented by fraudsters operating under assumed identities with stolen PII.<br><br>Join us as we take you through a journey of what these new frameworks look like and the new possibilities that emerge when there is no binary choice to be made between privacy and security. It will finally be possible to have both.</p>

  <p>As a byproduct of the current activity across industry, government, and regulatory sectors, digital identity leaders face unprecedented opportunities- and challenges.</p>
<p>Covid has accelerated the global imperative to establish a strong and safe global digital economy that is enabled by a secure, interoperable,&nbsp; digital identity ecosystem. &nbsp; One of the most daunting challenges is how, where and when to start.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reality is that the target global ecosystem will be years in the making despite the widely held view that better identity is crucial to achieving a trusted digital-first marketplace.&nbsp; The fact is that the target state is the quintessential “it takes a village” challenge.&nbsp; It is this speaker’s strongly held view that the leaders who move the market now will be best positioned to substantively shape the government, regulatory and legal frameworks that might otherwise hamper ecosystem growth.</p>
<p>The focus of this session is to speak to the market movers in the audience and provide food-for-thought in devising a strategy to move forward.&nbsp; The ‘right’ strategy will attract global relying parties, identity service providers and the digitally-enabled consumer audience writ large (‘the village.’)&nbsp; The global ecosystem will take time to evolve but the time to build the foundation is now.</p>

  <p>To date, Digital Identity Trust Frameworks have generally been light touch regarding the specification of fraud controls, relying on the theoretical protection a Digital ID offers through more robust authentication. It is true that improvements in authentication methods, such as soft tokens and biometrics, mean the ID theft vector of phishing for a user’s password may be removed. However, ID fraudsters will continue to use stolen ID information to create an ID in the victim’s name. They will continue to create synthetic IDs. They will also continue to try and take over victim’s accounts, using online account recovery and voice helpdesk channels to replace a strong authentication method with one that the fraudster controls.<br><br>In recognition of this ongoing threat from fraudsters, the Open Identity Exchange (OIX) has produced a comprehensive Guide to Fraud Controls for Digital ID Ecosystems.<br><br>The guide covers the processes and channels that need to be considered from a fraud risk point of view. It identifies the different types of fraud controls that should be applied in each channel, including ecosystem wide syndicated fraud controls, such as shared signals. The process of dealing with a suspected fraud is examined: how should these be prioritised, what investigation process should be followed, and how should victims be informed. Finally, it covers legal considerations when implementing fraud controls, in particular when sharing information and collaborating across the ecosystem to act as a joined-up defence against fraud attack.<br><br>This presentation / panel session will provide discuss these topics and how the guide can help those implementing Digital ID and provide the audience a chance to speak about their own fraud challenges with the authors and how the recommendations in the guide might be applied to help</p>

I collected requirements, draw process models, and did detailed analysis. I also defined minimum viable scope of the project and drove the team to reach the goal. Finally, I did acceptance testing. I can share key activities for business analyst throughout different phases of the project.<br> Analysis<br> * Get descriptions or describe yourself HR-processes, which are related to identity area. <br> * Get descriptions/explanations of data feeds from HR-systems.<br> * Describe your needs to HR-system development team, such as future employment changes, deputies etc in advance. <br> * Trust but verify: ask for example files /data. Perform data analysis to makes sure, that previous descriptions and processes are valid.<br> * Just acknowledge that “roll-out” of new processes is not one day activity, this can last for multiple months and must be treated and described as a separate process.<br> <br> Development<br> * Help developers with clarifying tiny details from stakeholders<br> * Document the details<br> * Control the scope and drive team to do correct prioritization<br> * Discuss alternative solutions to implement same business need<br> <br> Testing<br> * Rehearse migration<br> * Rehearse roll-out<br> * If testing resource is limited – verify major business cases. Prolong pilot period to see rare business cases in production.<br> <br> Roll-out<br> * Define different scopes and roll-out in smaller scopes (to keep incidents queue managed)<br> * Start roll-out from the process, that has smaller impact on acting employees (In our case we decided to start roll-out with leaver)<br> * Set up regular meetings with major stakeholders to inform them about changes in the processes. Good if you managed to agree on convenient communication channels (such as chat in Teams) between operational teams to be able to resolve incidents quickly.<br> <br> Pilot<br> * Verify not only concrete cases, but also analyze the data.<br> * Agree on convenient way of communicating issues/bugs/questions to developers.<br> * Resolve incidents and fix bugs as quickly as possible, so that operating units don’t feel alone with software/data issues.</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Key&nbsp;takeaways:</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>* Everything is possible but<br> * Define viable minimum<br> * Management team must be involved and work for your project. Your project must be a priority for all stakeholders / involved parties <br> * Start roll-out from the end<br> * Find a way to analyze your data to make sure, that everything is ok</p>

  <p>Denmark is among the most digitaized countries in the world and as the digitarization strategy moves forward, it is necessary to improve and enhance the nation's overall cyberprotection. In 2019, the Government appointed a new 20-member national Cybersecurity Council for the period of two years. The council’s role is to advise the government on new initiatives that can support both the private and public sectors by improving resillience and better cyberprotection; contribute to knowledge sharing, advisories and guidance on the strategic level; and look into the need for cyber security competences and suggest measures to further develop these, both among private citizens and employees, as well as within education and research.</p>
<p>In this session, you will get a view into the midway status of the work of the Council, and will learn which initiatives work and which need more effort. The Council has been advising the healthcare authorities on the Danish COVID-19 app, and has been discussing the SolarWinds hack and the upcoming vaccination passport.</p>

<p>The FIDO Alliance was launched in 2013 with the audacious goal: to change the very nature of authentication. To move the entire world away from usernames and passwords and traditional multi-factor authentication with an open and free web standard that makes authentication simpler and stronger. It’s 2021, so why are passwords still persisting? The session will answer that question, and detail the progress that has been made towards standardizing strong authentication and the opportunity for companies to start on a journey past passwords.<br> <br> Join Andrew Shikiar, executive director of FIDO Alliance, as we look the past year from the FIDO standards lens, including:<br> -- The impacts of Covid-19 on digital transformation plans and securing remote workforces &amp; where strong authentication has fit in <br> -- Progress global organizations have made toward going truly passwordless <br> -- Considerations for strong authentication when seeking compliance with regulation such as PSD2 SCA<br> -- What other areas, such as identity verification, that need to be strengthened to better secure the web</p>




<p>-- Attendees will understand how a global pandemic affected companies' digital transformation plans, including strong authentication projects</p>
<p>Key Takaways:&nbsp;</p>
<p><br> -- Attendees will learn the status of efforts to standardize strong authentication, and where support stands today<br> -- Attendees will be able to analyze their strong authentication options for complying with regulation like PSD2 SCA<br> -- Attendees will be able to explain how identity verification and authentication relate, and efforts in motion to better secure both areas</p>

 What if we took the traditional way of thinking of Identity Governance and reversed it completely? Putting together a successful IGA program has commonly been a long haul,    A headache,    A mess,    A budget destroyer,    And an expectation disappointer.    There is a new way. Some call us crazy and some say its impossible. However, those who have experienced the new way call us visionaries.

Putting together a successful IGA program has commonly been a long haul,<br> <br> A headache,<br> <br> A mess,<br> <br> A budget destroyer,<br> <br> And an expectation disappointer.<br> <br> There is a new way. Some call us crazy and some say its impossible. However, those who have experienced the new way call us visionaries. We have been presenting a modern ideology and process for IGA that drastically reduces the time to value, the total cost of ownership, and the economic impact of an Identity Governance Solution. <br> <br> This panel will focus on strategic order of operations, calculating the economic return of the modern approach, how to optimize AI/ML in Identity Governance, and the ways simplicity expediates the path to stronger compliance and security postures.</p>

<p>A lot of innovation around physical products is created by connectivity, allowing them to become part of the consumer's larger digital ecosystem and the providing enterprise. Gartner says in its megatrends for the next decade: "Anything costing more than a few USD will be "intelligent and networked". Examples are electronic wall boxes to charge cars or remote-control for dishwashers, cars, etc. <br> Several compelling use cases require smart things to act not only for themselves but also on behalf of the end-user. OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 can be used to provide a user-friendly and secure user journey. Learn about the experiences with these standards when it is about IoT and how Identity &amp; Access Management products help to reduce time-to-market, costs, and inconsistency between different touchpoints.</p>
<p>Key Takeaways:&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In a 2018 study by Onus &amp; Ponemon on data risk in the third-party ecosystem, more than 75% of companies surveyed said they believe third-party cybersecurity incidents are increasing. Those companies were right to believe that. <br> <br> As our world becomes more digitized, and thus more interconnected, it becomes increasingly more difficult to safeguard organizations from cybercrime. Tack on to that challenge a global pandemic that all but forced organizations to become “perimeter-less,” if they weren’t already, and the potential access points for bad actors through third-party access increases exponentially. <br> <br> The problem is two-fold. <br> <br> The landscape of third-party users is vast and continues to grow. From third-party non-employees like vendors, contractors and affiliates to non-human third parties like IoT devices, service accounts and bots, more organizations are engaging third parties to assist with their business operations and help them to innovate, grow faster, improve profitability, and ultimately create greater customer value – faster. On average, companies share confidential and sensitive information with more than 580 third parties and in many cases, an organization's third-party workers can actually outnumber their regular, full-time workforce. <br> <br> Yet, despite the increased use of third-party workers in business, most organizations lack the proper third-party risk culture, processes, and technologies to protect themselves against the long list of third parties with access to their sensitive data and systems. Organizations have these systems in place to manage their full-time employees but lack the same level of rigor to manage these higher-risk third-parties. As a result, many third-party users are provided with more access than needed for their roles, and most disturbingly, that access is frequently not terminated when the third party no longer needs it. <br> <br> Without the right third-party identity lifecycle management procedures in place, businesses unwittingly expand their attack surface, unnecessarily put sensitive information at risk, and create additional access points for hackers.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2021-panel-third-party-identity-risk-management"></a>

   Self-sovereign identity&nbsp;has been a hot topic at EIC since 2016. We've seen it rapidly go from concept to reality, with a massive increase in global interest from car manufacturers to banks to healthcare. We've seen innovative pilot projects, new software and exciting new privacy innovations.&nbsp; 
 
 But what happens when advanced new technology and protocols come into contact with the real world? In this talk, Andy will describe how SSI underpins the IATA Travel Pass ecosystem. He'll cover some of the implementation challenges, the do's and don'ts, and describe how the technology is just one small cog in the machine that comprises airlines, airports, testing laboratories and governments around the world.&nbsp; 
 
 As IATA's technology partner, Evernym has been at the centre of the storm of global travel pass innovation, and Andy will give you a look under the covers of what a global SSI rollout looks like.

  <p>Cloud computing has become commonplace in recent years, it is almost inevitable for small to medium sized companies to leverage cloud services largely if not fully. However, it is not easy to run cloud enablement project in bigger and yet most importantly traditional companies, where there are hundreds of legacy applications, which expect data to be closer to the computing units, and which are dependent on bandwidth and reliable network availability. In this presentation, I am going to address cloud migration requirements, usual challenges, and lessons learnt and best practices from project management, security and service management point of view.</p>

 DIDComm is the messaging protocol implemented in Hyperledger Aries that provides utility for DID-based relationships. Many may think DIDComm is just a way to exchange credentials, but it's more than that. DIDComm is a protocol layer capable of supporting specialized application protocols for any given workflow. Because of its general nature and inherent support for self-sovereign relationships, DIDComm provides a basis for a self-sovereign internet, a secure internet overlay, that is much more private, enabling, and flexible than the one we've built using Web 2.0 technologies. This talk introduces Autonomic Identity Architectures, describes DIDComm, discusses its protocological nature, and presents use cases in the Internet of Things.&nbsp;

				  Indicio Named Finalist in IDC’s Inaugural Best in Future of Digital Infrastructure North America Awards&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Seattle WA – September 14, 2021 – Indicio today announced it has been named a finalist in the inaugural <a href="https://www.idc.com/promo/future-of-x/digital-infrastructure/awards">IDC Future Enterprise, Best in Future of Digital Infrastructure North America Awards</a> in the Ubiquitous Deployment category.

<p>PYMNTS talked with Finicity CEO Steve Smith about open banking, open finance, data aggregation, where we’re headed with technologies and standards and how consumer-permissioned data is the future of lending.</p>
<p>Innovation is largely occurring differently in each fintech segment so the usefulness of a broad <a href="http://finicity.com/open-banking">open banking platform</a> to provide relevant, quality data across investing, budgeting and mortgage is becoming more and more important.</p>
<p>“We’re entering an age in which – through open banking – consumers are increasingly comfortable sharing their personal financial data with third parties. And amid that “gold rush,” a slew of companies have popped up (mostly fintechs), promising to upend financial services, though they tend to focus on segments of financial life – investing, let’s say, or mortgages, or high-yield savings accounts.”</p>

You can<a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-176-defi-needs-self-sovereign-identity-be42c290bfc7"> check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>ICYMI: <a href="https://bonifii.com/2021/09/bonifii-joins-indicio-network-node-operator-consortium/">Bonifii joins Indicio Network Node Operator Consortium — Bonifii</a></p><p>This week:</p>  The SEC threatens to sue&nbsp;Coinbase  What people are&nbsp;saying  This week in&nbsp;crypto  Stuff happens   1. The SEC threatens to sue&nbsp;Coinbase Brian Armstrong, Photo: TechCrunch Disrupt<p>Rosalyn Layton over at Forbes has <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2021/09/12/its-time-to-end-the-secs-clarity-charade-on-crypto/?sh=37e8e2dc25fa">a great overview of the SEC v. Coinbase situation</a>. The brief overview looks something like&nbsp;this:</p>  Regarding the sales of crypto as securities: “There’s actually a lot of clarity on that front,” Gary Gensler <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03">said at Aspen in early&nbsp;August</a>.  A month later, Gensler <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fb126d79-2e60-4002-8aba-b08887fca609">told the FT</a>: “Talk to us, come in,” he said. “There are a lot of platforms that are in operation today that would do better engaging and instead there is a bit of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. begging for forgiveness rather than asking for permission.”  <p>And here’s what happened when Coinbase and Brian Armstrong took Gensler’s advice and actively engaged with the SEC on one of their upcoming products, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roslynlayton/2021/09/12/its-time-to-end-the-secs-clarity-charade-on-crypto/?sh=37e8e2dc25fa">according to&nbsp;Layton</a>:</p><blockquote>They approached the SEC for guidance on their product. Armstrong says the SEC responded with subpoenas for records and depositions, demanded a list of all their clients who had expressed interest in the product, and finally issued Coinbase a Wells notice — a warning of impending enforcement action. Armstrong said that by May of this year, the SEC was the only office in Washington refusing to meet with him at&nbsp;all.</blockquote><blockquote>“They are refusing to offer any opinion in writing to the industry on what should be allowed and why, and instead are engaging in intimidation tactics behind closed doors,” Armstrong tweeted. “Meanwhile, plenty of other crypto companies continue to offer a lend feature, but Coinbase is somehow not allowed&nbsp;to.”</blockquote><p>Now, there are plenty of arguments that the product Coinbase is looking to offer might very well be classified as a security — <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-09-08/lending-bitcoins-is-tricky">check out Matt Levine’s solid overview</a>.</p><p>That might be the weakest link in Armstrong’s tweetstorm, but it’s also not the primary point here. The SEC’s strategy of regulation by enforcement stifles innovation, hurts investors, and perhaps most egregiously, picks winners and losers — all while further muddying the regulatory landscape. Here’s Layton&nbsp;again:</p><blockquote>Without Congressional oversight, a regulator can run roughshod over the law. Why was Ethereum blessed while its rival Ripple was sued? Why does Coinbase get a Wells notice while crypto lenders like Aave, built on the Ethereum platform, get a pass? Jesse Powell, CEO of Coinbase’s rival, Kraken, tweeted a response to Armstrong that “regulators are beating down good actors because it’s convenient” and asked: “Who is behind the effort to drive domestic businesses and consumers offshore?” Angry XRP holders point to Clayton and Hinman’s business ties to Ethereum before and after their SEC tenures. Powell implies that established financial actors welcome regulatory chaos to protect their revenue of transaction fees if it deters crypto’s disruption of traditional business&nbsp;models.</blockquote><p>One option for Coinbase? Fight&nbsp;back.</p><p>As GlobaliD co-founder and CEO Greg Kidd has <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-why-innovation-sometimes-requires-legal-action-92ba26eb2a81">argued in the past</a>, sometimes you have to litigate to innovate. (That happens to be the theme of his talk at <a href="https://us.money2020.com/speaker/greg-kidd-s103-58562">this year’s Money2020 conference in Vegas next&nbsp;month</a>.)</p><p>The SEC is incentivized not to overcommit and pick off easy targets to fill their coffers. (That’s their business model.) And they’ll want to grab as much land as possible. But Ripple and Coinbase have the resources and the will to fight back and find regulatory clarity through the legal&nbsp;process.</p><p>Eventually, it will be up to Congress to provide the country with regulatory clarity for crypto. Until then, get ready for more litigation.</p> 2. What people are&nbsp;saying <p><a href="https://twitter.com/davidortiz/status/1435642074284666891?s=12">Brian Armstrong</a>:</p><blockquote>Look….we’re committed to following the law. Sometimes the law is unclear. So if the SEC wants to publish guidance, we are also happy to follow that (it’s nice if you actually enforce it evenly across the industry equally&nbsp;btw).</blockquote><blockquote>But in this case they are refusing to offer any opinion in writing to the industry on what should be allowed and why, and instead are engaging in intimidation tactics behind closed doors. Whatever their theory is here, it feels like a reach/land grab vs other regulators.</blockquote><blockquote>Meanwhile, plenty of other crypto companies continue to offer a lend feature, but Coinbase is somehow not allowed&nbsp;to.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>If you don’t want this activity, then simply publish your position, in writing, and enforce it evenly across the industry.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-capital-2669d1b8-4017-4cad-a333-48fbc5df177f.html">Felix Salmon</a>:</p><blockquote>Why it matters: Coinbase, the first major crypto company to get SEC approval to go public on a U.S. stock exchange, is about as regulator-friendly as crypto companies get — it has positioned itself as being far more in compliance with U.S. regulatory strictures than overseas rivals like Binance or&nbsp;FTX.</blockquote><blockquote>This week’s news shows that the industry still has a long way to go before it truly comes to terms with the U.S. regulatory environment.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>The other side: “The SEC doesn’t have the obligation (or the resources) to issue guidance about things that should be obvious to a baby securities lawyer,” <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamLevitin/status/1435652290627653636">tweets</a> Georgetown Law professor Adam Levitin. “It’s really astounding that Coinbase thinks it’s entitled to anything&nbsp;more.”</blockquote><blockquote>The bottom line: Coinbase’s comparative advantage was supposed to be that it stands comfortably in America’s regulatory good graces. But now Armstrong seems to be jealous of other crypto companies that offer similar products without SEC approval, and is picking fights with regulators.</blockquote><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-09-08/lending-bitcoins-is-tricky">Matt Levine</a>:</p><blockquote>A Bitcoin lending program — in which (1) a bunch of people pool their Bitcoins, (2) some manager or smart contract lends those Bitcoins to borrowers who pay interest, and (3) some or all of the interest is paid back to the people in the pool — is pretty straightforwardly an investment contract and thus a security.</blockquote><blockquote>I have been saying this for months, though that’s only because the SEC has also been saying it for months. But I admit that the SEC hasn’t been saying it in a particularly clear way. There’s not an SEC press release saying “FYI crypto lending programs are obviously securities.” And I gather that there are a lot of crypto lending programs — they’re a staple feature of decentralized finance platforms — and roughly none of them are registered with the SEC. The SEC and state regulators have brought enforcement actions against a few of them — we’ve talked about BitConnect and BlockFi and Blockchain Credit Partners — but I suppose each of those is distinctive in its own way, and there are about a zillion others that haven’t been sued by the SEC. 1 So you could reasonably look around and be like “oh sure we can pool people’s Bitcoins and lend them and pass along the interest, that’s not a security that should involve the SEC.” You’d be wrong, but I get where you’re coming&nbsp;from.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>Look, I get it. From the perspective of Coinbase, and of its customers, and frankly of most normal people interested in&nbsp;crypto:</blockquote>  People would like to lend their Bitcoins.  It doesn’t feel like a security.  It’s kind of annoying and archaic that a 1946 Supreme Court case says that it&nbsp;is?  <blockquote>But look at it from the SEC’s perspective:</blockquote>  The SEC really doesn’t like&nbsp;crypto.  The SEC is a regulatory agency that has a general tendency to want to do more regulating.  Popular tokens like Bitcoin and Ether are not securities and so not subject to SEC regulation, which leaves the SEC feeling&nbsp;antsy.  But crypto lending programs are pretty clearly securities subject to SEC regulation.  So for the SEC to say “crypto lending programs are securities and need to be regulated” serves the dual purposes of (1) expanding SEC jurisdiction over crypto and (2) stopping those programs.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>A paradigm for aligning Development, Delivery, Infrastructure Setup &amp; Management, and Operations in a seamless manner, with identity &amp; security always at the forefront. Policy-based, automated, and with well-segregated but aligned responsibilities.</p>
<p>DevOps, an integrated approach for development and operations of software and services, and DevSecOps, adding a security angle, have been around for close to a decade. While DevOps became an established principle, combining agile software development and the subsequent operations, DevSecOps – despite being intensively discussed – is seldom implemented and enforced in practice.</p>
<p>This leads to a variety of challenges, such as:</p>
 
 Security as an afterthought, leading to sub-optimal implementation of security and delaying the delivery of software 
 Identity as an afterthought, leading to islands of identities instead of integrated identity, and identity-related risks such as weak authentication, but also bearing the risk of inadequate customer experience on the onboarding and access journey 
 Violation of the requirements, such as in GDPR, to deliver privacy-by-design and security-by-design, as well as gaps in security-by-default, caused, e.g., by coding settings instead of relying on identity and security services 
 Lack of consistent, stable Security API layers and Identity API layers that consume standardized services from Security Fabrics and Identity Fabrics, leading to extensive effort for continuous redevelopment and re-coding of security and identity instead of just consumption of standardized services 
 Security-as-code as a misconception, meaning that developers are involved in coding security instead of utilizing APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to consume security and identity services 
 Infrastructure security is defined in code, which is error-prone, hard to manage and virtually impossible to incorporate in comprehensive Access Governance, and which requires developers to spend time on tasks that are not within their primary focus 
 Lack of segregation of duties between development, infrastructure, operations, security, and identity 
 
 What Is SODAS 
<p>SODAS (Secure Operation &amp; Development of Agile Services) is a concept that addresses these shortcomings and can be used as a foundation to achieve the benefits of:</p>
 
 Fast, agile software development 
 Efficient, automated infrastructure setup and software/service deployment 
 Secure, efficient operations in multi-cloud, multi-hybrid environments 
 Delivering secure software on time 
 Consistently enforcing the principles of privacy-by-design, security-by-design, and security-by-default 
 
<p>A major principle within SODAS is to strengthen the skills of employees by focusing on these, instead of requiring, e.g., developers to deal with infrastructure specifics, or security experts coding security instead of just declaring policies. Segregation of skills and specialization help in evolving the workforce even in an age of a skills shortage. It also helps in having clearly-defined accountabilities and responsibilities, leading to a more efficient, but well integrated IT organization.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 1: The three pillars of the SODAS approach, spanning agile development, automated setup and management of infrastructure and operations, underpinned by consistent identity and security services.</p>
 The 3 Pillars of SODAS 
<p>SODAS consists of three pillars and a foundation, which is Security and Identity. It extends the DevOps and DevSecOps paradigm by requiring a closer integration with Infrastructure Management, specifically by adding Security and Identity in a manner that is ubiquitous to the entire process from development to operations, but at the same time well-segregated and delivered as a service to developers. This reduces developers‘ workload and allows them to consume security and identity services, instead of continually recreating these.</p>
<p>For Development, there is little change. It must be business-driven, (following the overarching <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/it-for-the-digital-age-introducing-basis-business-driven-agile-secure-it-as-a-service">BASIS model defined by KuppingerCole</a>), it must be agile, and it must follow modern design and architecture principles, such as building on microservices architectures.</p>
<p>For efficient DevOps and supporting complex multi-cloud, multi-hybrid environments that are the reality for most organizations today, infrastructure for running the services must be provisioned and configured. Infrastructure must also grow with the business needs, requiring elasticity and scalability, which – depending on the runtime environment – is a given or must be managed by the organization. Infrastructure is also not just compute and storage, but also network. Following the principles of BASIS, which also apply to SODAS, this is provided by policy-based automation, utilizing information gathered about both the infrastructure and the requirements of the new services that shall be deployed. This requires integration of information from development, infrastructure, and other areas into (virtual) repositories, building on a common semantic, so that policy-based automation – commonly supported by AI/ML – can be applied.</p>
 Policy-Based Automation, Unified Across the Multi-Cloud, Multi-Hybrid Environments 
<p>Operations then also build on this approach of policy-based automation, unified across the multi-cloud, multi-hybrid environments. Clouds already differ vastly in the way they are managed. Additionally, between a public cloud and on-premises IT, the required level of management differs vastly due to the differences in provider responsibilities versus tenant responsibilities. However, a unified layer for policy-based automation enables organizations to abstract these differences and thus simplify operations.</p>
<p>This all is underpinned by the Security and Identity layer, building on modern Security Fabrics and Identity Fabrics, delivering a consistent and comprehensive set of security and identity services via consistent API layers that remain stable even when the underlying architecture changes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 2: Key technologies involved in SODAS, integrating development, operations, and security by policy-based automation.</p>
<p>This all builds on the set of technologies described in the BASIS concept. For Development and Operations, DevOps Tools, but also IT Operations Management for the operations part, are essential. IT Operations Management is another vital element for the infrastructure setup and operations. Allowing the flexible shift of workloads from one environment to the other in a complex multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT is essential, and supported by this approach. The inherent limitations found frequently in DevOps and being caused by the vast differences even in operating the major public clouds, focusing on a single defined target environment for operations are overcome by SODAS.</p>
 The Role of Enterprise Service Management 
<p>Enterprise Service Management is another essential element, for allowing a business to express its demand, and for managing all the assets and services in a consistent and coherent manner. All these elements pay into the virtual repository that provides a unified perspective across services and the environment to execute these, making the formerly unknown and dynamic known. These repositories are accessed by policies and automation solutions primarily via APIs.</p>
<p>Last not least, cybersecurity and IAM (Identity &amp; Access Management), delivered via Identity Fabrics and Security Fabrics, are the foundation for delivering the identity and security services via a defined, comprehensive, and stable set of APIs. This all is well-integrated, last not least via the repository and the policy-based automation, backed by AI and ML.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 3: The key actions to take in delivering to the SODAS model.</p>
<p>To move from today’s DevOps towards an approach that delivers on the promise of DevSecOps and that is made to support the full range of a multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT environment, SODAS can be implemented in four stages, following the: plan – build – deliver – run approach.</p>
<p>Planning is about optimizing the organization, with a clear segregation of responsibilities, but also by defining interfaces and setting up cross-divisional processes. This is about focusing, not to be mixed up with building new silos. Silos are not connected; silos are not integrated. The concept of SODAS is about focus and about leveraging the skills and specialization of the workforce in an optimized manner, supported by integration at the organizational and technical layer, and powered by policy-based automation.</p>
 Tooling Beyond the DevOps Tools Chain 
<p>To make this work, it requires the setup of the tooling, beyond the DevOps tools chain. It also requires modernizing the DevOps tools chain so that infrastructure and operations management are segregated via defined interfaces. This also allows for managing security and identity managed externally (and being consumed via APIs), controlling the DevOps tools chain. It requires working on the Identity Fabric and Security Fabric. It requires ESM and building the (very dynamic, always current) Asset Repository. And it requires policy-based automation. This is a journey, not a big bang. But every organization will already have several elements in place for building their SODAS model.</p>
<p>This then needs to be delivered by gathering data, by defining policies, by setting up automation, and by defining the identity and security services, the APIs, libraries, and widgets that make consumption of complex identity and security seamless to the developers.</p>
<p>Guiding principles for SODAS:</p>
 
 Business requests IT Services 
 Unified view on IT Services – one IT, across multi-hybrid, multi-cloud environments 
 Policy-based automation instead of manual administration or coding 
 Development is agile, consuming identity &amp; security APIs, delivering status/requirements back to DevOps tools as well as IT Operations Management 
 Automation of identity, security, and infrastructure setup &amp; management 
 
<p>Our recommendation is to revisit the DevOps and DevSecOps approaches in place in the organization according to SODAS to improve security and time-to-value in delivering Digital Services.</p>

 Part 2: Development Environment Tools and How to Use MetaMask to Manage&nbsp;Keys <p>Last Week, Ontology announced the official deployment of a TestNet supporting EVM and opened the EVM compatible public beta to developers around the world. At the same time, the “<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-evm-testnet-officially-deployed-now-opening-evm-compatible-public-beta-to-developers-6dddc2bdd764">Ontology Security Vulnerability and Threat Intelligence Bounty Programme</a>” was officially launched in cooperation with SlowMist, a well-known code auditing agency. The top reward for reporting a vulnerability is $12,000 in&nbsp;ONG.</p><p>In order to encourage community developers to quickly and easily familiarize themselves with the Ontology EVM development environment, we specially prepared a “Handbook for Dummies”, which explains the essentials of Ontology EVM contract development.</p><p>In <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ontology-evm-contract-development-part-1-network-details-2095f6e141e5">Part 1</a>, we introduced the ChainID, RPC URL, browser address and other configuration information related to the Ontology EVM. Developers can configure MetaMask wallets to the Ontology network based on the above information. In this section, we introduce the tools for developing and deploying EVM contracts on Ontology, and how to use MetaMask plug-in wallets to manage Ethereum&nbsp;wallets.</p> 2. Introduction to Development Environment Tools <p>Since the EVM contract is developed in the <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&amp;runs=200&amp;evmVersion=null&amp;version=soljson-v0.8.1+commit.df193b15.js">Solidity</a> language, we have detailed how to build the Remix, Truffle and Hardhat development environment, and enter a series of work such as contract development, compilation, deployment, and debugging. In addition, developers can also directly reuse the existing Ethereum contract framework to develop and deploy EVM contracts on Ontology.</p> 2.1 Remix Development Environment <p><a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false&amp;runs=200&amp;evmVersion=null&amp;version=soljson-v0.8.1+commit.df193b15.js">Remix IDE</a> is an open source Solidity contract integrated development environment that supports users in contract development, compilation, deployment, and debugging. Please see this <a href="https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">link</a> for the official English version of Remix&nbsp;IDE.</p><p>Below we use a Hello World contract example to show how to use&nbsp;Remix.</p><p>2.1.1 Install Development Environment</p><p>To use Remix for the first time, you need to find and add the Solidity Compiler and Deploy and Run Transactions modules to the compiler in PLUGIN&nbsp;MANAGER.</p><p>Next, select the Solidity environment, create a new file and name it HelloWorld.sol. Then, copy the <a href="https://github.com/ontio/ontology/blob/master/docs/specifications/evm_refernce/contract-demo/helloworlddemo/helloworld.sol">Hello World contract code</a> that has been written to this&nbsp;file.</p><p>2.1.2 Compile&nbsp;Contract</p><p>Click the Solidity Compiler button, select the compiler version as 0.5.10, and start compiling HelloWorld.sol.</p><p>2.1.3 Deployment Contract</p><p>After compilation, the contract can be deployed to the Ontology network. The following will take the TestNet as an example. Before deploying the contract, you need to connect the MetaMask wallet to the Ontology network (refer to the technical viewpoint of the previous issue), and receive the test ONG as a handling fee on the Ontology <a href="https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Faucet&nbsp;address</a>.</p><p>Then, select “Injected Web3” in the Remix environment, and finally click “Deploy” to complete the contract deployment.</p><p>2.1.4 Call&nbsp;Contract</p><p>After the contract is deployed, the developer can call the methods in the contract. When deploying the Hello World contract in the example, the Hello string will be stored in the contract. We can call the message method of the contract to query this string, as shown&nbsp;below:</p> 2.2 Truffle Development Environment <p>Truffle is a framework used to assist in the development, testing and management of Ethereum smart contracts. For official documents, please refer to this&nbsp;<a href="https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">link</a>.</p><p>Below we use this <a href="https://github.com/ontio/ontology/tree/master/docs/specifications/evm_refernce/contract-demo/truffledemo">test code</a> as an example to introduce the use of&nbsp;Truffle.</p><p>2.2.1 Install Development Environment</p><p>To initialize the development environment, first install the configuration files required by the Truffle environment.</p>  <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js v8+ LTS and npm</a> (comes with&nbsp;Node)  <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a>  <p>Then install Truffle with the following command.</p><blockquote>$ npm install -g&nbsp;truffle</blockquote><p>2.2.2 Configure Truffle-Config</p>  First create&nbsp;.secret to store the test mnemonic or private key (can be found in MetaMask)  Then modify the truffle-config file as&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ontio/ontology/tree/master/docs/specifications/evm_refernce/tutorial">follows</a>  <p>2.2.3 Deploy the contract to the Ontology&nbsp;network</p><p>Execute the following command to deploy the contract.</p><blockquote>$ truffle migrate — network&nbsp;ontology</blockquote><p>If the <a href="https://github.com/ontio/ontology/tree/master/docs/specifications/evm_refernce/tutorial">following</a> output is displayed, the deployment is successful.</p><p>Note: Try not to use Ethereum token units (such as wei, gwei, ether, etc.) when writing test&nbsp;scripts.</p> 2.3 Hardhat Development Environment <p>Hardhat is a development environment for compiling, deploying, testing and debugging Ethereum applications. Below we use this <a href="https://github.com/ontio/ontology/tree/master/docs/specifications/evm_refernce/contract-demo/hardhatdemo">test code</a> as an example to introduce the use of&nbsp;Hardhat.</p><p>2.3.1 Install Development Environment</p><p>Please refer to this <a href="https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">installation tutorial</a> for installation.</p><p>2.3.2 Configure Hardhat-Config</p>  Modify the hardhat.config.js file according to the <a href="https://github.com/ontio/ontology/tree/master/docs/specifications/evm_refernce/tutorial">following code</a>  <p>2.3.3 Deployment Contract</p><p>Execute the following command in the project root directory to deploy the contract to the Ontology&nbsp;testnet.</p><blockquote>$ npx hardhat run scripts/sample-script.js — network ontology_testnet</blockquote><p>Results of&nbsp;the</p><blockquote>$ npx hardhat run scripts/sample-script.js — network ontology_testnet</blockquote><p>Contract deployed to: 0xB105388ac7F019557132eD6eA90fB4BAaFde6E81</p> 3. Use MetaMask to Manage&nbsp;Keys <p>Ontology Network supports developers to use the MetaMask plug-in to manage Ethereum wallet private&nbsp;keys.</p><p>MetaMask is a non-custodial wallet.

				  Le vote décentralisé  
			  
				
				
				  Une nouvelle manière de voter à la fois simple – sécurisée – confidentielle et innovante  
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Une entreprise peut souhaiter consulter ses collaborateurs, clients ou partenaires pour de multiples raisons, en les sollicitant lors de son assemblée générale, pour obtenir d’eux un retour sur un événement donné ou pour n’importe quel autre type de prise de décision collective.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Elle doit alors choisir un processus de vote efficace parmi le vote traditionnel ou des mécanismes de vote électronique existant.</p>
<p>Unikname propose un nouveau type de vote électronique décentralisé complètement sécurisé, 100% confidentiel et très facile d’utilisation. Grâce à la technologie de<a href="https://www.unikname.network"> la blockchain Unikname Network</a> et aux propriétés de vérifiabilité de ses service providers, Unikname Quorum permet d’atteindre un haut niveau de confiance.</p> 
			 
			  
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Introduction aux systèmes de vote  
			  
				
				
				  Le vote traditionnel  
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Le vote traditionnel, sous forme de bulletin papier, est simple dans la théorie, mais compliqué et coûteux dans son organisation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pour mettre en place un tel processus, les participants doivent se déplacer, et pour qu’il y ait suffisamment de confiance dans ce scrutin, un certain nombre d’observateurs doivent surveiller le déroulement des différentes étapes. L’expérience de vote est alors fastidieuse pour les votants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>De son côté, l’organisation doit mobiliser un nombre important de personnel afin d’assurer le bon déroulement du scrutin. Les bulletins doivent être préparés et distribués en amont et l’accès au scrutin doit être contrôlé. À la clôture du vote, l’organisation doit encore s’atteler aux étapes de dépouillement et de publication des résultats, le tout sous la surveillance d’observateurs, garants de la conformité du processus.</p>
<p>Le temps du dépouillement est proportionnel au nombre de votants et/ou au nombre de personnel participant au dépouillement. Il y a donc un délai non négligeable entre la clôture du scrutin et la publication des résultats.</p>
<p>Une telle organisation permet de garantir un haut niveau de transparence et de confidentialité mais elle est très coûteuse pour une entreprise.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Le vote électronique  
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Depuis une vingtaine d’années, de nombreux algorithmes et protocoles de vote électronique ont fait leur apparition, promettant de réduire les coûts et les délais. Cependant, il existe des réticences à déployer ces solutions en raison de<a href="https://dl.gi.de/handle/20.500.12116/29131"> problèmes de confiance</a>. Depuis leur première mise en place <a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/publications/theses/diss/2013/TCD-SCSS-DISSERTATION-2013-045.pdf">au début des années 1990 en Belgique</a>, beaucoup de failles de sécurité ont été remontées, notamment sur le non-respect de la confidentialité des votes, ou de l’aspect invérifiable des résultats.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Si certains organismes ou même certains pays (<a href="https://www.scss.tcd.ie/publications/theses/diss/2013/TCD-SCSS-DISSERTATION-2013-045.pdf">comme l’Estonie</a>) utilisent fréquemment des systèmes de vote électronique, <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/PSNR20.pdf">ces processus ne font toujours pas consensus.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pour le cas du vote en entreprise, en plus de la problématique de la confiance et de la sécurité, les professionnels font face à un obstacle supplémentaire : la multiplicité de plateformes. Utiliser une plateforme dédiée au vote électronique oblige ses utilisateurs à prendre en main une énième application, à gérer un énième identifiant, à s’authentifier selon un processus spécifique… Finalement ce qui est gagné en temps est perdu en complexité.</p>
<p>L’idéal serait donc une solution pleinement intégrée dans le système d’informations de l’entreprise, fortement sécurisée et respectueuse de la vie privée de ses utilisateurs. Ne serait-ce pas là toutes les valeurs de la Plateforme SSI Unikname 😉 ?</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Le vote décentralisé avec Unikname Quorum  
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>L’organisation d’un vote traditionnel repose sur quatre acteurs ou entités principales : le commissaire chargé de déclarer le scrutin et de constituer la liste électorale, les assesseurs responsables de l’administration du déroulement, l’urne permettant l’anonymisation des bulletins et les décompteurs organisant le dépouillement. Il y a également des observateurs invités à vérifier que chacun remplit bien son rôle.</p>
<p>Sur Unikname Network, ces différents rôles de commissaire, d’administrateur, de service d’anonymisation et de dépouilleur sont tenus par des service providers dédiés. Les Service Providers sont des petits programmes développés par la société Unikname ou ses partenaires s’exécutant sur le réseau Unikname Network. Ces programmes sont open-source, ce qui permet à n’importe qui de devenir observateur d’un vote en vérifiant que les service providers remplissent correctement leurs missions. Ils sont représentés sur le réseau par leur propre <a href="https://www.unikname.com/identifiant-decentralise-unikname/">UniknameID</a>, l’identifiant décentralisé Unikname, qui leur permet de signer des opérations, de s’authentifier ou encore d’enregistrer des transactions dans la blockchain.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Le commissaire, l’administrateur, le service d’anonymisation et de dépouilleur interviennent chacun leur tour dans les différentes étapes du vote pour garantir les exigences suivantes :</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 
					 = 
					 
						
						 <p>L’Exactitude – Un vote ne peut pas être modifié, supprimé, ni fabriqué artificiellement</p> 
					 
				 
			  
				
				
				 
					 = 
					 
						
						 <p>La Vérifiabilité – Les votants peuvent vérifier que leur vote est comptabilisé</p> 
					 
				 
			  
				
				
				 
					 = 
					 
						
						 <p>La Confidentialité – Personne qui ne peut pas connaître le vote d’un participant</p> 
					 
				 
			  
				
				
				 
					 = 
					 
						
						 <p>L’Exclusivité – Seuls les membres de la liste électorale peuvent voter et ils ne le peuvent qu’une seule fois</p> 
					 
				 
			  
				
				
				 
					 = 
					 
						
						 <p>La Non interférence – Aucun résultat ne peut être publié avant la fin du scrutin</p> 
					 
				 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Le déroulement du vote  
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Le vote décentralisé avec Unikname Quorum s’organise en trois étapes : l’enregistrement, le processus de vote et le dépouillement. À chacune de ces étapes, des informations permettant la transparence du scrutin et la vérification des exigences ci-dessus sont écrites dans la blockchain par les Service Providers. Des SSI credits sont échangés entre les différentes parties pour permettre l’accès aux différents services de<a href="https://www.unikname.com/plateforme-unikname/"> la Plateforme SSI Unikname</a>, comme par exemple les services d’écritures.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  L’enregistrement  
			  
				
				
				 <p>L’organisateur du scrutin contacte le commissaire pour préparer avec lui la liste électorale et les conditions de vote en échange de SSI credits. L’ensemble des crédits sont envoyés au commissaire qui va se charger de les répartir parmi les Service Providers concernés. Ainsi les participants pourront interagir avec eux sans avoir à manipuler de SSI credits.</p>
<p>Les informations seront écrites anonymement dans la blockchain par le commissaire et sous le contrôle de l’organisateur. Ainsi, les règles ne pourront pas être modifiées par la suite.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				 L’organisateur prend ensuite contact avec les participants pour les inviter à participer au scrutin. 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Le processus de vote  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Pour voter, les participants vont d’abord s’authentifier auprès de l’administrateur pour que celui-ci vérifie qu’ils sont bien inscrits sur la liste électorale et qu’ils n’ont pas encore voté. Grâce à des mécanismes d’anonymisation, cette vérification peut se faire sans que les votants n’aient à partager leur UniknameID avec l’administrateur.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Une fois les vérifications effectuées, l’administrateur signe une autorisation qui permet aux participants d’envoyer leur bulletin au service d’anonymisation. Ce dernier enregistre alors une transaction de vote, sous le contrôle du votant, pour prouver que ce dernier a bien participé au scrutin. Ensuite, le service d’anonymisation applique des algorithmes permettant de casser les liens entre un participant et son vote, puis conserve tous les bulletins jusqu’à la clôture du scrutin.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Naturellement, le vote d’un participant est chiffré localement directement dans son appareil et les échanges entre les différentes parties se font sous un protocole de type end-to-end encryption. À partir du moment où le bulletin a quitté l’appareil du votant, aucune entité n’a la possibilité d’en connaître le contenu avant le dépouillement.</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				  Le décompte des votes et la publication des résultats  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Lorsque le scrutin touche à sa fin, le dépouilleur reçoit l’ensemble des bulletins anonymisés. Il est le seul Service Provider capable de les déchiffrer, mais il n’est pas capable de faire de lien entre les votes et les votants.</p> 
			  
				
				
				
			 
			 
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				 
				
				
				 <p>Il va alors construire <a href="https://forum.unikname.com/t/an-introduction-to-merkle-trees/747">un arbre de Merkle</a> dont les feuilles sont l’ensemble des votes, ce qui permet à chaque participant de vérifier que son vote est comptabilisé. Le résultat publié est incontestable.

<p>QUESTIONS!</p>
 
 Questions started at about [46:30] &nbsp;– though some questions came earlier. We covered:
 
 “I don’t trust organizations and corporations” – where we point out the “decentralize the world” approach goes to far. 
 Phoning home – (hint: no it doesn’t need to phone home) 
 Where are Holders Authorized? (hint: <a href="https://www.continuumloop.com/bubbas-wallet/">Knowing if you can trust Bubba’s Wallet</a> may be more important…) 
 Canadian Digitial Identities are emerging – can startups leverage this?&nbsp; 
 Explain the Role of Government in ecosystems.&nbsp; 
 “Can a third party discover who I trust from a trust registry?” 
 How will interoperability work between trust registries?

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/kuppinger">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>A paradigm for unified delivery of IT services to the business demand, based on automated, policy-based management, and supported by the unification of heterogeneous multi-cloud multi-hybrid IT environments following a services-based approach.</p>
<p>Businesses need to reinvent themselves continually in the Digital Age. Every business is a Digital Business today, that needs <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/cio-advice-how-to-make-your-digital-business-fly">to deliver and improve Digital Services that differentiate it</a> from the competition. This requires an IT that is built to deliver to the business demand in an agile, yet secure and well-controlled manner.</p>
<p>This will work only when reducing the inherent complexity of today’s multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT, which is here to stay. Part of reducing that complexity is the gradual shift to the cloud, following “cloud-first” strategies. But the recent advent of Edge Computing has demonstrated that parts of IT never will run in the cloud. Beyond that, there is not a single cloud, but many clouds, resulting in a multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT.</p>
<p></p>
 Reduce Complexity by Unification and Automation 
<p>The complexity must be reduced by unification, wherever feasible, and by shifting to automated, policy-based management of IT across the “runtime” environments. The starting point is to focus on agile development, delivery, operations, and security of Digital Services, with a clear service focus. Services and the underlying resources are known, as are the users. Focusing on access of everyone (the users) and everything to these services and resources, is best achieved by treating everything as a service, and procuring, delivering, managing, and securing services in a consistent manner across all environments.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 1: The four main stages of the BASIS approach to plan, build, deliver and run Digital Services in an agile yet secure manner.</p>
<p>BASIS is a concept for delivering IT to meet the demand of the business in an agile, secure way, and with a unified perspective across all IT, be it on-premises, on the edge, or in some cloud. Services are treated in a unified manager, with policy-based automation being applied uniformly across the various environments, and across services.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Plan, Build, Deliver, and Run – The Essence of BASIS 
<p>The starting point for BASIS is a plan – build – deliver –&nbsp; run approach. It starts with the business demand and a &nbsp;re-defined IT strategy focused on efficient and agile delivery of IT services to business demands on time, and the IT organization that supports this. For the IT organization, the most important change is that there is no distinction between cloud and on-premises, as it is found in many organizations today, and that the focus is on development, delivery, operations of services, and security.</p>
<p>Build covers both the procurement and development of services, to which deployment model suits best. Cloud first strategies are a recommendation, but the reality is that, e.g., in hospitals or manufacturing, many services will continue to run on-premises. Additionally, software development takes a central role, with software being essential for differentiation of businesses in the Digital Age.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Application Delivery Necessitates Identity Management and Security Measures 
<p>These services need to be delivered, requiring the right setup of the infrastructure, e.g., Kubernetes instances in a public cloud or virtual machines in a private cloud environment, requiring delivery of the applications and services themselves, and the setup of adequate Identity Management and Security for all resources that come with these services and that are consumed by these services.</p>
<p>Once deployed, efficient execution of these services is required, from the cloud or the hybrid IT, thus still potentially involving Data Center operations, as Hybrid Cloud Operations from the edge to the public cloud. It requires Application Management and, last but not least, the IAM (Identity &amp; Access Management) and Cybersecurity to operate these Digital Services securely.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 2: Key technologies involved in BASIS, integrating development, operations, and security by policy-based automation.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Building a BASIS Approach 
<p>It is apparent that not all parts of a multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT environment are alike. Not everything in a multi-cloud, multi-hybrid environment can or should be managed in the same manner, starting with different provider and tenant responsibilities. However, what always is under tenant control, can be treated in a uniform manner, especially when internal IT or MSPs also deliver according to the service paradigm known from the cloud, with clearly defined tenant and provider responsibilities.</p>
<p>The essential building blocks for the BASIS approach on agile, secure IT and Digital Service delivery are:</p>
 
 Enterprise Service Management for business service requests, managing services across the entire IT, and providing insight into the assets that must be managed and secured. 
 DevOps for delivering services following agile software development paradigms, including automated testing and delivery into the operations environment of choice. 
 These environments must be managed, across the entire multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT environment. The depth and breadth of management required differs. In a public cloud, less management is required, but even there, several services must be managed and monitored. 
 Policy Management &amp; Enforcement is a central component, as the foundation for automating the management of service delivery. 
 Identity &amp; Access Management as well as Cybersecurity are essential for delivering services securely and managing everyone and everything that has access to services and the underlying resources. 
 
<p>All this must be well-integrated, being backed by access to information about the current state of IT across the multi-cloud, multi-hybrid environment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Fig. 3: The key actions to take in delivering to the BASIS model.</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Guiding Principles for BASIS 
<p>IT leaders must take various actions in each area to implement the BASIS approach for the agile delivery of IT services in a secure manner:</p>
 
 Plan: The main focus is to shift IT consequently to a business service delivery organization, driven by business demand. This requires alignment of development, operations across the multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT environment, Identity &amp; Access Management for the Digital Identities of everything and everyone, and Cybersecurity. Responsibilities as well as interfaces between the various areas must be well-defined. 
 Build: These interfaces include, at a technical level, Identity &amp; Security API layers that allow developers to easily and efficiently consume identity and security services for the Digital Services they are creating. It also requires interfaces to all current IT states, across the entire multi-cloud, multi-hybrid IT, as well as to service requests and the state of IT services. Only when the applications, services, identities, and other elements are known and their state is accessible, a unified management can be applied. 
 Deliver: Delivery starts with policies that form the foundation for automation. Policies are rather easy to describe. However, with a growing number of policies, support by technology, including AI/ML, will be required for proposing, analyzing and optimizing policies. Policies are best described at generic levels and then – by technology – translated into the concrete policies and measures for the various parts of the IT environment. 
 Run: This starts with the enforcement of a consistent service request &amp; delivery process and implementing and enforcing the policy-based automation approach. Last but not least, the identity and security models must be implemented and enforced, for consistent control of all the resources in today’s complex, heterogeneous IT environments. 
 
<p>Guiding principles for BASIS:</p>
 
 Business requests IT Services, business demanding new or modified IT services, or initiates change 
 Unified view on IT Services services as foundation – one IT, across the entire multi-hybrid, multi-cloud environments 
 Policy-based automation instead of manual administration or coding 
 Development is agile, consuming identity &amp; security services via APIs, returning status/requirements as feedback, and as input to operations 
 Automation of identity, security and infrastructure setup &amp; management 
 
<p>Our recommendation is to revisit the IT organization according to BASIS, for delivering Digital Services successfully and at the speed of the business.</p>

<p>Companies across the globe are undergoing digital transformation. The main challenge with this approach is the ability to securely manage access for on-premise, cloud and SaaS applications. Entitlement Management across this hybrid landscape requires management of cloud assets, IAM profiles, groups, roles and entitlements in support of Identity Lifecycle Management, Access Management, and Access Governance. <br> <br> Workloads have been running in the cloud since the last decade or so. AWS, GCP and Azure have replaced traditional data centers and companies continue to migrate their production workloads to cloud at blistering pace. So, what changed? Firstly, we are starting to realize that this cloud infrastructure model necessitates a different type of identity and access management solutions as native solutions don’t cover multi-cloud IaaS model and traditional IGA solutions fall short in their scope. Secondly, business goals and priorities are driving engineering teams to work on initiatives without formal approval and oversight. With IaaS it is easy to spin up an instance, assign various resources. As organizations aren’t centrally controlling these spin offs, any vulnerabilities in this growing shadow IT is a target for hackers.<br> <br> SecurEnds enables entitlement management across hybrid cloud assets for security and compliance.</p>




<p>1. Provide visibility over hybrid-cloud assets<br> Discover all identities, service accounts, IAM users, roles and policies within single or hybrid cloud the IaaS infrastructure.<br> See the granular permissions held by IAM Users, Roles and Service Accounts. This is important to define least privilege policies.<br> 2. Provide governance over hybrid-cloud assets<br> Enforce least privilege policies across all cloud identities to avoid privilege creep. <br> Routine audits of configurations across cloud environments helps with policy enforcement and compliance.<br> 3: Provide remediation over hybrid-cloud assets<br> Post identity review kick off automation to rectify privileges</p>

<p>After applying an agile way of working for the last three years the Rabobank Identity &amp; Access Management service has gone through a transformation. The increased autonomy of teams, using backlogs with prioritized epics, applying agile rituals in order to create space for growth in applying agile principles, all of these have affected how IAM services are developed and delivered. Where the arena is uncertain and customers have a somewhat-defined request the agile, iterative approach works. Yet where the arena is regulatory governed and compliance driven an agile approach works less. The impact of incidents in a 24x7 security service immediately reflects itself on the development of the service when a devops team is used. The strain between waterfall project management and this agile approach is not instrumental but conceptual. Aligning expectations with the wider organization is a challenge in itself. This presentation will demonstrate the pros and cons of agile on IAM.</p>

  <p>The paradox of simplicity is that making things simpler is hard work. - Bill Jensen</p>
<p>&nbsp;Building strong passwordless authentication from scratch can be very time-consuming. Integrating the necessary infrastructure into a typical password-centric identity code base increases code complexity exponentially. Taking into consideration that well-known user flows have to be changed and enhanced with new authentication options may also pose significant challenges for developers. They have to get it right - and make it as simple as possible for the end user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In this talk, we highlight possible pitfalls and necessary considerations when implementing passwordless FIDO and WebAuthn protocols. You will recognize how a cloud-native approach can simplify the integration of passwordless authentication and smoothen the requirements for developers and product owners of any online service. You’ll also learn how to gradually migrate existing users to the new authentication methods in a frictionless manner.</p>
<p>Join us to explore three possible abstraction layers we’ve identified to take the complexity away when dealing with FIDO and passwordless multi-factor authentication. Ranging from utilizing a managed FIDO API and SDKs up to a fully-fledged passwordless-native identity provider that can be integrated with OpenID Connect. We also will share some secrets on useful extensions of the FIDO standards we’ve identified when building our passwordless user experiences.</p>

  <p>The onslaught of account takeover attacks from insecure passwords is driving the rapid adoption of passwordless solutions.&nbsp; While the risk reduction benefits are substantial, eliminating passwords is just the first step on the path to fundamentally strong authentication.&nbsp; In the “new normal” era of work from anywhere, and rapidly increasing cloud adoption, organizations are moving to a new risk-based authentication model.&nbsp; Advanced organizations are validating users, their devices, and inspecting the security posture of the device for each login.&nbsp; Strong and continuous authentication is a fundamental building block of Zero Trust. Learn how you can make it happen without making the user experience miserable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Discussion topics include:</p>
 
 New cybersecurity and identity management requirements in the post COVID era 
 Traditional MFA vs Passwordless - avoiding the “security vs. painful user experience” tradeoff 
 Device trust and the confluence of cybersecurity and identity management 
 Continuous risk-based authentication&nbsp; 
 
<p>Takeaways:</p>
 
 Account takeovers and other attacks have increased as a result of distributed working - adopting a solution that removes passwords removes most of the risk 
 MFA has evolved beyond the traditional “password + SMS + pin” approach 
 CISO’s and IT no longer have to trade increased security for user convenience 
 Modern devices allow organizations to leverage the Secure Enclave / Trusted Platform Module for increased security 
 Continuous, risk-based authentication is a key factor in identity and access management

<p>Traditional IAM models have focused on users, policies, and roles, which met the needs of web applications in years past but as application development has evolved to APIs, an innovative approach to identity management is required. It is no longer just users, roles, and permissions. APIs must be integrated into the identity and access management framework to ensure adequate governance and security. <br> <br> Within an API there is a requestor (often on behalf of a user), a service (API), and the data that is being passed. All these entities in the transaction require unique identity and authorization; without identity, compliance and enforcement mandates cannot be met effectively and without authorization, there is a free-for-all on your APIs reminiscent of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. <br> <br> In this session, we will look at how rapid digitalization (first and third-party APIs + multi-or hybrid-cloud environments) has complicated security efforts, the role of API integration in data governance, and how companies can best navigate the heightened cyber-threat environment we find ourselves in today.</p>




<p>- Why API security requires more than traffic policy management and course-grained enforcement. <br> - Why APIs need to be integrated into the identity and access management framework to ensure adequate governance and security. <br> - How companies can reduce the burden on developers to allow for a proactive approach to API security instead of reactive.</p>

NIST SP 800-207 refers to a zero trust deployment pattern called “enhanced identity governance”. The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) has a project on implementing a zero trust architecture that will include enhanced identity governance. This talk will be an overview of the role of network identities in zero trust and the current status of the NCCoE project.</p>

  <p>IAM programs in organizations have a reputation for difficulty and high failure rates.&nbsp;Through education and later through experience, professionals learn that communication is the most critical success factor in all human undertakings. We may have cutting-edge technology, generous budgets, and a competent team and still fail our project miserably.&nbsp;High-quality communication about IAM with our stakeholders is insufficient to succeed, but it is a necessary condition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what is the building block of communication? Words and concepts.</p>
<p>Improving the IAM vocabulary's accuracy is the idea behind the TOME (The Open-Measure Encyclopedia) project - an open-source encyclopedia specialized in IAM, authored by volunteer IAM professionals for their peers. Its goal is to become the industry reference dictionary. It is free of charge and licensed under Creative Commons to facilitate its widespread adoption. It is rooted in science with a solid methodology and pervasive references to stand on the shoulders of giants.</p>
<p>In this session, I will present and define a series of IAM concepts, both frequently used and rare but often misunderstood</p>

  <p>Many companies from diverse industries increasingly rely on AI for strengthening their efficiency by automating jobs. Many of these advanced automation tools, however, currently become standard applications. Consequently, an isolated use of these tools will not enable companies to gain a competitive advantage. This presentation builds on an intelligence-based view of firm performance and the ‘Integrated Intelligence’ approach, which highlights the need to integrate AI with specific human expertise to outperform competitors and to transform a firm’s intelligence architecture. It further discusses the leadership implications for general managers and offers a systematic framework for generating growth and innovation beyond automation and efficiency. The ‘I3 – Integrated Intelligence Incubator’ provides executives with a toolset for developing appropriate strategic initiatives for intelligence-based future competition.</p>

<p>The pandemic, for all its impact, has enabled organisations to re-evaluate their working strategies and practices. But at what cost? Cybercrime on corporate applications has risen exponentially from the dispersed workforce and rapid cloud adoption has left organisations vulnerable to ransomware, malicious activity and internal subterfuge.</p>
<p>Danna Bethlehem, Director Product Marketing Authentication at Thales discusses how organisations can accelerate their business with the right approach to their IAM strategy. For 2021 and beyond, enterprises need to leave survival mode behind and adopt a drive to thrive.</p>
<p>Drawing on recently released research into the EMEA IAM market, she will highlight:</p>
 
 How demands of the corporate workforce for dispersed working is bringing IAM security concerns to the fore 
 How the next generational approach to IAM can enable forward thinking organisations to thrive 
 How enterprises can build an effective IAM strategy to drive their growth

   Deployment of IoT installations are accelerating as organisations seek to expand their business by adding IoT functionality to their products/service, or reduce their costs by automating processes. Unfortunately, in many cases these initiatives are not adequately executed and, as a result, do not meet expectations. 
 In this session we will look at 5 pillars of an IoT deployment: the Device pillar

  <p>Deployment of IoT installations are accelerating as organisations seek to expand their business by adding IoT functionality to their products/service, or reduce their costs by automating processes. Unfortunately, in many cases these initiatives are not adequately executed and, as a result, do not meet expectations.</p>
<p>In this session we will look at 5 pillars of an IoT deployment: the Device pillar ensures we select the appropriate sensors and actuators, the Control pillar guides our decisions on controller functionality, the Communications pillar ensures we consider which options fit our required functionality and budget, the IT pillar determines the level of integration between our IT and OT environments, and the Security pillar guides our protection strategy.</p>
<p>A holistic approach is a success-indicator for our IoT projects.</p>

Since 2018, IDPro has conducted an industry survey to call attention to the skills that identity practitioners possess and employee to be successful. In 2019, the survey was expanded to explore enterprise priorities to highlight which areas of the identity industry were garning more attention and investment. And in 2021, IDPro expanded the survey again to include questions about diversity and inclusion. Join Ian Glazer, Founder and Vice-President of IDPro, as he explores the results of this year’s survey and the implications for you, your employer, and the industry as a whole.</p>

Your digital double is active and involved in various activities, even when you take a nap. Therefore, securing the digital double is critical.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In an attempt to protect users from excessive tracking and surveillance, the last couple of years have witnessed major browser vendors introducing increasingly restrictive anti-tracking measures. Identity protocols and features got caught in the crossfire, however, forcing identity software vendors and developers to hastily introduce changes to restore functionality that browser changes broke. Is this the new normal? What will we do when a change will break an identity feature beyond repair?</p>
<p>This session will review the main browser changes that have affected identity over the last few years – Chrome’s SameSite and Safari’s ITP2 in particular, interpreting them as part of a larger trend and attempting to predict what the future will look like for identity customers and practitioners.</p>

<p>As more and more organizations go multi-cloud, the question arises how to integrate existing and compliance-proven enterprise IAM processes with the upcoming requirements of managing identity in the clouds.<br>In this talk we will present two different approaches on how an organization can manage multi-cloud identities and access. The models are based on real life examples we have found to work out for organizations we work with. What we learn with these examples is that there is a wide spectrum between agility and control. Each organization has to find their own balance in this playing field and design a solution that is valuable to them and their team.</p>

<p>I today's digital world (post EU DMA, DSA, DGA regulation proposals (now tabled in EU Parliament for legislative approval by 2023), GAIAx birth in Europe and eprivacy new regulations adoption, the hard line separation between personal and non personal data is blurring and companies have yet understood what this means for them. While they thought that only personal data needed to be consented, now it's all the data that need the consent log prof for each digital identity they get associated to. Europeans have also created a new "notion" of cloud (GaiaX). A cloud where data can circulate freely, can be shared and mutualised (upon consent). This will have implications. Huge implications as GaiaX carries the option to "import/acquire" data also originated from other entities (including from outside Europe). The transfer mechanism will only be possible upon user express consent, voluntarily. User will need to be incentivised to agree to share. Since transfer can only be performed by users, and with consent, that will in fact open up to a secondary data market which sees the consent log representing a "transaction event'. Hence privacy will exit the framework compliance to enter the framework of "strategy and business development'. The contextual "data" hunt can begin (vs big data paradigm which fades aways). The de-monopolisation of consumer data, too.</p>

<p>I considered myself quite an experienced programmer and having some expertise in Identity management when I was hired by Swedbank to work as full time Identity engineer. Besides projects, I had assignment to describe an architecture of the IAM as a service from my manager. Honestly, I had no clue about how to envision it. I tried to assemble standards and squeeze something out from practices and papers. But these were not really all my ideas and I did not feel much confident. But something started to happen in few last years when we had a very hard time implementing our IAM project (believe or not, it was successful). We had to answer hundred times to questions "why", "what" and "how". And finally the blueprint of the architecture of IAM as a service appeared from the mist. It is not one and only, because same size does not fit for all. Still, I do not agree that there are indefinite number of possible solutions. I think similar enterprises and engineers may find this presentation useful to draw their own blueprints.</p>




<p>IAM projects start usually from implementing baseline IAM processes - joiners, leavers, movers. Because this is what is usually most needed. But then you will get asked for more - identity data, events, other services. This is what makes up IAM as a service.</p>

   Traditional identity and access management solutions built so far on the trust for selected identity providers and their adoption from an ecosystem of identity owners and identity verifiers. The decentralized identity paradigm is disrupting these ecosystems and required&nbsp;more democratic collaboration and competition&nbsp;among a number of&nbsp;identity and credential issuers, identity owners, and verifiers selecting and using them. This requires not only to design and implement new technologies but also to identify new business opportunities and business models. Collaboration, experimentation,&nbsp;and evaluation are the road to adoption, and the EU collaborative H2020 research and innovation framework offers the opportunity&nbsp;to de-risk such collaborations, in favor of innovation. 
 
 This talk will present the activities and lessons from three EU collaborations, CityExhcange, ENSURESEC and ORCHRESTRA, generating innovation with the adoption of decentralized identities for individuals, things, and organizations among complex&nbsp;stakeholders ecosystems in the smart energy, e-commerce, and smart transport domains.

 Guardianship is a condition of life in human societies. When we are young we may be looked after by parents until we become adults. When we are adults we on occasions need others to look after us, and sometimes we may need increasing levels of care as we age. In our physical world, we may recognise a guardianship role between parents and children and within families, and we may have

<p>Guardianship is a condition of life in human societies. When we are young we may be looked after by parents until we become adults. When we are adults we on occasions need others to look after us, and sometimes we may need increasing levels of care as we age.<br>In our physical world, we may recognise a guardianship role between parents and children and within families, and we may have more or less sophisticated laws to recognise instances where someone needs to take care of another for medical, financial or other needs.<br>While the concept of Guardianship is reasonably well developed and understood in our physical lives, it is scarcely considered in our digital lives. Very few (if any) considerations are made for the possibility that someone may need another to look after their affairs online. Without this consideration, we resort to poor approaches such as where a Guardian needs to "log in" as the dependent, without the visibility of the service provider, or has to prove their Guardianship status to a service provider who is physically remote and often in a different legal jurisdiction.<br>In late 2019, the Sovrin Task Force on Guardianship wrote a white paper on Guardianship considering these issues against two specific use cases: a child refugee and an adult living with dementia. A Working Group was established at the beginning of 2020 to develop these ideas further within the context of Trust over IP and has produced two key documents: an Implementation Guide to Guardianship using Verifiable Credentials, and a Technical Requirements document for Guardianship using Verifiable Credentials.<br>I would like to present these new pieces of work and, hopefully, engage in a discussion on guardianship in the digital world.<br>**Please note that this work was created by a team working with the not-for-profit Sovrin Organisation and is provided on a Creative Commons BY SA 4.0 Licence**</p>
