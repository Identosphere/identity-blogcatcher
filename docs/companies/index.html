<p>Those that work in the digital privacy space may feel that they aren’t at risk like other companies or individuals. We here at Authenteq are not those people. We know that protecting one’s privacy online extends far beyond just safeguarding the identity of our customers, we take the security of our own digital identities, and our shared systems, seriously. As the saying goes, sometimes you have to eat your own dog food. So, in the spirit of transparency, we thought we’d share how we handle things here to help anyone that may be looking for ways to better protect themselves.</p>



 The Cost of Spoofs 



<p>No one who uses the internet – and really, is there anyone who doesn’t? – is immune to cyberattacks. A simple check on sites like<a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"> Pwned</a>&nbsp;can show you all the compromised sites where your email address has been used. Last year, a hacker gained access to CapitalOne’s system affecting 100 million Americans and 6 million Canadians, costing the company upwards of<a href="https://www.virtualarmour.com/the-capital-one-hack-the-latest-in-a-series-of-high-profile-breaches/"> $100 million</a>. Phishing and spoofing attacks have risen steadily every year and according to Agari’s<a href="https://www.agari.com/insights/ebooks/2h-2020-trends-report/?utm_source=press-release&amp;utm_medium=prnewswire&amp;utm_campaign=h2trendsreport"> H2 2020 Email Fraud &amp; Identity Deception Trends Report</a>, 80 percent of FTSE 100 companies are vulnerable to brand impersonation online. TL; DR anti-spoofing efforts should matter to everyone.</p>



 Email and Phone 



<p>Ensuring that you request some pretty basic information may seem obvious, but there are easy steps to implement to protect your employees and customers that can go a long way.</p>



<p>At Authenteq, we’ve changed fields on our website so that only someone with a professional, or corporate, an email address can schedule a demo. That means no Hotmail, no Gmail, no personal emails at all. It’s a good first step in preventing either bad actors from entering your system as a worst-case scenario, but it’s also a way to prevent low quality leads from taking up time from your workforce by flooding support with questions, booking demos of products they don’t intend to purchase or license, and generally wasting time and resources. If an email address does make its way into your system, flag it as spam and block it immediately.<br></p>



 Regular Training&nbsp; 



<p>Keep your staff up to date by offering regular training around anti-spoofing measures. Just like any facet of life, trends come and go, and so it’s important to know the latest. When new scams emerge, ensure that you have measures in place to protect yourselves. Your employees should also be aware of any new scams in case customers get targeted and turn to their sales or account representative looking for guidance or assurance.</p>



<p>COVID, for example, brought a<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwasik/2020/08/03/which-covid-scams-are-hot-now/#46c0369e1577"> new wave of scams</a>, particularly around robocalls, as a flood of new financial assistance funds were released. People were stuck at home, either by their own choice or by their government’s insistence, which meant companies or government agencies suddenly reaching out by phone didn’t feel at all out of place.</p>



<p>Furthermore, your employees themselves need to make sure they are verifying their own emails for suspicious emails, know not to share passwords or private information via email, and to always back up their work. All it takes is one employee that opens a phishing email and your entire operation could be compromised. If an employee gets an email from their CEO that seems off, they should know and feel empowered to be able to question it instead of opening it and clicking suspicious links.</p>



 Two-Factor Authentication 



<p>As companies grow, the security measures that worked for a team of say 10 employees will not work for a team of 100. One thing companies often fail to implement is increased security as this growth happens. Having to go back and adjust things retroactively is much harder than putting in what may feel like an overly vigorous system in place before the need is felt. Two-factor authentication on emails, sites where internal documents are kept like Jira or<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa"> GitHub</a>, or even shared social media sites is a great best practice to set up. At Authenteq, we require employees to set up two-factor authentication for our internal emails, and they must reverify their authentication every time a new device is used or if they’re in a new location.</p>



<p>In addition to 2FA, we use<a href="https://1password.com/"> 1Password</a>, a password manager, for our shared accounts. We also have three different VPNs. All employees’ pay slips are encrypted. And for physical onsite security, the<a href="https://nuki.io/en/"> Nuki</a> smart lock and app is the only way to gain access inside the office, and we keep employee records, confidential documents, and any expensive hardware in a safe.</p>



 Planning 



<p>Having a plan in place to respond to any worst-case scenario is a good idea for some and crucial for others. Even if it’s not on your “need to have”, we can’t think of any situation in which this wouldn’t be a “nice to have.” If a hacker breached your internal IT system, consider what that would mean, what and who would be affected and most at risk, and the people on your team who could respond.</p>



 Liveness Checks&nbsp; 



<p>Integrating a fully automated KYC solution into your onboarding process is the ultimate tactic to prevent spoofers from sneaking in. But identity verification tools with an accompanying liveness check leaves almost no room for them.</p>



<p>Liveness checks can also prevent deepfakes from entering your system, the latest in spoofing threats. Using neural network-powered artificial intelligence and machine learning, images and video footage can be fed into algorithms to create a “mask”, replacing or manipulating the original faces with lookalike data. Deepfakes do pose a threat to identity theft online, but can also be<a href="https://authenteq.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-deepfakes-the-importance-of-kyc/"> prevented</a> with sophisticated KYC tools and liveness checks.</p>

<p>Ontology Launches New Decentralized Identity For the Automotive Industry</p><p>Ontology is focused on building trust in the automotive industry through the development of a blockchain-based decentralized digital identity solution that allows for driving data to be recorded, stored, and verified in a safe and secure way, offering a range of benefits to drivers and the wider automotive industry.</p><p>How does it work? Meet Daphne, and see how her driving experience is made easier with&nbsp;Ontology</p><p>Ontology Records Daphne’s Driving Data Making Her Driving Experience Better</p><p>Daphne is a florist and vlogger. She begins her day driving to the flower shop, activating ONT ID, Ontology’s mobile digital ID application and decentralized framework that allows users to securely manage their digital identity by storing their data locally on a phone or on trusted cloud storage with a private key that grants access only to the verified user. When Daphne opens her smart lock enabled car, her driving data has been recorded and stored in a safe and secure&nbsp;way.</p><p>Ontology Allows Daphne To Book Concert Tickets Quickly Using Ontology&nbsp;NFTs</p><p>While making her way to the flower shop, Daphne uses her built-in ONTO self-sovereign data wallet, a one-stop mobile application for the management of digital identity, data, and assets, to book concert tickets with her friends. She pays using ONT, Ontology’s utility token. Daphne books the tickets using built-in voice recognition, meaning she can safely use the application while driving. Daphne is then able to send the tickets directly to her friend through the Ontology network, which transfers the cinema ticket in the form of a Ontology Non-Fungible Token&nbsp;(NFT).</p><p>Ontology Allows Daphne To Earn ONT By Renting Her Car To Other Verified Safe&nbsp;Drivers</p><p>Later in the day, Daphne goes online to an Ontology-powered marketplace where she can earn ONT by renting her car to other verified, safe drivers. Daphne is able to easily verify that the driver she rents her car to is a licensed driver with a good driver history according to their ONT Score, Ontology’s decentralized reputation scoring&nbsp;system.</p><p>Following A Minor Car Accident, Daphne Settles Her Insurance Payment Immediately Through An Ontology-powered Insurance Application</p><p>After work, Daphne is back in her car on the way to the cinema, when she gets into a minor road traffic accident. By using an Ontology-powered insurance platform, Daphne can settle her insurance payment immediately. Because the information is recorded on the Ontology blockchain, the process is fully verified, fast, and efficient. Now needing to fix her car, Daphne is able to easily order replacement car parts. Details of Daphne’s car model is recorded in a decentralized way, making the process simple and ensuring Daphne can purchase the right&nbsp;parts.</p><p>Throughout Daphne’s day, Ontology has helped make her driving experience better. By integrating Ontology’s decentralized identity solution, Ontology is bringing much-needed trust to the driving industry, not only for Daphne, but for insurers, car renters, and other drivers,&nbsp;too.</p> Want to find out more about Ontology Automotive Solution? <p>Visit <a href="https://ont.io/automotive">https://ont.io/automotive</a> or get your customized solution by emailing us at <a href="http://business@ont.io">business@ont.io</a>.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/in-the-fast-lane-ontology-accelerates-decentralized-identity-for-the-automotive-industry-2e829ecb7f23">In The Fast Lane: Ontology Accelerates Decentralized Identity for the Automotive Industry</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The symbol for the denarius, the reference coin in the Roman Empire</p>



<p>This is the fourth in the series on the paradigm shift to a digital state, this time focusing on new digital forms of government-issued money.</p>



<p>Technology
is changing the building blocks of government. In <a href="https://procivis.ch/2020/04/30/the-digital-state-part-1/">Part 1</a> we
saw that the trend to e-government is leaving no pillar untouched. <a href="https://procivis.ch/2020/07/08/the-digital-state-part-2/">Part 2</a>
showed how the technology by which people make their political choices is
changing, and <a href="https://procivis.ch/2020/07/30/the-digital-state-part-3/">Part 3</a>
looked at how law-making is being shaped by new digital tools.</p>



<p>The
rush to digital government is now evident everywhere. Recently, for example, we
learnt about the chaos caused in the UK by a government algorithm that decided
which students passed their university entry exams. [1] The point of this negative
example is not to be negative, but merely to show that the state is now
embracing digital tools big time.</p>



<p>And
what can be a bigger than government-issued digital currencies?</p>



<p>E-government
and its money</p>



<p>The
latest technology has always shaped the physical characteristics of money. We
know that there was a time without coins – a pre-metallic monetary period. One
form of money then was cowrie shells, which could not be counterfeited. Its
monetary area encompassed the Indian ocean coastal regions of Africa, Asia and Oceania.
We know that when the shift to metallic money happened, coins started out as little
blobs. As the technology got more sophisticated, the coins became rounder and
flatter, with symbols stamped on them. We know that the metallic composition of
coins was impacted by mining discoveries – also linked to new technology. We
know that Marco Polo was hugely impressed when he discovered that the Chinese were
using a new technology for money: paper. And we know that Australia introduced
the first banknotes made from a rubber-like substance (polymer). So, we know
that the composition of money reflected the technology and resources of the
era.</p>



<p>Should
we now be terribly surprised, therefore, that in our era the state is
experimenting with new technology for the issuance, distribution, safe-keeping
and exchange of money? No. And should we be surprised that the essence of this
new money is something we cannot see or touch: digital stuff? No. And wouldn’t Marco
Polo have been impressed? Yes!</p>



<p>So,
what’s new about CBDCs?</p>



<p>While
computers are not new and electronic payments are not new and central bank
digital book entries are not new, there is something new about central bank
digital currencies (CBDCs). The new feature is that technology is changing how
and where they can be distributed and stored. &nbsp;</p>



<p>A
new digital highway, interspersed with cool digital gadgets, is creating a new
monetary transmission mechanism directly from the central bank to those
devices. The technology is not holding up its introduction, the missing legal
framework is. Where is the law that governs the new digital wallets at the
central bank? Where are the laws that govern the settlement of cross-border
payments linked to these new wallets? </p>



<p>What
we know from history is that where technology leads, society and the law inevitably
follow. The new laws will also follow from the local driving forces. One such
case is currently happening in Switzerland. The country’s stock exchange is
building a trading platform for “digital assets”. The central bank needs to
understand what that might mean for the payments system, counterparty risk and
systemic stability. One potential outcome could be a “digital Swiss franc”, which
would be used to settle payments between wholesale participants on that
platform. Nothing has been decided yet. But if that were decided, it could
happen as early as 2021.</p>



<p>Central
banks all over the world are taking a closer look at what this new digital
infrastructure might mean for their mandates. While the motivations and urgency
differ from country to country, it appears at this point that the introductions
of the first central bank digital currencies will not replace “cash” – they
will merely be an additional pool of digital units for a newly defined purpose,
distributed and stored via a new infrastructure. It also appears clear at this
stage that central banks are not keen on the idea that retail clients should
have digital wallets at the central bank.</p>



<p>Blockchain
agnostic</p>



<p>Central
bank digital currencies do not need blockchain. Recall that bitcoin was born as
the anti-central bank fiat currency. Central banks want control over the amount
of money they issue; they are not going to give up that control to a public
blockchain. Central bank digital money is anti-bitcoin money; it has a central
counterparty: the central bank. Some central banks are indeed experimenting
with blockchain, and it is not inconceivable that some could even issue a
currency on a private or permissioned blockchain, but that means they will
still exercise control.</p>



<p>Concluding
thoughts: What we can learn from the big Ӿ</p>



<p>The
era of central bank digital currencies is dawning just as governments all over
the world have issued war-time levels of debt and central banks have increased
their balance sheets to previously unimaginable sizes. It is not unreasonable
to ask if central bank digital currencies stored on new digital wallets would
not make it easier to push more digital units through the system or even remove
units via new negative interest rates? The answer to both questions is probably
yes.</p>



<p>The
algorithm problem in the UK cited above is also meant to illustrate the point
that e-government also needs a superior governance framework. This is not just
about downloading new software; e-government should also be smart government
that serves the people more efficiently.</p>



<p>Similarly,
the introduction of central bank digital currencies will need a superior
governance framework to prevent bad outcomes. Here we perhaps need to be
reminded about bad monetary outcomes in history. It is difficult to separate
the role of the issuer of money, be it a mint in ancient Greece or a modern
central bank, from the fiscal obligations of its owner, the sovereign.&nbsp; These are two sides of the coin. Several
writers who focused on the finances of the ancient world conclude that the
unsustainable public finances of ancient Greece and Rome were ultimately the
real cause of the collapse of those empires. [2]</p>



<p>In
one of the largest recorded increases in the money supply of the Roman Empire&nbsp;– a tenfold
rise in the circulation of mainly silver coinage between 157BC and 50BC – smart
administration and structural changes initially held back inflation. The measures included more cash reserves held by the
banks and the Roman treasury.
But these supportive factors eventually reversed. The Roman coin
the denarius (which had its own symbol Ӿ), was gradually debased from a practically pure
silver coin to one just washed in silver. Its value plummeted (figure 1). </p>



<p>Figure 1: The price of one pound of gold in denarii,
log scale, 50 BC to 350 AD</p>



Source [3]



<p>The
wealthy were initially able to protect themselves from inflation with a
diversified portfolio that included gold, silver and real estate. But when Rome
eventually fell to the invaders, and the new capital moved to Ravenna, the rich
could not take their land with them. </p>



<p>Rome was not built in a day and its money was not destroyed in a day either. We will need a smart new governance framework for the era of central bank digital currencies. </p>

<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz01OTdiM2IwMGRkNmQxMWVhYTZiMTBlMTg5NWRmNWQxMQ=="></a></p>
 Trend 1: The new work nucleus 
<p>The “new work nucleus” refers to a collection of SaaS-based personal productivity, collaboration and communication tools, combined into one cloud office product. It generally includes email, instant messaging, file sharing, conferencing, document management and editing, search and discovery, and collaboration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new work nucleus has become a cornerstone of most organizations’ digital workplace infrastructures, particularly in today’s remote work environment. Reliance on cloud office technologies has increased due to a general preference for cloud, as well as the desire to reduce costs, drive simplicity and continuously provide more functionality to employees. Vendors are upgrading cloud services with new mobility, content discovery and artificial intelligence (AI) features.</p>
 Trend 2: Bring your own thing 
<p>Individuals are beginning to use more personal Internet of Things (IoT) devices or wearables at work, in a trend known as bring your own thing (BYOT). BYOT involves a wide range of objects, such as fitness bands, smart lights, air filters, voice assistants, smart earbuds and consumer virtual reality (VR) headsets. In the future it will include highly sophisticated devices such as robots and drones.</p>
<p>“As homes and domestic technology become smarter and consumers acquire more IoT technology, a growing range of personal things will be brought into offices or used to support remote working,” says Cain.</p>

 Trend 3: The distance economy 
<p>In-person events and meetings were once the norm and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-lead-better-remote-meetings/">virtual meetings</a> the exception, but COVID-19 has flipped those scenarios. The pandemic influenced the emergence of the distance economy, or business activities that don’t rely on face-to-face activity. Organizations with operating models that depend on first-party or hosted events have switched quickly to virtual alternatives.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, as internal meetings, client interactions, new hire interviews and a variety of other business activities have gone virtual, the distance economy has given rise to a new generation of meeting solutions that attempt to more closely mimic an in-person meeting.</p>

<p>[swg_ad]</p>
 Trend 4: Smart workspaces 
<p>A smart workspace leverages the growing digitalization of physical objects to deliver new ways of working and improve workforce efficiency. Examples of smart workspace technologies include IoT, digital signage, integrated workplace management systems, virtual workspaces, motion sensors and facial recognition. Any location where people work can be a smart workspace, such as office buildings, desk spaces, conference rooms and even home spaces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As employees <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-early-return-to-workplace-lessons-from-asia/">return to work post-COVID-19</a>, organizations will take full advantage of smart workspaces as they revisit design strategies to better understand how people participate in physical spaces or adhere to social distancing. Such insight can create new capabilities related to seating and room allocation, access management and wayfaring.</p>
 Trend 5: Desktop-as-a-service 
<p>Desktop as a service (DaaS) provides users with an on-demand, virtualized desktop experience delivered from a remotely hosted location. It includes provisioning, patching and maintenance of the management plane and resources to host workloads.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>COVID-19 highlighted the value and business continuity strength of DaaS</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Organizations have long been interested in adopting <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/virtual-desktop-infrastructure-vdi">virtual desktop infrastructure</a>, but complexity and capital investment have made implementations difficult. COVID-19 highlighted the value and business continuity strength of DaaS in its ability to rapidly enable remote work where on-premises options have stalled. The pandemic is likely to accelerate adoption of DaaS, and it may even perpetuate as a delivery architecture when employees return to the office.</p>
 Trend 6: Democratized technology services 
<p>Technology services of the future will be assembled and composed by the people that actually use them. A few examples of democratized technology services include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/citizen-developer">Citizen developers</a>, or employees who create new business applications using development tools and runtime environments sanctioned by corporate IT. Citizen developers are empowered by the availability and power of low-code and “no code” development tools.&nbsp; 
 Citizen integrator tools, which enable expert business users with minimal IT skills to handle relatively simple application, data and process integration tasks by themselves through very intuitive, no-code development environments. 
 Citizen data science, an emerging set of capabilities that enable users to extract advanced analytic insights from data without the need for extensive data science expertise.

  <p>Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_Technologies">Unity Technologies</a>. The engine is able to create three-dimensional, two-dimensional, virtual reality, and augmented reality games, as well as simulations and other experiences. The engine has been adopted by industries outside video gaming such as film, automotive, architecture, engineering, and construction.</p>

<p>Identity security is a key concept that is mostly missing in Unity. In fact, most engines today do not provide solutions for securing identity, authenticating users, and authorizing users. The industry has instead traditionally relied on custom-built solutions and/or delegated auth from other products, like game stores. As the industry advances beyond anonymous consumption of video games, into massively interconnected online projects, or professional XR use cases such as ArchViz and simulation, new requirements have appeared for authentication and authorization.</p>

<p>In gaming, use cases tend to depend on the project itself. A single-player game really only needs to focus on protecting its own intellectual property from theft. Using a game store’s authorization—as is common today—is more than enough for this use case. Even the introduction of microtransactions can stay secure with just a store if these transactions are being handled by that store. However, once the project gets to a point where a user’s client needs to authenticate a user and authorize that user to one or multiple servers, the solutions provided by stores fall short. It gets even more complicated when users are actually making purchases or entering personal information into your game client directly. Once the game gets to a more complex level of interconnectivity, and once users are trusting you with private information and financial information, proper identity security is paramount.</p>

<p>With XR use cases, the concept is similar to what is described above for gaming—especially if the project is a VR game—however professional XR projects open up a whole new area of interest. Professional projects such as ArchViz, or simulations done for security or scientific application, need to protect the intellectual property within the project itself, and the user identity, just like games. However, more is potentially needed to handle authorization to specific aspects of the project results, as well as professional requirements to integrate or federate with other technologies used by these professionals.</p>

<p>The level of effort to build identity security from scratch is massive. Just to build a secure store for identity, authentication with basic username/password, authorization via OAuth, and basic security policy, it takes a large team months. When you account for keeping the tech up to date with new standards, compliance with standards such as PCI, compliance with GDPR, complex multi-factor authentication, and complex authorization rules, it becomes apparent that the work is not a one-time effort and it is not easy. Rather than spend countless development cycles focusing on identity security—when the team should be focused on the core project itself—it is much easier and more secure to leave it to the experts. Okta is the most advanced identity platform on the market today and represents the best of breed solution for developers, including Game/XR developers creating within Unity.</p>

 Core Concepts 

<p>Before we jump into Unity, it is important to understand what options exist to handle authentication and authorization of users within your project. The most common designs are in engine with native UI, in engine with OAuth via browser, external with native UI, and external with OAuth via browser. The other option, as previously mentioned, is to trust authorization from another product such as a game store.</p>

<p>The decision that needs to be addressed first is the balancing act that every security team must make between what is most secure and what has the best user experience. If the decision is that the project is not storing sensitive user data, then it is reasonable to focus on user experience. However, if there is even a slight risk that a data breach would negatively affect individual consumers, security must take the front seat.</p>

<p>When a project accepts authorization from another product, one that is not a security product like Okta, there is a huge risk with that trust. Risk that users are not being challenged properly with MFA, risk that standards and technology get out of date from what is standard in the security industry, and risk that user data is not being secured and passed correctly and safely. This is the risk represented by delegating security to a game store.</p>

<p>The most secure option would be to leverage OAuth2/OIDC either in the engine or externally in the project’s launcher. OAuth2/OIDC is the industry standard best practice for authorization/authentication. OAuth specification defines multiple different flows, or grants, but the most recommended for security is Auth Code with PKCE. You can read more about OAuth2 <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-overview/">here</a>. The complaint typically with OAuth, especially within a game engine directly, is that it traditionally leverages a browser and a hosted login experience. Okta provides a hosted login experience that is fully customizable via HTML/CSS and Unity is able to pop up a browser and receive tokens from it after authentication. How to do this will be described in this blog. What needs to be considered is if that user experience is acceptable for the project. The browser can also be embedded with different Unity browser plugins, found in the asset store, which might make the experience better because the user will not need to leave the game to interact with an external browser. OAuth is considered more secure because users are putting their credentials into a trusted browser and a trusted, secure, login page. Furthermore, the access token that is returned at the end of the authorization process is retrieved by code not running in a browser which means intercepting it is difficult to impossible.</p>

<p>Okta also supports a native UI experience both in engine or externally. This is a better user experience but considered potentially less secure because the project’s code is now required to accept a password from a user, properly handle it in a secure way from start to finish, and be secure enough that it can’t be exploited by bad actors or rogue software. Essentially you take all of the risk onto yourself to handle the information from the user with care. This concept also requires a bit more work in UI development because the UI will be entirely built in engine and Okta would be interacted with via API only. This option will be reviewed in this blog as well.</p>

<p>In order to help visualize the difference between these concepts, this blog will show you how to build for Native UI and OAuth via browser in engine. These same concepts can also be applied to external solutions, such as a launcher. developer.okta.com contains countless guides and blogs that can assist further with the external use case.</p>

 Create the Project 

<p>Get started by creating a new project in Unity Hub. Select 3D and give the project a name.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Unity will take a moment to set everything up and open the project. Once open, click Assets &gt; Import Package and select the <code>OktaSDK.unitypackage</code> file. The Okta Auth SDK will be used for the Native UI design. The SDK is not required for OAuth. A <a href="https://okta.box.com/s/m5q2ucervn03cbzu5dpgzx2vxmeg3xph">Okta SDK Unity Package</a> has been provided with this guide to simplify this process.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: The <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-sdk-dotnet">Okta SDK for .NET</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-dotnet">Okta Auth SDK for .NET</a> can be found on GitHub and NuGet. However, Unity does not work well with NuGet and compiling from source should not be necessary. If manual installation is desired, there are numerous dependencies that NuGet would normally add to a project with the SDK. These dependencies will need to be manually downloaded and added to Unity. <a href="https://www.nuget.org/">NuGet Gallery</a> is recommended for this.</p>
</blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>Make sure all libraries are selected and click Import. This will create a Plugins folder inside the Assets folder which is how Unity knows to import the .NET libraries as <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingDLL.html">managed plugins</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, click on the Asset Store tab in the editor and search for <code>Unity Samples: UI.</code> This example asset was created by Unity Technologies as a learning asset, teaching best practices for building UI’s inside of Unity. For this guide, we will leverage this UI to build our login experience.</p>

<p>Click Import and import all of the assets in the package.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once the import process is complete, click on the Scenes folder and open the <code>Menu 3D</code> scene. Click Play to run the project and make sure that the UI is properly functioning.</p>

<p>Save 2 copies of this scene, one for <code>Native</code>, and one for <code>OAuth</code>.</p>

<p></p>

 Native: Build the Auth Menu 

<p>Open the example scene saved for the Native experience.</p>

<p>The UI sample asset does not come with any type of input field. We will need input fields for a <code>Username</code> box and a <code>Password</code> box. To create a new Input Field object:</p>

 
   Open the <code>Prefabs</code> folder 
   Duplicate the SF Button object (Ctrl + D) 
   Rename the duplicate object SF InputField 
   Delete the label element out of the object 
   Click the GameObject menu &gt; UI &gt; InputField 
   Position the new InputField where the label element was 
   Switch the gizmo to scale and resize the InputField to fill out the box 
 

<p></p>

<p>Next, a new menu will be needed for the Auth Menu. The simplest way to create this is to duplicate the existing <code>MainMenu</code> object and customize it. To create the Auth Menu:</p>

 
   Select <code>MainMenu</code> and duplicate it (Ctrl + D). 
   With <code>MainMenu</code> still selected, click the checkbox in the inspector to disable it. This will make the <code>MainMenu</code> object disappear. 
   Rename the duplicated menu to <code>AuthMenu</code>. 
   Delete the <code>Continue</code> and <code>New Game</code> objects 
   Rename the <code>Settings</code> object to <code>Next</code> 
   Drag in 2 of the InputField prefabs and rename them to <code>Username</code> and <code>Password</code> respectively. 
   Expand the <code>Password</code> object and click on the InputField object. In the Inspector, scroll down to Content Type and change to Password. 
   Change <code>Username's</code> position PosY to 70, and change <code>Password's</code> PosY to 0. 
   Expand the <code>Username</code> object, expand the InputField, select Placeholder, and change the text to <code>Username</code>. Do this for the <code>Password</code> object next. 
   With <code>AuthMenu</code> still selected, click the checkbox in the inspector to disable it. This will make the <code>AuthMenu</code> disappear. 
 

<p></p>

<p>Click <code>MenuManager</code> and make sure it is enabled in the inspector. Find the <code>PanelManager</code> script component attached to the <code>MenuManager</code> object and double click to edit. This will open up the primary IDE configured in Unity.</p>

 Native: Authenticate with Okta 

<p>Reference the <code>Okta Auth SDK</code> by adding the following to the end of the using statements.</p>

   <code>using Okta.Auth.Sdk;
using Okta.Sdk.Abstractions.Configuration;
</code>   

<p>The login code will need to understand some of the elements in the menu to be able to interact with them. Expose public variables so that these elements can be configured in the editor. After the initiallyOpen Animator on line 11, add:</p>

   <code>public Animator authMenu;
public static bool isAuthenticated;

public InputField Username;
public InputField Password;
public string OktaDomain;
</code>   

<p><code>authMenu</code> will hold the <code>AuthMenu</code> object that was created earlier. <code>IsAuthenticated</code> will allow the UI to determine what to display. The two InputFields will hold the <code>Username</code> and <code>Password</code> InputField objects that were added to the Auth Menu. The <code>OktaDomain</code> string will hold the <code>Okta Developer Org URL</code>.</p>

<p>At line 38, inside the <code>OpenPanel</code> method, add:</p>

   <code>if (!isAuthenticated)
{
   anim = authMenu;
}
</code>   

<p>In <code>OpenPanel</code>, anim is the variable holding what UI panel to open. If authentication is required or has not been completed, we always want to override whatever panel is in the process of opening and open the Auth Menu instead. This forces the user to log in when needed.</p>

<p>Next, create the <code>Login()</code> function that the <code>Next</code> button will call on click. At line 86 add:</p>

   <code>public async void Login()
{
   var client = new AuthenticationClient(new OktaClientConfiguration
   {
      OktaDomain = OktaDomain,
   });

   var authnOptions = new AuthenticateOptions()
   {
      Username = Username.text.ToString(),
      Password = Password.text.ToString(),
   };

   try
   {
      var authnResponse = await client.AuthenticateAsync(authnOptions);

      Debug.Log("Authentication Status: " + authnResponse.AuthenticationStatus);
      if (authnResponse.AuthenticationStatus == "SUCCESS")
      {
         //Store the token
         Debug.Log(authnResponse.SessionToken);
         isAuthenticated = true;

         OpenPanel(initiallyOpen);
      }
      else
      {
         //Handle Errors
         Debug.Log("Authentication Failed...");
      }
   }
   catch (System.Exception ex)
    {
      Debug.Log(ex.Message);
     }
 }
</code>   

<p>Save <code>PanelManager.cs</code> and switch back to Unity.</p>

<p>Make sure <code>MenuManager</code> is selected and notice the new properties in the <code>PanelManager</code> component attached to the <code>MenuManager</code> object. To configure the PanelManager, do the following:</p>

 
   Drag the <code>AuthMenu</code> object from the project hierarchy to the <code>authMenu</code> property in the inspector. 
   Drag the InputField from the <code>Username</code> object in the project hierarchy to the <code>Username</code> property in the inspector. 
   Drag the InputField from the <code>Password</code> object in the project hierarchy to the <code>Password</code> property in the inspector. 
   Enter the Okta domain from the Okta developer org “{yourOktaDomain}”. 
 

<p></p>

<p>Now, wire the <code>Next</code> button’s OnClick event to the <code>Login()</code> method in <code>PanelManager.cs</code>. Click the <code>Next</code> button object in the hierarchy window, find the On Click () section in the inspector windows and change the dropdown to PanelManager &gt; Login().</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Play to run the project and log in using user credentials for a user in the associated Okta Developer Org.</p>

<p></p>

<p>If Authentication was successful, a session token will appear along with the <code>SUCCESS</code> result coming from the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/">Okta AuthN API</a>.</p>

<p>Now that the client is able to authenticate users via basic auth, more advanced concepts can be added such as support for MFA and user account/profile management. This is done by adding logic to the code described in this guide that handles other authentication states within the Okta <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/">AuthN</a> API. The SDK is already able to handle these concepts which means that the additional code is needed only for the UI in Unity. This code is outside the scope of this blog but the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/authn/">AuthN</a> API leveraged for this experience is documented on developer.okta.com</p>

 OAuth: Authenticate with Okta 

<p>Open the scene that was saved for the <code>OAuth</code> experience.</p>

<p>To protect the scene with OAuth, a simple GameObject is all that is needed. Create one by clicking GameObject and then Create New. Name this GameObject <code>OktaOAuth2</code>.</p>

<p>If <code>Assets</code> &gt; <code>Scripts</code> does not exist in the project, create a folder called <code>Assets</code> and a folder inside Assets called <code>Scripts</code>. Create a new cs script within the <code>Scripts</code> folder and name this script <code>OktaOAuth2.cs</code>. This script will be added to the GameObject and will force unauthorized users to authorize before interacting with the scene.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Edit <code>OktaOAuth2.cs</code>.</p>

<p>This example makes use of multiple libraries, all of which are included with .Net with the exception of Newtonsoft.Json. Start by adding the following references:</p>

   <code>using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using System;
using System.Text;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.IO;
using System.Net;
using System.Net.Sockets;
using System.Security.Cryptography;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
</code>   

<p>Newtonsoft.Json is already included with the Okta SDK unity package. If this is already imported into the project, and a Plugins folder already exists with a Newtonsoft.Json.dll file inside, skip the next steps describing the manual installation of Newtonsoft.Json.</p>

<p>Next, go back to Unity and create a folder inside <code>Assets</code> called <code>Plugins</code>.</p>

<p>The easiest way to add Newtonsoft.Json to the Unity project is to manually download it and add it to the project. This is because Unity does not support Nuget directly.</p>

<p>Go to <code>nuget.org</code> and search <code>Newtonsoft</code>. <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/">https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/</a> Download the package and open it as a zip file. Open lib &gt; net20 and extract Newtonsoft.Json.dll to the <code>Plugins</code> folder in the Unity project.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Go back to editing <code>OktaOAuth2.cs</code>.</p>

<p>Within the default class generated by Unity, create public variables to hold our Okta configuration information.</p>

   <code>// client configuration
public string clientID;
public string clientSecret;
public string authorizationEndpoint;
public string tokenEndpoint;
public string userInfoEndpoint;
</code>   

<p>In the <code>Start()</code> method, call <code>doOAuth()</code>, which is where we will process the OAuth logic.</p>

   <code>// Start is called before the first frame update
void Start()
{
   // Add logic to check current auth state and only doOAuth() when needed.
   doOAuth();
}
</code>   

<p><code>doOAuth()</code> will need to handle popping up a browser, redirecting the user for authentication, and receiving/validating access tokens upon return. How to design code in .Net for OAuth2 is a large topic and outside the scope of this blog. You can read more about OAuth2 <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-overview/">here</a> on developer.okta.com. For this example, I am providing code that I am using in my own project to help explain the concept.</p>

   <code>private async void doOAuth()

    // Creates a redirect URI using an available port on the loopback address.
    string redirectURI = string.Format("http://{0}:{1}/", IPAddress.Loopback, /*GetRandomUnusedPort()*/51772);
    output("redirect URI: " + redirectURI);
    // Creates an HttpListener to listen for requests on that redirect URI.

</code>   

<p>While the OAuth2 code can vary, so long as it follows spec, the part that is relevant for Unity is how to get the browser to appear and redirect the user to login.</p>

   <code>// Opens request in the browser.
System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(authorizationRequest);
</code>   

<p>Passing a URL to <code>System.Diagnostics.Process.Start()</code> in Unity will launch a browser that can be used to log a user in. This part could be replaced with an <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/gui/embedded-browser-55459">embedded browser</a> solution from the asset store to improve the user experience by keeping the user in the engine. However, the interaction with Okta would be the same.</p>

<p>The OAuth2 code provided does rely on a few helper methods around base64 encoding, cryptology, and logging.</p>

   <code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Appends the given string to the on-screen log, and the debug console.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="output"&gt;string to be appended&lt;/param&gt;
public void output(string output)
{
   Debug.Log(output);
}

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Returns URI-safe data with a given input length.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="length"&gt;Input length (nb. output will be longer)&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;
public static string randomDataBase64url(uint length)
{
   RNGCryptoServiceProvider rng = new RNGCryptoServiceProvider();
    byte[] bytes = new byte[length];
   rng.GetBytes(bytes);
   return base64urlencodeNoPadding(bytes);
}

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Returns the SHA256 hash of the input string.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="inputString"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;
public static byte[] sha256(string inputString)
{
   byte[] bytes = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(inputString);
   SHA256Managed sha256 = new SHA256Managed();
   return sha256.ComputeHash(bytes);
}

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Base64url no-padding encodes the given input buffer.
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name="buffer"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;
public static string base64urlencodeNoPadding(byte[] buffer)
{
   string base64 = Convert.ToBase64String(buffer);

   // Converts base64 to base64url.
   base64 = base64.Replace("+", "-");
   base64 = base64.Replace("/", "_");
   // Strips padding.
   base64 = base64.Replace("=", "");

    return base64;
}
</code>   

<p>The most important logic still needed is calling out to UserInfo. UserInfo is an Open ID Connect defined endpoint that returns data on a user in exchange for a valid access token. Okta has the ability to add new data as claims to the access token itself so this may not be required, but if the goal is to keep the access token as light as possible, this type of introspection might be desired.</p>

   <code>async void userinfoCall(string access_token)
{
   output("Making API Call to Userinfo...");

   // sends the request
   HttpWebRequest userinfoRequest = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(userInfoEndpoint);
   userinfoRequest.Method = "GET";
   userinfoRequest.Headers.Add(string.Format("Authorization: Bearer {0}", access_token));
   userinfoRequest.ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded";
   //userinfoRequest.Accept = "Accept=text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8";

   // gets the response
   WebResponse userinfoResponse = await userinfoRequest.GetResponseAsync();
   using (StreamReader userinfoResponseReader = new StreamReader(userinfoResponse.GetResponseStream()))
   {
      // reads response body
      string userinfoResponseText = await userinfoResponseReader.ReadToEndAsync();
      output(userinfoResponseText);
   }
}
</code>   

<p>Save the script and go back to Unity.</p>

<p>Click the <code>OktaOAuth2</code> GameObject and notice the public variables from the <code>OktaOAuth2.cs</code> script in the inspector.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, go to an Okta tenant, or create a new dev tenant at <code>developer.okta.com</code>, and log in.</p>

<p>Click on Applications &gt; Add Application and choose Web.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>This application is the representation of your OAuth2 client within Okta. Give the application a name and trust the local IP/Port that your client will be using to interact with Okta. By default, the sample code is set to <code>http://127.0.0.1:51772</code> where the IP is the client’s local IP address.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Done.</p>

<p>The next menu will be the General tab for the application’s settings menu. At the bottom of General, there is a section containing a <code>Client ID</code> and <code>Client Secret</code>. Copy these and paste them into the inspector for the <code>OktaOAuth2</code> GameObject in Unity.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>For the three endpoint URL’s, go back to Okta. In the top menu click API &gt; Authorization Servers.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click default to open the default authorization server. Click the Metadata URI link.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Find the <code>authorization endpoint</code>, <code>token endpoint</code>, and <code>userinfo endpoint</code> urls, copy and paste into the <code>OktaOAuth2</code> GameObject inspector in Unity.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Fully log out of Okta and close the browser if possible before testing. Make sure the project is saved and run it. When the browser appears, log in. Close the browser when prompted and return to Unity. The console will contain tokens and claims for the user.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The great thing about authenticating via OAuth2 and Okta’s hosted login widget is that the level of effort to build out the UI to support complex concepts like MFA is no longer required. Okta handles every aspect of authentication freeing up developers to focus on the project itself. Best of all, this hosted login experience can be fully customized. Everything from the domain of the page to its HTML and CSS is exposed within Okta so that users stay within your branded echo system.</p>

<p></p>

<p>To further enhance the example, code could be added to check a user’s authentication state on start of every scene or before secure actions are allowed. This is easily done by calling the <code>userinfoCall()</code> method from the example code. Simply save the access token on the user’s first login to a secure location, such as a vault, and check if there is a token on <code>Start()</code>. If a token exists, send it to the <code>userinfoCall()</code> method from the sample code and act on the results. If there is no token, or if the existing token is not valid, call <code>doOAuth()</code>.</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>Identity security is a very complex, but increasingly required, aspect of most game/XR projects today. The resource commitment required to build out all of the functionality needed, and then maintain and grow that functionality, is massive. When it’s done incorrectly it can be devastating. Leaving identity security to the experts and leveraging the best of breed Okta Identity Platform for all identity security needs in your project will save countless hours and ensure that intellectual property and customer accounts are properly secured.</p>

<p>To expand on the ideas discussed in this blog, I recommend further reading on securely storing access tokens using vaults, such as <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">HashiCorp Vault</a>, and authorizing users to Network Engines such as <a href="https://www.photonengine.com/pun">Photon</a>. Stay tuned to developer.okta.com/blog for further discussions on these topics and more.</p>

					 <p>The easiest way to explain <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) is to pull out an item that people carry on a daily basis—a wallet.¹ It’s strange to use a leather pouch to explain such a complex, nascent technology as SSI, but it works! And it works because most of the magic of SSI happens within and between digital wallets.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Going from leather to digital 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Apart from money, the leather wallet you carry in your pocket or purse stores important identifying cards (i.e., your driver’s license, health insurance card, employee badge, etc.). We show these cards to people and organizations on a daily basis to receive access to services by proving we are who we say we are. A wallet makes it easy to access these cards when we need them, and it keeps the cards from being lost or stolen.²</p><p><br>Just like a leather wallet stores a variety of important physical cards, an SSI digital wallet stores your <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-are-verifiable-credentials/">verifiable credentials</a>, making it easy for you to show those credentials to others in a secure, private way. As the name implies, a digital wallet is digital and can exist locally (ie., on your mobile device or desktop) or in the cloud. A more formal definition of digital wallets is below:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				A digital wallet, in the context of self-sovereign identity, is a software application and encrypted database that stores credentials, keys, and other secrets necessary for self-sovereign identity.³			</p>
					</blockquote>
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Each participant in the SSI ecosystem (the issuer, the holder, and the verifier) needs a digital wallet in order to issue, hold, and verify verifiable credentials.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 What can you do with an SSI digital wallet? 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Collect credentials 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Just like the leather pouch in your pocket stores important documents, your digital wallet stores your verifiable credentials. When you are issued a credential, it will be stored in your wallet. The wallet makes it so that the credentials are:<br><br></p>  Easily accessible: With a click of a button, you have access to all of your credentials which you can seamlessly share with others.  Secure: Your credentials are stored only on your device. No one else has access to them—not even the wallet provider (e.g., Trinsic).  Private: You are in full control of who you send the credential to and what pieces of information on the credential you show them.   
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Share verifiable information 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Here’s where the rubber meets the road. When you have a digital wallet, anybody can request information from you. The information is entirely under your control, so you can choose to share the information or reject their request. If you decide to respond, the wallet finds credentials with the relevant data and shares just what they need to know, without sharing everything. For example, you might share your address from your driver’s license credential without sharing your name or birthdate. This is possible through <a href="https://trinsic.id/zero-knowledge-proofs/">zero-knowledge proofs</a> (ZKPs).</p><p><br>Best of all, the information you share is instantly verifiable, so you can receive access to services seamlessly, just like you do in the real world when you use your physical wallet.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Connect with others 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Finally, if there are parties you want to interact with frequently over time, you can establish a super-private, securely-encrypted connection between you and the other party. You can share information, messages, or any other interaction through this channel with a high degree of trust. While connections are powerful, they’re not always needed; <a href="https://trinsic.id/connectionless-credentials/">connectionless credential exchange</a> is sometimes a faster, more convenient way to interact, especially when the relationship isn’t long-term.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Making a connection is as easy as scanning a QR code with your wallet, after which your connection will show up under your “Connections” tab in your wallet. You can also create your own QR code so others can connect with you.</p>

					 <p>The <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a> is the world’s first SSI digital wallet to have proven <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0302-aries-interop-profile">interoperability</a> and has become one of the most-used SSI wallets globally. As a cross-platform mobile application with a locally-stored wallet, the Trinsic Wallet is built to be ideal for developers while being accessible and simple enough for the average user. Also, when you use the Trinsic Wallet, you don’t need to worry about vendor lock-in because you can easily export your verifiable credentials and import them into another Aries-based digital wallet that supports <a href="https://trinsic.id/ssi-digital-wallet-portability/">import/export functionality</a>. Download the Trinsic Wallet for free today or build your own wallet with Trinsic’s tools.</p>

					 <p>If you’re seeking to implement an SSI solution, you have two options:<br><br></p>  Use an existing mobile wallet, like the popular&nbsp;<a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://connect.me/">Connect.Me</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://lissi.id/mobile">Lissi</a>.  Develop your own wallet, custom-made for your use case.  <p>To determine which option is best for you, read our blog “<a href="https://trinsic.id/ssi-wallets-3-decisions/">Building SSI Digital Wallets: The 3 Major Decisions</a>“.

 	 Drummond Reed, an SSI expert, is famous for pulling out his wallet during presentations on SSI. Timothy Ruff, wrote about this tactic in his blog “<a href="https://medium.com/@rufftimo/when-explaining-ssi-start-with-the-wallet-bee5d2af6696">When Explaining SSI, Start with the Wallet</a>“. 
 	 Of course wallets are not foolproof. They can be stolen or lost, but overall, they do a pretty good job of keeping all of our cards in one place that we can keep on us most times throughout the day. SSI digital wallets have their own security protections that are not listed out in detail here as this is an intro post. 
 	 For simplicity’s sake, at Trinsic, we call it all a “wallet” although in more technical circles, you’ll find the term “agent” used for the application that routes messages and decrypts the wallet, and “wallet” used for the storage layer of the agent.

   Redefining Identity: ForgeRock Autonomous Identity&nbsp; 

<p>IT and Security teams are experiencing identity governance fatigue because they are exhausted from manually reviewing and approving access requests and rubber-stamping certifications. To address this weariness, ForgeRock is providing a new modern approach to identity. ForgeRock Autonomous Identity is an artificial intelligence <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">(AI)-driven identity analytics solution</a>, that allows you to overcome <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">identity governance</a><a href="https://www.forgerock.com/blog/what-identity-governance-fatigue"> fatigue</a>.</p>

<p>ForgeRock Autonomous Identity provides real-time, continuous enterprise-wide user access visibility, control, and remediation. By leveraging AI and machine learning techniques, Autonomous Identity collects and analyzes all identity data—such as accounts, roles, assignments, user activity, and entitlements—to identify security access and risk blind spots.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The solution provides you with wider and deeper insight into the risks associated with user access by providing enterprise-wide contextual insights, high-risk user access awareness, and remediation recommendations. Autonomous Identity can be overlaid onto legacy IGA solutions, enabling your organization to increase operational efficiencies, accelerate decision making and maximize existing identity investments.</p>

 Leverage Your Existing Identity Investments&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>ForgeRock Autonomous Identity works with your existing identity infrastructure to develop a complete view of the user access landscape. This includes identity management, Microsoft Active Directory, identity governance, databases, LDAP systems, and other identity data sources in your organization. The landscape provides highly accurate models, showing what good access should and shouldn’t look like.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike legacy IGA solutions that are based on leveraging static rules, roles, and peer group analysis, Autonomous Identity relies strictly on the data in your organization to develop an analysis that is free from any bias coming from human-derived rules and roles that exist in your identity management or <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">identity governance</a> solution.</p>

 How It Works&nbsp; 

<p>Autonomous Identity links users to entitlements at the lowest attribute level. The solution uses profile data to determine the likelihood an individual will need an entitlement, based on how entitlements are currently distributed across the organization.</p>

   Why ForgeRock Autonomous Identity?&nbsp;&nbsp; 

<p>Autonomous Identity addresses identity governance fatigue with unique and highly differentiated capabilities, including:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  Global visibility: By leveraging AI-driven identity analytics, you can collect and analyze identity data (examples: accounts, roles, user activity, entitlements, and more) from diverse identity, governance, and infrastructure solutions in order to provide enterprise-wide visibility of all identities and what they have access to across the entire enterprise. This approach provides your security and risk teams with contextual insights into low-, medium-, and high-risk user access at scale. 
	 Highly scalable: As new identity data is collected and old data is purged, the AI and machine learning model evolves and learns the dynamic changes within the enterprise. By leveraging predefined machine learning techniques and algorithms, you can quickly predict, recommend, and identify outliers. This intelligence-based approach allows your security and risk professionals to automatically analyze and model high volumes of identity data to identify high-risk user access and unauthorized or unknown user access across the entire organization. 
	 Data driven: With Autonomous Identity, you can contextually examine all identity-related data and identify and recommend the right level of user access rights. This approach provides the ability to identify and apply appropriate birthright or leaver user access rights to accounts, applications, systems, roles, entitlements, and more. This process reduces the overall request volume by predicting appropriate user access at the right time to the right resources. 
	 Transparent AI: Unlike “black box” identity analytics solutions, Autonomous Identity allows you to fully comprehend how and why risk confidence scores are determined. By visually presenting low-, medium-, and high-risk confidence scores together, your security and risk professionals can contextually understand which key risk indicators were met. This AI-driven approach recommends risk-based identity and governance remediation updates based on enterprise-wide confidence scores. 
	 Dynamic analysis: With intelligent data stream processing, you can leverage existing and diverse identity, governance, and infrastructure data sources to continuously collect and process high-velocity, high-volume data (examples: roles, entitlements, attributes assignments, and more) from across the enterprise. Combined with a highly scalable and distributed microservices architecture, enterprises can process and analyze tens of millions of data points quickly to predict and recommend user access rights and highlight potential risks. This intelligence-based approach enables security and risk professionals to accelerate their decision-making process. 
 <p>Autonomous Identity provides you the unprecedented ability to reduce costs while simultaneously lowering risks across your organization. It is a game-changing solution that is redefining identity by providing organizations with the following key business benefits:&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

 Crypto Stablecoin Report 14: The increase of Ethereum Gas Fee makes the transfers of stablecoin transactions on the blockchain <p>Original link: <a href="http://bihu.com/article/1181625280">https://bihu.com/article/1181625280</a></p><p>Original publish time: August 18,&nbsp;2020</p><p>Original author: HaiBo Jiang, researcher of MYKEY&nbsp;Lab</p><p>We released MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report to share our interpretation of the development status of stablecoins and analysis of their development trends to help the participants in the crypto market stay updated on the development status of stablecoin. The MYKEY Crypto Stablecoin Report will be published every week, looking forward to maintaining communication with the industry and exploring the development prospects of stablecoin together.</p> Quick Preview   Last week, the market capitalization of major stablecoins increased by $815 million to $15.202&nbsp;billion.  Last week, Tether has additionally issued USDT twice on Ethereum, totaling 620&nbsp;million.  On August 13, Ethereum set a record for an average gas fee of $7.12 per transaction.  Starting from the end of April, the proportion of the circulation of TRC20 USDT is increasing and now TRC20 USDT has accounted for 30.6% of the total&nbsp;USDT.  Beginning in June, the proportion of the number of transactions of stablecoins on Ethereum has continued to decrease. At present, the number of transactions of stablecoins on Ethereum accounts for 20.73% of the total transactions on Ethereum. The increase of gas fees on Ethereum has shifted the transactions of stablecoins to other&nbsp;places.   1. Overview of Stablecoin Data <p>First, let’s review the changes in the basic information of the various stablecoins in the past week(August 8, 2020 ~ August 14, 2020, same&nbsp;below).</p> Market Circulation <p>Source: MYKEY, CoinMarketCap, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>At present, the market circulation of major stablecoins has increased by $815 million to $15.202&nbsp;billion.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Last week, Tether has additionally issued twice on Ethereum, totaling 620 million USDT. The circulation of USDC, BUSD, TUSD, and DAI increased by 94.81 million, 27.21 million, 49.1 million, and 32.83 million. TUSD and BUSD have a higher proportion of additional issuance. The circulation of PAX, HUSD, and GUSD decreased by 3.92 million, 2.87 million, and 2.3&nbsp;million.</p><p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>Last week, the number of main stablecoin holding addresses on Ethereum all increased and increased by&nbsp;153,078.</p><p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>The number of holding addresses of USDT, USDC, PAX, TUSD, and DAI increased by 139,838, 7,309, 481, 822, and&nbsp;4,628.</p> The Number of Active Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The number of active addresses of stablecoins last week decreased by an average of 6.43% compared to the previous&nbsp;week.</p> The Number of 24-hour Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Compared with the previous week, the number of daily transactions of major stablecoins increased by an average of&nbsp;3.26%.</p> The Number of 24-hour Volume of Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Compared with the previous week, the daily volume of transactions of major stablecoins last week increased by an average of&nbsp;4.74%.</p> 2. The impact of Ethereum Gas Fee on the use of stablecoins <p>With the prosperity of the Ethereum ecosystem, TPS has become an important factor restricting the development of Ethereum. Transactions on Ethereum are gradually becoming congested, and gas fees are getting higher and higher. The high gas fee excludes users with low net worth. As an important type of asset on Ethereum, stablecoins may be affected by gas fees. According to data from DeBank, the current total market capitalization of stablecoins on Ethereum is $10.047 billion, which is 20.66% of the market capitalization on Ethereum. In this report, we will explore the impact of Ethereum gas fee on the use of stablecoins.</p><p>According to data from <a href="http://messari.io/">messari.io</a>, since April this year, Ethereum miner fees have increasing. Beginning in June, Ethereum miner fees surpassed Bitcoin miner fees, setting a record for an average gas fee of $7.12 per transaction on August 13. The green line in the figure below represents Ethereum miner fee, and the white line represents Bitcoin miner&nbsp;fees.</p><p>Source: <a href="http://messari.io/">messari.io</a></p><p>Since the end of April, Tether may have been aware of the increase of gas fees on Ethereum, and began to issue a large number of USDT on Tron. The proportion of the circulation of TRC20 USDT is increasing and now TRC20 USDT has accounted for 30.6% of the total USDT, and Omni USDT and ERC20 USDT account for 10.5% and&nbsp;58.9%.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The same situation has also occurred in the number of transactions. Since June this year, the proportion of TRC20 USDT in the number of transactions of USDT has also increasing, and has now increased to 35.9%. At the beginning of the year, the number of transactions of TRC20 USDT accounts for 5.34% of the number of transactions of ERC20 USDT, and now this proportion has increased to&nbsp;58.04%.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Before June this year, there was a general upward trend in the number of transactions of stablecoins on Ethereum. After June, the proportion of stablecoin transactions gradually decreased. Now, the sum of the number of transactions of the major stablecoins accounts for 20.73% of the number of transactions on Ethereum. This may be due to the rising gas fees on Ethereum and the popularity of TRC20 USDT. It can be seen that the increase of gas fees on Ethereum has shifted the transactions of stablecoins to other&nbsp;places.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>At present, the number of transactions of ERC20 USDT accounts for 83.8% of the number of transactions of stablecoin on Ethereum, and the transactions of stablecoins on the blockchain are still mainly based on USDT. The ERC20 USDT held by the top ten addresses accounted for only 14.09% of the total ERC20 USDT. More than a month ago, the ERC20 USDT held by the top ten addresses accounted for 22.49%. ERC20 USDT holdings are becoming more and more scattered.</p><p>Among the ten addresses holding the most TRC20 USDT, 7 are marked as Exchanges, the other is the official Tether address, and two are anonymous. Among them, the address in the fourth place on the rich list has had large transactions with Huobi. 93.15% of the total TRC20 USDT are held by the top ten addresses on the rich list. Binance occupies three of the top ten on the rich list, and 55.46% of the total TRC20 USDT are held by these three addresses. TRC20 USDT is largely concentrated on centralized Exchanges.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Tether, Tokenview</p><p>While the transactions of stablecoins on the blockchain are gradually turning to Tron, the DeFi Dapps on Tron may also become better. We selected seven representative DeFi Dapps: 200TRON, Bank of TRON, TronTrade, Poloni DEX, Forsagetron Smartway, Zethyr Finance, and Oikos cash to judge the development of DeFi on Tron. In the past 10 days, the number of daily transactions on 200TRON increased from 0 to 112,600. In the past month, the number of daily transactions of Bank of TRON increased by 283% to 205,400, and the number of transactions of Zethyr Finance increased by 116%. Only TronTrade and Oikos cash have little change in the number of daily transactions, while the number of daily transactions in the other 5 Dapps has increased significantly. It can be seen that many DeFi Dapps on Tron have also made great progress recently.</p><p>Source: MYKEY, DappReview</p> Tips <p>To better communicate with industry insiders, we decided to add two sections for questions of readers and opinions of guests.

   Do you remember the days when people used tables to arrange content on websites? HTML tables were ideal for arranging content in a grid-style layout. But they had a serious problem. They mixed content with style, prohibited semantic markup, and made it hard for screen readers to sort the information in a meaningful way. 

 After dropping the use of tables, the first solution was to use the CSS flo

  <p>Do you remember the days when people used tables to arrange content on websites? HTML tables were ideal for arranging content in a grid-style layout. But they had a serious problem. They mixed content with style, prohibited semantic markup, and made it hard for screen readers to sort the information in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>After dropping the use of tables, the first solution was to use the CSS <code>float</code> to position elements on a web page. But floats are clumsy, fragile, and generally hard to work with. CSS frameworks—like Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation—sprung up to help with the difficulties of creating a responsive grid layout. But these frameworks have their own learning curve and often introduce significant overhead in unused CSS code.</p>

<p>Along came flexbox to help with some of these problems. It made it a lot easier to create a responsive row or column-based layouts. While flexbox is a huge step forward, it doesn’t adequately address all the needs of front-end designers. Designers for print media usually work with a grid system that organizes content on a page. And the need for a method of arranging content in a 2-dimensional space that uses the same concepts that have been used by print designers for many years was recognized.</p>

<p>The CSS grid layout allows you to specify a grid system on your web page and place content inside the grid cells in a responsive manner. Elements inside the grid can span multiple rows or columns while maintaining the correct row heights and gutter spacings. The CSS grid is not supposed to replace flexbox but to work alongside it to create truly professional layouts.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, I will show you how to create a single page application that uses CSS grids to create a responsive layout without using media queries. The application will be a simple Unicode character browser implemented with React.</p>

 Create a Unicode Browser App with React 

<p>I will assume that you have some familiarity with JavaScript and that you have a recent version of Node installed on your computer. You will first create a React project using the <code>npx</code> command that comes with the Node installation. In a terminal, navigate into a directory of your choice and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npx create-react-app react-grid-unicode
</code>   

<p>This will create a new folder <code>react-grid-unicode</code> and install a skeleton React application into it. Before you start implementing the application, you need to obtain the data files that you will be using for the Unicode look-up. The raw data is available at <a href="https://www.unicode.org">https://www.unicode.org</a> but, to make your life easier, I have created two JSON files that you will be using for this project. In the terminal, navigate into your new project folder and then into the <code>src/</code> folder. Now create a new folder called <code>unicode</code> inside the <code>src</code> folder and download and save the following files into it.</p>

 
   <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-css-grid-example/master/src/unicode/license.txt">license.txt</a> 
   <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-css-grid-example/master/src/unicode/blocks.json">blocks.json</a> 
   <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-css-grid-example/master/src/unicode/unicode.json">unicode.json</a> 
 

<p>If you have <code>wget</code> installed on your system, you can grab these files with the following commands:</p>

   <code>wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-css-grid-example/master/src/unicode/license.txt
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-css-grid-example/master/src/unicode/blocks.json
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-react-css-grid-example/master/src/unicode/unicode.json
</code>   

<p>Next, open your favorite IDE in the project folder and create a new file <code>src/Unicode.js</code> and paste the following content into it.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import unicode from './unicode/unicode';
import blocks from './unicode/blocks';

class Unicode extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super();
    this.state = { results: this.search('') };
  }

  search(query) {
    return unicode
      .filter((entry) =&gt; entry.name.toUpperCase().includes(query.toUpperCase()))
      .slice(0, 100);
  }

  selectChar(entry) {
    const codeInt = parseInt(entry.code, 16);
    const block = this.findBlock(codeInt);
    this.setState({
      selected: {
        ...entry,
        html: String.fromCharCode(codeInt),
        block: block &amp;&amp; block.name
      }
    });
  }

  findBlock(code) {
    return blocks.filter((b) =&gt; (b.from&lt;=code &amp;&amp; b.to&gt;=code))[0];
  }

  render() {
    const handleSelect = (entry) =&gt; () =&gt; {
      this.selectChar(entry);
    };

    const handleSearch = (event) =&gt; {
      this.setState({
        results: this.search(event.target.value)
      });
    };

    const resultList = this.state.results.map((entry) =&gt;
      &lt;li key={entry.code}
          onClick={handleSelect(entry)}
          className={(this.state.selected &amp;&amp; entry.code===this.state.selected.code) ? 'active' : ''}&gt;
          {entry.name}
      &lt;/li&gt;
    );
    const charInfo = this.state.selected
      ? &lt;div&gt;
          &lt;p className="char-name"&gt;{ this.state.selected.name }&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p className="char-block"&gt;{ this.state.selected.block }&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p className="char-code"&gt;&amp;#x{ this.state.selected.code };&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      : undefined;

    return (
      &lt;div className="app-ui"&gt;
        &lt;div className="search-input" onChange={handleSearch}&gt;&lt;input type="text" placeholder="Search"/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div className="search-results"&gt;
          &lt;ul&gt;{resultList}&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div className="char-display"&gt;{ this.state.selected &amp;&amp; this.state.selected.html }&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div className="char-info"&gt;{ charInfo }&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}

export default Unicode;
</code>   

<p>In the code above, the top part includes the import of <code>./unicode/unicode</code> and <code>./unicode/blocks</code>. These lines import the JSON files that you downloaded earlier and make them available for the module. The <code>Unicode</code> class is a React component that will render the Unicode browser UI. It implements a number of functions:</p>

 
   <code>search()</code> will search for entries in the Unicode character table based on a search string. 
   <code>selectChar()</code> is called when an entry is selected, and the character information should be displayed. 
   <code>findBlock()</code> finds the Unicode character block for a given Unicode. 
   <code>render()</code> is the React function that renders the component. 
 

<p>In the return statement of the <code>render()</code>  function, you can see that the component has four main parts, a search input, the search results, an area that displays the chosen character, and a panel that shows some additional information about that character.</p>

<p>Now you can add this component to your application. Open <code>src/App.js</code> in your editor and replace its content with the code below.</p>

   <code>import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import Unicode from './Unicode';

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div className="App"&gt;
        &lt;header&gt;
          Unicode Chart
        &lt;/header&gt;
        &lt;div className="page"&gt;
          &lt;div className="content"&gt;
              &lt;Unicode /&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}

export default App;
</code>   

<p>Notice how the <code>&lt;Unicode /&gt;</code> tag is used to place your Unicode component onto the screen. Next, you can give the page some styling by opening <code>src/App.css</code> and replacing the contents with the following.</p>

   <code>.App header {
  background-color: #282c34;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
  color: white;
  padding: 0.5rem 1rem;
}

.page {
  text-align: center;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

.content {
  text-align: left;
  display: inline-block;
  background-color: #ffffff;
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 1232px;
  padding: 16px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
</code>   

<p>At this point, you can try out your application. In a terminal, run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm start
</code>   

<p>Once the application has finished compiling, it should automatically open your browser to <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. You will see something like the image below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The layout of the user interface is not very nice, of course, because you have not yet applied any styling to it.</p>

 Add a Responsive Layout with CSS Grid 

<p>In this section, I will show you how to create a responsive layout using a CSS Grid Layout. In your IDE, create a new file <code>src/Unicode.css</code> and paste the following style into it.</p>

   <code>.app-ui {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(384px, 1fr));
  grid-gap: 16px;
}

.search-input {
  grid-column-start: 1;
  grid-column-end: -1;
}

.search-input input {
  width: 100%;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.search-results {
  grid-column-end: span 2;
  grid-row-end: span 2;
  border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;
  overflow: auto;
  max-height: 500px;
}

.search-results ul {
  list-style: none;
  padding: 8px;
  margin: 0;
}

.search-results li.active {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

.char-info {
  text-align: center;
  border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;
  padding: 16px;
}

.char-display {
  text-align: center;
  border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;
  padding: 16px;
  font-family:serif !important;
  font-size: 120px;
}
</code>   

<p>The line <code>display: grid;</code> in the CSS code above, instructs the browser to layout the contents of the <code>.app-ui</code> container as a grid. The <code>grid-template-columns</code> property specifies the columns of the grid. Using <code>auto-fit</code>, the code above tells the browser to create as many columns as possible but maintaining that each column should have a minimum width of 384 pixels. Specifying <code>1fr</code> for the maximum width allows columns to span the whole width of the container if required. The line <code>grid-gap: 16px;</code> creates a consistent gutter of 16 pixels between grid cells.</p>

<p>Each child element of the grid container can be positioned individually. Take a look at the styling of the search input.</p>

   <code>.search-input {
  grid-column-start: 1;
  grid-column-end: -1;
}
</code>   

<p>This forces the search input to always start in the first column and end in the last column of the grid. This means that the search input will always span the full width of the container. You can also force elements to span a fixed number of rows or columns. Have a look at the following lines.</p>

   <code>.search-results {
  grid-column-end: span 2;
  grid-row-end: span 2;
}
</code>   

<p>These ensure that the search results will always span at least two columns and two rows. Elements that don’t specify any specific CSS grid properties will, by default, always be placed into a cell spanning a single row and columns.</p>

<p>To make sure that the styles are applied to the <code>Unicode</code> component, open <code>src/Unicode.js</code> again and add the following import to the top of the file.</p>

   <code>import './Unicode.css'
</code>   

<p>Now you can run <code>npm start</code> again to test the application. In your browser, you should see something as shown in the image below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>On smaller screens, the number of columns in the grid decreases, and the two cells on the right will automatically be placed below the search results.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Note that this behavior has been achieved without the use of media queries.</p>

 Add Authentication with Okta 

<p>When developing web applications, you will at some point be faced with the need to provide user authentication. There are ways to implement this yourself, but they are difficult and require a lot of experience in order to ensure they are safe. With Okta, you can avoid these problems and you can set up authentication with just a few lines of code. In addition, Okta provides a single sign-on service, which means that a single user account can be used for multiple applications.</p>

<p>You need to register for a free account at <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">developer.okta.com</a>. Simply select Create Free Account and complete the registration process. Once complete, you will be directed to your Okta developer dashboard. Here you can register your application by navigating to Applications &gt; Add Application. On the next screen, choose Single Page App and click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The following screen lets you edit the application’s settings. Make sure that the port number is 3000 and also change the base URI to <code>http://localhost:3000/</code>. Then set the Login Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:3000/callback</code>. Port 3000 is used by the React development server to serve your application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click Done and you should see a Client ID, which you will need to paste into your JavaScript code.</p>

<p>Next, open the terminal in your project’s base directory and install the Okta React SDK and React Router by running the following commands.</p>

   <code>npm install -E @okta/okta-react@3.0.4 react-router-dom@5.2.0
</code>   

<p>Now, open <code>src/App.js</code> and add the following two imports to the top of the file.</p>

   <code>import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import { LoginCallback, SecureRoute, Security } from '@okta/okta-react';
</code>   

<p>In the <code>render()</code> function, replace the <code>&lt;Unicode /&gt;</code> component with the code below.</p>

   <code>&lt;Router&gt;
  &lt;Security issuer='https://{YourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default'
            clientId='{ClientId}'
            redirectUri={window.location.origin + '/callback'}
            pkce={true}&gt;
    &lt;SecureRoute path='/' exact={true} component={Unicode}/&gt;
    &lt;Route path='/callback' component={LoginCallback}/&gt;
  &lt;/Security&gt;
&lt;/Router&gt;
</code>   

<p>Here <code>{YourOktaDomain}</code> is your Okta domain that you can find on the Okta dashboard (in the top right), and <code>{ClientId}</code> is the client ID that you created earlier when you registered the application.</p>

<p>That’s it! You have secured your application. Now, if you stop your application and restart it  (with <code>npm start</code>) you will have to log in to your Okta account before you will be able to access the Unicode browser.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you don’t see a login form, it’s because you’re already logged in. Using a private window will cause a redirect to Okta for authentication. If you’d rather have the login form in your application, you can use <a href="https://developer.okta.com/code/react/okta_react_sign-in_widget/">Okta’s Sign-In Widget with React</a>.</p>

 Learn More About Styling Your Single-Page Applications 

<p>In this tutorial, I have shown you how to use CSS grid to style your single page application. The grid allows you to create a responsive layout without the use of media queries. This new CSS feature is not intended to replace the currently popular flexbox but should be used alongside giving you control and flexibility over the design on your website.</p>

The U.S. doesn’t trust China so ditto state-connected enterprises like ByteDance and&nbsp;Tencent.</p><p>But hey, email still&nbsp;works.</p><p>What that means is that a balkanized internet will only accelerate the transition toward new approaches so that we can continue to connect even as the rules of the game&nbsp;shift.</p><p>Anyway, that’s what Peter Thiel is betting on. (Always the contrarian and often controversial, but never disappoints with his insights.)</p><p>Here’s Peter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufm85wHJk5A">speaking at the Discovery Institute’s technology summit in&nbsp;July</a>:</p><blockquote>If we’d been assembled in 1969, the future of computers was going to be massive centralization. It was giant databases, giant AI-like computer intelligences that would run everything. IBM was HAL transposed in the movie The Space Odyssey, one letter off. It was one of the early Star Trek episodes. They come to the planet Beta, where thousands of years earlier, somebody had unified the planet and left a computer program that ran the whole planet and all the people were peaceful, but very docile — nothing ever happened. But the future of the computer age circa 1969 was centralization — a few large companies, a few large governments, a few large computers that controlled everything.</blockquote><blockquote>Fast forward to 1999, the future of the computer age was going to be massive decentralization. It was sort of libertarian and anarchist. It was the corollary to the end of the Soviet Union, that information had this decentralizing tendency, and the internet was going to fragment things and it was going to be this anarchic libertarian place.</blockquote><blockquote>If we fast forward to 2019, the consensus view of the future today, I would submit, is that the pendulum has somehow swung back all the way to 1969. And the consensus view again is that it is about large centralization — Google like governments that control all of the world’s information in this super centralized way.</blockquote><blockquote>The Life After Google thesis that I agree with and endorse is that if we look at this past — and people got it terribly wrong in ‘69 — and things were going to go to decentralization in ’99, it actually started going back the other way from the point of view of 2019. Even if I’m hesitant to talk about the absolute future and where this all ends, ultimately, perhaps the contrarian thing is to say maybe the pendulum can swing back towards more decentralization, more privacy, and things like that. This is what seems to be at least contrarian and at least something we should always take more seriously.</blockquote><blockquote>If you want to frame it in terms of the buzzwords of the day, if it were in terms of crypto and AI, it is easily understood by people. It’s always understood that crypto is somehow vaguely libertarian, but we never are willing to say the opposite, which is that AI is communist. It’s because it’s centralized. The computer knows more about you than you know about yourself. It’s totalitarian.</blockquote><blockquote>Communist China loves AI and dislikes crypto. We should at least consider the possibility that Silicon Valley is probably way too enamored of AI, not just for technological reasons, but also because it expresses this sort of left wing centralized zeitgeist.</blockquote><blockquote>The first sort of contrarian idea I have is that perhaps it’s time for the pendulum to swing back and Life After Google, at its core, means that we are going to go back from this very centralized world today towards a more decentralized one. That seems to me to be the correct thing to bet&nbsp;on.</blockquote><p>Going by Peter’s timeline, 1999 might have felt like the height of the decentralization movement but it was also the beginning of the cycle for the rise of Google, Amazon, Apple (again), and later Facebook.</p><p>Those companies are now among the most valuable on&nbsp;earth.</p><p>So even if today feels like peak centralization, it’s reasonable — particularly if you’re feeling contrarian — that this only means that the pendulum is about the swing the other way. The forces are already in&nbsp;motion.</p>  <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/13/1006631/wechat-ban-severs-a-hundred-million-ties/">The human cost of a WeChat ban: severing a hundred million&nbsp;ties</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/internet-freedom-nationalism-authoritarianism-767da13b-b6bf-4aac-8f05-78f0a6353f08.html">Nationalism and authoritarianism threaten the internet’s universality</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/mg">/mg</a>— <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogBjqQbuiHw">Who wields the power online? | DW Documentary</a>  <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/competition-bureau/news/2020/08/competition-bureau-seeks-input-from-market-participants-to-inform-an-ongoing-investigation-of-amazon.html">Competition Bureau seeks input from market participants to inform an ongoing investigation of Amazon — Canada.ca</a>  <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-alibaba/trump-says-looking-at-pressuring-other-chinese-companies-after-bytedance-idUKKCN25B11B">Trump says looking at pressuring other Chinese companies after Bytedance</a>  <a href="https://www.state.gov/the-clean-network/">The Clean Network — United States Department of&nbsp;State</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/wechat-ban-decentralized">A WeChat Ban Should Be the Moment for Decentralized Tech. But It’s Not. — CoinDesk</a>   2. It’s unclear that things will play out as cleanly as Peter Thiel’s proposed logic. What’s clear is that there’s suddenly ample demand for new solutions. <p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/corporate-america-worries-wechat-ban-could-be-bad-for-business-11597311003">WSJ&nbsp;reports</a>:</p><blockquote>More than a dozen major U.S. multinational companies raised concerns in a call with White House officials Tuesday about the potentially broad scope and impact of Mr. Trump’s executive order targeting WeChat, set to take effect late next&nbsp;month.</blockquote><blockquote>Apple Inc., Ford Motor Co., Walmart Inc. and Walt Disney Co. were among those participating in the call, according to people familiar with the situation.</blockquote><blockquote>“For those who don’t live in China, they don’t understand how vast the implications are if American companies aren’t allowed to use it,” said Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. “They are going to be held at a severe disadvantage to every competitor,” he&nbsp;added.</blockquote><blockquote>Other participants in the call Tuesday included Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Intel Corp., MetLife Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, United Parcel Service Inc., Merck &amp; Co. Inc. and Cargill Inc., according to the&nbsp;people.</blockquote><p>That’s the long&nbsp;game.</p><p>There’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-98146fea-684f-411e-b873-40fd00171f93.html">ample demand from individuals, too,&nbsp;BTW</a>:</p><blockquote>Americans using digital services would gladly switch to companies that are more committed to data privacy, according to survey results shared exclusively with Axios’ Kyle&nbsp;Daly.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: It’s the latest sign people are frustrated with the digital status quo, even as companies make efforts to give users more control over how their data gets collected, stored and&nbsp;used.</blockquote><blockquote>Details: The survey of 1,018 Americans, conducted in June, found people want more control over what happens with their personal information and think existing tools seem outdated and should be easier to&nbsp;use.</blockquote><blockquote>93% of Americans would switch to a company that prioritizes their data&nbsp;privacy.</blockquote><blockquote>91% would prefer to buy from companies that always guarantee them access to their&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>88% are frustrated that they don’t have more control over their&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>73% reported finding the process of downloading their data from a company “outdated”; 32%, “hard”; 32%, “confusing.”</blockquote><blockquote>About two-thirds said they want to be able to choose what data companies can and can’t&nbsp;collect.</blockquote><p>They’re also just waiting for an alternative.</p> 3. And just to point out the swings of the pendulum — there’s Apple, complaining about the WeChat ban. Back in 1984, Apple released that iconic Super Bowl ad about IBM referencing George&nbsp;Orwell. <p>Now they’re getting a taste of their own medicine <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1294006412931223552">with Riot’s Fortnite&nbsp;spoof</a>.</p><p>Of course, Facebook <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-apple-app-store-22774656-4221-40e7-b6b6-307a1a2de4d5.html">sees an opportunity</a>:</p><blockquote>Between the lines: Facebook is trying to position itself as friendlier to small businesses than Apple, which also faces a lawsuit from Fortnite maker Epic Games over its commission and in-app payment restrictions.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s happening: Facebook said Friday that it will launch “Paid Online Events” for small businesses in 20 countries around the world to charge Facebook users to attend their classes, instructions and other&nbsp;events.</blockquote><blockquote>The feature could be useful for any small business or individual offering a service, such a preacher, musician, yoga teacher or cooking instructor.</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook asked Apple to either waive its 30% cut or let Facebook go around it and process event payments via Facebook Pay, in either case letting event hosts keep all the revenue they generate.

The other thing about technological balkanization is that it’s not always going to be black and white. A lot of the time it’s gray. That’s a good way to describe what’s been happening in Europe in terms of how they’ve dealt with the influence of American Big Tech. Rather than ban anything outright, they just force companies to play by their&nbsp;rules. <p>That’s well and good in theory. In practice, it’s really messy with a lot of unintended consequences.</p><p>For instance:</p><blockquote>Some businesses fear growing liability while others worry that small and mid-sized firms will get hurt as the U.S. and Europe begin work to replace Privacy Shield, the pact that let thousands of firms transfer data across the Atlantic without breaking EU privacy rules, Axios’ Ashley Gold&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>Why it matters: Without a replacement in place after the EU’s high court struck Privacy Shield down last month, thousands of businesses will be stuck complying with an agreement that no longer applies in the EU while scrambling to figure out how to get data over from Europe without exposing themselves to legal&nbsp;risks.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s new: This week, the Department of Commerce and European Commission announced they have started discussions to come up with a new framework to govern data transfers between the EU and the&nbsp;U.S.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://link.axios.com/click/21182755.18680/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY29tbWVyY2UuZ292L25ld3MvcHJlc3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvMjAyMC8wOC9qb2ludC1wcmVzcy1zdGF0ZW1lbnQtdXMtc2VjcmV0YXJ5LWNvbW1lcmNlLXdpbGJ1ci1yb3NzLWFuZC1ldXJvcGVhbj91dG1fc291cmNlPW5ld3NsZXR0ZXImdXRtX21lZGl1bT1lbWFpbCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bmV3c2xldHRlcl9heGlvc2xvZ2luJnN0cmVhbT10b3A/5873ef138cc2b2045d8b45dcB191b30f7">Joint Press Statement from U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross and European Commissioner for Justice Didier&nbsp;Reynders</a>  <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/889kyv/a-princess-is-making-google-to-forget-her-drunken-rant-about-killing-muslims">A Princess Is Making Google Forget Her Drunken Rant About Killing&nbsp;Muslims</a>  <a href="https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2020/08/165131-strong-customer-authentication-a-requirement-to-combat-payments-fraud-might-lead-to-many-customers-abandoning-purchases-at-checkout/">Strong Customer Authentication, a Requirement to Combat Payments Fraud, Might Lead to Many Customers Abandoning Purchases at&nbsp;Checkout</a>   5. We’ve talked about balkanization. We’ve touched on regulation. One of the missing pieces that’s become a pivotal question of the day is moderation, which is understandably a controversial topic of the day. If you listened at all to the recent antitrust hearings, then you know that Republicans have their collective pitchforks out about platform censorship. <p>And it’s easy to think about moderation negatively particularly with what’s going on in&nbsp;China.</p><p>But just as not every habit needs to be labeled an addiction — there are good habits, after all — not all moderation should be labeled censorship.</p><p>Good moderation is helpful in creating the right incentives that align with a community’s core values — whether that’s a small group of friends or an entire&nbsp;country.</p><p>And good moderation will mean different things for different people.</p><p>A big part of why there’s such a negative slant to the idea of moderation with today’s status quo isn’t moderation itself, it’s the issue of centralized power and the lack of transparency and accountability.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/trump-twitter-facebook-and-the-future-of-online-speech">the New Yorker</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><blockquote>In a 2018 article published in the Harvard Law Review, “The New Governors: The People, Rules, and Processes Governing Online Speech,” Kate Klonick, who is now a professor at St. John’s University Law School, tallies the sometimes conflicting factors that have shaped the moderation policies at Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. The companies, she writes, have been influenced by a fundamental belief in American “free speech norms,” a sense of corporate responsibility, and user expectations. They’ve also reacted to government requests, media scrutiny, pressure from users or public figures, and the demands of third-party civil-society groups, such as the Anti-Defamation League. They have sometimes instituted new rules in response to individual incidents. There are downsides to this kind of improvisational responsiveness: a lack of transparency and accountability creates conditions ripe for preferential treatment and double standards.</blockquote><p>It’s also the type of problem inherent to huge centralized organizations and platforms. The more decentralized, transparent, and flexible moderation is, the less oppressive moderation feels.</p><p>I mean I get it. Why should Mark Zuckerberg decide the rules for billions of people? Who made him king? (And I get Mark’s side — when you have your own employees protesting because you won’t take stuff down because they don’t like&nbsp;it.)</p><p>It’s like that thing that Aristotle said: That dude that has a lotta friends basically has no&nbsp;friends.</p><p>Mark gets it, too. That’s why he created an independent (supposedly) subcommittee to decide that&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>As a solution, though, it’s still kind of a bandaid. When you’re as big and as powerful as Facebook, any solution to the problem will be a bit cumbersome.</p><p>When you don’t have a system built on real trust and real identities, it’s impossible to delegate that responsibility to your users or your communities. If you never trusted them in the first place, how can you provide them&nbsp;agency.</p><p>It’s a point that we touched upon a couple weeks&nbsp;ago.</p><p>Vitalik Buterin:</p><blockquote>If you don’t have any notion of persistent identity, then you can’t have positive incentives because there’s no persistent thing for those incentives to hook onto. There’re a lot of ways you can have persistent identity, persistent reputation — even in ways that are very strongly privacy preserving.</blockquote><p>Anyway, this was more of an open question. Something to think&nbsp;about.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://themarkup.org/google-the-giant/2020/08/07/google-documents-show-taboo-words-antitrust">To Head Off Regulators, Google Makes Certain Words Taboo — The&nbsp;Markup</a>   6. OK. I’ll leave you with a little more Peter Thiel on the state of innovation and progress in the U.S. from that same talk. (Sorry, Chamath is pushed back&nbsp;again.) <blockquote>If we look at the rate of progress in Silicon Valley, it was charismatic because it was the one place where things were still happening relative to the rest of the U.S., and it’s become a lot less charismatic in the last five&nbsp;years.</blockquote><blockquote>We think about the vibe in 2014, it was this place where the future was being built. In 2019, the big tech companies are probably as self hating in some ways as the big banks were in&nbsp;2009.</blockquote><blockquote>There’s a sense of, “uh, it’s not quite working.”</blockquote><blockquote>If you pick on Google a little bit here, the Google propaganda of the future was that it was all going to be more automation. The story in 2014 were things like Google Glass so you could identify anybody you looked at at any time. It was the self-driving car. I would say these aren’t that big of a set of innovations — a self-driving car is a step from a car but not as big a step as a far from a&nbsp;horse.</blockquote><blockquote>So we can debate quite how big these things are and how to quantify them. But that was still the narrative that was very intact in&nbsp;2014.</blockquote><blockquote>When you fast forward to 2019, it’s striking how there’s absolutely no narrative of the future left. Google doesn’t even talk about the self-driving car very much. There’s a sense that it may still happen, but it’s further in the future. The expected time seems to be getting further&nbsp;away.</blockquote><blockquote>So there’s sort of the sense that perhaps there’s this danger that we have slowed progress even in tech, even in the world of information technology.</blockquote><blockquote>….</blockquote><blockquote>Somehow Silicon Valley has consolidated into larger companies. It’s gotten harder for new companies to break through, and it’s gotten harder because new companies or small companies are good at doing new things and people are doing fewer new things. Then the big companies are more dominant.</blockquote><blockquote>….</blockquote><blockquote>The stagnation idea is that at the end of the day, technology is about people. It’s not about inanimate forces. It’s not some kind of Marxist historicism about the way things are inevitably going to happen. The stress is always on individuals, small teams that start companies, new projects that do new&nbsp;things.</blockquote><blockquote>It’s a question of human agency. It’s not deterministic. We have every possibility to do these things, but at the end of the day, it is up to us to make it happen. And it’s not set in stone that it’s going to happen one way or&nbsp;another.</blockquote><blockquote>In conclusion, I think one other gloss in Life After Google is that perhaps you should have the title with “life” being italicized or stressed or put in&nbsp;bold.</blockquote><blockquote>The critical thing is there is life, life goes on and in particular, human life, humanity goes on. Even though the dominant narrative in tech is about inanimate forces or Marxist historicism — it really is, at its core, about human beings and we should always bet on the indomitability of the human&nbsp;spirit.</blockquote> 7.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Informatica has <a href="https://www.informatica.com/about-us/news/news-releases/2020/08/20200818-informatica-acquires-greenbay-technologies-to-advance-ai-and-machine-learning-capabilities.html">just announced</a> that they have made another acquisition this summer: GreenBay Technologies, a startup focused on AI and machine learning. Read about their July 2020 acquisition <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/kuppinger/big-data-informatica-announces-acquisition-of-compact-solutions">here</a>.</p>
<p>GreenBay Technologies brings CloudMatcher to Informatica’s Intelligent Data Platform (IDP). CloudMatcher uses machine learning to automate entity matching and schema matching tasks with high accuracy. This impacts several key data management capabilities such as master data management, data cataloging, data quality, governance, and data integration.</p>
<p>This acquisition adds to the core capabilities of Informatica’s CLAIRE® engine. Informatica has previously collaborated with and invested in GreenBay Technologies, with some elements of CloudMatcher technology already embedded in Informatica products. Founders and team members of GreenBay Technologies will join Informatica as full-time employees. The collaboration, investment, and mutual aim to provide a more complete view and understanding of enterprise data foreshadows a successful acquisition.</p>
<p>Empowering the Business User with AI-Powered Data Management Tools</p>
<p>CloudMatcher further strengthens Informatica’s approach to no-code data management. It brings innovations to both schema matching and entity matching. While schema matching determines that two columns in two tables, such as “ename” and “emp name”, are semantically the same, entity matching determines that two records, such as (David Smith, Acme Company) and (Dave M. Smith, Acme), are the same real-world entity.</p>
<p>Historically, entity matching has remained a complex problem because the solutions are rule-based that require skilled developers and a significant amount of time. GreenBay Technologies has created a blend of “declarative rules” and “AI rules” for match classification. Many existing solutions to schema and entity matching use hand-crafted rules. With this acquisition, Informatica adds a powerful machine learning model that can capture complex and powerful matching rules, the kind of rules that users cannot create manually. The supervised learning used in this approach requires relatively little effort from the user to train the system. The active learning stage presents the business user with interactive labeling exercises for tuple pairs from two separate tables. Simultaneously, the system learns from more user feedback and curation to continuously improve over time. This workflow goes through multiple iterations and yields a high degree of accuracy. CloudMatcher is also highly amenable to distributed and parallel processing, allowing the solution to scale to very large data sets and dramatically reduce manual data stewardship required.</p>
<p>This opens the door for many data management services to be “hands-off”, meaning easily usable by business users without the need for coding or a developer background. As data sets are getting larger and larger, the improved match rate offered by CloudMatcher will help reduce the false positives. By applying a crowdsourcing approach with business users labeling training data, Informatica can configure a sophisticated data matching system that adapts to an organization’s data landscape in a few hours as opposed to days or weeks. This technology also helps in extending matching beyond identity data by matching product, supplier, location, and other types of data domains with even higher accuracy.</p>
<p>AI on Demand: A Continuation of the Platform Economy</p>
<p>We see the trend of harnessing AI to make complex tasks more accessible to non-technical users rising in many different fields. <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/mc80384/conversational-ai-building-platforms/#article-slice-14228">Conversational AI Building Platforms</a> is one such area with many vendors providing the general technology and language capabilities, with support to train the chatbot on a customer’s specific industry and corporate knowledge. Other areas include <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lb70278/artificial-intelligence-in-cybersecurity/">cybersecurity</a>, with AI capabilities already integrated into the cybersecurity solution and able to be trained in a context-specific environment rather than a “build it yourself” approach. This may shift in the future though, as methodologies for presenting the AI development process (data preparation, model selection, training, validating, implementation, maintenance, and retirement) to non-AI experts improve. Some tech companies (read about some examples <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/ev80232/ibm-watson/">here</a> and <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/ev80233/microsoft-azure-ai-platform/">here</a>) are offering AI capabilities irrespective of industry; they aim to provide the infrastructure, data pipeline management, automated support to determine appropriate learning models, and governance for the AI lifecycle.</p>
<p>The data management use cases that we see Informatica addressing have the potential to unlock more data-based insights at a lower cost – be it through reducing time-to-value or by enabling subject matter experts to work with their data as a data scientist or developer would. Enabling more data-driven business will shape the processes, internal decisions, production goals, and much more. But this is only possible with strong data management practice, including the correct labeling of entities. User-friendly AI to manage this step is key to seeing more value from data management products.</p>

					 <p>“Portable” is one of the <a href="http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html">10 principles</a> of <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI). In order to achieve portability or self-sovereignty, an individual must be able to control where their identity information and credentials are stored. They must be able to leave their current provider and move to a new provider and never be trapped in vendor lock-in.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wallet portability for individuals has always been an aspiration of wallet providers, but until today, has never been successful. We’re proud to announce that Trinsic has achieved interoperable wallet portability with two other SSI wallet vendors—<a href="https://lissi.id">Lissi</a> and <a href="https://esatus.com">esatus AG</a>. For the first time, an individual can “fire their wallet”¹ and use a new one.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 What is wallet portability? 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>When we talk about wallet portability with other vendors, we mean you can seamlessly transfer your SSI wallet between these different applications by exporting from one wallet and importing into another (“import/export”). With import/export functionality, you are no longer tied to or reliant on a single technology provider.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“Portability between Aries wallets is a long time coming. It’s a huge win for the vision of SSI,” said Trinsic CEO Riley Hughes. “Import/export should be standard in any SSI wallet—because if a wallet doesn’t support portability, it’s not really self-sovereign.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This first implementation amongst 3 vendors is a first step in what we hope will be a larger community effort to converge on best practices for interoperability of SSI wallets.</p>

					 <p>The <a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet/">Trinsic Wallet</a>, the <a href="https://lissi.id/mobile">Lissi app</a>, and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.esatus.wallet&amp;hl=en_US">esatus Wallet</a> are three separate SSI wallets that support the import/export feature. The video below shows Trinsic CEO Riley Hughes easily moving his wallet from Trinsic to Lissi and then back again, all while receiving and verifying credentials with no interruption:</p>

					 <p>Transfer credentials from the Trinsic Wallet to the Lissi app:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  In the Trinsic Wallet, go to Settings and click the Export Wallet tab.  Copy down the recovery phrase.  Click on the Export Wallet button.  Save the wallet to wherever you’d like to store it.  Open the Lissi app (this can be done with the esatus Wallet as well), go to Settings, and click on the Recover Account tab.  Click on Open File and choose the Trinsic Wallet file.  Paste in the recovery phrase that was copied from the Trinsic Wallet and click Recover Backup.   
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Transfer credentials from the Lissi app to the Trinsic Wallet:<br><br></p>  In the Lissi app, go to Settings and click on the Create Export/Backup tab.  Write down the recovery phrase and click Continue.  Verify the recovery phrase by clicking on the words in the correct order.  Name your backup file and click Export.  Unzip the exported file.  Open the Trinsic Wallet, click on Settings, and click on the Backup and Restore tab.  Click on the Restore Wallet button, select Local Backup, and choose the Lissi wallet file.  Type in the recovery phrase and click the Recover Wallet button.   
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>“We celebrate with the community in the achievement of SSI wallet portability and are proud that Lissi Mobile Wallet is one of the first truly portable wallets,” said Helge Michael, the Program Manager at Main Incubator who runs Lissi. “Self-sovereign identity has made incredible progress in the last couple of years, and we can now add wallet portability to the list.”</p>

					 <p>Our approach to wallet portability shouldn’t be viewed as the end-all be-all. Further iterations and evolution will happen over time as the SSI community continues to converge on standards and protocols relating to wallet portability. We do commit, however, to being involved in that effort. If you’d like to get involved, here are some things we’d love your contributions on:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Currently connections are lost through the import/export process. Connections are a persistent 1:1 relationship between two parties and rely on endpoints provided by mediator agents to ensure messages are routed to the correct wallet. Because the approach to mediator agents aren’t completely standardized between vendors, connections do not transfer seamlessly across different vendors.  The export function creates an encrypted, duplicate wallet which you can use as a backup. This is extremely useful if you lose your device and want to restore your wallet. But it also enables you to upload your wallet to multiple devices. This is useful if you want a tablet &amp; mobile wallet to be in sync, but can be problematic if you duplicated your wallet onto other people’s devices, allowing them to present your credentials. Ensuring the integrity of credentials across the import/export process is the subject of future work.  All the mobile wallets that support portability are based on the <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet">Aries Framework .NET</a>. Further testing will be required to determine whether the exported wallet can be opened seamlessly in other Aries frameworks or whether additional limitations will arise.  The import/export implementation is specifically geared toward local wallets and applications (ie., mobile wallets). Enterprise wallets and cloud wallets are out of scope.

<p>Poly Network will permit interoperability between multiple chains, offering a range of new advantages</p><p>In a bid to lay the groundwork for a more collaborative and transparent decentralized ecosystem, three leading global blockchain projects, <a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, <a href="https://neo.org/">Neo</a>, and <a href="https://www.switcheo.network/">Switcheo</a>, have announced the launch of <a href="https://www.poly.network/">Poly Network</a>, a heterogeneous interoperability protocol alliance.</p><p>In what is a major milestone for the Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) industry, Poly Network will permit cross-platform interoperability, greatly increasing transparency and accessibility. Enterprises leveraging diverging systems can connect to Poly Network, and collaborate and interact with each other through an open, transparent admission mechanism.</p><p>Andy Ji, Co-founder of Ontology, the high performance, open source blockchain specializing in digital identity and data said, “By combining the highest standards of expertise and platform capabilities, Poly Network will have unprecedented benefits for blockchain developers, propelling the building of the decentralized ecosystem through a range of platform offerings that make the user experience easier.</p><p>“For a time now, the Ontology community has enjoyed the benefits of cross-chain functionalities with Ethereum. Now, through Poly Network, an enterprise leveraging the Ontology blockchain will be able to seamlessly interact with an enterprise leveraging Ethereum, Cosmos, or Neo, helping these platforms overcome challenges to scalability, mainstream adoption, and collaboration. To make it happen, Ontology has invested high levels of technical research, development, and financial support.”</p><p>Prioritizing key characteristics of efficiency, value transfer, privacy, and security, PolyNetwork’s core function is to enable cross-platform interoperability and atomic cross chain transactions, such as the swapping of digital currency for other tokenized assets. PolyNetwork will:</p>  Provide DeFi developers with new infrastructure for creating cross-chain compatible dApps  Support both heterogeneous and homogeneous chains including Ethereum, Neo, Ontology, and Cosmos, along with each platform’s homogenous chain forks, with future plans to support the Bitcoin&nbsp;network  Permit easy, eco-friendly access to cross-chain transactions, by requiring less smart contracts  Increase scalability of cross chain transactions by enabling the transfer of both assets and information  <p>Da Hongfei, Founder of Neo, an open-source, community driven platform, said, “I firmly believe that interoperability is the future of the blockchain industry. Within our current paradigm, both traditional and blockchain platforms exist as effectively isolated data silos — users and developers alike are restricted by each platform’s capabilities and limitations. With PolyNetwork, we are linking disparate and heterogeneous platforms to build a global cross-chain platform with the aim of realizing blockchain’s potential while overcoming its challenges — together. Moving forward, I encourage all interested projects and companies to join us in building the foundation for&nbsp;NGI.”</p><p>Ji concluded, “Cross-chain interoperability is becoming increasingly important as we focus on moving away from a siloed way of working. Ontology is committed to fostering an open and transparent blockchain ecosystem and we are proud to partner with Neo and Switcheo to deliver true cross-blockchain interoperability. We look forward to playing our part through this groundbreaking alliance.”</p><p>For more information on Poly Network and how to join, visit <a href="https://www.poly.network/">https://www.poly.network/</a></p><p>About Poly&nbsp;Network</p><p><a href="https://www.poly.network/">PolyNetwork</a> is built to implement interoperability between multiple chains in order to build the next generation internet infrastructure.

  <p>In most cities in China, citizens and visitors must download Health Code — an app that indicates COVID-19 status — to access many public and private spaces and services. A green screen means the person is free to travel, yellow indicates required quarantine and red means a confirmed infection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies is a unique Hype Cycle that distills more than 1,700 unique technologies</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In India, the Aarogya Setu app indicates which travelers are “safe” to use rail and air travel. The United Arab Emirates recently launched ALHOSN UAE, which also indicates via color if a person is okay, infected or need to be quarantined, but also has an option for “hasn’t been tested.” ALHOSN UAE is currently being used to grant access to air travel.</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="36598"]</p>
<p>All of these apps, called health passports, are examples of a pandemic/epidemic response technology and one of the new additions to the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle#:~:text=Gartner%20Hype%20Cycle%20methodology%20gives,of%20your%20specific%20business%20goals.">Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 2020</a>. The sheer populations in India and China using health passports pushed this technology to a 5% to 20% market penetration, an unprecedented number for a technology just entering the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/hype-cycle">Hype Cycle.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;“This Hype Cycle highlights technologies that will significantly affect business, society and people over the next five to 10 years,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/26081/Brian-Burke">Brian Burke</a>, Research VP, Gartner. “It includes technologies that enable a composable enterprise, aspire to regain society’s trust in technology and alter the state of your brain.”</p>
<p>The Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies is a unique Hype Cycle that distills more than 1,700 unique technologies into a list of must-know technologies and trends. This year’s list highlights five unique trends:</p>
 
 
<p>Composite architectures</p>
 
 
<p>Algorithmic trust</p>
 
 
<p>Beyond silicon</p>
 
 
<p>Formative artificial intelligence (AI)</p>
 
 
<p>Digital me</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://images-cdn.newscred.com/Zz1lNWZiNWRjMmRlNWIxMWVhYjFjMjBlNjhjZDJlOWEzMw=="></a></p>
 Trend No. 1: Composite architectures 
<p>In the face of rapid changes and decentralization, organizations need to shift to more agile, responsive architectures. A composite architecture is made up of packaged business capabilities built on a flexible data fabric. This allows the enterprise to respond to rapidly changing business needs.</p>
<p>For example, a “composable enterprise” supported by a composite architecture offers increased business resilience. This modular design enables organizations to “recompose” when needed, like during a global pandemic or economic recession. The composable enterprise has four core principles: Modularity, efficiency, continuous improvement and adaptive innovation. Although many organizations apply these principles in a piecemeal fashion, a composable enterprise applies all four across all parts of its organization — from business models to how employees work.</p>
<p>This modular business model enables organizations to move from rigid, traditional planning to active agility. Composable enterprise thinking creates more innovation, reduced costs and better partnerships.</p>
<p>Other technologies under this trend include packaged business capabilities, data fabric, private 5G and embedded AI.</p>
 Trend No. 2: Algorithmic trust 
<p>Increased amounts of consumer data exposure, fake news and videos, and biased AI, have caused organizations to shift from trusting central authorities (government registrars, clearing houses) to trusting algorithms. Algorithmic trust models ensure the privacy and security of data, provenance of assets, and the identities of people and things.</p>
<p>For example, "authenticated provenance" is a way to authenticate assets on the blockchain and ensure they’re not fake or counterfeit. While blockchain can be used to authenticate goods, it can only track the information that it is given.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-blockchain/">The CIO's Guide to Blockchain&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>To adequately track assets, they must be tracked from their source. For example, if a counterfeit item is added to the blockchain as a genuine version, the blockchain will continue to verify its authenticity based on the bad original data input. Due to the nature of the immutable ledger, it can never be modified or deleted.</p>
<p>Gartner believes increased interest in <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-reality-of-blockchain/">blockchain </a>will create increased digital authentication and verification options.</p>
<p>Other technologies in the algorithmic trust trend include differential privacy, responsible AI and explainable AI.</p>
 Trend No. 3: Beyond silicon 
<p>Moore’s Law predicts that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit would double every two years, but technology is quickly reaching the physical limits of silicon. This has led to the evolution of new advanced materials with enhanced capabilities designed to support smaller, faster technologies.</p>
<p>For example, "DNA computing and storage" use DNA and biochemistry in place of silicon or quantum architectures to perform computation or store data. The data is encoded into synthetic DNA strands for storage and enzymes provide the processing capabilities through chemical reactions.</p>
<p>Despite two successful prototypes, the technology is currently rudimentary and expensive with significant technical barriers to mainstream use. However, the impact of a successful DNA computing and storage option would transform data storage, processing parallelism and computing efficiency.</p>
<p>Other technologies in this trend include biodegradable sensors and carbon-based transistors.</p>
 Trend No. 4: Formative AI 
<p>Formative<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-artificial-intelligence/"> AI </a>is a type of AI capable of dynamically changing to respond to a situation. There are a variety of types, ranging from AI that can dynamically adapt over time to technologies that can generate novel models to solve specific problems.</p>
<p>For example, generative AI is a type of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-prevent-ai-dangers-with-ethical-ai/">AI</a> that can create new novel content (images, video etc.) or alter existing content. The new artifacts are similar to, but not exactly the same as, the original. This technology is responsible for deep fakes content, which can cause serious disinformation and reputational risk, and is expected to increase in numbers over the next five years. However, less nefarious uses like drug discovery and synthetic data generation — and even AI-generated artwork — are also increasing in popularity.</p>
<p>Other technologies in this trend include composite AI, differential privacy, small data and self-supervising learning.</p>
 Trend No. 5: Digital me 
<p>From health passports to digital twins, as technology integrates with people, there are more opportunities to create digital versions of ourselves. These digital models represent humans in both the real and virtual worlds.</p>
<p>For example, bidirectional brain-machine interfaces (BMIs), are brain-altering wearables that enable two-way communication between a human brain and a computer or machine interface. BMIs can be either wearables or implants that monitor EEGs (electrical activity in the brain) and individuals’ mental states. The difference between regular monitoring BMIs and bidirectional BMI is that the latter can use electrostimulation to modify the mental state of the person.</p>
<p>In the business world, potential applications include <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-security-areas-to-focus-on-during-covid-19/">authentication</a>, access and payment, immersive analytics and exoskeletons. But other applications, which have their own social and ethical concerns, might include using stimulation to boost alertness in a fatigued employee or changing the mood of an irritable teacher by applying currents to the brain. While there are many potential use cases, BMIs also introduce an additional avenue of vulnerability for would-be attackers to exploit.</p>

  Possibly the best method of securing an administration panel today is to use a decentralized identity platform for authentication. Let's see how it's done.

<p>As far as tech industry standards go, it has been a slow burn <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html">finding out exactly how</a> 130 Verified Twitter Accounts, and thousands of unverified accounts, came to suddenly begin promoting fake charities or Bitcoin giveaways last month. Piece by piece security experts have gleaned information directly from hackers, found tidbits on the dark web, and learned more from Twitter - the company has been updating their <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html">blog post</a> about the incident almost every day since it was first posted on July 18, 2020.</p><p>However, this type of hack can happen to any company that has an administration panel or dashboard for their app that’s protected by a username and password. Even taking the time and effort to fully integrate back end systems, enable two-factor authentication, and take other precautionary measures can still lead to a similar breach thanks to clever social engineering tricks and hacks that have become increasingly common. </p><p>One way to really lock down your administration panel, possibly the best method as of today, is to use a decentralized identity platform for authentication. For example, faking a BloomID is almost impossible -- only one BloomID can be created using an email address, it’s secured by a private key that cannot be duplicated or spoofed, and accessing the accompanying Bloom app requires physical access to someone’s iOS or Android device, or taking full control of their Apple ID or Google account and restoring everything to a new device, which would cause multiple emails and alarms to go off for the affected party. Your Apple ID has been used to sign in to a new device! Your Google account has a new device associated with it! It’s kind of hard to ignore, and the most security conscious of us have locked down our wireless carrier and Apple/Google accounts, leaving only the usernames and passwords we use left to secure, or rather abandon passwords entirely, which is a movement already <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">supported</a> across all the most popular platforms but not implemented widely. </p><p>So how do you lock down your administration panel, ensuring your God Mode or Super Admin mode is only accessed by those who are truly authorized to have it? Let’s dive in.</p> Server Side <p>We’re not going to use anything like Verify Kit this time, there’s no need. All we want to do is ensure that the person trying to access the administration panel has the appropriate rights, and that can be correlated by the email address they share via Bloom’s mobile app to an existing database that contains role-based access control permissions and rights. </p><p>We will assume you have a back end that can handle some JavaScript in the form of an Express-based app, or that can be passed a payload from an Express library. This is largely true for many administration apps since JavaScript is so flexible.</p> Let’s Use Bloom Starter for Auth <p>There are two parts to the Bloom Starter app; the server-side (Express) and client-side (React).</p><p>Getting Started</p><p>First we’re going to start the Express server, start ngrok to proxy the Express server so that the mobile app can POST share-kit data to the url, and then start the React app. </p><p>Follow these steps to make it happen:</p>  Run <code>git clone https://github.com/hellobloom/bloom-starter.git</code>  And then <code>cd bloom-starter/bloom-starter-auth</code>  Then run <code>npm run deps</code> (this installs any dependencies for both the server and client)  Before starting up the dev server, you will need a .env file with these variables set:     <code>PORT</code>  <code>NODE_ENV</code>, and   <code>SESSION_SECRET</code>   <p>Please see the .env.sample file in the repository for an example of where your .env should be located, and what it should look like. There’s no need to go in blind. </p><p>And finally run <code>npm run dev</code>.</p><p>If all went well, and the <code>REACT_APP_SERVER_URL</code> env var is set to the ngrok url, then we can move on to the client.</p> Time for the Client Setup <p>Share Kit is the front end library needed to generate a data sharing request. </p><p>Since the administration app is a web app, we can continue leveraging the same Bloom Starter repository. </p><p>For this demonstration, we don’t need much. The only Verifiable Credential we’re going to use is <code>email</code>, which we can tie back to our existing database to ensure it’s someone that should have access to the admin panel.</p><p>You can use the <a href="https://bloom.co/docs/share-kit/demo">Share Kit demo</a> to generate the code needed to place the QR code on the login page. For the DatingApp administration panel login, we end up with:</p> <code>import React from 'react'
import {RequestElement, Action} from '@bloomprotocol/share-kit-react'

const requestData = {
  action: Action.attestation,
  token: 'e1b865a6-7eb6-4347-9a03-e1e6342ef85e',
  org_name: 'DatingApp Admin',
  url: 'https://receive-kit.datingapp.co/api/receive',
  org_logo_url: 'https://datingapp.co/images/DatingApp-Logo.png',
  org_usage_policy_url: 'https://datingapp.co/legal/terms',
  org_privacy_policy_url: 'https://datingapp.co/legal/privacy',
  types: ['email']
}

const MyComponent: React.SFC = props =&gt; (
  &lt;RequestElement
    requestData={requestData}
    buttonCallbackUrl="https://datingapp.co/admin?token=e1b865a6-7eb6-4347-9a03-e1e6342ef85e"
    qrOptions={{
      size: 256,
      hideLogo: false,
      fgColor: '#16325b'
    }}
  /&gt;
)
</code> 
<p>That token above is unique to your app. It is not a token provided by Bloom. You choose your own token as a unique identifier for your app, allowing you to distinguish data sharing requests from multiple sources. This also ensures you are receiving data from your app, and not someone else’s.</p><p>Also note that the <code>Action</code> in this request, unlike others, is <code>Action.authentication</code>. This ensures that Verify Kit knows that... </p><p>Once we have placed that on the login view, it should render like this:</p>DatingApp Admin Portal Login Page with Bloom QR Code Embedded<p>After scanning the QR code using Bloom's mobile app, this is what you would see:</p>The Data Sharing Request someone trying to log in to the adminstration panel will see.<p>Completing the ‘Slide to Share’ action will share the data with your Verify Kit instance, allowing you to ingest the data and verify it against your database. Assuming it’s successful, you can let the user in to the admin panel!</p><p>Your employees can use Bloom’s mobile app to log in to your administration panel instead of using a username and password. </p><p>To really beef up the security here, and ensure it is the same person with the same device (or a new device where they have restored a backup) each time, you could also ask for the following Verifiable Credentials:</p>  <code>phone</code>  <code>email</code>  <code>linkedin</code>  <code>full-name</code>  <code>birth-date</code>  <code>sanction-screen</code>  <code>pep-screen</code>  <p>Of course we don’t want to recommend you intrude into your staff’s personal lives, but you must consider the sensitivity of the data and the power the administration app they are accessing grants them. This is also all data you likely know about your employees already, and therefore you can verify the data received via Bloom.</p><p>This is just one of the many use cases where you can use Bloom’s open source technology to enhance trust and security within your own internal platforms while maintaining data security. Verify the data provided, delete it from your Verify Kit service, and allow your compliance and security teams to rest assured they have taken a concrete step towards better internal controls.</p> More Resources:   <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/bloom-starter">Bloom Starter GitHub Repository</a>  <a href="https://bloom.co/docs/share-kit/overview">Share Kit Documentation</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/share-kit#TAttestationTypeNames">Share Kit Attestation Types</a>  <a href="https://bloom.co/docs/verify-kit/overview">Verify Kit Documentation</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/verify-kit">Verify Kit GitHub Repository</a>    Bloom: Your Data, Your Credit, Your Privacy <p>At Bloom, we are giving you the tools to take back control of your data all in one simple app. No more centralized data storage.

<p>Nothing felt strange when former president Barack Obama began his speech about the importance of taking a critical look at what we see on the internet. That is until he started making some, shall we say, uncharacteristic statements. The now-famous deepfake was one of the first of its kind to go viral, showing both how easy it is to be fooled and the dangers of not looking more closely.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“This is a dangerous time, moving forward we need to be more vigilant with what we trust from the internet. It’s a time we need to rely on trusted news sources,” </p>– Peele through Obama</blockquote>



 

 



<p>The word <a href="https://medium.com/@songda/a-short-history-of-deepfakes-604ac7be6016">deepfake was coined by a Reddit user back in 2017</a> and is a portmanteau of the words deep learning and fake. Today, it is a blanket term for artificial intelligence (AI) powered face swapping, i.e. when one person is replaced by another in a photo or video footage. On Reddit it began as a way to make fake adult videos of famous celebrities, and while that “trend” continues, deepfakes have become a way to create and disseminate misinformation and fake news. Peele’s decision to use Obama illustrates just how easy it is to manipulate politicians’ words, which is particularly worrisome as the 2020 election approaches. And while some can be fun to watch, like Bill Hader transforming into<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWrhRBb-1Ig"> Tom Cruise</a> or<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPhUhypV27w"> Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, they all come with a warning bell.&nbsp;</p>



 How’d They Do That? 



<p>Deep learning is an AI technique that uses huge data sets to create standard models and formats. Inspired by artificial neural networks, a function of the biological brain, it is considered to be the breakthrough within the field of AI. By leveraging neural network powered AI and machine learning, images and video footage can be fed into an algorithm that creates a “mask” which can be used to replace or manipulate original faces or and voices by using lookalike data. The algorithms train themselves to improve over time. If Peele hadn’t appeared in the video next to Obama, the manipulation would have been difficult for many humans to even detect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Much of the software involved in creating deepfakes is open-sourced like Google’s TensorFlow or uses widely available tools like Adobe’s After Effects. That doesn’t mean it’s easy, however. Peele’s skilled production team spent 56 hours to create the one-minute Obama video.</p>



 What Does This Mean for KYC?&nbsp; 



<p>The rise and advancement of deepfakes does pose a threat in that many organizations have found themselves wondering if these techniques could be used to create false identities not easily detectable within their onboarding processes. For sophisticated KYC and verification tools like <a href="https://authenteq.com/">Authenteq’s</a>, however, deepfakes can be thwarted at several entry points.</p>



<p>Authenticating one’s identity within a fully automated, robust KYC solution means that a person has to scan and upload a copy of their government-issued ID. The next step is to take a selfie and using facial recognition technology, the customer’s identity can only be verified once the biometrics of the selfie match those of the photo ID. The liveness check done with the real-time selfie also determines whether the customer is a real person, and so anything pre-recorded or played through a screen wouldn’t pass. Biometric authentication that doesn’t include a liveness check is only doing half the job as far as KYC efforts go.</p>



<p>Once verified within Authenteq’s system, spot ID checks can also be implemented if suspicious behavior is detected. If the identity does match the ID used in the onboarding process, the account could be flagged or even deactivated.</p>



<p>There has also been a series of legislation introduced to help tackle this problem. In 2019, the<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3230"> DEEPFAKES Accountability Act</a> was introduced in the House of Representatives, and California passed<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20902884/california-deepfake-political-ban-election-2020"> legislation</a> making it illegal to produce deepfakes of politicians. In the United Kingdom, producers of deepfakes can be<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/what-is-deep-fake-pornography-and-is-it-illegal-in-the-uk_uk_5bf4197ce4b0376c9e68f8c5?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAANO465UhdTIOSqTKHRjw0X8c-MSstQyicQRLFRn2icdH1SuNC7u3R-zoqNfcARCzR-WeClmyXYgxvjChZ3zayJqECu8v_8LA3r5rdDhaz_-c5a3Sz2Y5oZkxi43chLqjGphrH5i9EUIiBHhEE13RXZkNQXCRBa01XfrK4OZomQWJ"> prosecuted</a> for harassment.</p>



 Looking Ahead 



<p>Much of the very warranted concern over deepfakes revolves around prominent public figures like politicians and celebrities, but what about the average consumer or businesses? Identity theft and fraud are a growing concern for people in every country and business in every sector. Like all technology, we can’t predict with any certainty what will be possible with deepfakes in the coming years but when it comes to identity verification, one thing is certain. As deepfake technology gets more sophisticated, so too will our KYC and identity verification tools.<br></p>

 MYKEY and IRISnet Established a Strategic Partnership <p>MYKEY has established a strategic partnership with IRISnet. MYKEY’s technologies, including the cutting-edge Smart Wallet and digital identity, and also MYKEY’s ecosystem is brought to IRISnet’s internet of blockchains, further facilitating the construction of next generation distributed applications and application blockchains. Meanwhile, IRISnet will also provide MYKEY cross-chain services through their practical and reliable cross-chain technologies, not only protecting the security of users’ private data but also enabling users to easily experience smooth and convenient blockchain applications like DeFi. MYKEY and IRISnet will continue to innovate through close collaboration, and jointly contribute to the prosperity and development of the blockchain ecosystem.</p><p>The two parties will carry out in-depth collaboration in many aspects such as technical support and market development:</p> Digital identity: <p>MYKEY will provide industry-leading digital identity and Smart Wallet solutions and technology in this collaboration. At the same time, IRISnet plans to bring KEYID products and technology into the IRISnet and Cosmos ecosystems through developing on-chain distributed identity(DID) modules to further protect user data and privacy in the cross-chain ecosystem.</p><blockquote>MYKEY’s founder, Gulu, expresses that “ IRISnet is the first self-evolutionary BPoS network built with Cosmos SDK. MYKEY is happy to collaborate with IRISnet and has the opportunity to expand our technical products to IRISnet and Cosmos network ecosystem, address customer concerns about losing their accounts, and provide data security support.&nbsp;”</blockquote> Cross-chain services: <p>IRISnet will provide cross-chain services for MYKEY Smart Wallet and other products: through IRISnet’s interchain service hub, MYKEY network will be able to connect to blockchains supported by IRISnet, and jointly provide end-users with smooth and convenient cross-chain DeFi and asset management experience.</p><blockquote>Harriet Cao, the co-founder of IRISnet, remarks that “as a multi-chain smart wallet, MYKEY lowered the barrier for users to experience the digital life, and on the other hand, the cross-chain capability of IRISnet lowered the entrance barrier for service providers and consumers. I believe that, through in-depth collaborations with MYKEY and taking advantage of our strengths, cross-chain service experiences and private data and asset management will be greatly facilitated, pushing forward the practical and pervasive applications of blockchains.”</blockquote> About MYKEY <p>MYKEY (<a href="http://mykey.org">mykey.org</a>) is a smart wallet implemented on multiple public blockchains. It is dedicated to providing foundational infrastructure for the large-scale implementation of blockchains. Through cryptocurrency storage, trading, wealth management, gaming, and community, MYKEY constructs a one-stop digital life platform for its users. On MYKEY, users can gain free accounts as well as resources for internet usage. Users are also able to freeze and restore accounts when private keys get lost. MYKEY is also a building block of Web of Trust. Furthermore, in the context of Web 3.0, MYKEY turns data ownership back to users, protecting user privacy from the ground&nbsp;up.</p> About IRISnet <p>IRIS Network (a.k.a.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/tolbert">John Tolbert</a></p><p>NIST, the US National Institute for Standards and Technology, recently released <a href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-207.pdf" title="Zero Trust Architecture">SP 800-207 Zero Trust Architecture</a>. The NIST special publication examines the principles of and motivations for ZTA, as well as implementation considerations, security concerns, and suggestions for improvements to architecture. NIST SPs are authored primarily for consumption by other US government agencies. In practice, however, their documents often become de facto standards and guidelines used more broadly in industry. In this post I’ll review the strengths of the SP and identify areas for improvement.</p>
<p>The NIST document serves as a good introduction for ZTA. The authors correctly describe the fundamental principles of ZTA, which are a combination of traditional security tenets of Least Privilege and Defense-in-Depth. In practice, Least Privilege means only granting sufficient permissions to accomplish specific actions and not more than that; Defense-in-Depth means inserting layers and gates of security at all relevant control points in a use case. Wide open networks behind firewalls are easy targets. These ideas have become more commonly accepted in modern security architectures, as organizations realize that firewalls and other perimeter-based designs are porous and not sufficient for protecting against proliferating threats.</p>
<p>We have often heard about “Zero Trust Networking” at trade shows and conferences. SP 800-207 does a good job of explaining that ZTA is not limited to networks. In fact, ZTA must transcend network-layer thinking in order to be successful. ZTA requires proper authentication and authorization for each session involving users, applications, networks (including clouds), and data. Other key components of ZTA are continuous risk-adaptive authentication and dynamic policy evaluation.</p>
<p>SP 800-207 references OASIS XACML 2.0 architecture, including Policy Administration Points (PAPs), Policy Decision Points (PDPs), and Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs). The document should have referenced the updated <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/xacml-3.0-core-spec-os-en.html" title="XACML 3.0">XACML 3.0</a>, which contains the elements of Obligations and Advice that can be used in ZTA scenarios where risk-adaptive authentication and authorization may be required by policies. There are also rule and policy combining algorithm optimizations in v. 3 that fit better with the description of Trust Algorithms in the NIST SP (p. 17).</p>
<p>SP 800-207 defines conceptual components that go beyond the standard XACML PAP/PDP/PEP reference architecture. In my view, the breakdown of PDP into Policy Engine and Policy Administrator doesn’t add value and can create confusion. The XACML 3.0 reference architecture is still valid today, and is used in authorization and access control solutions even where explicit support for the XACML language is missing.</p>
<p>The illustration and definition of contributing components in Figure 2 (p. 9), namely CDM System, Industry Compliance, Activity Logs, SIEM System, etc. adhere to other US federal program definitions, but do not exactly match common usage. For example, Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigations (CDM) roughly translate to asset, vulnerability, and configuration management. Industry Compliance is not a set of functions localized to one product or platform. Activity logs are consumed by SIEM, SOAR, and forensics tools. Some extrapolation and normalization of terminology and illustration may make this section applicable outside the US government.</p>
<p>SP 800-207 claims that threat intelligence “is the only component that will most likely be under the control of a service rather than the enterprise” (p. 19). Such a view discounts the prevalence and use of Identity-as-a-Service (IDaaS) and other kinds of 3rd-party services, including discrete authentication services, and fraud risk services. At KuppingerCole, expect to see more usage and development of additional modular functional services that can enhance the ZTA authentication and authorization experiences for enterprises, covering all permutations of user-device-app-data interactions.</p>
<p>Section 4 of the new doc addresses use cases and deployment scenarios:</p>
 
 Enterprises with satellite offices (includes teleworkers) 
 Multi-cloud/cloud-to-cloud enterprises 
 Contractors and non-employee access 
 Cross domain collaboration 
 Public and/or consumer facing organizations 
 
<p>There are some variations to these use cases that could use additional detail, such as more about remote workforces and cloud-native enterprises. Section 4 is good starting point for planning how to migrate to ZTA.</p>
<p>Most discussions of ZTA tend to highlight the security advantages, of which there are several. Section 5 of SP 800-207 provides a list of possible threats specific to ZTA that industry needs to consider and begin mitigating against. Of special note here are DoS attacks on PDPs, the need for full enterprise monitoring (not just endpoint or network), and potential weaknesses in proprietary/non-standard APIs.</p>
<p>SP 800-207 also lists the use of non-person entities in ZTA administration as a possible threat. It is true that innovative IAM and IGA solutions increasingly employ non-person agents/processes to reduce the workload on human admins. For example, machine learning algorithms can be used to:</p>
 
 assign roles and permissions to users at on-boarding based on attributes and entitlements that their peers have 
 perform User Behavioral Analysis (UBA) and provide confidence scores per session 
 analyze device intelligence to determine if the sources of access requests are originating from authorized locations, properly patched, free of malware, etc. 
 process the output of UBA, device intel, and other types of threat intelligence to generate risk scores per session. 
 
<p>It is possible that ML detection models can be manipulated (or gamed) to produce both false positives and negatives, and these outcomes can then be exploited by malicious actors. Even though these types of attacks require sophistication, such attacks have migrated from the theoretical to the real world. Vendors and implementers must take knowledge of these scenarios into consideration when performing threat modeling.</p>
<p>NIST correctly surmises the need for standardization in ZTA, especially in the areas of APIs. Most identity and security products expose APIs for other applications to use, therefore securing these APIs must be a top priority. The proprietary nature of APIs is itself a source of security concern.</p>
<p>In summary, NIST SP 800-207 is a good primer on ZTA which includes some high-level, practical design advice. The authors clearly state that there is no single ZTA solution, and that the road to fully instrumented ZTA is a long one.</p>

<p>Micronaut is a new framework for developing JVM applications, including APIs and microservices. It uses ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation to compute the information that your application needs before runtime, removing the need for reflection. The result is a significant decrease in runtime overhead and startup time, and a substantial increase in application throughput. Micronaut is a direct competitor to Spring Boot from the folks that invented Grails. Its design and runtime efficiency make it ideal for deployment in modern, resource-constrained environments (like serverless).</p>
 
 
<p>JHipster is a full-stack development platform for generating, developing, and deploying modern web applications and microservice architectures. Its first version used AngularJS for the frontend; its latest version uses Angular 10. JHipster traditionally only had a Spring Boot backend implementation. However, other backend implementations have recently been added, including Micronaut!</p>
 
 
<p>JHipster has a concept called blueprints. Blueprints allow you to override default behavior in its application generator. Popular JHipster blueprints include <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-vuejs">Vue.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-kotlin">Kotlin</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Today, I’d like to show you how to use the new and shiny <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-micronaut">Micronaut blueprint for JHipster</a>. It supports Micronaut 2.0 and deploying to Heroku, plus adding Okta in one command. I figured it’d make for an excellent blog post!</p>

 <a>Discover more about Micronaut and JHipster</a> 
 
 
 
 Build a Micronaut app with JHipster 
 
 
<p>JHipster has its own domain language called JDL (JHipster Domain Language). JDL can be used to describe an app, entities, relationships between entities, and even deployments. In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to build a simple app that allows you to record space launches and add images to the event. It will look similar to NASA’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/launchschedule/">Launches and Landings</a>.</p>
 
 
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p><a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/">Java 11</a>+</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node 12</a>+</p>
 
 
<p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker</a></p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Install JHipster and the Micronaut blueprint using npm:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm i -g generator-jhipster@6.10.1 generator-jhipster-micronaut@0.3.8</code> 
 
 
 
 
 
 Design a Micronaut data model with JHipster’s JDL 
 
 
<p>JHipster has defaults for all of its options. You can create a new app using the <code>jhipster</code> command—hold down the enter key when prompted with choices, and your app will be created with the defaults. <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/">JDL</a> allows you to create an application definition where you only override the defaults. For example, you could create an app with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for authentication using the following JDL:</p>
 
 
 
 application {
  config {
    baseName rockets
    authenticationType oauth2
  }
} 
 
 
 
<p>Create a new directory called <code>spacefan</code>. Add an <code>app.jdl</code> file to it and populate it with the following code.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 application { (1)
  config {
    baseName space
    applicationType monolith
    authenticationType oauth2
    packageName org.jhipster.space
    prodDatabaseType postgresql
    testFrameworks [protractor]
  }
  entities *
}

(2)
entity SpaceEvent {
  name String required
  date LocalDate required
  description TextBlob required
  photo ImageBlob required
  type SpaceEventType required
}

entity Mission {
  name String required
  description String
}

enum SpaceEventType {
  LAUNCH,
  LANDING
}

(3)
relationship OneToOne {
  SpaceEvent{mission(name)} to Mission
}

(4)
paginate SpaceEvent with infinite-scroll
paginate Mission with pagination 
 
 
 
 
 
<p>The app definition overrides the name, authentication type, production database, and test frameworks.</p>
 
 
<p>Entity definitions with validation rules.</p>
 
 
<p>Relationships between entities.</p>
 
 
<p>Pagination rules can be defined for each entity.</p>
 
 
 
 
 
 






You can find additional JDL samples on GitHub in the <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/jdl-samples">jdl-samples repository</a>.



 
 
 
 
 Generate a Micronaut app with Angular 
 
 
<p>Open a terminal and navigate to the <code>spacefan</code> directory you created. Run the following command to create an Angular app with a Micronaut backend.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mhipster import-jdl app.jdl</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This process will create a plethora of files for your application and run <code>npm install</code>. When it’s finished, you’ll need to start Keycloak.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d</code> 
 
 
 






If you’re an Oh My Zsh fan, you can install the <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/oh-my-zsh/">Oh My Zsh JHipster plugin</a> and just type <code>jhkeycloakup</code>.



 
 
<p>Keycloak is the default OIDC engine that’s used by JHipster, and you can run it in a Docker container. In your project’s <code>src/main/docker</code> folder, there’s a Docker Compose file for Keycloak, as well as default users, realms, and applications. Keycloak imports these on startup.</p>
 
 
 What about React and Vue.js? 
 
<p>You might have noticed I didn’t specify a client framework. I didn’t need to because Angular is the default. If you want to use React instead, you simply need to add a <code>clientFramework react</code> line to the application definition in your JDL. For example:</p>
 
 
 
 application {
  config {
    baseName space
    applicationType monolith
    authenticationType oauth2
    clientFramework react
    packageName org.jhipster.space
    prodDatabaseType postgresql
    testFrameworks [protractor]
  }
  entities *
} 
 
 
 






You can see all the default options in <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/jdl/applications#available-application-configuration-options">JHipster’s documentation</a>.



 
 
<p>If you want to use Vue.js instead of React, it’s a little more complicated. The Micronaut blueprint modifies Angular and React templates. These modifications will likely be needed for Vue as well. Since Vue will be integrated into JHipster in v7.0, it’s probably best to wait until it’s released before you try Micronaut and Vue.</p>
 
 
<p>If you really want to try Vue with Micronaut, you can. You might need to modify the Vue files to work with Micronaut after you generate your project.</p>
 
 
<p>First, you’ll need to install the Vue.js blueprint:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm install -g generator-jhipster-vuejs</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then you’ll need to import the JDL and specify both Micronaut and Vue.js as blueprints.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>jhipster import-jdl app.jdl --blueprints micronaut,vuejs</code> 
 
 
 
 
 Confirm Authentication with Keycloak works 
 
<p>With Keycloak up and running, you should be able to log in. Start your app using Maven:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw</code> 
 
 
 
<p>When it finishes launching, go to <code><a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a></code> in your favorite browser and click the sign in link.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Your app will redirect you to Keycloak to log in. Use <code>admin/admin</code> to log in as an administrator.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You can browse through the Administration section by clicking on the Administration menu.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>Go to Entities &gt; Space Events to add new events and missions.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 






You might notice how both space events and missions have existing data. This is from <a href="https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/">Faker.js</a> and <a href="https://www.liquibase.org/">Liquibase</a>. Liquibase is used to create your database tables, and Faker.js is used to create fake data in development. If you want to turn off fake data, you can open <code>src/main/resources/application-dev.yml</code> and search for <code>faker</code>. Remove it from the list of active profiles for Liquibase.



 
 
 
 <code>liquibase:
  datasources:
    default:
      async: true
      change-log: classpath:config/liquibase/master.xml
      contexts: dev</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Since you chose Protractor for testing, you can ensure all the client code works by running the following command in a second terminal window. (Your JHipster app should still be running in the first.)</p>
 
 
 
 <code>npm run e2e</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You should see a message saying that all tests have passed.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>14 passing (34s)</code> 
 
 
 






The pauses for alerts when running end-to-end tests is a <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/11766">known issue</a>.



 
 
 
 
 
 Prepare Micronaut for production 
 
 
<p>JHipster ships with profiles for development and production. In development, everything is designed to be fast for the developer. In production, everything should be quick for your users. When you build your app with the <code>prod</code> profile enabled, Micronaut is optimized with less logging and PostgreSQL. On the client side, scripts are optimized, CSS is minimized, and HTML is streamlined.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Deploy Micronaut to Heroku 
 
 
<p>Since JHipster has production optimizations built in, you’re ready to deploy your app to Heroku!</p>
 
 
<p>To begin, you must install the <a href="https://cli.heroku.com/">Heroku CLI</a>, and have created a Heroku account. You will need to verify your Heroku account with a credit card as a security measure. JHipster won’t add any add-ons that cost money, but Heroku requires a credit card on file to provision some add-ons.</p>
 
 
<p>Stop your app. Then, run the following command:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>mhipster heroku</code> 
 
 
 
<p>When prompted for type of deployment, choose Git. Use 11 for the Java version and select Yes to provision the Okta add-on. Enter your email for the JHipster Admin user and an initial password. When prompted to overwrite <code>pom.xml</code>, type <code>a</code> to overwrite it.</p>
 
 
<p>This process can take a while to complete. When I tried it, it took seven minutes.</p>
 
 
<p>When the deployment process finishes, open your favorite browser to the URL in your console or run <code>heroku open</code>.</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You should be able to log in using the email and password you provided. Okta will prompt you to change your password and set a security question (for password recovery).</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>You can also deploy your JHipster app as a Docker container! In <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/06/17/angular-docker-spring-boot#heroku-spring-boot-docker">Angular + Docker with a Big Hug from Spring Boot</a>, I showed you how to deploy Spring Boot to Heroku as a container. I also showed how you can deploy that same image to Knative on Google Cloud and Cloud Foundry. Once you have a JHipster + Micronaut image built, you can use those same instructions to deploy to those platforms.</p>
 
 
<p>In the next section, I’ll show how to deploy your container to Heroku.</p>
 
 
 
 
 Micronaut + Docker on Heroku 
 
 
<p>JHipster uses <a href="https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib">Jib</a> to build Docker images for your application. Run the following command to create a Docker image.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>./mvnw -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can test it out locally using Docker Compose.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml down
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up</code> 
 
 
 






 
<p>To make Keycloak work, you need to add the following line to your hosts file (<code>/etc/hosts</code> on Mac/Linux, <code>c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts</code> on Windows).</p>
 
 
 
 <code>127.0.0.1	keycloak</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This is because you will access your application with a browser on your machine (which is named localhost, or <code>127.0.0.1</code>), but inside Docker, it will run in its own container, which is named <code>keycloak</code>.</p>
 



 
 
<p>Once you’ve confirmed everything works, create a new app on Heroku, and add it as a remote.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>heroku apps:create
git remote add docker https://git.heroku.com/&lt;your-new-app&gt;.git</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then run the commands below to deploy your Micronaut app as a Docker image. Be sure to replace the <code>&lt;…​&gt;</code> placeholders with your Heroku app name. If you don’t know your app name, run <code>heroku apps</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>heroku container:login
docker tag space registry.heroku.com/&lt;heroku-app&gt;/web
docker push registry.heroku.com/&lt;heroku-app&gt;/web</code> 
 
 
 
<p>For example, I used:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>heroku container:login
docker tag space registry.heroku.com/infinite-crag-99454/web
docker push registry.heroku.com/infinite-crag-99454/web</code> 
 
 
 
<p>At this point, you can use the PostgreSQL and Okta add-ons you’ve already configured. Run the following command to get the identifiers of the add-ons from the <code>heroku</code> remote that you first deployed to.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>heroku addons --remote heroku</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then you can attach these instances to your new application.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>heroku addons:attach &lt;postgresql-addon-name&gt; --remote docker
heroku addons:attach &lt;okta-addon-name&gt; --remote docker</code> 
 
 
 
<p>When you use <code>mhipster heroku</code> to deploy your application, it properly configures the database for you. However, when deploying it as a Docker container, none of that happens. Therefore, you need to set a few configuration variables so your Docker container can talk to PostgreSQL. First, run the following command to get the PostgreSQL URL.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>heroku config:get DATABASE_URL --remote docker</code> 
 
 
 
<p>This command will retrieve a value with the following syntax:</p>
 
 
 
 <code>postgres://username:password@address</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Then, set the database environment variables to match the keys that are in <code>application-heroku.yml</code>.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>heroku config:set JDBC_DATABASE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://&lt;address&gt; --remote docker
heroku config:set JDBC_DATABASE_USERNAME=&lt;username&gt; --remote docker
heroku config:set JDBC_DATABASE_PASSWORD=&lt;password&gt; --remote docker</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Set the max amount of Java memory to use and specify the Micronaut environments.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>heroku config:set JAVA_OPTS=-Xmx128m --remote docker
heroku config:set MICRONAUT_ENVIRONMENTS=prod,heroku --remote docker
heroku config:set MICRONAUT_ENV_DEDUCTION=false --remote docker</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Now you should be able to release your container and start the app.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>heroku container:release web --remote docker</code> 
 
 
 
<p>You can watch the logs to see if your container started successfully.</p>
 
 
 
 <code>heroku logs --tail --remote docker</code> 
 
 
 
<p>Now you should be able to open your app, click the sign in link, and authenticate!</p>
 
 
 
 <code>heroku open --remote docker</code> 
 
 
 
<p>If you test your Dockerized Angular + Micronaut app on <a href="https://securityheaders.com">securityheaders.com</a>, you’ll see it scores an A!</p>
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>If you want to log in to this app, you’ll need to add login and logout redirect URIs to your Okta Web app. To access it, open <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com">dashboard.heroku.com</a> in a private window. Log in and go to $docker-app-name &gt; Resources &gt; okta. After you’re redirected to Okta, you should see your developer dashboard. If you don’t, log out of Okta and try again. Then, go to Applications &gt; Web &gt; General &gt; Edit.</p>
 
 
<p>For example, I added the following to mine:</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>Login redirect URI: <code>https://infinite-crag-99454.herokuapp.com/oauth2/callback/oidc</code></p>
 
 
<p>Logout redirect URI: <code>https://infinite-crag-99454.herokuapp.com/logout</code></p>
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
<p>If you make save these changes and try to log in to your app again, you’ll likely receive an error message:</p>
 
 
 
 Internal Server Error: Unable to sync user with idp. 
 
 
 
<p>This happens when you try to log in with the super admin that the Okta add-on creates. Try logging in using a private window and it should work as expected.</p>
 
 
<p>Deploying a Micronaut app to Heroku in a Docker container is a little more difficult because JHipster doesn’t configure PostgreSQL and Okta for you. However, setting a few environment variables is all you need to get things up and running.</p>

					 <p>We’re continuing our COVID-19 blog series interviews with Leah Houston, MD. Leah is an emergency doctor that has practiced medicine across the United States for nearly 10 years. She is currently working on an identity project around physician and later patient identities using <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We asked Leah to share her thoughts on how SSI can not only play a role in the medical industry but also impact the world during COVID-19. Check out the interview below!</p>

					 <p>The project is called <a href="https://hpec.io">HPEC</a>. HPEC stands for humanitarian, physicians, empowerment, community. For those of you who’ve been involved in the identity discussion, you understand that it’s all about community, and it’s about connecting with others. Your identity is used to interact.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We as physicians have to constantly interact with each other in order to coordinate care for patients. But right now, there’s no way for us to do that in a streamlined way. As with every other form of digital communication, the process is centralized. So if you’re working in a hospital, you only are able to communicate with doctors in that hospital. If you work for an insurance network, you’re only able to send patients to other doctors in that insurance network if you want the patient’s care to be covered. HPEC decentralizes all of that and allows everyone to interact with each other regardless of policy, practice, location, or specialty, so doctors can get their patients the best care.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 How does HPEC use SSI? 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>When we document things as physicians, we’re really recording what happened in the patient encounter, so we can call upon the information in the future when needed. If the patient comes back in six months, we can look at the records and answer questions such as: Why did we give that medication, or what surgery did they have and when? But documenting the interaction is also important when communicating with other medical professionals. If I’m sending my private practice patient to an orthopedic surgeon, I want to be able to send the surgeon the patient’s relevant medical history.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, physicians record their documentation on electronic health records (EHRs). And similar to any digital documentation, especially over the internet, we have the same problem where physicians have to choose one EHR, and then the information is all trapped there. The EHRs don’t talk to each other, and there’s no standards for interoperability. So there’s a lot of friction with being able to share that information among physicians and with patients being able to access that information.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Because of that we are building a self-sovereign identity solution for the practicing physician, so they can log in, document, and share this information in a streamlined and standardized way.</p>

					 <p>Something happened to me that made me really wake up to this problem and then this potential solution—a hospital that I was previously working for stole my identity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They were using my professional brand, NPI numbers, and license numbers to bill under my name when I wasn’t even in that hospital anymore. That kind of turned on a light bulb. I had learned about identity (self-sovereign identity was very, very early in that stage), but I had read about identity solutions around voting and around resource allocation, especially in emerging economies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I realized that SSI would have not only prevented what happened to me but could be used to alleviate a lot of the friction in our current healthcare system.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 In the healthcare industry, what are the COVID-19 related use cases where SSI and verifiable credentials would be most helpful? 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Self-sovereign identity brings privacy, security, and trust to the individual, without the individual having to reveal all of their identifying information. When it comes to COVID-19 and safety in businesses (especially in healthcare facilities like nursing homes), there might be some rules that employers create or that governments start mandating where you might need to have a recent negative COVID-19 test in order to go to work or enter the facility. But do you really need to show a piece of paper that contains a lot of personal information such as your name, phone number, and other lab tests you did that day? No. SSI makes it so you don’t have to.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
					
				 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 What do you think it will take for the healthcare industry to begin adopting SSI as a viable solution to combat the risks of COVID-19 in the use cases you mentioned above? 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Well, unfortunately as with everything else, show me the money. It has to demonstrate that it’s going to save money somewhere. If I am not allowed to go to work unless I prove that I’ve had a recent COVID-19 test, and I don’t have a solution for that, then that hits me in my wallet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But if there’s an app that I can easily download, store my negative COVID-19 test result in it as a verifiable credential, and be able to show that to my employer, then we have a solution. So it’s going to have to be public, private partnerships and individuals who demand to use it. Those individuals may be CEOs of companies who want to get people back to work or they may be the individuals who want to be able to go back to work, board an airplane, go on a cruise, go to the movies, or send their children back to school.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a bit of a leap when it comes to understanding how SSI is a solution, which I think is also somewhat of a barrier, but I think these kinds of conversations are going to help open that up.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 What advice would you give to physicians and other healthcare professionals who would like to learn about SSI but don't know where to start? 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>What people really need are developers who can build these platforms and make them user friendly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But if people want to just learn about SSI in general and understand what it means, <a href="https://ssimeetup.org/">SSI Meetup</a> has a lot of really good webinars on SSI. The people who’ve been doing this for a long time—Drummond Reed, Kaliyah Young, Christopher Allen, Kim Hamilton Duffy—these individuals have written a lot on the topic. The information and leadership is out there. It just takes a little time to understand it.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Is there anything else that you would like to add to this interview?

<p>Renaissance 2.0 will boost the development of Ontology’s DeFi ecosystem</p><p>Decentralized finance, better known as “DeFi”, has become a buzzword in the cryptocurrency industry in recent weeks. According to <a href="https://defipulse.com/">Defi Pulse</a>, the total value locked in the DeFi sector hit an all-time high of $5.21 billion as of August 14,&nbsp;2020.</p><p>Many developers have already been exchanging ideas and developing DeFi dApps in Ontology’s ecosystem. In the coming months, a range of new decentralized finance applications will be launched, as DeFi capabilities expand to reach more mainstream audiences.</p><p>In order to encourage pioneering DeFi developers to build on the Ontology blockchain, we’ve updated our Ontology dApp Incentive Plan to the new “Renaissance 2.0”, with the aim of boosting the DeFi ecosystem on the Ontology network. The Ontology Foundation will give the plan a 3-month trial period — from August 15th, 2020 to October 15th,&nbsp;2020.</p><p>A summary of the DeFi-exclusive Renaissance 2.0 plan is as&nbsp;follows:</p><p>1. Active DeFi transaction fee rebate. 100% of all transaction fees (ONG) generated by dApps listed in the Top 10 Ontology dApps on <a href="https://dappradar.com/search/ontology">DappRadar</a> on <a href="https://dapp.review/">Dappreview</a> will be returned to developers.</p><p>2. Developers can get DOUBLE the transaction fees returned if they integrate and use ONT ID in their&nbsp;dApp.</p><p>3. High performing developers will be provided with technical, marketing, and operations support from the Ontology&nbsp;team.</p><p>Following evaluation processes, accepted applications will receive coaching from experts to help chosen dApps with marketing and development.</p> Example <p>John and his team developed a DeFi dApp on the Ontology blockchain that utilizes ONT ID. They submitted their dApp to DappRadar and it became very popular, rising into the Top 10 Ontology dApps&nbsp;list.</p><p>With the new Renaissance 2.0 plan, John and his team will&nbsp;receive</p>  200% of all transaction fees (ONG) generated by the dApp. That&nbsp;is,  <blockquote>1) 100% of all transaction fees (ONG) generated by the dApp for being a DeFi&nbsp;dApp.</blockquote><blockquote>2) Another 100% of all transaction fees as a reward for integrating and using ONT ID in the&nbsp;dApp</blockquote>  Technical support and guidance on protocols, SDK, coding support, and auditing of smart contracts.  Marketing support on all Ontology’s social media platforms and 29 communities, as well as event planning (such as an AMA in Ontology’s community telegram groups), graphic designs, news releases and proofreading, real-time community maintenance, and feedback.  <p>Don’t miss out! The earlier you apply, the earlier you can start to earn rewards. The application review normally takes around 1 to 2 business&nbsp;days.</p> How to&nbsp;apply? <p>Develop a DeFi dApp on the Ontology blockchain first and then submit your dApp to either <a href="https://dappradar.com/submit-dapp">DappRadar</a> or <a href="https://dapp.review/login?next=/dapp/submit">DappReview</a>. The Ontology team will check the dApp ranking and announce the rewards distribution status on Twitter on the last week of each&nbsp;month.</p><p>Are you a developer?

 Ontology Completes DID Smart Contract Development on Ethereum to Boost the Decentralized Identity Ecosystem <p>This week, Ontology successfully completed the development of the next stage of its open-source DID smart contract on the Ethereum network, significantly expanding the purview of the platform’s decentralized identity ecosystem. Having defined the DID specification, submitted the required W3C registration, and concluded the DID smart contract development, Ontology’s bespoke Decentralized Identity Solutions now boast even greater chain interoperability and heightened technological capabilities.</p><p>The announcement means that Ontology’s Decentralized Identity Solutions, defined in this instance by the addition of a new smart contract method <a href="https://github.com/ontology-tech/DID-solidity/tree/etho-did">did:etho:</a>, can now be used not only across the expansive Ethereum network, including a range of popular DeFi applications, but also most chains that run EVM virtual machines. Ontology aims to make its Decentralized Identity solutions available across any chain, as part of its ongoing effort to achieve full cross-chain functionality.</p><p>LI JUN, Founder of Ontology, said, “In line with Ontology’s defined objective to transform key processes pertaining to the management of individuals’ data, we are delighted to build on the significant progress that has been made with respect to our ever-expanding decentralized identity ecosystem. Successfully completing the open-source decentralized identifier smart contract development on the caliber of Ethereum is another milestone in what has been an incredibly successful Q3 for our platform.”<br> <br>This completion is the latest in a string of high-profile announcements for the company that specializes in digital identity and data. It follows the recent launch of ‘Ontology Mercury’, a trusted, Decentralized Identifier (DID) based peer-to-peer communication framework; the official release of Ontology’s new Decentralized Identity Solutions, designed to help crypto holders and traders manage and exchange digital assets in a more secure and streamlined manner; and a recent collaboration with NEAR Protocol, Elrond Network, and Waves Platform among others to advance the development of secure decentralized identity solutions.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-completes-did-smart-contract-development-on-ethereum-to-boost-the-decentralized-identity-c7a4564febc3">Ontology Completes DID Smart Contract Development on Ethereum to Boost the Decentralized Identity…</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>Privileged Access Management (PAM) software comes in many forms. Some are heavy with software components (the thick client model) while others are leaner (the thin client model). Since we at SSH.COM are firm believers in the thin client model, I wanted to present five solid reasons why this is the case.</p>
<p></p>
 1. No constant cycle of installing, patching and configuring agents 
<p>Thick clients require that you have to install agents on the client - and usually on the server as well. Moreover, you need to ensure that those agents are always up-to-date, patched and compatible with the operating system, and installed on every client necessary.</p>
<p>That’s not only a lot of steps but it’s a process that often requires the help of specialist staff which increases costs. On top of that, when access is no longer valid, you should ensure that the agent is actually removed from the client.</p>
<p>With a thin client, there is no need to install, remove or patch any agents at any point. We prefer a model where access is granted, managed and revoked using a standard browser - the only ‘software agent’ you need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Less complexity means easier endpoint security management 
<p>Every piece of software component added to the environment adds complexity to the mix. The installation and configuration needs easily add up when people join the company, switch roles and leave. This is particularly true for 3rd parties whose access needs are often temporary.</p>
<p>Moreover, PAM solutions grant primarily admin-level access. Installing a required PAM agent requires (local) admin rights which in turn are often under the control of other solutions since they are privileged accounts.</p>
<p>Client installations might also require application black or whitelisting – which adds yet another management layer to the equation. In some cases, you might need to give local admin rights to 3rd parties to get them onboarded which might not always be a good idea or even against corporate policies.</p>
<p>All in all, having privileged software agents on clients adds up to surprisingly complex endpoint security management.</p>
<p>With a thin client model, you simply skip the PAM agent installation phase which saves a lot of time, effort and money and makes access management leaner. It also means that you can have an identical installation image for all clients intended for privileged users, and you can manage software and hardware upgrades, security policies, application changes virtually and remotely using that same image.</p>
<p>You can also ensure that the clients have only the bare minimum setup for the required tasks, so there is nothing to steal if the client is compromised.</p>
<p>Last but not least, this model reduces the number of misconfigurations. Since privileged users or 3rd parties don’t need to – and can’t - install anything to use the client, unauthorized software installations or installing viruses becomes unlikely.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Standard, plugin-free browser for minimized management 
<p>There are access management tools that work using browsers but require plugins for privileged user access to work. This is just points 1 and 2 wrapped inside a browser: are all the plugins up-to-date, who maintains them, who has the rights to install them, are they always compatible with the latest browser versions, is the browser set up correctly per client…</p>
<p>We believe in an approach where your standard browser is your only access management tool that you need to update. The official browser releases are always rigorously tested, and patches are fast and automatic which is not often the case with plugins or other software components. Once again, this model is straightforward and minimizes the number of configurations and reduces complexity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Thin in bloat, rich in features and usability 
<p>This point is almost ideological: many widely used applications – IT or otherwise - exist in the cloud and are based on thin clients, like Citrix Virtual Apps, Office 365 or Netflix just to name a few. With thin client PAM software, your developers get the same, consistent and secure experience across clients and your admins manage all access through a single pane of glass. Thin can be very rich in features: the features simply exist behind a clean looking UI.</p>
<p>This model is also very fast for onboarding: the developer just logs in to the centralized authority through a UI without anyone having to configure anything on the client. Switching clients becomes effortless. The number of access ticket requests is significantly smaller and training needs are radically reduced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. Respect your environment, minimize all changes 
<p>If you are not familiar with the concept of immutable infrastructure, here’s a small breakdown of the idea. Once you have a particular environment set up and servers deployed, you don’t make any run-time changes to it. If you change something, you decommission the entire environment and spin up an entirely new instance instead. The benefit is more consistency, predictability and reliability in your infrastructure.</p>
<p>Again, thin is key. Don’t install anything on the client or the server for that matter. When granting privileged access, you don’t even need to create any one-time passwords or temporary accounts on the server side either. All these processes require constant run-time changes and add unwanted complexity and unnecessary processes. We are suggesting that privileged access can be granted without permanent credentials with what we call <a href="https://www.ssh.com/iam/ephemeral_access/">ephemeral certificates</a>, in a <a href="https://blog.ssh.com/zoom-and-who-data-breaches-prove-need-passwordless-it-solution">passwordless</a> fashion and without making any kind of changes to your environment.</p>
<p>This might sound radical and we are fine with that reaction. Not all PAMs need to be the same: we built ours with a strong focus in the future which is mostly multi-cloud and hybrid driven. The fact that our solution, PrivX, is based on just-in-time authentication without a need for any type of permanent credentials for privileged users was just one of the reasons KuppingerCole credited us with one of the Overall Product Leaders in their <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/lc80088/privileged-access-management/">Leadership Compass 2020: Privileged Access Management</a>, as evidenced by the following quote.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s an innovative approach but one that does bring functional and security advantages – access is faster, onboarding and offboarding of privileged users is quick and there are no passwords to issue or lose, since there are no permanent leave-behind credentials”</p>

  <p>The CEO of a startup gaming company is in the middle of developing its next big hit for gamers. Between ensuring the product is perfect for release, examining the workflow of the business and keeping employees engaged, the amount of to-dos and questions quickly becomes overwhelming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CEO makes the decision to build an advisory board for the company. As a first step, they identify and record all the gaps in the business, as well as specific questions that have come up in recent meetings that need unbiased answers. But the success of the company depends on choosing the right people to answer those questions and give advice on the gaps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Building an effective board means CEOs must be open to accepting coaching and guidance</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While advisory boards are not mandatory within an organization, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/technology-ceos-create-valuable-buyer-urgency-for-shorter-sales-cycles/">tech CEOs </a>can benefit greatly from the presence of a board, as each member can offer insights, ideas and strategic advice outside of the CEO’s expertise. For startups, establishing an advisory board can play a pivotal role in their corporate development.</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="36547"]</p>
 Understand the business needs 
<p>CEOs often begin the search for advisory board members prior to understanding the needs of the organization and the critical matters the board will be looking to solve. As a first step, tech CEOs need to identify goals and a clear path to accomplishing those goals. This in turn will offer insight into the type of individuals and skills needed on the board. Think about areas of the business that need improvement and find the gaps in knowledge, skill and experience.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-must-haves-in-the-ceo-chro-culture-conversation/">3 Must-Haves in the CEO-CHRO Culture Conversation</a></p>
 Welcome challenges 
<p>Although advisory board members are chosen by the CEO, they lack the legal liability and corporate power for decision making and strategic direction of the organization. Because of this, individuals are often selected based on relationships, a tech CEO’s network or on specific expertise, likely making them more hesitant to offer a counterargument to the CEO.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that building an effective board means CEOs must be open to accepting coaching and guidance, welcome challenging thoughts, and be willing to allow outsiders to help structure and build their organization.</p>
 Know what good looks like 
<p>The advisory board should consist of executives who have an interest in the company and are willing to contribute time to its development. Review backgrounds and experience to identify the skills that each individual has to offer. CEOs should keep the number of members small enough to make the group manageable, but large enough to get the talent needed. The larger the advisory board, the more attention and resources it will require.</p>
<p>Each advisor should be able to offer some of these attributes:</p>
 
 Industry knowledge 
 Customer contacts 
 Access to capital 
 Access to potential management team members and advisors 
 Partnership contracts 
 M&amp;A experience 
 General management experience 
 
 Avoid conflicts 
<p>CEOs will want to determine any conflicts of interest early on and have necessary agreements in place, including nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) and conflict of interest agreements, as advisors will have access to confidential business plans, intellectual property and the organization’s overall strategy.</p>
<p>To prevent conflicts in positions, a set term limit and mandatory performance reviews should be put in place. This will also enable the board to remain fluid as the business needs of the organization change and new skills and experience are required.</p>
 Don’t rush the process 
<p>While it’s important to staff the board as soon as possible, it’s not necessary to choose the entire board at once. Begin with one or two strong candidates and fill each seat as you find the right individuals.</p>
 Motivate your members&nbsp; 
<p>Lastly, advisors should be incentivized via correct compensation when possible, through equity, cash or other expenses, to ensure members stay engaged. When deciding on compensation, take into account a prospect’s potential role, current position, strengths and what they bring to the table overall.</p>
<p>CEOs who prepare their company properly for the existence of an advisory board will set it up to play a key role in dealing with many issues, including finance, sales, marketing, expansion, production, funding and infrastructure. Ultimately, an effective advisory board can assist in many aspects of running a business, help lead strategic changes and actively contribute to the organization’s success.</p>

  <p>Spring Cloud Gateway is the Reactive API Gateway of the Spring Ecosystem, built on Spring Boot, WebFlux, and Project Reactor. Its job is to proxy and route requests to services and to provide cross-cutting concerns such as security, monitoring, and resilience. As Reactive models gain popularity, there is a chance that your microservices architecture becomes a mix of Spring MVC blocking applications and Spring WebFlux non-blocking applications.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, you will use Spring Cloud Gateway for routing to traditional Servlet API microservices, and you will learn the required configuration for these three common OAuth2 patterns, using Okta as authorization server:</p>

 
   OpenID Connect Authentication - the pattern used for end-user authentication. 
   Token Relay - when an OAuth2 consumer service or application, like the API gateway, acts as a client and forwards the incoming token to outgoing resource requests. 
   Client Credentials Grant - the pattern to use when the authorized requestor is another service. In this case, we talk about machine to machine, m2m, or service to service authorization.

 Pattern 1: OpenID Connect Authentication 

<p>OpenID Connect defines a mechanism for End-User authentication based on the OAuth2 authorization code flow. In this pattern, the Authorization Server returns an Authorization Code to the application, which can then exchange it for an ID Token and an Access Token directly. The Authorization Server authenticates the application with a ClientId and ClientSecret before the exchange happens. As you can see in the diagram below, OpenID and OAuth2 patterns make extensive use of HTTP redirections, some of which have been omitted for clarity.</p>

<p></p>

<p>For testing this OAuth2 pattern, create the API Gateway with service discovery.
First, create a base folder for all the projects:</p>

   <code>mkdir oauth2-patterns
cd oauth2-patterns
</code>   

 Create a Eureka Discovery Service 

<p>With <a href="https://start.spring.io/">Spring Initializr</a>, create an Eureka server:</p>

   <code>curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip -d dependencies=cloud-eureka-server \
-d groupId=com.okta.developer \
-d artifactId=discovery-service  \
-d name="Eureka Service" \
-d description="Discovery service" \
-d packageName=com.okta.developer.discovery \
-d javaVersion=11 \
-o eureka.zip
</code>   

<p>Unzip the file:</p>

   <code>unzip eureka.zip -d eureka
cd eureka
</code>   
<p>As described in <a href="https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/spring-cloud-netflix.adoc#jdk-11-support">Spring Cloud Netflix documentation</a>, the JAXB modules, which the Eureka server depends upon, were removed in JDK 11. If you are running Eureka server with JDK 11, edit the <code>pom.xml</code> and add the following dependency:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.glassfish.jaxb&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;jaxb-runtime&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Edit <code>EurekaServiceApplication</code> to add <code>@EnableEurekaServer</code> annotation:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.discovery;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.eureka.server.EnableEurekaServer;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaServer
public class EurekaServiceApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(EurekaServiceApplication.class, args);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Rename <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to <code>application.yml</code> and add the following content:</p>

   <code>server:
  port: 8761

eureka:
  instance:
    hostname: localhost
  client:
    registerWithEureka: false
    fetchRegistry: false
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: http://${eureka.instance.hostname}:${server.port}/eureka/
</code>   

<p>Start the service:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8761</code> and you should see the Eureka home.</p>

 Create a Spring Cloud Gateway Application 

<p>Now let’s create an API Gateway with Spring Cloud Gateway, using Spring Initializr again.</p>

   <code>curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip \
-d dependencies=cloud-eureka,cloud-gateway,webflux,okta,cloud-security,thymeleaf \
-d groupId=com.okta.developer \
-d artifactId=api-gateway  \
-d name="Spring Cloud Gateway Application" \
-d description="Demo project of a Spring Cloud Gateway application and OAuth flows" \
-d packageName=com.okta.developer.gateway \
-d javaVersion=11 \
-o api-gateway.zip
</code>   
<p>Unzip the project:</p>

   <code>unzip api-gateway.zip -d api-gateway
cd api-gateway
</code>   
<p>Edit <code>SpringCloudGatewayApplication</code> to add <code>@EnableEurekaClient</code> annotation.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.gateway;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.eureka.EnableEurekaClient;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaClient
public class SpringCloudGatewayApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SpringCloudGatewayApplication.class, args);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add a package <code>controller</code> and the controller class <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/gateway/controller/GreetingController.java</code>. The controller will allow us to test the login without having configured any routes yet.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.gateway.controller;

import org.springframework.security.core.annotation.AuthenticationPrincipal;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.OAuth2AuthorizedClient;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.annotation.RegisteredOAuth2AuthorizedClient;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.core.oidc.user.OidcUser;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.ui.Model;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestMapping;

@Controller
public class GreetingController {

    @RequestMapping("/greeting")
    public String greeting(@AuthenticationPrincipal OidcUser oidcUser, Model model,
                           @RegisteredOAuth2AuthorizedClient("okta") OAuth2AuthorizedClient client) {
        model.addAttribute("username", oidcUser.getEmail());
        model.addAttribute("idToken", oidcUser.getIdToken());
        model.addAttribute("accessToken", client.getAccessToken());

        return "greeting";
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add a greeting template <code>src/main/resources/templates/greeting.html</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
&lt;html xmlns:th="https://www.thymeleaf.org"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Greeting&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;p th:text="'Hello, ' + ${username} + '!'" /&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p th:text="'idToken: ' + ${idToken.tokenValue}" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p th:text="'accessToken: ' + ${accessToken.tokenValue}" /&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>Rename <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to <code>application.yml</code> and add the following properties:</p>

   <code>spring:
  application:
    name: gateway
  cloud:
    gateway:
      discovery:
        locator:
          enabled: true
logging:
  level:
    org.springframework.cloud.gateway: DEBUG
    reactor.netty: DEBUG
</code>   

<p>Add <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/gateway/OktaOAuth2WebSecurity.java</code> to make the API Gateway a resource server with login enabled:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.gateway;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.reactive.EnableWebFluxSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.web.server.ServerHttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.web.server.SecurityWebFilterChain;

@Configuration
@EnableWebFluxSecurity
public class OktaOAuth2WebSecurity {

    @Bean
    public SecurityWebFilterChain securityWebFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http) {
        http.csrf().disable()
                .authorizeExchange()
                .anyExchange()
                .authenticated()
                .and().oauth2Login()
                .and().oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();
        return http.build();
    }
}
</code>   
<p>To keep things simple in this example, <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.0.x/reference/html/csrf.html">CSRF</a> is disabled.</p>

<p>Now we need to create an authorization client in Okta. Log in to your Okta Developer account (or <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">sign up</a> if you don’t have an account).</p>

 
   From the Applications page, choose Add Application. 
   On the Create New Application page, select Web. 
   Name your app Api Gateway, add <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/okta</code> as a Login redirect URI, select Refresh Token (in addition to Authorization Code), and click Done. 
 

<p>Copy the issuer (found under API &gt; Authorization Servers), client ID, and client secret.</p>

<p>Start the gateway with:</p>
   <code>OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER={yourOktaIssuer} \
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID={yourOktaClientId} \
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET={yourOktaClientSecret} \
./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8080/greeting</code>. The gateway will redirect to Okta login page:</p>

<p></p>

<p>After the login, the idToken and accessToken will be displayed in the browser.</p>

   <code>idToken: eyJraWQiOiIw...

accessToken: eyJraWQiOi...
</code>   

 Pattern 2: Token Relay to Service 

<p>A Token Relay happens when an OAuth2 consumer, for example the API Gateway, acts as a Client and forwards the accessToken to the routed service.</p>

<p></p>

 Create a REST API Service 

<p>Let’s create a shopping cart service.</p>

   <code>curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip -d dependencies=web,data-jpa,h2,cloud-eureka,okta,security,lombok \
-d groupId=com.okta.developer \
-d artifactId=cart-service  \
-d name="Cart Service" \
-d description="Demo cart microservice" \
-d packageName=com.okta.developer.cartservice \
-d javaVersion=11 \
-o cart-service.zip
</code>   
<p>Unzip the file:</p>

   <code>unzip cart-service.zip -d cart-service
cd cart-service
</code>   

<p>Edit <code>pom.xml</code> and add <a href="https://github.com/zalando/jackson-datatype-money">Jackson Datatype Money</a> dependency. For this tutorial, we will use <a href="https://javamoney.github.io/ri.html">JavaMoney</a> for currency.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.zalando&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;jackson-datatype-money&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.1.1&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Before creating the entities for the service, add a <code>MonetaryAmountConverter</code> for mapping the <code>MonetaryAmount</code> type to the database. The conversion to and from BigDecimal for persistence allows using the built-in Hibernate BigDecimal to JDBC numeric mapping.
Add <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/cartservice/model/MonetaryAmountConverter.java</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice.model;

import javax.money.CurrencyUnit;
import javax.money.Monetary;
import javax.money.MonetaryAmount;
import javax.persistence.AttributeConverter;
import java.math.BigDecimal;

public class MonetaryAmountConverter implements AttributeConverter&lt;MonetaryAmount, BigDecimal&gt; {

    private final CurrencyUnit USD = Monetary.getCurrency("USD");

    @Override
    public BigDecimal convertToDatabaseColumn(MonetaryAmount monetaryAmount) {
        if (monetaryAmount == null){
            return null;
        }
        return monetaryAmount.getNumber().numberValue(BigDecimal.class);
    }

    @Override
    public MonetaryAmount convertToEntityAttribute(BigDecimal bigDecimal) {
        if (bigDecimal == null){
            return null;

                .create();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Create the <code>Cart</code> and <code>LineItem</code> model classes under <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/cartservice/model</code> package:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice.model;

</code>   

<p>Add a <code>CartRepository</code> under <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/cartservice/repository/CartRepository.java</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice.repository;

import com.okta.developer.cartservice.model.Cart;
import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;

public interface CartRepository extends CrudRepository&lt;Cart, Integer&gt; {
}
</code>   

<p>Create the <code>CartNotFoundException</code> under <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/cartservice/controller/CartNotFoundException.java</code> for mapping the API 404 in the <code>CartController</code> we will create after:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice.controller;

    public Cart getCart(@PathVariable Integer id){
        return repository.findById(id).orElseThrow(() -&gt; new CartNotFoundException("Cart not found:" + id));
    }

    @PostMapping("/cart")
    public Cart saveCart(@RequestBody  Cart cart){

        Cart saved = repository.save(cart);
        return saved;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Configure the Jackson Money Datatype module. Add a <code>WebConfig</code> class under <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/cartservice</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.config.annotation.WebMvcConfigurer;
import org.zalando.jackson.datatype.money.MoneyModule;

@Configuration
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {

    @Bean
    public MoneyModule moneyModule(){
        return new MoneyModule().withDefaultFormatting();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Edit <code>CartServiceApplication</code> and add <code>@EnableEurekaClient</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.eureka.EnableEurekaClient;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaClient
public class CartServiceApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(CartServiceApplication.class, args);
    }

}
</code>   
<p>Rename <code>src/main/resources/application.propeties</code> to <code>application.yml</code> and add the following values:</p>

   <code>server:
  port: 8081

spring:
  application:
    name: cart

okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: {yourOktaIssuer}
    audience: api://default
</code>   

<p>Start the <code>cart-service</code>:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

 Route the REST API Through Spring Cloud Gateway 

<p>Go to the <code>api-gateway</code> project and add a route for the cart service, edit <code>SpringCloudGatewayApplication</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.gateway;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.gateway.route.RouteLocator;
import org.springframework.cloud.gateway.route.builder.RouteLocatorBuilder;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.eureka.EnableEurekaClient;
import org.springframework.cloud.security.oauth2.gateway.TokenRelayGatewayFilterFactory;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaClient
public class SpringCloudGatewayApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SpringCloudGatewayApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Bean
    public RouteLocator routeLocator(RouteLocatorBuilder builder, TokenRelayGatewayFilterFactory filterFactory) {
        return builder.routes()
                .route("cart", r -&gt; r.path("/cart/**")
                        .filters(f -&gt; f.filter(filterFactory.apply()))
                        .uri("lb://cart"))
                .build();
    }
}
</code>   

<p><code>TokenRelayGatewayFilterFactory</code> will find the accessToken from the registered OAuth2 client and include it in the outbound cart request.</p>

<p>Restart the gateway with:</p>
   <code>OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER={yourOktaIssuer} \
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID={clientId} \
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET={clientSecret} \
./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Go to <code>http://localhost:8080/greeting</code> and copy the accessToken. Then use the accessToken to make requests to the cart API through the gateway.</p>

   <code>export ACCESS_TOKEN={accessToken}

# Add an item to the cart
curl \
  -d '{"customerId": "uijoon@example.com", "lineItems": [{ "productName": "jeans", "quantity": 1}]}' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  http://localhost:8080/cart

# Return the contents of the cart
curl \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  http://localhost:8080/cart/1
</code>   

 Pattern 3: Service-to-Service Client Credentials Grant 

<p>In this authorization pattern, the application requests an access token using only its own client credentials. This flow is suitable for machine-to-machine (M2M) or service-to-service authorizations.</p>

<p></p>

 Create a Micro Service 

<p>For service-to-service authorization, create a <code>pricing</code> Spring Boot service with Spring Initializr:</p>

   <code>curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip -d dependencies=web,cloud-eureka,okta,security,lombok \
-d groupId=com.okta.developer \
-d artifactId=pricing-service  \
-d name="Pricing Service" \
-d description="Demo pricing microservice" \
-d packageName=com.okta.developer.pricing \
-d javaVersion=11 \
-o pricing-service.zip
</code>   
<p>Unzip the file:</p>

   <code>unzip pricing-service.zip -d pricing-service
cd pricing-service
</code>   

<p>Edit <code>pom.xml</code> and add Jackson Datatype Money dependency again.</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.zalando&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;jackson-datatype-money&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.1.1&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Create the <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/pricing/model/Cart.java</code> and <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/pricing/model/LineItem.java</code> model classes:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.pricing.model;

import lombok.Data;
import javax.money.MonetaryAmount;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

@Data
public class Cart {

    private Integer id;
    private String customerId;
    private List&lt;LineItem&gt; lineItems = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    private MonetaryAmount total;

    public void addLineItem(LineItem lineItem){
        this.lineItems.add(lineItem);
    }
}
</code>   

   <code>package com.okta.developer.pricing.model;

import lombok.Data;
import javax.money.MonetaryAmount;

@Data
public class LineItem {

    private Integer id;
    private Integer quantity;
    private MonetaryAmount price;
    private String productName;

    public LineItem(){
    }

    public LineItem(Integer id, Integer quantity) {
        this.id = id;
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Create the <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/pricing/service/PricingService.java</code> interface and a <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/pricing/service/DefaultPricingService</code> implementation to calculate prices for the <code>LineItem</code>.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.pricing.service;

import com.okta.developer.pricing.model.Cart;

public interface PricingService {

    Cart price(Cart cart);
}
</code>   

   <code>package com.okta.developer.pricing.service;

import com.okta.developer.pricing.model.Cart;
import com.okta.developer.pricing.model.LineItem;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import javax.money.CurrencyUnit;
import javax.money.Monetary;
import javax.money.MonetaryAmount;
import java.math.BigDecimal;
import java.math.RoundingMode;

@Service
public class DefaultPricingService implements PricingService {

    private final CurrencyUnit USD = Monetary.getCurrency("USD");

    @Override
    public Cart price(Cart cart) {

        MonetaryAmount total = Monetary.getDefaultAmountFactory()
                .setCurrency(USD)
                .setNumber(0)
                .create();

        for (LineItem li : cart.getLineItems()) {
            BigDecimal bigDecimal = new BigDecimal(Math.random() * 100)
                    .setScale(2, RoundingMode.HALF_UP);

            MonetaryAmount amount = Monetary.getDefaultAmountFactory()
                    .setCurrency(USD)
                    .setNumber(bigDecimal)
                    .create();
            li.setPrice(amount);
            total = total.add(amount.multiply(li.getQuantity()));
        }

        cart.setTotal(total);
        return cart;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Create a <code>PricingController</code> to handle the pricing request. Add the class  <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/pricing/controller/PricingController.java</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.pricing.controller;

import com.okta.developer.pricing.model.Cart;
import com.okta.developer.pricing.service.PricingService;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestBody;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class PricingController {

    @Autowired
    private PricingService pricingService;

    @PostMapping("/pricing/price")
    public Cart price(@RequestBody Cart cart){

        Cart priced = pricingService.price(cart);
        return priced;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Configure the Jackson Money Module in a <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/pricing/WebConfig.java</code> class:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.pricing;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.web.servlet.config.annotation.WebMvcConfigurer;

@Configuration
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {

    @Bean
    public MoneyModule moneyModule(){
        return new MoneyModule().withDefaultFormatting();
    }
}
</code>   

 Secure the Micro Service using OAuth 2.0 Scopes 

<p>Protect the pricing endpoint by requiring a custom scope <code>pricing</code> in the accessToken. One way to do it is with <code>HttpSecurity</code> configuration. Add a <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/pricing/WebSecurity.java</code> class with the following:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.pricing;

import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configurers.oauth2.server.resource.OAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer;

@EnableWebSecurity
public class WebSecurity extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
                .authorizeRequests(authorizeRequests -&gt; authorizeRequests
                        .mvcMatchers("/pricing/**").hasAuthority("SCOPE_pricing")
                        .anyRequest().authenticated()
                )
                .oauth2ResourceServer(OAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer::jwt);
    }
}

</code>   

<p>Add <code>@EnableEurekaClient</code> to <code>PricingServiceApplication</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.pricing;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.cloud.netflix.eureka.EnableEurekaClient;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaClient
public class PricingServiceApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(PricingServiceApplication.class, args);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Rename <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> to <code>application.yml</code> and add the following:</p>

   <code>server:
  port: 8082

spring:
  application:
    name: pricing

okta:
  oauth2:
    issuer: {yourOktaIssuer}
    audience: api://default
</code>   

<p>Start the service:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Let’s try the pricing API without an accessToken:</p>

   <code>curl -v\
  -d '{"customerId": "uijoon@mail.com", "lineItems": [{ "productName": "jeans", "quantity": 1}]}' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  http://localhost:8082/pricing/price
</code>   
<p>With the <code>-v</code> verbose flag, you should see the request is rejected with 401 (Unauthorized).</p>

 Update the REST API to Call the Micro Service 

<p>Now we are going to configure <code>cart-service</code> to use the client credentials grant flow to request pricing.</p>

<p>First create a new authorization client in Okta.</p>

 
   From the Applications page, choose Add Application 
   On the Create New Application page, select Service 
   Name your app Cart Service and click Done 
 

<p>Copy the new client ID, and client secret.</p>

<p>Create a custom scope to restrict what the <code>cart-service</code> accessToken can access. From the menu bar select API -&gt; Authorization Servers. Edit the authorization server by clicking on the edit pencil, then click Scopes -&gt; Add Scope. Fill out the name field with <code>pricing</code> and press Create.</p>

<p></p>

<p>We need to configure the OAuth2 client in the <code>cart-service</code> application, for calling the <code>pricing-service</code>. <code>OAuth2RestTemplate</code> is not available in Spring Security 5.3.x. According to Spring Security OAuth <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/wiki/OAuth-2.0-Migration-Guide">migration guides</a>, the way to do this is by using RestTemplate interceptors or WebClient exchange filter functions. Since Spring 5, <code>RestTemplate</code> is in <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.2.7.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/client/RestTemplate.html">maintenance mode</a>, using WebClient (which supports sync, async, and streaming scenarios) is the suggested approach. So let’s configure a <code>WebClient</code> for the pricing call.</p>

<p>First, add the <code>spring-webflux</code> starter dependency to the <code>cart-service</code> <code>pom.xml</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-webflux&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>IMPORTANT: Adding both <code>spring-boot-starter-web</code> and <code>spring-boot-starter-webflux</code> modules results in Spring Boot auto-configuring Spring MVC, not WebFlux. This allows Spring MVC applications to use the reactive WebClient.</p>

<p>Create <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/cartservice/WebClientConfig.java</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice;

import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.cloud.client.loadbalancer.reactive.ReactorLoadBalancerExchangeFilterFunction;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.http.codec.json.Jackson2JsonDecoder;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.registration.ClientRegistrationRepository;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.web.OAuth2AuthorizedClientRepository;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.client.web.reactive.function.client.ServletOAuth2AuthorizedClientExchangeFilterFunction;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.ExchangeStrategies;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient;

@Configuration
public class WebClientConfig {

    @Autowired
    private ReactorLoadBalancerExchangeFilterFunction lbFunction;

    @Autowired
    private ObjectMapper objectMapper;

    @Bean
    public WebClient webClient(ClientRegistrationRepository clientRegistrations,
                               OAuth2AuthorizedClientRepository auth2AuthorizedClients){

        ExchangeStrategies exchangeStrategies = ExchangeStrategies.builder()
                .codecs(configurer -&gt;
                        configurer.defaultCodecs().jackson2JsonDecoder(new Jackson2JsonDecoder(objectMapper)))
                .build();

        ServletOAuth2AuthorizedClientExchangeFilterFunction oauth2 =
                new ServletOAuth2AuthorizedClientExchangeFilterFunction(clientRegistrations, auth2AuthorizedClients);

        oauth2.setDefaultClientRegistrationId("pricing-client");

        return WebClient.builder().apply(oauth2.oauth2Configuration())
                .exchangeStrategies(exchangeStrategies)
                .filter(lbFunction).baseUrl("http://pricing/pricing/price").build();
    }
}
</code>   

<p>In the code above, we set a custom json decoder, from the <code>objectMapper</code> that includes the <code>MoneyModule</code>, so the monetary amounts are correctly serialized and deserialized. Also, we set  <code>pricing-client</code> as the default OAuth 2.0 <code>registrationId</code>. For service discovery, a <a href="https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-commons/reference/html/#webflux-with-reactive-loadbalancer"><code>ReactorLoadBalancerExchangeFilterFunction</code></a> must be added to the <code>WebClient</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s now configure the OAuth 2.0 client registration. Edit the cart-service <code>application.yml</code> and add security.oauth2 properties. The <code>cart-service</code> is a resource server and an OAuth 2.0 client at the same time. The final configuration must be:</p>

   <code>server:
  port: 8081

spring:
  application:
    name: cart
  security:
    oauth2:
      resourceserver:
        jwt:
          issuer-uri: {yourOktaIssuer}
      client:
        registration:
          pricing-client:
            provider: okta
            authorization-grant-type: client_credentials
            scope: pricing
            client-id: {clientId}
            client-secret: {clientSecret}
        provider:
          okta:
            issuer-uri: {yourOktaIssuer}
  cloud:
    loadbalancer:
      ribbon:
        enabled: false

logging:
  level:
    com.okta.developer: DEBUG
    org.springframework.web: DEBUG

</code>   
<p>Note the <code>Ribbon</code> loadbalancer has been disabled, otherwise the <code>ReactorLoadBalancer</code> auto-configuration will fail.</p>

<p>Also, note the requested scope for the client_credentials grant is <code>pricing</code>, the custom scope. Then, the accessTokens for this client will only have access to the <code>pricing-service</code>. Adding a custom scope for the client_credentials flow is a best practice.</p>

<p>Spring Boot will auto-configure the application as an OAuth2 client because of the <code>client.registration</code> presence in the YAML. Add a <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/cartservice/WebSecurity.java</code> class to override the auto-configuration, and configure the application as an OAuth 2.0 resource server:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice;

import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configurers.oauth2.server.resource.OAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer;

@Configuration
public class WebSecurity extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
                .authorizeRequests(authorize -&gt; authorize
                        .anyRequest().authenticated()
                )
                .oauth2ResourceServer(OAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer::jwt);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Create the class <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/cartservice/service/PricingException.java</code> to return <code>HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR</code> (HTTP status 500) when the cart cannot be priced due to an unexpected error.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice.service;

import org.springframework.http.HttpStatus;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.ResponseStatus;

@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)
public class PricingException extends RuntimeException {

    public PricingException(Exception e) {
        super(e);
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Add a PricingService for the pricing implementation. Create the class <code>src/main/java/com/okta/developer/cartservice/service/PricingService.java</code>:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice.service;

import com.okta.developer.cartservice.model.Cart;
import com.okta.developer.cartservice.model.LineItem;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import org.springframework.web.reactive.function.client.WebClient;
import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

@Service
public class PricingService {

    private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(PricingService.class);

    @Autowired
    private WebClient webClient;

    public Cart price(Cart cart){
        try {

            Mono&lt;Cart&gt; response = webClient
                    .post()
                    .bodyValue(cart)
                    .retrieve().bodyToMono(Cart.class);

            Cart priced = response.block();

            for (int i = 0; i &lt; priced.getLineItems().size(); i++) {
                LineItem pricedLineItem = priced.getLineItems().get(i);
                LineItem lineItem = cart.getLineItems().get(i);
                lineItem.setPrice(pricedLineItem.getPrice());
            }

            cart.setTotal(priced.getTotal());


            return cart;
        } catch (Exception e){
            logger.error("Could not price cart:", e);
            throw new PricingException(e);
        }
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Note that the ‘WebClient’ is making a synchronous call, as we invoke <code>response.block()</code> to get the pricing result. This is the expected approach for non-reactive applications.</p>

<p>Modify the <code>CartController</code> to request pricing when creating a cart:</p>

   <code>package com.okta.developer.cartservice.controller;

import com.okta.developer.cartservice.model.Cart;
import com.okta.developer.cartservice.repository.CartRepository;
import com.okta.developer.cartservice.service.PricingService;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RestController
public class CartController {

    @Autowired
    private CartRepository repository;

    @Autowired
    private PricingService pricingService;


    @GetMapping("/cart/{id}")
    public Cart getCart(@PathVariable Integer id){
        return repository.findById(id).orElseThrow(() -&gt; new CartNotFoundException("Cart not found:" + id));
    }

    @PostMapping("/cart")
    public Cart saveCart(@RequestBody  Cart cart){

        Cart priced = pricingService.price(cart);
        Cart saved = repository.save(priced);
        return saved;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Restart the cart-service:</p>

   <code>SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_PRICINGCLIENT_CLIENTID={serviceClientId} \
SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_PRICINGCLIENT_CLIENTSECRET={serviceClientSecret} \
./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

 Putting it All Together 

<p>Create a cart through the API Gateway again, make sure to have a valid accessToken from <code>http://localhost:8080/greeting</code>:</p>

   <code>export ACCESS_TOKEN={accessToken}

curl -v\
  -d '{"customerId": "uijoon@mail.com", "lineItems": [{ "productName": "jeans", "quantity": 1}]}' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${ACCESS_TOKEN}" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json' \
  http://localhost:8080/cart
</code>   

<p>You should get a priced cart as response:</p>

   <code>{
   "id":1,
   "customerId":"uijoon@example.com",
   "total":{
      "amount":86.20,
      "currency":"USD",
      "formatted":"USD86.20"
   },
   "lineItems":[
      {
         "id":2,
         "productName":"jeans",
         "quantity":1,
         "price":{
            "amount":86.20,
            "currency":"USD",
            "formatted":"USD86.20"
         }
      }
   ]
}
</code>   

<p>Take a look at the System Log in the Okta Dashboard and you will see an entry indicating the Cart Service requested an access token:</p>

 The merits of Rust for SSI and IAM software 



<p>Security is a top priority for network infrastructure, software solutions, and end-user applications that support interactions involving sensitive user data or personal information about real people and organizations.</p>



<p>Decentralized or not, any system which handles, transports, stores, or serves high value (digital) assets —&nbsp;especially solutions for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sovereign_identity">Self-sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> and Identity and Access Management (IAM) — warrants rigorous scrutiny toward any vulnerability or oversight that may infringe on a user’s rights as a data subject.</p>



<p>That’s where <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> really shines: the programming language is distinctive for its comprehensive focus on safety, security, correctness, and efficiency. All of these areas resonate extremely well with the dimensions and properties most important when developing digital identity solutions.</p>



<p>What’s more, the design of the language itself offers crucial advantages for security by effectively addressing a wide range of common, long-standing vulnerabilities affecting code written in other popular languages. To top it off, Rust provides markedly high performance, and opens up possibilities for embedded use cases.</p>



<p>It’s a promising sign, then, to see folks familiar with blockchain and other DLT technologies are showing embrace of Rust in their development work. Already at this early stage of adoption there is a sizeable array of tools and applications written in Rust that could well be implemented in IAM solutions based on SSI. This toolset nicely complements the core set of design-driven advantages for development previously mentioned.</p>



<p>Rust’s security guarantees are proving to be particularly desirable for the implementation of highly secure systems, like those used to manage user identities, access rights, and digital assets. Since SSI infrastructure must be capable of handling complex flows of value, the underlying technical infrastructure must be designed to sustain and secure that value. The distinctive features of Rust are particularly advantageous for these reasons.</p>



 Developing for SSI in Rust 



<p>As the SSI ecosystem is still maturing, only a limited number of production-ready solutions enjoy active deployment in real use cases, and even fewer are implemented in Rust.</p>



<p>That said, here are a couple ways we use Rust at Jolocom:</p>



  Certain core components of <a href="https://github.com/jolocom/wallet-rs">our open source library for SSI-based digital identity management</a> are implemented in Rust (available on GitHub). In particular, we migrated all plaintext private-key operations (e.g. signing, decryption) into Rust code in order to minimize risk posed by malicious dependency attacks in JS runtimes, as well as to provide a safe, portable, consistent, and well-understood set of crypto tools with an easy-to-use API.  



  A Rust implementation of the “KERI” Core Library — KERIOX — is well underway. <a href="https://github.com/SmithSamuelM/Papers/blob/master/whitepapers/KERI_WP_2.x.web.pdf">KERI (“Key Event Receipt Infrastructure”)</a> is an event-based Distributed Key Management Infrastructure which provides the same security and verifiability properties for transactions as a blockchain or distributed ledger, without the overhead of requiring an absolute global ordering of transactions. The system is designed to provide a secure identifier-based “trust spanning layer” for any stack. The open source project is under active development in collaboration with <a href="https://identity.foundation">DIF — the Decentralized Identity Foundation</a>, where we’ve been a member-organization <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/self-sovereign-identity-the-next-generation-of-digital-life/">since early 2018</a>.   



<p>With such tremendous potential in cross-industry collaboration, we want to help catalyze and coordinate any opportunities for mutual enrichment and growth by building up the common ground shared by Rust and SSI communities.</p>



<p>In fact, we are actively seeking an experienced software engineer with knowledge in Rust —&nbsp;here’s <a href="https://jolocom.io/hiring-rust-software-engineer/">more on the open position</a> in case you or someone you know may be interested in joining the Jolocom team!</p>



  



<p>As a 12-person, purpose-driven organization stewarding an open source project to create a common infrastructure for digital identity and rehash our society’s relationship to personal data — we at Jolocom definitely place an emphasis on community engagement as a core value. For that reason we are always looking for ways to contribute back to the people and communities which help make a positive impact on and off the Web.</p>



 That is why for this year’s <a href="https://rustconf.com">RustConf</a>, Jolocom is supporting the conference as an official sponsor! 



<p>We can’t wait to meet more of the community and explore the intersection of Rust and SSI alongside dedicated stakeholders, veterans, and enthusiasts.</p>



<p>Hope to see you on Thursday (Aug. 20) for the virtual conference.</p>



<p>Want to connect, but unable to attend next week? We’re always available to chat on <a href="https://gitter.im/jolocom/home">Gitter</a>.</p>

 Identity security is driving exceptional customer experiences 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every day when you enter your username and password into your favorite website, you’re generating data. The average customer generates an eye-watering volume of data over the course of their digital day. When someone registers for a new website or app and creates a user profile, they’re creating a new dataset that can be analyzed by a new firm. When that phenomenon multiplies across cities, countries, and continents, the amount of information being created by customers across the globe is downright staggering. But managing that data properly and adhering to regional, national, and international guidelines can be a difficult task for even the most seasoned executive. It’s an organizational risk that more companies are coming to terms with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But all that data is also an opportunity, one that allows companies to personalize their products and services and give their customers and clients incredible, engaging experiences—such as the ability to login without using a password. Personalization is key to success, but it has to happen in a way that makes data security simultaneously integral and invisible.</p>

   The Traditional Identity Journey 

<p>Over the past decade, organizations have gone through many different stages of the identity journey. Depending on the size and maturity of your organization, you are probably in one of six identity maturity categories (see diagram below). Your progress through the stages of maturity may be stalled—but not necessarily because of limited resources or for lack of trying. Your lack of progress is likely due to the limitations of your existing identity governance solution.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why? These legacy solutions fail to deliver on your <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/identity-governance">identity governance</a> requirements. Large enterprises need a model that provides visibility into who has access into what and why, eliminating manual access requests, approvals and certification rubberstamping. And, the identity model should grow dynamically as your organization changes over time.&nbsp;</p>

 Why Legacy Identity Governance Solutions are Destined to Fail&nbsp; 

<p>Legacy identity governance and administration (IGA) solutions are failing organizations today for&nbsp;several reasons:&nbsp;</p>

  Identity silos: Many IGA solutions are only integrated with a few authoritative identity sources, like Microsoft Active Directory, or your company's HR system, like Workday. The limited integrations result in poor user access visibility and a lack of consistent access visibility across the entire enterprise. As a result, you have many islands of identity sprinkled across your organization. 
	 Operational inefficiencies: IGA solutions are meant to automate access requests, approvals and certification reviews. The reality is quite different. Instead, your teams are so overwhelmed with access requests, approvals and certification reviews that they end up manually approving access requests and rubber-stamping certifications. This results in the overprovisioning of user access privileges across your entire enterprise.&nbsp; 
	 No context: While IGA solutions are good at providing visibility into a single authoritative source, they don’t provide visibility and context across multiple authoritative sources. As a result, organizations struggle to determine what users need access to, what access they have, and why that access is needed. Without universal visibility and context across the entire enterprise, your organization is blind to inappropriate user access privileges and potential unauthorized user access.&nbsp; 
	 Static data: IGA solutions provide tools—like role modeling—to help organizations achieve better operational efficiencies and compliance. While role modeling helps to better align users with the right access rights, the organizational role model rapidly becomes stale and outdated. Your organization changes dynamically every hour, every day, every week, and every month. With outdated access rights, privileges, roles and entitlements of an IGA solution, your organization is more open to security risks and potential data breaches.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 <p>These are the reasons why IT and Security teams are experiencing identity governance fatigue. They are exhausted from manually reviewing and approving access requests and rubber-stamping certifications.&nbsp;</p>

 Don’t Run Your Business with a Crystal Ball 

<p>Is this how you want to run your business? With a crystal ball that provides predictions based on limited data. Of course not! That is why you implemented an IGA solution.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Your existing IGA solution has provided you with an initial set of capabilities to manage and control the entire identity lifecycle. From a user’s birthright access to the removal of their access when they leave the organization. The point here is, access requests, access approvals, certifications and role modeling capabilities have gotten you to where you are today. You have made progress in managing and controlling user’s access. That’s the good news.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bad news is legacy IGA solutions have created a new set of barriers to your organization’s growth and future success. Existing IGA solutions have stalled your progress because they have not addressed the core problem: “How do I develop a model to solve my access problem?”&nbsp; Until that question is addressed with a solution that meets today’s challenges and acknowledges the dynamic nature of your organization, you’ll continue to be in a “holding pattern” when it comes to managing and controlling user access across the entire enterprise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Grow the Business with AI-Driven Identity Analytics&nbsp; 

<p>How do you evolve past the holding pattern?&nbsp; The answer is artificial intelligence (AI)-driven identity analytics, which address legacy IGA solution gaps.</p>

<p>Using AI and machine learning techniques to consume and analyze large data volumes, AI-driven identity analytics can detect user access patterns and inappropriate access privileges across the entire enterprise. By automating high-confidence and low-risk user access rights, your security and risk teams will have more time and resources to focus on higher priority tasks and projects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In my next blog, I’ll explain how organizations can overcome identity governance fatigue with ForgeRock <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/platform/autonomous-identity">Autonomous Identity</a>.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/small">Mike Small</a></p><p>In their race towards digital transformation, organizations are using cloud services to accelerate the development of new apps and improve efficiency. They allow new applications to be rapidly developed, existing applications to be modernized and deployed without additional capital spend. This provides important business benefits but also increases the challenges for the cloud customer to ensure cyber-security and regulatory compliance. It is in this light that the recent announcements from GCP (Google Cloud Platform) need to be understood.</p>
 
 Trust but Verify 
 
<p>Initially, cloud service users were concerned that they had no control over the way in which the services themselves were managed and secured. The major CSPs (Cloud Service Providers) now go to great lengths to secure the infrastructure of their environments and it has become clear that many of the cloud security challenges lie with the customers’ own use of these services. For example, security and compliance are often outside the skills of DevOps teams or are overlooked and this can lead to the existence of critical vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cyber adversaries.</p>
<p></p>
<p>An additional concern is the risk of government interference in the operation of the service or demands for access to the data it holds. This concern was recently rekindled with the EU <a href="https://noyb.eu/files/CJEU/judgment.pdf">Court of Justice Ruling</a> on the EU-US Privacy Shield.</p>
<p>The onus is on the CSP to gain customers' trust in all of these areas.</p>
<p>GCP publish an <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/google-clouds-semi-annual-transparency-report-now-available">Enterprise Data Transparency Report</a> that identifies the number of government requests received for Google Cloud Platform and G Suite Enterprise Cloud customer. This report claims that a very small percentage of requests were for enterprise data and that Google did not produce any GCP Enterprise Cloud customer data in response to government requests.</p>
<p>The customer always needs to verify the claims of the CSP. SLAs provide some reassurance but usually with limited recourse if they are missed. Contracts are usually written by the CSP and are not negotiable. Independent certification of compliance is useful to provide a snapshot in time. The best verification is proof that the service was designed, implemented, and is run with security and compliance built-in.</p>
 
 Securing Data and Access 
 
<p>When an organization uses a cloud service the responsibility for security and compliance is shared (see graphic). It is always up to the customer to classify the data that they hold in the service and to control access to this data according to the risks and their compliance obligations. The CSP must secure the infrastructure and should provide the capabilities for the customer to assess and control their use of the service.</p>
<p>One critical control for this is data encryption – however, customers need to consider which form of encryption is appropriate for their risks. For example, while data may be encrypted during transit on the network and at rest in the database and - this will protect against interception and media loss, but it does not protect against application-level attacks such as SQL Injection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>GCP already provides the customer with the capabilities to encrypt their data and to manage their own encryption keys. This includes a cloud-hosted key management service that lets the customer manage their cryptographic keys for their cloud services the same way as on-premises. It also provides HSM as a service to provide hardware protection of the keys. Additionally, in beta is Key Access Justifications a capability that gives the customer visibility into every request for an encryption key, a justification for that request, and a mechanism to approve or deny decryption in the context of that request.</p>
 
 Confidential Computing 
 
<p>While data is being processed in the customer’s applications it needs to be decrypted. This creates a small but important risk to confidentiality through RAM scraping attacks for example. Intel SGX technology already enables applications to be written to process data within protected enclaves.&nbsp; However, this typically requires development changes to the application. GCP&nbsp;<a href="https://cloud.google.com/confidential-computing">Confidential Computing</a>&nbsp;(in beta) is a technology that encrypts data in-use while it is being processed. Confidential Computing environments keep data encrypted in memory and elsewhere outside the central processing unit (CPU). Google claims that this can be implemented at a VM level without any need for code changes at the click of a button.</p>
 
 Assured Workloads for Government 
 
<p>Normally CSPs offer cloud services tailored to the specific compliance requirements of governments. Often, these are hosted in dedicated data centres and managed by government accredited staff to ensure compliance. However, this slows the deployment of new features and does not scale to support other highly regulated industries such as finance. In response to this GCP has announced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/assured-workloads-for-government-compliance-without-compromise">Assured Workloads for Government</a>. Google claim that this will allow them to support US Government workloads to IL4 within their normal infrastructure by:</p>
 
 Automatic enforcement of data location: to meet U.S. government compliance requirements by choosing to store data at rest in U.S. regions. 
 Personnel access: to limit Google support personnel access based on predefined attributes such as citizenship, a particular geographical access location, and background checks. 
 Built-in security controls: to reduce the risk of accidental misconfigurations by choosing from available platform security configurations. 
 Automatic enforcement of product deployment location based on organizational policy. 
 
 
 Certificate Authority Service 
 
<p>Digital certificates underpin identity and authentication for many networked devices and services. This is not new technology but is becoming more important as a mechanism to securely identify IoT devices. However, it is difficult to set up a CA (Certificate Authority) and manage digital certificates at the scale required where there may be many millions of devices. Google has announced <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/introducing-cas-a-cloud-based-managed-ca-for-the-devops-and-iot-world">Certificate Authority Service</a>. This is in beta and will provide a scalable and available service that simplifies and automates the management and deployment of private CAs.</p>
 
 My Opinion 
 
<p>These announcements from GCP underpin the view that organizations are increasingly using cloud services for their business-critical applications as part of their digital transformation journey. This is leading to more scrutiny of the ways in which these services can help the organization to support their own specific security and compliance obligations. The customer still needs to map these controls back to their obligations and to ensure that the controls are effective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While none of the announcements from GCP are for offerings that are completely unique they do provide useful differentiation that may sway some customers to choose GCP. However, most organizations will have a hybrid IT deployment model involving multiple CSPs as well as on services delivered on-premises and this will remain a significant challenge for the foreseeable future.</p>

The circulation of USDC, PAX, BUSD, HUSD, DAI, and GUSD increased by 23.99 million, 8.09 million, 6.31 million, 3.91 million, 8.99 million, and 840,000. The circulation of TUSD decreased by 2.39 million.<br>The circulation of DAI increased by 7.57% compared with a week ago, a decrease in growth&nbsp;rate.</p> The Number of Holding Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>Last week, the number of main stablecoin holding addresses on Ethereum all increased and increased by&nbsp;52,792.</p><p>Source: MYKEY,&nbsp;DeBank</p><p>The number of holding addresses of USDT, USDC, PAX, TUSD, and DAI increased by 38,624, 7,331, 269, 885, and&nbsp;5,683.</p> The Number of Active Addresses <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>The number of active addresses of stablecoins last week increased by an average of 9.65% compared to the previous&nbsp;week.</p> The Number of 24-hour Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Compared with the previous week, the number of daily transactions of major stablecoins increased by an average of&nbsp;13%.</p> The Number of 24-hour Volume of Transactions on the Public Blockchains <p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Source: MYKEY, Coin&nbsp;Metrics</p><p>Compared with the previous week, the daily volume of transactions of major stablecoins last week decreased an average of 2.2%. On July 27 of the previous week, the transfer amount of USDT on Ethereum was unusually high.</p> 2. Reserve&nbsp;Protocol <p>Among the digital assets that Coinbase recently listed as possible to launch, Reserve Rights in the stablecoin project is included. Reserve Rights Token (RSR) is a token used to promote the stability of the Reserve Token (RSV) in the Reserve Protocol. At present, the application of stablecoin RSV is still relatively few. We will introduce the Reserve Protocol in this&nbsp;report.</p><p>Reserve is a flexible stablecoin pool that reduces the risk of stablecoins through asset diversity and decentralized governance. The collateral assets of Reserve include USDC, PAX, TUSD, etc. Under normal circumstances, the price of RSV will be automatically adjusted by the open market to around $1. When demand falls, for example, the price of RSV on the open market is $0.98 and the redemption price is $1, arbitrageurs will be incentivized to purchase RSV on the secondary market and redeem $1 worth of reserves, pushing up the price of RSV. When demand rises, if the price of RSV is $1.02, arbitrageurs will be incentivized to pledge $1 worth of assets to mint RSV and sell them in the market, reducing the price of&nbsp;RSV.</p><p>Although Reserve chooses a portfolio with less downside risk, the value of collateral tokens may still fall. When this happens, the Reserve Protocol will sell the newly minted RSR tokens to supplement the collateral assets.</p><p>In extreme cases, if the collateral assets depreciate and no market participant is willing to purchase the newly minted RSR at the lowest auction price of the RSR, the collateral assets of the RSV may theoretically be less than 100%. In this case, the Reserve Protocol will enlarge the price range set to protect RSV. Under normal circumstances, the RSV range is close to $1. In the event of a crisis, such as a 5% depreciation of collateral tokens, the price range of RSV may be adjusted to $0.95-$1.05. This means that in the short term, the redemption of RSV can only get $0.95 worth of collateral assets, while newly minted RSV requires $1.05 worth of collateral assets. In this way, runs can be prevented, and the last person to redeem the collateral assets gets the same ratio as the first person to&nbsp;redeem.</p><p>At present, there are few RSV holders, and the Reserve is not widely used, with holders able to purchase Amazon gift cards through the Reserve App. As the variety of collateral assets increases, the stability of RSV will be enhanced and applications will likely increase.</p> Tips <p>To better communicate with industry insiders, we decided to add two sections for questions of readers and opinions of guests.

  <p>Fakes are everywhere. From olive oil to pharmaceuticals, to seafood, sneakers and even digital content, criminals make big money by tricking consumers into buying their counterfeit goods. In fact it’s estimated that over 60% of olive oil is fake, and, in some places, there’s an 87% chance that red snapper is actually a cheaper fish, like perch or tilapia.</p>
<p>For some companies the costs of combating mislabeling and fakes outweigh the risks, and others actually benefit from the fake creation. For example, many social media platforms realize it’s not worth spending money ferreting out disinformation when that type of sensational content is so effective at increasing engagement and therefore advertising revenue.</p>
<p>“As a consumer, you really do need to be skeptical of everything that you're consuming and looking at,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-blockchain/">Avivah Litan</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner.<br>
</p>
<p>According to a report prepared for the <a href="https://iccwbo.org/">International Chamber of Commerce</a>, counterfeit and other piracy will grow to 2.81 trillion dollars by 2022.</p>
<p>In times of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-disruptions-you-might-not-see-coming/">disruption</a>, shortages and uncertainty, like a global pandemic or a divisive election season, counterfeiters become more active preying on people who have dropped their guard. It’s exactly these environments of desperation and distraction that cause people to become victims of counterfeits.</p>
<p>Here are three tools to spot and stop counterfeits. Gartner recommends that consumers look for at least one that has been used to verify that a product is what it says it is. But for organizations that must ensure products are 100% genuine, it’s best to rely on all three.</p>
 
 Human verification. This includes on-site auditing by regulators who conduct actual physical inspections, sampling and testing to deliver certificates of verification. In the digital space it may also include crowdsourced ratings of reputation, such as seller reviews online. 
 Algorithmic verification. Machine learning and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-artificial-intelligence/">AI models</a> are trained to analyze and recognize attributes, components and ingredients of the genuine article to provide verification. 
 Digital verification. Deployed for certification at the origin of a product or piece of content, these tools allow for quality control with digital techniques such as DNA analysis or spectral imaging to capture and record the original as a digital object. Then <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-blockchain/">blockchain</a> and digital tokenization enable tracking of this immutable object from origin to end user to provide certainty that nothing has been changed. 
 
<p>Because each tool by itself is not perfect, all three layered together provide the greatest verification. But the cost increases with each tool, so deciding which to use and when requires carefully weighing risks and benefits against cost. Whatever the level of need to assess the truth, these tools will help you spot fakes and protect yourself and your business from counterfeits.</p>

  <p>Organizations that hesitate to commit to a total migration to the public cloud model use a combination — or hybrid — of private-cloud-inspired and public cloud styles of computing. That is why, over the past three years, Gartner client requests to discuss hybrid cloud have grown 15%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Cloud computing promises that customers will gain advantages from several key propositions, for example by shifting the responsibility and work of running hardware and software infrastructure to cloud providers, leveraging the economics of cloud elasticity, benefiting from the pace of innovation in sync with public cloud providers, and more,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/6992/David-Smith">David Smith</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The next generation of cloud computing, retains the advantages of cloud computing while extending the range and use cases for cloud</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet, hybrid cloud breaks these very value propositions: One part of a hybrid cloud is architected, owned, controlled and operated by the customer and the other by the public cloud provider. The customer retains responsibility for their part of the operation but cannot leverage the capabilities (such as the skills, innovation pace, investments and techniques) of the public cloud provider.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>Newer generations of packaged hybrid cloud offerings can help reduce the impact of these shortcomings. Distributed cloud, the next generation of cloud computing, retains the advantages of cloud computing while extending the range and use cases for cloud. CIOs can use distributed cloud models to target location-dependent cloud use cases that will be required in the future.</p>

 What is distributed cloud? 
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/distributed-cloud">Distributed cloud computing</a> is the first cloud model that incorporates physical location of cloud-delivered services as part of its definition. Historically, location has not been relevant to cloud computing definitions. In fact, location has been explicitly abstracted away from the service, which inspired the term “cloud computing” in the first place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Distributed cloud has three origins: Public cloud, hybrid cloud and edge computing. Public cloud providers have supported multiple zones and regions for many years. With packaged hybrid offerings, public cloud services (often including necessary hardware and software) can now be distributed to different physical locations, for instance, the edge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By 2024, most cloud service platforms will provide at least some distributed cloud services that execute at the point of need</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, ownership, operation, governance, updates and evolution of the services remain the responsibility of the originating public cloud provider. This is a significant shift from the virtually centralized model of most public cloud services and the model associated with the general cloud concept. It will lead to a new era in cloud computing.</p>
<p>Some might ask if distributed cloud is simply a case of edge computing, and the answer is both yes and no. All instances of distributed cloud are also instances of edge computing. But not all instances of edge computing are distributed cloud. This is because many uses of edge involve a public cloud provider that manages the evolution and ongoing control of the resulting environment.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-top-10-cloud-myths/">Top 10 Cloud Myths</a></p>
 The value of distributed cloud computing 
<p>Cloud services from public cloud providers become “distributed” out to specific and varied physical locations. Operations being physically closer to those who need the capabilities enable low-latency compute. This also ensures a consistent control plane to administer the cloud infrastructure from public to private cloud and extend consistently across both environments. Taken together, these items can deliver major improvements in performance due to the elimination of latency issues, as well as reduce the risk of global network-related outages or control plane inefficiencies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Distributed cloud will evolve in two distinct phases. Phase One will consist of like-for-like hybrid</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Distributed cloud creates strategically placed substations of cloud compute, storage and networking that can act as shared cloud pseudoavailability zones. Gartner uses the term “substations” to evoke the image of subsidiary stations, for instance branch post offices, where people gather to use services.</p>
<p>Because distributed cloud substations are the responsibility of the originating public cloud provider, the key cloud value propositions of productivity, innovation and support remain intact. In fact, by 2024, most cloud service platforms will provide at least some distributed cloud services that execute at the point of need.</p>
<p>Other specific advantages of distributed cloud potentially include:</p>
 
 Increased compliance with regulatory requirements that data must be in a specific customer location 
 Reduced network failure risk because the cloud services can reside in local or semilocal subnets, allowing them to operate intermittently untethered 
 A dramatic increase in the number and availability of locations where cloud services can be hosted or from which they can be consumed (compute zones) 
 
 What’s next for distributed cloud? 
<p>In practical terms, distributed cloud will evolve in two distinct phases. Phase One will consist of like-for-like hybrid, where enterprise customers will buy cloud substations to mimic the promise of hybrid cloud and avoid latency-based problems.</p>
<p>These customers will not initially embrace the idea of opening their substations to near neighbors, whether geographical or industry-based, and will keep the substation on their premises to themselves. This will have the effect of enabling true hybrid cloud by having public cloud providers take responsibility for everything.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Next-generation cloud will work based on an assumption that cloud substations are everywhere — much like Wi-Fi hot spots</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Phase Two, or next-gen cloud, will consist of utilities, universities, city governments and telcos, among others, buying cloud substations and opening them for use by near neighbors. This will begin to establish the idea that distributed cloud represents the foundation of the next generation of cloud computing. This will also reflect the need for the continuum of distributed cloud. Next-generation cloud will work based on an assumption that cloud substations are everywhere — much like Wi-Fi hot spots.</p>
<p>“In both phases, location becomes more transparent again,” says Smith. “They allow customers to specify to a provider, ‘I need X to comply with policies Y and latencies Z,’ and then let the provider configure automatically and transparently. This could potentially represent future phases as well.”</p>
 Distributed cloud is not without its challenges 
<p>Within the distributed cloud model, some questions must be addressed before <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/4-lessons-learned-from-cloud-infrastructure-adopters/">the model can be widely adopted</a>. For example:</p>
 
 How much of the public cloud capabilities will be available on the distributed cloud substation? While this is not definitional to distributed cloud, it is a factor in deciding what flavor of distributed cloud will be necessary — fully distributed or partially distributed. 
 What custom scenarios for distributed cloud substations will emerge? 
 If distributed cloud substations are opened to near-neighbor companies, who pays for the increased bandwidth necessary for effective operation and how will it be paid? 
 How will revenue models play out for sharing substations across multiple companies? For example, do near-neighbor users of a substation pay the originating cloud provider or the enterprise that originally requested the substation be installed? 
 Must a distributed cloud substation always be connected, or can it operate with variable connectivity? 
 
 Considerations for CIOs 
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/analysts-answer-what-do-cios-need-to-consider-for-cloud-strategy/">In the eyes of the CIO</a>, the distributed cloud concept will guide the roadmap for cloud evolution. It will specifically benefit CIOs seeking new opportunities to reach customers in dispersed environments and those who need location-specific services with reduced latency. Using Phase One like-for-like hybrids without sacrificing cloud value propositions will enable real hybrid cloud computing. Thus, distributed cloud not only ushers in a next generation of cloud in Phase Two, but it also helps build a firmer foundation for hybrid as it exists today.</p>

 The GiD Report#122 — What will replace WeChat? (And how Facebook fueled TikTok’s&nbsp;rise) <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-121-what-we-learned-from-the-big-tech-antitrust-hearing-645d98b1fc61">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Two things mattered this last week: the state of the economy and the state of our technology.</p><p>On the economy, we still can’t seem to agree on the next stimulus bill and so the Fed has taken matters into its own hands — with a now redefined purview on expanding inflation with whatever tools necessary.</p><p>On our technology, President Trump banned a bunch of Chinese apps including TikTok and WeChat. Make no mistake, China’s played this game since day one, keeping out platforms like Facebook and Google so they could build their own tightly controlled variants. But in fighting China’s fight, the U.S. is creating an internet that more and more resembles that of its primary geopolitical rival.</p><p>All of this had the vibe of inevitability. With all the tension building up from the status quo, it was only a matter of time before something had to&nbsp;give.</p><p>These are the ongoing battles that will rejigger the world as we know&nbsp;it.</p><p>And so this week, the economy feels a little less free. And the internet feels a little less&nbsp;open.</p><p>Here’s what we have for you&nbsp;today:</p>  What will fill the WeChat&nbsp;vacuum?  How Facebook fueled TikTok’s&nbsp;rise  The New Brandeis Movement of antitrust thinking  NYTimes contemplates the challenge of antitrust regulations  Chamath Palihapitiya on the economy and Bitcoin (next&nbsp;week)  Stuff happens   1. Everyone is talking about TikTok. Microsoft has 45 days to complete a deal. Twitter apparently threw its hat into the ring over the weekend, according to the WSJ (they’re calling it “Twik Twok”). But let’s talk about&nbsp;WeChat. <p>Where TikTok is about ephemeral fun and also significant long term cultural (and in turn political) influence — soft power, basically — WeChat is as hard as it&nbsp;comes.</p>Photo: Sean&nbsp;Foley<p>Sure, WeChat hasn’t had the same kind of international impact outside of China that TikTok has enjoyed (which, BTW, isn’t even available in China — they use an alternative called Douyin). But if I want to chat with my cousin in Shanghai about the new guy she’s dating, I open up WeChat. If my sister wants to order some obscure product that only a niche Chinese manufacturer makes, she logs onto&nbsp;WeChat.</p><p>If you wanted to connect with people in China, you opened up China’s #1&nbsp;app.</p><p>So even though pretty much no regular American uses WeChat for their normal day-to-day stuff, it remains the central vector for connecting with mainland China both socially and economically. By banning WeChat, Trump is burning a key&nbsp;bridge.</p><p>And because China banned U.S. platforms long ago, there’s really no real alternatives from either&nbsp;side.</p><p>That’s a huge vacuum that’s going to need to be filled. Tensions are high between the two governments, but people are still people. They are going to want to chat and they are going to want to do business with the outside&nbsp;world.</p><p>So the real question is what fills that&nbsp;gap.</p><p>It’s hard to see something from the old guard rising to the task. They want too much control. They need too much of your data. And they lack the structural flexibility to appease both sides. It will be a nonstarter for either government.</p><p>New bridges will need to be built with new approaches.</p><p>That’s the new&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Anyway, this is a big deal. It’s not just about me or my sister. It’s also about Apple. Here’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-29d4148e-e21a-4b81-82c8-8e23fb4995d8.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>Yes, but: WeChat is not only huge inside China but serves to connect users there with friends and family abroad, and shutting it down in the U.S. would be a major disruption to the Chinese diaspora. Beijing’s internet surveillance and censorship means most Chinese communication platforms stay domestic, and American tech platforms don’t extend into the&nbsp;country.</blockquote><blockquote>Unlike TikTok, which doesn’t operate in China, WeChat can’t be cleanly severed from China, so there’s no path to a domestic acquisition, and the executive order likely amounts to a&nbsp;ban.</blockquote><blockquote>And if American companies can’t do any commerce involving WeChat, which is widely used for a vast range of functions within China, that could demolish the Chinese business of companies like Apple, observers <a href="https://twitter.com/guan/status/1291698934155489281">note</a>.</blockquote> 2. OK! With that out of the way, now we can talk about TikTok (the success of which Facebook is apparently responsible for). <p>If you watched the antitrust hearings the other week — and even if you only watched parts as I did, it was clear that Mark Zuckerberg was positioning Facebook as a democratic foil to TikTok (and parent owner ByteDance).</p><p>In other words, Mark believes we need companies like Facebook to be as big as possible in order to compete on the global stage with an emergent China — Tech Cold War and all that&nbsp;jazz.</p><p>It’s a compelling argument with some (emphasis some) undeniable merit. Companies, tech or other, benefit from scale and network effects, improving reach and efficiency. And having global corporate behemoths expands American hegemony.</p><p>And we all want to expand American hegemony don’t we? (Apologies to all the non-American readers, I’m just trying to make a&nbsp;point.)</p><p>With billions of users, Facebook helps better connect people everywhere, expanding American soft power, and for a time, even helping to spark democratic movements (arguably). The Arab Spring comes to&nbsp;mind.</p><p>But what if Facebook (sheer size and monopolistic behavior in tow) is also one of the main drivers of TikTok’s&nbsp;success?</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://promarket.org/2020/08/07/tech-monopolies-are-the-reason-the-us-now-has-a-tiktok-problem/">Lucas Kunce</a> (via Matt Stoller’s newsletter BIG) for the University of Chicago’s Stigler Center ProMarket magazine:</p><blockquote>If you’re amused by the irony of Big Tech protecting us from an app that could be used for election meddling, given Facebook’s role in the 2016 election, the irony doesn’t stop there. Because TikTok, the app getting all the attention right now, owes its existence in large part to Facebook.</blockquote><blockquote>Once upon a time, America had a popular video-sharing app similar to TikTok. It was called Vine and, like TikTok, all the kids used to share silly videos on it. Facebook didn’t like the competition and flexed its monopoly power to strangle it. As revealed in leaked e-mails, Mark Zuckerberg pulled the trigger himself, denying Vine access to Facebook and eliminating its ability to access&nbsp;users.</blockquote><blockquote>Curiously, Facebook didn’t do that with TikTok. In fact, it did the opposite. During the spring and summer of 2018, when Facebook was still pushing to access China and trying to open a subsidiary office in Hangzhou, Facebook allowed the Chinese app to blitzkrieg its site with advertising. The ad buys were so overwhelming — more than a billion dollars — that between 15 percent and 22 percent of all ads shown through Facebook on IOS during this time were TikTok&nbsp;ads.</blockquote><blockquote>In 2019, however, things changed, and it had nothing to do with patriotism or protecting the West from a Chinese app. Zuckerberg appeared to finally realize that he would never get into China, political scrutiny on Facebook’s outsized power intensified on both sides of the aisle, and TikTok stopped pouring $3 million a day into big ad buys on Facebook.</blockquote><blockquote>In short, Facebook claims its size should be preserved in order to serve as a line of defense against adversarial companies and that it needs to be big to innovate. Yet the evidence indicates that the latest adversarial app owes its existence, in part, to Facebook’s pursuit of corporate goals like expanding into China and increasing ad revenue. The Vine story clearly illustrates how the large tech platforms are structurally unable to defend American interests and should never be trusted with that&nbsp;task.</blockquote><p>That’s the other side of the coin. Just because Big Tech is powerful doesn’t mean it’s good for America. Because ultimately, Big Tech is self interested.

So we’ve talked about Lina Khan here before, who wrote the seminal paper on antitrust (Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox), which helped spawn the New Brandeis Movement (Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis is heavily cited in Lina’s paper). The ethos of that movement got a nod by Chairman David Cicilline during the antitrust hearings (via Ben Thompson’s Stratechery): <blockquote>Because concentrated economic power also leads to concentrated political power, this investigation also goes to the heart of whether we as a people govern ourselves, or whether we let ourselves be governed by private monopolies. American democracy has always been at war against monopoly power. Throughout our history, we’ve recognized that concentrated markets and concentrated political control are incompatible with democratic ideals. When the American people confronted monopolies in the past, be it the railroads or the oil tycoons or AT&amp;T and Microsoft, we took action to ensure no private corporation controls our economy or our democracy.</blockquote><p>Which touches upon our point about Facebook and the rise of TikTok. This isn’t just about keeping prices low, making platforms more useful, or optimizing for efficiency. It’s about upholding social, cultural, and political values and not allowing economic power undermine them.</p><p>In other words, we can’t lose sight of the big&nbsp;picture.</p><p>Those were Chairman Cicilline’s closing remarks to his opening statement. Ben has <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/antitrust-politics/">a more in depth take on the hearings as a whole</a>, which is worth your time. (Incidentally, he didn’t feel like the rest of the show lived up to the spirit of those initial remarks.)</p> 4. The issue is that it’s easy to spot the problem. Figuring out a solution is less straightforward—especially from a regulatory perspective. <p>Here’s <a href="https://messaging-custom-newsletters.nytimes.com/template/oakv2?campaign_id=158&amp;emc=edit_ot_20200804&amp;instance_id=20964&amp;nl=on-tech-with-shira-ovide&amp;productCode=OT&amp;regi_id=62965355&amp;segment_id=35187&amp;te=1&amp;uri=nyt%3A%2F%2Fnewsletter%2Fd75f7c23-4919-5b0f-99e6-c340a549cde8&amp;user_id=76e07e60b492e3c9680e0c35970dc9ef">the NYTimes tech newsletter</a>:</p><blockquote>Shira: What’s been Europe’s approach to the American tech superpowers?</blockquote><blockquote>Adam: Europe started doing antitrust investigations several years ago. But the resulting lawsuits and regulation haven’t done&nbsp;much.</blockquote><blockquote>Google is the best example. Investigations into allegations of anti-competitive tactics took years. The European Union then fined Google several billion dollars for breaking the law. But critics say that Google wasn’t forced to change much, so this did little to restore competition.</blockquote><blockquote>What can American lawmakers and regulators learn from Europe’s mistakes?</blockquote><blockquote>Speed is crucial, otherwise regulators are fighting yesterday’s battles.</blockquote><blockquote>There was also a problem with enforcement. Europe passed a highly-touted privacy law called General Data Protection Regulation, but it’s been a flop at limiting data collection by the biggest tech companies. Much of the policing of the law was left to Ireland, which simply doesn’t have the resources to keep&nbsp;up.</blockquote><blockquote>It sounds as if the lesson is that you can believe there’s a problem with tech companies’ power, but it’s hard to craft an appropriate response.</blockquote><blockquote>Without a doubt. The authorities in Europe are changing their tactics now. They’re looking at rewriting laws to directly target the way big tech companies do business: How they use data or box out rivals, and ways they give their products preferential treatment.</blockquote><blockquote>But after a few years covering this in Europe, I have become much more suspect about these efforts at regulation. There’s a lot of potential for unintended consequences.</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>Does this mean we should be skeptical about any U.S. government action against Big&nbsp;Tech?</blockquote><blockquote>Maybe. But it’s still been interesting to watch this growing realization among the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic about the size of these companies and the influence they hold over their democratic societies and how they operate, including their communication systems, information flow and commerce.</blockquote><blockquote>You can sense this feeling that lawmakers think they must do something, but aren’t quite sure what that is yet. The next 12 to 18 months are going to be extraordinary.</blockquote><p>And because these are extraordinary times, things are moving faster than usual.&nbsp;Axios:</p><blockquote>After grilling the CEOs of Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple last week, members of Congress are grappling with whether to accuse any of the firms of illegal anticompetitive behavior, to propose updating federal antitrust laws, or both, Axios’ Ashley Gold&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>The big picture: Congress is just one arm of government making the case against these <br>companies. Google is expected to be the first of the firms to face possible antitrust litigation from the Justice Department before summer’s end, but all four face a full-court press of investigations by DOJ, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general.</blockquote><blockquote>What’s next: Following on from last week’s hearing, the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee is preparing a report of its probe’s findings, drawn from some 1.3 million documents and hours of calls and interviews. Subcommittee Chair David Cicilline told “Axios Re:Cap” he hopes to issue the report and recommendations by late August or September.</blockquote> 5. I was going to get to the economy next, referencing the interview with Chamath Palihapitiya I shared on Friday, but today’s newsletter has already gotten pretty long so I’ll save it for next&nbsp;week. <p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/goldman-sachs-eyes-token-bank-appoints-head-digital-assets">Goldman Sachs Eyes Own Token as Bank Appoints New Head of Digital Assets — CoinDesk</a>  <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/other20200806a.htm?utm_campaign=20200806_FS_PR_FN_FRN%203%20Release_Broad&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=Eloqua">Federal Reserve announces details of new 24x7x365 interbank settlement service with clearing functionality to support instant payments in the United&nbsp;States</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/the-history-present-and-future-of-central-banks-feat-george-selgin">The History, Present and Future of Central Banks, Feat.

					 <p>It’s a tale as old as tech: Do I build it in-house or do I invest in a ready-made product? There are dozens of articles scattered around the web which can help you answer this question. But <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) is a unique market with unique requirements. Here we seek to provide a comprehensive analysis of the advantages of building versus buying.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 The classic question 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>There is a single question that can go a very long way in helping determine whether you should build a solution in-house or buy a product to solve your need:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				Where are you adding value to your customers, and therefore at what layer of the technology should you focus your time?			</p>
					</blockquote>
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>If you were developing a web app, you wouldn’t consider building your own RDBMS, front-end framework, or hosting service. Likewise, to add payments functionality, you would probably use a service from experts like Stripe in order to reliably process payments and ensure PCI compliance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re a bank, on the other hand, payments is probably your bread and butter. You’ll either partner with someone like Stripe for their expertise in API/cloud development or hire a team and build it all yourself.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
							 
											
													
										By leveraging existing tools, your team is freed up to focus all its efforts on what it's best at, while resting assured that world-class experts are taking care of the underlying critical components. 
									 
						 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Common build vs buy considerations 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>At face value, the decision to build or buy seems like a relatively straightforward one; how much will it cost you to build and maintain an in-house system, and what’s the sticker price for the ready-built solution? But there are non-obvious and often hard-to-quantify considerations that you need to make sure to fully consider.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Reasons to buy</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Reasons to build</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Turnkey/speed</a>
					 
					 <p>A ready-made product should work off the shelf. Some products work better than others…but in principle, this is true.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Support</a>
					 
					 <p>If you’re building something in-house and you run into a roadblock, where will you turn? Consultants? Expensive. Forums? Unreliable, slow. Figure it out? Expensive (because it’s slow). The support that comes with a product, especially in an industry as nascent as self-sovereign identity, is extremely valuable.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Premium product</a>
					 
					 <p>When a vendor makes an update to a product you’re using, you inherit those features effortlessly. The product improves itself over time because there is a dedicated team working on it. Because of the nature of economies of scale, this always results in a premium product.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Scaling</a>
					 
					 <p>Open source reference implementations are meant to be a reference but are not ultimately meant to be a scalable solution. If you use a vendor, you’ll likely need to pay them more money as you scale; so they’re incentivized to ensure their product is scalable!</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Lower-cost</a>
					 
					 <p>It’ll always be lower-cost to buy than to build because the development costs of the product can be amortized across all their customers. If you build it in-house, you bear the brunt of 100% of the costs.</p> 
				 
					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>  Control</a>
					 
					 <p>When you build the technology yourself, you have total ownership and control over the software. You’re not restricted by other software licenses, and you have full ability to change the codebase to accommodate your needs. You control where the data is hosted and don’t need to rely on legal agreements to control how it’s handled.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> In-house expertise</a>
					 
					 <p>Although it will be much more expensive and time consuming to build in-house, your team will build up an expertise. If this expertise is strategically important for your organization, this is an important consideration. You’ll need to make sure to retain the knowledgeable employees, however; I’ve seen key employees leave and wipe out their company’s SSI knowledge base.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Long-tail use case</a>
					 
					 <p>If your use case is uncommon or extraordinarily unique, you may be forced to build in-house. Ready-built platforms like Trinsic are built to accommodate all of the most common use cases, but there is a “long tail” of cases that aren’t economical for a vendor to cover. For these, you will likely need to go deep into the low level SDKs and build something custom.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Costs at scale</a>
					 
					 <p>Depending on the pricing model of the vendor you’re working with, it’s possible that it will be costlier at scale to use a vendor. For example, if a vendor charges per-issuance and your use case requires issuing millions of credentials, then you’ll either need to negotiate special pricing with the vendor or build your own solution to make it economical. This is rare, so it is a companion point to the “long-tail use case” point.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a> Avoid vendor lock-in</a>
					 
					 <p>Traditionally, enterprises would build in-house to avoid being locked in to a specific software vendor. Luckily, SSI protocols are open source and based on standards which means that Trinsic can’t lock you in even if we wanted to! So the value of this point is reduced in the context of self-sovereign identity.</p> 
				 
					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Self-sovereign identity is unique 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>In addition to the common considerations above, SSI has some unique properties that you should be aware of.<br><br></p>  Rapidly-moving space: The open source and standards work in the SSI community are moving at the speed of light. If you opt to build yourself, you’ll need at least two full-time engineers working solely on SSI just for your system to tread water; one to stay abreast of the evolving work going on at DIF, ToIP, Hyperledger, Sovrin, W3C, etc. and one to implement and maintain your software in response to those changes. You’ll bear 100% of the cost of these engineers. And the interoperability devil is in the details—with a vengeance.  Identity is high-stakes: Many verifiable credentials use cases involve high-value, highly-regulated data. Identity breaches are <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ponemon-institutes-2015-global-cost-of-data-breach-study-reveals-average-cost-of-data-breach-reaches-record-levels-300089057.html">costly</a>, making key storage, wallet management (especially in the cloud), and other architectural considerations crucially important. Are you a world-class expert in securing these components? Even if you have the know-how, do you have the engineering capacity for the build-out and maintenance? Once it’s secured, how will it scale?  <p><br>Self-sovereign identity is who we are. It’s what we eat, breathe, and sleep, so you don’t have to. Our expert engineering team ensures the most recent standards and protocols are implemented in our platform, so you never have to worry about interoperability or standards compliance. We spread the cost of these engineers across our hundreds of customers, meaning you get best-in-class solutions and maintenance for a fraction of the cost. Additionally, we’ve invested hundreds of thousands of dollars into our cloud platform with the best experts in the world for SSI security. We’ve learned the lessons and hit the roadblocks already so that you don’t have to.</p>

					 <p>Actually, you don’t need to ask a binary question like “build vs buy.” By buying a developer tool like the Trinsic platform, you avoid reinventing the wheel and get the peace of mind that comes with knowing experts have taken care of the hardest security problems and low-level protocols. This allows your development team the freedom to focus on what they’re best at: building the solutions that will add value to your organization.</p><p><br>With Trinsic’s fully-loaded package of 3 APIs, a front-end Studio, robust documentation, and SDKs in popular languages, your team is equipped with the flexibility and functionality needed to build something extraordinary.<br><br></p>  Trinsic Studio:&nbsp;An easy-to-use web interface for managing credential exchange with no code.

<p><a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a> has announced the release of a new decentralized identity solution, which will make it easier and more secure than ever for crypto holders and traders to manage and exchange digital assets. It is envisioned that the benefits of this new solution will bring benefits similar to what the EU’s Open Banking initiative is bringing to traditional finance, to crypto users around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>In what will have major benefits for users’ experience, through Ontology’s decentralized identity solution, digital asset holders can now access a 360° view of all of their holdings on one dashboard through the Ontology website or Ontology’s ONTO application. Users will have a clear view of their assets, no matter what wallets those assets are held in. In addition, users will also be able to view their OScore, Ontology’s credit scoring system, on any&nbsp;chain.</p><p>LI JUN, Founder of Ontology, said, “Ontology is on a mission to change the way data is managed and transferred, increasing security, protection, and value for all parties involved. It is inevitable that DeFi developments will be subject to strict regulations, just as is the case with traditional finance. Thus, ensuring that reliable mechanisms for the verification of user identity are in place is vital. Ontology is providing a solution that connects users’ assets to their identity, providing increased security and trust to all parties, connecting the missing pieces of decentralized finance’s ecosystem.</p><p>“Many crypto users hold digital assets in different wallets. Should a user wish to borrow crypto, for example, it can be difficult to verify their financial holdings easily. Through the use of ONT ID, Ontology’s OScore allows users to verify the full value of their holdings and view relevant financial history across their wallets, without showing a full list of those assets. In this way, user data privacy is protected, and information that does not need to be shared is not shared. For lenders, the risk is vastly reduced as transparency and trust are greatly increased, and correct due diligence can take&nbsp;place.”</p><p>In line with the release of the new decentralized identity solution, Ontology has also published a graphic outlining exactly how the solution works. Integration of the solution into BTC, ETH, etc is already under construction, as Ontology plans to cater for increased demand for the cross-chain interoperability.</p><p>For more information, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://ont.io/">ont.io</a>.</p> Find Ontology elsewhere <p><a href="http://ont.io/">Ontology website</a> / <a href="http://onto.app/medium">ONTO website</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/OWallet/releases">OWallet&nbsp;(GitHub)</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OntologyNetwork/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ONTnetwork/?source=post_page---------------------------">Facebook</a> / <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/13604309">LinkedIn</a> / <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzLZJgDglAWRU0b2GOa7pA">YouTube</a> / <a href="https://m.blog.naver.com/ontology8">NaverBlog</a> /<a href="https://hub.forklog.com/tag/ontology/">&nbsp;Forklog</a></p><p><a href="https://t.me/OntologyAnnouncements">Telegram Announcement</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram English</a> / <a href="https://github.com/ontio/?source=post_page---------------------------">GitHub</a> /&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/pQRHtbD">Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-releases-new-decentralized-identity-solution-to-benefit-defi-users-e75d3f9551bb">Ontology Releases New Decentralized Identity Solution To Benefit DeFi Users</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>It’s a commonplace nowadays that we live in an information age where society and the economy is increasingly driven by data. All you need for evidence of this is to look at the likes of Google and Facebook, companies that have embedded themselves into billions of peoples’ everyday lives. Or take a look at the increasingly fractious debate about who should be allowed to collect what data, how, for what purposes and whose&nbsp;benefit.</p><p>But actually we’re just at the beginning. At the very earliest stage. Why? Because the way that data is currently collected and used suffocates its true potential.</p><p>The unique and special thing about data is that it doesn’t get ‘used up’ when it is used. It can be used again and again. And it can be used by different people for different purposes. Your health data may be used by a doctor to help treat an illness for example, and by an insurance company to calculate your insurance premiums. You may use the data in your driving licence to prove that you are entitled to drive. A separate organisation may use it to help verify your identity.</p><p>Currently our entire data economy is organised around the assumptions of ‘OUOU’: that there is only One User of any piece of data that has been collected (the first ‘OU”) and there is only One Use for this data — the purpose they collected the data for (the second ‘OU’ of ‘one use’). This data system is almost 100% organisation-centric. It is organisations that collect and use data and they only use this data for their own purposes, jealousy guarding the data they collect, partly because for legal reasons if it is personal data, but also because they see this data as keys to their competitive edge and ability to make&nbsp;money.</p> From ‘OUOU’ to&nbsp;‘MUMU’ <p>Increasingly however, a new realisation is dawning: that data that was originally collected and used by a specific data controller for a specific purpose could be used by many other parties for many other purposes. As long as we live in an OUOU world the full potential of data can never be unleashed, because most users, and uses, of this data can never&nbsp;happen.</p><p>To unleash this potential, we need to move from OUOU to MUMU — many users, many&nbsp;uses.</p><p>Like the chick in the egg at a certain point the OUOU structures and assumptions that originally protected and nurtured data collection and use begin to constrain and suffocate it. For the data chick’s potential to be unleashed it has to break out of the OUOU shell to embrace MUMU&nbsp;instead.</p><p>You can see the MUMU trend everywhere we look, in issues relating to both personal and non-personal data. For example, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/communication-european-strategy-data-19feb2020_en.pdf">new European Strategy for Data</a> has provisions to improve and increase data sharing between the public sector and business (government-to-business or G2B data sharing), between companies (business-to-business or B2B data-sharing), between businesses and government authorities (business-to-government or B2G data sharing), and between public authorities. It is developing strategies for increased data sharing in targeted industries such as automotive, financial services, health and Internet of&nbsp;Things.</p><p>Of course, citizen’s right to data portability is now enshrined in law via GDPR. Data sharing in one form or another is also an essential element of multiple initiatives including those to promote availability of Open Data, attempts to promote Open Banking and hot topics including so-called ‘Big Data’, AI, internet of things, smart cities and smart&nbsp;homes.</p><p>This shift from OUOU to MUMU represents a tectonic shift in the data economy. Its unfolding may be slow but it is also fundamental, structural, remorseless, relentless and unstoppable. the potential uses of data. And the more the idea ‘clicks’ in peoples’ minds (e.g. policy makers, regulators, innovators, entrepreneurs, opinion-formers as well as people like ourselves) the more unstoppable the pressure for MUMU&nbsp;becomes.</p><p>Looking back, once MUMU ways of collecting and using data have become the new normal, what we currently call ‘the ‘information age’ will seem extremely restricted, distorted and partial indeed, just as the age of steam seems extremely limited once viewed from the vantage point of an electrified society.</p><p>In their time, steam engines were dazzling and awe-inspiring in their operation, scale and impact; widely seen as harbingers, symbols and catalysts of dramatic and far-reaching change. But ultimately, steam was a dead-end. When it was replaced by electricity — a far richer, more flexible, versatile, efficient, distributed way of accessing and using energy, economic growth really took&nbsp;off.</p><p>Companies like Google and Facebook are the steam engines of the information age. They, too, are dazzling and awe-inspiring in their operation, scale and impact. But their OUOU nature means they don’t represent the MUMU&nbsp;future.</p> Multiple effects <p>MUMU will (is already having) multiple effects. Here are some of&nbsp;them.</p>  A growing increasing realisation that data storage needs to be separated from data use, with specialist organisations and institutions enabling the gathering, aggregation and storing data and helping specialist service providers access and use it for specific purposes. A central plank of the EU’s new data strategy for example is to “increase its pools of quality data available for use and re- use.” This is part of what it calls “a new data paradigm where less data will be stored in data centres, and more data will be spread in a pervasive way closer to the user ‘at the edge’ ”. Mydex is one of these specialist organisations.  The increasing importance of new mechanisms and enablers of safe, efficient data sharing. Well-formed APIs are an obvious example. They can help to turn a system of isolated data castles into a vibrant, pulsating nervous system driven by data sharing. But the development of new standards for the creation and use of metadata is also critically important along with data directories that act as signposts to where the data is held, and data inventories explaining what data is held by each&nbsp;party.  New forms of value and business model to go with these new approaches.  The collapse current notions of ‘private property’ which are of absolutist, binary, where something is either mine or yours. In its place: increased recognition of the importance of shared and divided rights and responsibilities with negotiated boundaries and&nbsp;limits.  Changes in value equations. Currently, in consumer/citizen facing services, the only value that matters relates to the content and quality of the service offered by a service provider. With the rise of MUMU, organisations will be increasingly expected to offer an added dimension of value: data. Citizens/customers will increasingly ask “what data has the service provider collected, generated or minted that I could use for other purposes elsewhere, outside of this relationship, with other parties?”   New dangers <p>The shift to MUMU won’t automatically usher in a new golden age of data sharing and use. Far from it. Predatory, parasitic and profiteering motives and strategies are likely to be inflamed even further, triggering new data land grabs that are even bigger, more vicious and more cynical than those we have yet seen. Sharks and opportunists will adopt ‘caring, sharing’ words to cover the real intentions. One example: Look at how new health data sets are being collated supposedly for the purpose of helping society tackle Covid-19, but actually represent power grabs and data monetisation. Beware also the new fashion for ‘data trusts’ which are already being eyed by some as a data land grab opportunity.</p> But also new opportunities <p>The existence of such threats makes Mydex’s work work even more important. We saw MUMU coming when we first launched 13 years ago. Everything we have done since has been designed to enable data sharing — to help MUMU happen in the realms of personal data — but only if it is safe and ethical, empowers citizens and ensures they realise the value of their own data. (That was our original slogan on formation: “helping individuals realise the value of their own&nbsp;data”.)</p><p>We’re getting closer to making it happen. With the work we have done for the <a href="https://blogs.gov.scot/digital/2020/03/06/what-are-smart-entitlements/">Scottish Government on its ‘Smart Entitlement’ strategy</a> we believe we have found a practical, doable way forward that achieves the goals of safety, efficiency and equity, and that helps unleash the full value of personal data for both individuals and the broader society and&nbsp;economy.</p><p>More on that&nbsp;soon.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/from-ouou-to-mumu-why-the-real-information-age-hasnt-even-started-yet-6ebf7b871184">From OUOU to MUMU: why the real information age hasn’t even started yet</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katarzyna-mrowinska/">Katarzyna Kazimierczak-Mrowińska</a>, or Kasia to her friends and colleagues, is the COO of Authenteq. Not only does she oversee the day to day operations and operational functions of the business, but she’s also a new mom to two beautiful twins. We spoke to Kasia about juggling work and motherhood, what’s changed, and what she learned so far.<br></p>



<p></p>



 What led you to Authenteq and made you want to work in the KYC and identity verification space? 



<p>I worked indirectly with Authenteq through the company I worked with beforehand. I have a law degree but I never actively pursued any academic knowledge in the tech sector. I had been working in the tech industry for a few years, so when the GDPR passed in Europe and made <a href="https://authenteq.com/10-reasons-you-should-verify-identities/">privacy a much bigger topic to everyone</a>, I was able to get involved hands-on combing my skills.</p>



<p>The identity verification space has a lot to do with the law, new regulation and compliance, so for me, it was a way to build on the skills I already had and use my expertise, while continuing to learn. I’ve been able to watch as the law catches up, or tries to, to technology.</p>



 What do you like most about working at Authenteq? 



<p>It’s such an interesting industry and being a part of it as it evolves has been great. I have a lot of responsibilities, that are paired with a great level of autonomy to plan my own days and my schedule. Plus, the people at Authenteq are really incredible.&nbsp;</p>



 How would you describe the work culture at Authenteq? 



<p>I was always a fan of Scandinavian work culture and their seemingly perfect work-life balance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Authenteq was established in Iceland, which is arguably one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Iceland#:~:text=Iceland%20is%20arguably%20one%20of%20the%20world's%20most%20gender%2Dequal,pay%20gap%20index%20since%202009.">world’s most gender-equal countries</a> in the world. It was listed as the number one best place to work by The Economist’s women index in 2016, has been named the most feminist country in the world, and has been listed number one on the World Economic Forum gender pay gap index since 2009.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So having Scandinavian culture and women equality was the core of the culture, and we tried to translate that in the Berlin office as well. We are honest, transparent, and most importantly, we respect each other. Those are the most important principles within the team. Of course, a company is like a living body, it evolves and changes, people leave while new people join, so sometimes we struggle to keep that same level of culture, but I can say for sure that this is the best company I’ve ever worked with.&nbsp;</p>



 You are the mother of two beautiful twins. How did you manage your work while pregnant and what does your schedule look like today?&nbsp; 



<p>I was super supported when I was pregnant. My colleagues, many of whom I consider friends, brought me food, helped solve computer and software-related issues as I tried to work more from home. I left the office in August but continued working remotely, a few hours a day. I took September off and the twins were born in October.</p>



<p>The team has been as supportive of me coming back – that’s why I can efficiently juggle work and motherhood. Currently, I have set hours that align with my nanny’s schedule. It’s never an issue if I have to come in late or leave early, and meetings are scheduled around me, which is why I wanted fixed hours so that expectations could be set in both ways. It’s helpful for my teammates to know when I’ll be in and available and that it doesn’t change from week to week. The kids will be in Kita (Kindertagesstätte, or a nursery school for pre-school children) as of January so I’ll be back part-time as of February.&nbsp;</p>



 How do you balance motherhood and acting as the COO of a thriving startup in a fast-paced city?&nbsp; 



<p>A friend told me that if you work part-time, it will require the same amount of effort and energy as working full time, and I have found that to be helpful and true.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I have to be super focused at work because I know once I’m back at home with the kids, I can’t do any work until the babies are asleep. I also make sure I take time for myself. Every day I do some sort of sports or pilates. I took an online business course with <a href="https://online.hbs.edu/courses/core/">Harvard Business School</a> back in May so I would go from checking in at the office, back home to take care of the kids, put them to bed, exercise, and then study or do homework until midnight. It was crazy!</p>



 Has your leadership style changed since becoming a mother? 



<p>Now that I’m juggling more, I’m definitely more careful with my time. I plan better, attend fewer meetings, and I’m more organized in terms of my own agenda.&nbsp;</p>



 What’s been the most surprising thing about motherhood so far?&nbsp; 



<p>How patient I can be, and how little sleep I need to operate!</p>



 What are some tips or advice that you’d share with new moms going back to work after maternity leave?&nbsp; 



<p>Don’t try to be the best right away, just take your time and take time for yourself. No one is going to expect you to be operating at 100 percent as soon as you’re back, so don’t stress yourself out. Stress can have such negative impacts on your productivity and your mood, which is only going to make things harder at work, and harder at home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would recommend taking fewer responsibilities at the beginning, starting with just one or two projects that you can manage on your own, with realistic deadlines. You’ll find your own rhythm as you ease back into your routine. It was really hard for me to focus the first four weeks after I had the twins, my mind was somewhere else, but slowly it got better and better. Never forget that work-life balance is key – that’s what makes juggling work and motherhood possible. Once you start building a family, your priorities will shift, and I promise you that you won’t regret a single day spent outside of the office to focus on them.&nbsp;<br></p>

					 <p>Trinsic makes verifiable credentials and <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) easy for developers to implement, so it is only fair we make it easy to conceptualize as well! The term “verifiable credentials” can seem a bit technical and overwhelming at first glance. But in reality, verifiable credentials are simpler than you think.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Start with what you know 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Let’s begin with the word “credential.” When we use the word credential, we are talking about any document, card, certificate, etc. that contains information about something. We use credentials every day, including driver’s licenses, passports, diplomas, insurance cards, medical test results, employee badges, and more.<br><br>All of these examples are physical, paper, or plastic credentials that you can hold in your hand. However, a credential becomes a verifiable credential once it is in a standard, digital format which you keep in your phone or the cloud. And that leads to our simple definition of verifiable credentials:</p> 
				 
				 
				 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				Verifiable credentials are standardized, digital certificates that make it easy to share information online in a private and secure way.			</p>
					</blockquote>
				 
				 
				 
				 
					 <p>We say “standardized” because the way verifiable credentials should be built&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">has been standardized</a>&nbsp;by the internet’s leading standards body. That means there is a correct way to create a verifiable credential, and at Trinsic, we make it easy for you to do so.<br></p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 The verifiable credential model 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>When it comes to using verifiable credentials, it important to know these three roles:<br><br></p>  Issuer: The issuer is the person or organization that creates the verifiable credential and gives (“issues”) it to a person, organization, or thing. (e.g., a DMV)  Holder: The holder is the person or organization that holds the verifiable credential in their digital wallet. (e.g., a person who receives a digital driver’s license from the DMV)  Verifier: The verifier is the person or organization that gets information shared with them. They can authenticate the information they receive instantaneously. (e.g., a security agent at the airport checking your license)  <p><br>Often called the “Trust Triangle,” the image below is a classic diagram used to help conceptualize the verifiable credential model.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>An important thing to note is that while the integrity of the information can be verified, the truthfulness of it cannot. So although the verifier needs to trust the source of the credential (ie., the issuer) it doesn’t need to contact the issuer directly in order to verify the information.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 The unique properties 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Verifiable credentials are unique from other kinds of digital documents because they are:<br><br></p>  Portable: With just a few clicks, you can send the credential online to anyone you please. You can also move wallets between different providers if you’d like.  Verifiable: The reason why they are called verifiable credentials is because they allow you to verify the following things: 1) who issued the credential, 2) who the credential was issued to, 3) if the information within the credential has been tampered with, and 4) whether the credential has been revoked.  Private: Through <a href="https://trinsic.id/zero-knowledge-proofs/">zero-knowledge proofs</a>, you can pick and choose what information you want to share on a credential (you don’t have to share all of it).  Tamperproof: Verifiable credentials can’t be altered or forged.   
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Trinsic's role in all of this 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Trinsic is the best way to implement verifiable credentials.<br><br></p>  Simplicity:&nbsp;We make integrating verifiable credentials easy to do.&nbsp;<a href="https://studio.trinsic.id/">Trinsic Studio</a>&nbsp;removes all of the complexity of getting started, and our APIs abstract low-level protocols to help developers get going fast.

The platform recently announced the completion of a $21.6 million funding round backed by Andreessen Horowitz, Electric Capital, and others, as well as the launch of their&nbsp;MainNet.</p><p>Erick Pinos, Ontology Americas Ecosystem Lead,&nbsp;said,</p><blockquote>“Teaming up with NEAR broadens our remit considerably when it comes to delivering state of the art decentralized identity protocols. NEAR has quickly emerged as a leading dApp platform, attracting wide interest from backers and high profile enterprise partners. We share common objectives in terms of broadening the accessibility of enterprise-grade blockchain applications and decentralized identity solutions and look forward to working together.”</blockquote><p>With a primary focus on delivering a fast, user-friendly platform with a unique infrastructure that supports robust cross-chain collaboration, Ontology provides businesses with the tools to design their own blockchain solutions securely. Powered by the Ontology Token (ONT), the distributed collaboration platform allows businesses to enjoy the benefits of smart contracts and tokenization while retaining control of their sensitive data.</p><p>Erik Trautman, CEO of NEAR Foundation said,</p><blockquote>“We are tremendously excited to leverage the technical acumen of the Ontology team, particularly in relation to their bespoke ONT ID 2.0, a very robust decentralized identity solution designed for streamlined cross-chain interoperability. Following our successful MainNet launch, we are keen to strengthen our partner network, and look forward to extending the power of Ontology’s solutions to our growing customer&nbsp;base.”</blockquote><p>The news follows last month’s launch of a new version of ONTO, Ontology’s self-sovereign data wallet, designed to give users the power to control the value of their data, as well as a new upgraded version of ONT&nbsp;ID.</p><blockquote>“At Ontology, we are firmly committed to promoting tangible, real-world DID applications and educating the world on the far-reaching benefits. We look forward to making further contributions to what will become a thriving DID ecosystem globally, and continue showcasing Ontology’s unique DID capabilities,” concluded Pinos.</blockquote> About the NEAR&nbsp;Protocol <p>NEAR’s mission is to enable community-driven innovation to benefit people around the world. NEAR’s platform provides decentralized storage and compute that is secure enough to manage high-value assets like money or identity and performant enough to make them useful for everyday people, putting the power of the Open Web in their&nbsp;hands.</p><p>Technically speaking, NEAR Protocol is a brand new public, proof-of-stake blockchain which is built using a novel consensus mechanism called Doomslug. NEAR Protocol uses a technique called “sharding” which splits the network into multiple pieces so that the computation is done in parallel.

   The topic of validating an OAuth 2.0 access tokens comes up frequently on this blog. Often we talk about how to validate JSON Web Token (JWT) based access tokens; however, this is NOT part of the OAuth 2.0 specification. JWTs are so commonly used that Spring Security supported them before adding support for remotely validating tokens (which is part of the OAuth 2.0 specification.)

  <p>The topic of validating an OAuth 2.0 access tokens comes up frequently on this blog. Often we talk about how to validate JSON Web Token (JWT) based access tokens; however, this is NOT part of the OAuth 2.0 specification. JWTs are so commonly used that Spring Security supported them before adding support for remotely validating tokens (which is part of the OAuth 2.0 specification.)</p>

<p>In this post, you will build a simple application that takes advantage of both types of validation.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

   <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">A free Okta Developer account</a> 
 

 Should I Validate Access Tokens Locally or Remote? 

<p>Whether you should validate access tokens locally (e.g., a JWT) or remotely (per spec) is a question of how much security you need. Often, people jump to, “I need all of the securities!” This statement simply isn’t true—how much security you need should be balanced with other factors like ease of use, cost, and performance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no such thing as perfect security, only varying levels of insecurity.</p>
   
     Salman Rushdie 
   
</blockquote>

<p>The biggest downside to validating a token locally is that your token is, by definition, stale. It is a snapshot of the moment in time when your identity provider (IdP) created the token. The further away you get from that moment, the more likely that token is no longer valid: it could have been revoked, the user could have logged out, or the application that created the token disabled.</p>

<p>Remotely validating tokens are not always ideal, either. Remote validation comes with the cost of adding latency in your application, as you need to add an HTTP request to a remote server every time you need to validate the token.</p>

<p>One way to reduce these concerns is to keep the lifetime of an access token short (say 5 minutes) and validate them locally; this limits the risk of using a revoked token.</p>

<p>There is another option: do both!</p>

 Validate Access Tokens Locally and Remotely! 

<p>By default, Spring Boot applications can be configured to use JWT validation OR opaque validation, simply by <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-security-oauth2-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#specifying-a-token-verification-strategy">configuring a few properties</a>. Using both types of validation in the same application requires a few extra lines of code.</p>

<p>Obviously, you wouldn’t do both on each request; you could validate more sensitive operations remotely and all other requests locally. For example, when updating a user’s contact information, you may want to validate the token remotely, but when viewing the user’s profile information, validate locally. This pattern keeps your application fast, as updating an address or an email happens less frequently than just viewing contact information.</p>

<p>To get started, you will need an OAuth Web application in Okta.</p>

<p>Login in to your Okta admin console, if you just <a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup">created a new account</a>, and have not logged in yet, follow the activation link in your inbox.</p>

<p>Make a note of the Org URL on the top right; I’ll refer to this as <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> in the next section.</p>

<p>Once you are logged in, navigate to the top menu and select Applications -&gt; Add Application. Select Web -&gt; Next.</p>

<p>Give your application a name: “Spring Tokens Example”</p>

<p>Set the Login redirect URIs to <code>https://oidcdebugger.com/debug</code></p>

<p>Check Implicit (Hybrid)</p>

<p>Click Done</p>

<p></p>

<p>Head over to <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&amp;language=java&amp;platformVersion=2.2.6.RELEASE&amp;packaging=jar&amp;jvmVersion=1.8&amp;groupId=com.okta.example&amp;artifactId=spring-token-example&amp;name=spring-token-example&amp;description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&amp;packageName=com.okta.example&amp;dependencies=security,web">start.spring.io</a> and click the Generate button.</p>

<p>Note: The above link populates the following settings:</p>

 
   Group: com.okta.example 
   Artifact: spring-token-example 
   Package name: com.okta.example 
   Dependencies:
     
       Spring Security (security) 
       Spring Web (web) 
     
   
 

<p>Unzip the project and open it in your favorite IDE.</p>

<p>Add two more dependencies to the Maven <code>pom.xml</code> file:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.nimbusds&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;oauth2-oidc-sdk&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;7.3&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Add an <code>OAuth2ClientProperties</code> bean to the <code>SpringTokenExampleApplication</code> class to reuse the standard Spring Security OAuth properties.</p>

   <code>@Bean
OAuth2ClientProperties oAuth2ClientProperties() {
    return new OAuth2ClientProperties();
}
</code>   

<p>Add a simple REST controller with a GET and a POST handler, in <code>src/main/java/com/okta/example/SimpleController.java</code></p>

   <code>package com.okta.example;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class SimpleController {

    @GetMapping("/")
    String hello() {
        return "Hello!";
    }

    @PostMapping("/")
    String helloPost(@RequestParam("message") String message) {
        return "hello: " + message;
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Create a new class that will map a <code>RequestMatcher</code> to the <code>AuthenticationManager</code> (more on this below) <code>src/main/java/com/okta/example/RequestMatchingAuthenticationManagerResolver.java</code></p>

<p>NOTE: This class may be part of a future version of <a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/pull/7366">Spring Security</a>.</p>

   <code>package com.okta.example;

    private AuthenticationManager defaultAuthenticationManager = authentication -&gt; {
        throw new AuthenticationServiceException("Cannot authenticate " + authentication);
    };

    public RequestMatchingAuthenticationManagerResolver
    (LinkedHashMap&lt;RequestMatcher, AuthenticationManager&gt; authenticationManagers) {
        Assert.notEmpty(authenticationManagers, "authenticationManagers cannot be empty");
        this.authenticationManagers = authenticationManagers;

        Assert.notNull(defaultAuthenticationManager, "defaultAuthenticationManager cannot be null");
        this.defaultAuthenticationManager = defaultAuthenticationManager;
    }
}
</code>   

 Configure Spring Security to Validate JWTs and Opaque Tokens 

<p>Everything up until now has been boilerplate, now we get to the fun part!</p>

<p>Create a new <code>ExampleWebSecurityConfigurer</code> class which uses local JWT validation for <code>GET</code> requests, and remote “opaque” validation for all other requests (be sure to read the inline comments):</p>

   <code>package com.okta.example;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.security.oauth2.client.OAuth2ClientProperties;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.authentication.AuthenticationManager;
import org.springframework.security.authentication.AuthenticationManagerResolver;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;

import org.springframework.security.oauth2.server.resource.authentication.OpaqueTokenAuthenticationProvider;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.server.resource.introspection.NimbusOpaqueTokenIntrospector;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.server.resource.introspection.OpaqueTokenIntrospector;
import org.springframework.security.web.util.matcher.RequestMatcher;

import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.LinkedHashMap;
import java.util.List;

@Configuration
public class ExampleWebSecurityConfigurerAdapter extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    // Inject the `OAuth2ClientProperties` we configured in the previous step
    @Autowired
    private OAuth2ClientProperties oAuth2ClientProperties;

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {

        // All routes require authentication
        http.authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated();

        // Configure a custom `AuthenticationManager` to determine 
        // if JWT or opaque token validation should be used
        http.oauth2ResourceServer().authenticationManagerResolver(customAuthenticationManager());
    }

    AuthenticationManagerResolver&lt;HttpServletRequest&gt; customAuthenticationManager() {
        LinkedHashMap&lt;RequestMatcher, AuthenticationManager&gt; authenticationManagers = new LinkedHashMap&lt;&gt;();

        // USE JWT tokens (locally validated) to validate HEAD, GET, and OPTIONS requests
        List&lt;String&gt; readMethod = Arrays.asList("HEAD", "GET", "OPTIONS");
        RequestMatcher readMethodRequestMatcher = request -&gt; readMethod.contains(request.getMethod());
        authenticationManagers.put(readMethodRequestMatcher, jwt());

        // all other requests will use opaque tokens (remotely validated)
        RequestMatchingAuthenticationManagerResolver authenticationManagerResolver 
            = new RequestMatchingAuthenticationManagerResolver(authenticationManagers);

        // Use opaque tokens (remotely validated) for all other requests
        authenticationManagerResolver.setDefaultAuthenticationManager(opaque());
        return authenticationManagerResolver;
    }

    // Mimic the default configuration for JWT validation.
    AuthenticationManager jwt() {
        // this is the keys endpoint for okta
        String issuer = oAuth2ClientProperties.getProvider().get("okta").getIssuerUri();
        String jwkSetUri = issuer + "/v1/keys";

        // This is basically the default jwt logic
        JwtDecoder jwtDecoder = NimbusJwtDecoder.withJwkSetUri(jwkSetUri).build();
        JwtAuthenticationProvider authenticationProvider = new JwtAuthenticationProvider(jwtDecoder);
        authenticationProvider.setJwtAuthenticationConverter(new JwtBearerTokenAuthenticationConverter());
        return authenticationProvider::authenticate;
    }

    // Mimic the default configuration for opaque token validation
    AuthenticationManager opaque() {
        String issuer = oAuth2ClientProperties.getProvider().get("okta").getIssuerUri();
        String introspectionUri = issuer + "/v1/introspect";

        // The default opaque token logic
        OAuth2ClientProperties.Registration oktaRegistration = oAuth2ClientProperties.getRegistration().get("okta");
        OpaqueTokenIntrospector introspectionClient = new NimbusOpaqueTokenIntrospector(
                introspectionUri,
                oktaRegistration.getClientId(),
                oktaRegistration.getClientSecret());
        return new OpaqueTokenAuthenticationProvider(introspectionClient)::authenticate;
    }
}
</code>   

 Better JWT Validation 

<p>Out of the box, Spring Security does minimal validation of the JWT because this is a vendor-specific detail. In addition to the standard JWT validation, Okta recommends validating the issuer and audience claims: <code>iss</code> and <code>aud</code>.</p>

<p>Update the above <code>jwt()</code> method to look like the following:</p>

   <code>AuthenticationManager jwt() {
    // this is the keys endpoint for okta
    String issuer = oAuth2ClientProperties.getProvider().get("okta").getIssuerUri();
    String jwkSetUri = issuer + "/v1/keys";

    NimbusJwtDecoder jwtDecoder = NimbusJwtDecoder.withJwkSetUri(jwkSetUri).build();

    // okta recommends validating the `iss` and `aud` claims
    // see: https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/validate-access-tokens/java/overview/
    List&lt;OAuth2TokenValidator&lt;Jwt&gt;&gt; validators = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    validators.add(new JwtTimestampValidator());
    // Add validation of the issuer claim
    validators.add(new JwtIssuerValidator(issuer));
    validators.add(token -&gt; {
        Set&lt;String&gt; expectedAudience = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();
        // Add validation of the audience claim
        expectedAudience.add("api://default");
        // For new Okta orgs, the default audience is `api://default`, 
        // if you have changed this from the default update this value
        return !Collections.disjoint(token.getAudience(), expectedAudience)
            ? OAuth2TokenValidatorResult.success()
            : OAuth2TokenValidatorResult.failure(new OAuth2Error(
                OAuth2ErrorCodes.INVALID_REQUEST,
                "This aud claim is not equal to the configured audience",
                "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-3.1"));
    });
    OAuth2TokenValidator&lt;Jwt&gt; validator = new DelegatingOAuth2TokenValidator&lt;&gt;(validators);
    jwtDecoder.setJwtValidator(validator);

    JwtAuthenticationProvider authenticationProvider = new JwtAuthenticationProvider(jwtDecoder);
    authenticationProvider.setJwtAuthenticationConverter(new JwtBearerTokenAuthenticationConverter());
    return authenticationProvider::authenticate;
}
</code>   

 Configure and Run Your OAuth 2.0 Application 

<p>We are in the home stretch; the last thing needed for our application is a little configuration.</p>

<p>Update your <code>src/main/resources/application.properties</code> file to include the properties from the previous steps.</p>

   <code>spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.okta.issuer-uri = {yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.client-id = {clientId}
spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.okta.client-secret = {clientSecret}
</code>   

<p>Run the application on the command line:</p>

   <code>./mvnw spring-boot:run
</code>   

<p>Make a curl request to the server:</p>

   <code>curl localhost:8080/ -v
</code>   

<p>This will return something like:</p>

 <code>HTTP/1.1 401
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer
</code> 

<p>A 401 is expected here as we did not provide an access token to the request. There are a few ways to get an access token—which option is right for you depends on where and how you access your REST application. Usually, another application is calling your REST API and that application already has an access token. For testing purposes, we will set up the <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">OIDC Debugger</a>.</p>

 Get a Token with the OIDC Debugger 

<p>Head over to <a href="https://oidcdebugger.com/">https://oidcdebugger.com/</a> and populate the form with the following values:</p>

 
   Authorize URI - <code>{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code> 
   Client ID - <code>{clientId}</code> from the previous step 
   State - <code>this is a test</code> (this can be any value) 
   Response type - select token 
   Use defaults for all other fields 
 

<p>Press the Send Request button.</p>

<p>If you are using an incognito/private browser, this may prompt you to login again. Once the Success page loads, copy the Access token and create an environment variable:</p>

   <code>export TOKEN="&lt;your-access-token-here&gt;"
</code>   

<p>Now that you have a token, you can make another request to your REST API:</p>

   <code>curl localhost:8080/ -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

&gt; Hello!
</code>   

<p>Similarly, we can call the POST endpoint:</p>

   <code>curl -X POST -F 'message=there' localhost:8080/ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"

&gt; hello: there
</code>   

<p>We can perform a simple (unscientific) performance test using the <code>time</code> utility, by prefixing the above commands with <code>time</code>:</p>

   <code>time curl localhost:8080/ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"
time curl -X POST -F 'message=there' localhost:8080/ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}"
</code>   

<p>This data isn’t a great benchmark as both the client and server are running on the same machine, but you can see the first one returned faster.</p>

 <code>0.00s user 0.01s system 65% cpu 0.013 total
0.00s user 0.01s system 4% cpu 0.210 total
</code> 

<p>NOTE: The increased CPU usage is caused by the JWT signature validation.</p>

<p>Enterprise wants to focus on the value identity can bring beyond verified access.</p>
<p>Whilst reducing identity management compliance risk and storage costs, more organizations are giving customers their identity ownership back. They are using intelligent agents, real-time data updates and new conferred trust verification methods to leverage (consented-for) identity data insights for cross-sell and up-sell - and to better service customers, employees and partners.</p>
 
 
<p>Distributed graph technology is enabling this. It guarantees privacy, anonymity and security – ensuring no unauthorized access to any user data. And it solves blockchain scalability, compliance and speed limitations – offering data compliance for both organizations and their stakeholders. A million graph vaults for a million customers – not one database or ledger block holding a million customer records.</p>
<p>We'll explain why intelligence-driven identity verification, sovereign identity ownership and compliant identity security built from the bottom up can offer enterprise the value-add they seek.</p>

  <p>Many B2B technology and service providers approach go-to-market strategy in silos. First, they develop the product and identify the market segmentation, then they create sales and marketing strategies. But buyers increasingly expect more. They seek providers that offer the product they want through their desired purchase experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To understand and meet these needs, sales, product marketing and product management must work together to take a more complete view of their go-to-market strategies. Product marketing is in the right spot to take the lead on this process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[swg_ad id="36456"]</p>
<p>“Greater integration places a premium on internal collaboration, customer experience and data-driven decision making,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/80790">Mark Stanyer</a>, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner. “These are all disciplines that play to the strengths of experienced product marketers.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet, according to Stanyer, many providers take baby steps when it comes to taking a unified approach. What’s getting in the way?</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/analysts-answer-what-challenges-will-product-marketers-face-in-2020/">What Challenges Will Product Marketers Face in 2020</a></p>
 Understand the role of product marketing in technology-centric and sales-centric cultures 
<p>Culture is often the single biggest factor in determining the actual roles and responsibilities of product marketing, which can vary widely between providers. This makes it difficult to align sales, marketing and product management and execute a common go-to-market strategy, especially when company culture favors a specific role.&nbsp;</p>
 Technology-centric culture 
<p>Here, the center of power is the product development organization. Product marketers are often viewed as tactical rather than strategic, mandated to focus on creating collateral, presentations, and sales enablement tools, and staffing booths at tradeshows. They have limited input into enhancements, roadmaps, creating new solutions and launches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sales models are often product-led, where positioning and differentiation are based on technological superiority. This approach tends to work better when selling to IT as opposed to line-of-business buyers because the requirements are generally much more technical.</p>
 Sales-centric culture 
<p>Product marketing may have an even more limited role in a sales-centric culture. In this model, product marketing focuses on demand and lead generation, and creates some sales enablement tools. Because salespeople are the primary interface to the market, customer needs drive the product strategy. However, the market-led sales model often fails to be truly customer-centric, delivering what customers ask for rather than what they need.</p>
<p>As product marketing roles center on generating demand, they end up being filled by individuals without critical product marketing skills like storytelling, market analysis and customer engagement. There also tends to be a fairly frequent pivoting of storyline and product developments as sales chases big deals with specific requirements, thus confusing the message to the market.</p>
<p>Gartner has observed that this lack of expertise around messaging and positioning causes significant issues. Buyers can easily look elsewhere for alternatives more clearly targeted to their specific needs.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/technology-gms-adjust-your-product-strategies-and-vision-for-covid-19/">Adjust Your Product Strategies and Vision for COVID-19</a></p>
<p>To tackle these issues, make product marketing more strategic and expand its responsibility. Here are four actions product marketers can take to coordinate across teams and facilitate buyer-centricity into the go-to-market strategy.</p>
 1. Create consistent, compelling stories to drive high-performing content 
<p>It takes more than writing expertise or intimate knowledge of the product to develop effective messaging.</p>
<p>“The most compelling marketing stories are often the ones that are driven by product marketers, particularly those practitioners who have access to customers, prospects and salespeople,” Stanyer says.</p>
<p>Leverage your acute understanding of the market, the products, the customers and the competition to create a clear marketing story and a unique value proposition.&nbsp;</p>
 2. Focus on down-the-funnel conversions 
<p>Do more than drive activity at the top of the sales funnel. Ensure that leads are likely to convert into revenue and happy customers. By handing off responsibility for demand and lead generation, you can focus your expertise and knowledge on <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/use-multichannel-marketing-to-generate-more-demand/">driving conversions</a>.</p>
 3. Become a key contributor to product strategy 
<p>Get more involved in gathering and prioritizing feature and enhancement requests. But don’t simply provide a laundry list of feedback to product management and product development. Frame the argument in terms of how it advances market leadership, offers competitive advantage and provides significant revenue opportunity.</p>
 4. Coordinate cross-team participation in key activities 
<p>Sales, marketing and product management should all be involved in segmentation, win/loss analysis and sales enablement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, although product marketing might have direct responsibility for win/loss analysis, sales has to be involved in the design and implementation of the process, and product management has to be committed to using the data to inform roadmap decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s very tempting to revert to cultural norms. Product marketing can use data to drive consensus and smart decision making, but cannot impose itself on others. It must demonstrate how it will create value across teams by, for example, becoming a “trusted” advisor to product management. Additionally, clear organizational ownership of specific objectives must be defined so each team knows each other’s responsibilities.</p>

  <p>Arm processors have been in the news lately, and it’s causing confusion and worries about processor performance for some folks. After Apple announced its plan to switch to Arm-based processors, I heard people (incorrectly!) speculating the performance would be similar to a Raspberry Pi. Java on Arm is nothing new, but we are seeing increased Arm investment from cloud vendors. Amazon recently updated its Arm offerings, and Microsoft is working on porting the JVM to Arm64 for Windows (no doubt for future Azure support).</p>

<p>In this post, I’ll share the Java benchmarks I took on various AWS EC2 instances, and, just for fun, on my laptop.</p>
 
   Amazon a1.large (ARMv8 Cortex-A72, 2 Cores, 4GB RAM) 
   Amazon m6g.medium (ARMv8 Neoverse-N1, 1 Core, 4GB RAM) 
   Amazon t3.medium (Intel Xeon Platinum 8259CL, 1 Core / 2 Threads, 4GB RAM) 
   Apple MacBook Pro (Intel i9 2.4GHz, 8 Core / 16 Threads, 64GB RAM) 
 

<p>NOTE: The Arm trademark was previously written in all caps, “ARM”, but is now referred to as “Arm”.</p>

 A Note About Benchmarks 

<p>Benchmarks are just numbers. They serve as a starting point when you are figuring out the compute power you need for your own application. All applications are different, your workload will likely have different characteristics than these benchmarks. The only way to figure out how your application will perform on a different system is to try to test it out!</p>

<p>For these tests, I tried to compare three different AWS offerings that are similar and have comparable on-demand pricing. There are some differences though. The a1.large instance is from Amazon’s first-generation ARM processors, whereas the m6g.medium is the current Arm series, and the t3.medium is an Intel x86_64 processor.</p>

<p>To keep things consistent, all of these benchmarks used Amazon Corretto 11.0.7.10.1 JVM, with the default GC configuration, and with the tests run through <a href="https://www.phoronix-test-suite.com/">Phoronix Test Suite</a>.</p>

 The Benchmarks! 

<p>In almost all cases the a1.large instance performed the worst, and my MacBook the best. This isn’t particularly interesting, so I’m going to focus my analysis on the differences between the t3.medium and the m6g.medium instances.</p>

 Machine Learning 

<p>First up, we have a test based on Apache Spark’s MLlib which uses a random forest algorithm.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this test, the t3.medium is 15% faster than the m6g.medium.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Spark alternating least squares (ALS) benchmark is one of the few tests where both the Arm servers outpaced the t3.medium.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In the Spark Naive Bayes algorithm test, the m6g.medium was 8% faster than the t3.</p>

<p>Winner: m6g.medium. This was almost too close to call, but in the words of Meat Loaf, “Two Out of Three Ain’t Bad.”</p>

 

 

 Processing Power 

<p>This batch of benchmarks focus on compute-heavy operations. The first two use functional “actors” programing from the <a href="https://shamsimam.github.io/papers/2014-agere-savina.pdf">Savina Actors Benchmark Suite</a>, and the rest focus on math-based operations.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This first test shows the t3.medium has a 20% lead over the m6g.medium.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Interestingly, in this test, both the m6g and the t3 perform about the same.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Spark PageRank test shows the m6g performs 65% faster than the t3.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The m6g also outperformed the t3 by 22% when calculating Fourier transforms.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The t3.medium narrowly wins the sparse matrix multiplication tests by 3%.</p>

<p>Winner: m6g.medium</p>

 Threads and Concurrency 
<p>For many of us building web applications, concurrency is critical as your web server handles many different requests at once. This set of tests highlights the differences between the number of vCPUs in each system—the m6g.medium only has one, the a1.large and the t3.medium both have two, and the MacBook Pro has 16.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This first test uses two threads, so naturally, the t3 is about 34% faster than the m6g.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The Twitter HTTP Finagle test starts a small HTTP server and creates a number of clients equal to the number of vCPU cores plus one. The HTTP server has the number of CPUs*2.  This is going to create a bit of thread contention, which likely explains these results.</p>

<p>Winner: t3.medium (This one was not a fair fight.)</p>

 Pricing 

<p>At the end of the day, which system you pick may come down to a balance of price and performance. The on-demand pricing for an m6g instance (medium, large, xlarge, 2xlarge) was about 8.5% cheaper than the corresponding t3 instance.</p>

<p>Winner: m6g.medium</p>

 Conclusion 

<p>The overall winner of these benchmarks is my MacBook Pro! Joking aside, the difference between Amazon’s second-generation Arm processors and the equivalent Intel processor wasn’t what I expected when I started writing this post. If I had to pick between t3.medium and the m6g.medium, I’d say the overall winner of this showdown is the Arm m6g.medium.</p>

<p>As I mentioned at the start of this post, all of this info needs to be taken with a grain of salt.  Your Java applications will perform differently than these benchmarks, you will need to make your own conclusion to figure out if switching to Arm is right for you. The biggest challenge in switching from x86_64 to Arm64 is making sure your native dependencies are available—but this is much less of an issue nowadays as both Java and Linux distros have been supporting Arm for years.</p>

 The GiD Report#121 — What we learned from the Big Tech antitrust hearing <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-120-how-persistent-identity-can-shape-better-online-communities-7ed6daaad889">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we have for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  What we learned from the antitrust hearing  Tiktok  Stuff happens   1. As everyone already knows by now, the big news of the week was the antitrust hearing in DC, attended by the Big 4 tech CEOs of Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple. As is typical, these hearings are hardly conclusive. YouTube: House Judiciary<p>What’s atypical especially in our current political environment is to have something both sides can actually get together on and while they often came from different angles, there’s a general consensus that this conversation is super necessary.</p><p>And it’s the type of conversation that will help define competition, innovation, and even consumer preferences in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>Let’s be clear. None of these companies are going anywhere. That was made readily apparent by <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-624bc8f7-fb1f-4c4e-9d39-5cf041af45a1.html">their earnings report the day after</a> (Google’s lackluster showing notwithstanding).</p><p>And frankly, they shouldn’t.</p><p>But this is certainly the beginning of a long term reorganization of a technological landscape. It might happen because of regulators taking bold action. It might happen because of consumers shifting their expectations and preferences. It might happen because of innovation emerging elsewhere. Whatever the case, it’s happening. It’s also necessary. We’ve learned plenty from this last cycle of Big Tech. We’ve gotten a lot out of it. And we’ve also learned some important lessons about the double edged sword that is progress.</p><p>So we also know we can do a little bit&nbsp;better.</p><p>Anyway, here’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-e24f4690-028f-4f39-9ba3-af1019b33b54.html">Axios</a>:</p><blockquote>House lawmakers aired an enormous array of grievances with the CEOs of Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple Wednesday, throwing everything in their arsenal at four of the most powerful men in the world for six hours, Axios’ Kyle Daly&nbsp;reports.</blockquote><blockquote>Quick take: The antitrust hearing, which wandered far afield at times, didn’t nail a case that these companies are harmful monopolies. But the representatives succeeded in wringing some surprising admissions from the executives about how they wield their market power, providing ammunition for regulators now conducting investigations — and possibly a spur for Congress to strengthen antitrust law for the digital&nbsp;era.</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>Facebook: Panel Democrats said the social network’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were plainly anticompetitive — that the company made the deals to stop Instagram from becoming a competitor to its main platform and WhatsApp from becoming a competitor to its messaging service. (CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Facebook had no idea the two would become such juggernauts when it bought&nbsp;them.)</blockquote><blockquote>…</blockquote><blockquote>All the companies, subcommittee chair David Cicilline said, have become bottlenecks for distribution, using their chokehold over data to surveil potential competitors and their control over technologies to extend their&nbsp;power.</blockquote><p>Here’s <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/scoring-the-tech-ceos-the-informations-tech-briefing">The Information</a>:</p><blockquote>Perhaps the most damning episodes of the hearing involved disclosure of internal company emails that appeared to support the politicians’ contention that the big tech companies used their size to squash competitors. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat who represents the Seattle area, said Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom confided in an investor that he was worried Facebook would go into “destroy mode” if Instagram didn’t sell. — Martin&nbsp;Peers</blockquote><p>Cool NYU guy Scott Galloway provided <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/fire-fawning">a preview of events that outlined the sheer size of the entities that we’re dealing with</a> while also providing (much better) hypothetical questions to grill our favorite tech&nbsp;bosses.</p><p>Check out these&nbsp;charts:</p><p>Likewise, new efforts to take on the titans has&nbsp;waned:</p><p>Of course, on the surface, it’s pretty clear that Tech has gotten monstrously Big, while crowding out new entrants with their sheer scale — sometimes underhandedly.</p><p>But maybe the positive slant is also just how much tech has transformed our economy and our lives in the last few decades — that seismic shift from the physical to the digital, data now overtaking Oil as the greatest modern value proposition.</p><p>To put it plainly, this is well and truly the tech&nbsp;era.</p><p>The difference here though — say, compared to a time when the biggest companies were sucking petroleum out of the ground is that tech is malleable. There are constraints in the physical world that govern how things are played. In the digital one, there’s a lot more room to define the rules of the&nbsp;game.</p><p>That’s what this next chapter will be all about. How do we rewrite those rules in a way that optimizes incentives and balances power for individuals and communities — from both a regulatory and platform perspective. And consumers will have choices to make as certain core values come to the&nbsp;fore.</p><p>The thing is, we’ve watched this movie&nbsp;before.</p><p>There were a lot of kings back in the day. Today, there are still some kings. But there’s also a lot more democracy.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/scoring-the-tech-ceos-the-informations-tech-briefing">Scoring the Tech CEOs: The Information’s Tech&nbsp;Briefing</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/big-tech-marshals-a-right-leaning-army-of-allies-for-antitrust-fight-155d5760-86d4-4ce0-9cda-734dbc95e252.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">Big Tech marshals a right-leaning army of allies for antitrust fight</a>  <a href="https://www.profgalloway.com/fire-fawning">Fire &amp; Fawning | No Mercy / No&nbsp;Malice</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-facebook-boycotters-lobby-lawmakers-on-antitrust-4816702f-e9bc-41ae-a2c4-1201e65873cd.html">Scoop: Facebook boycotters lobby lawmakers on antitrust</a>  <a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=3113&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">Online Platforms and Market Power, Part 6: Examining the Dominance of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and&nbsp;Google</a>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/house-antitrust-investigation-documents/?tpcc=ECTW2020">Secret documents from US antitrust probe reveal big tech’s plot to control or crush the competition — TechCrunch</a>   2.

					 <p>I have been a co-founder of various cybersecurity and blockchain-based ventures in digital identity and personal data protection. I am also the Chair of the Sovrin Steward Council and an ex-officio Board of Trustees member at the <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin Foundation</a>. My passion and motivation are to leverage the <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust over IP</a> stack to develop solutions that will have a profound and lasting impact on humanity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My latest venture, <a href="http://www.didx.co.za/">DIDx</a>, focuses on SSI and is a <a href="https://sovrin.org/stewards/">Founding Steward</a> of the Sovrin Network and a <a href="https://trustoverip.org/members/">Founding Contributing Member</a> of the Trust over IP Foundation.</p>

					 <p>Globally, one out of five young people between the ages of 15-24 live in Africa and are largely underemployed or at worst, are unemployed. According to the African Development Bank, youth unemployment occurs at a rate that is more than twice of that for adults in most African countries. Many of these individuals are unable to secure jobs due to a lack of education, experience, and financial means. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of decent job opportunities that could use employees to their full potential in most African countries. Skills needed in Sub-Saharan Africa are shifting, and the region’s educational system is underprepared, resulting in a skills mismatch between the skills being acquired and those required by companies.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Our aim is to unlock the youth’s potential across the African continent and beyond by integrating privacy-preserving personalized learning pathways across the <a href="https://www.yoma.africa/">Yoma platform</a>. Yoma, a youthagency marketplace, aims to use AI to match youth with individualized learning pathways, impact tasks to positively contribute to their community, and jobs based on their aspirations and psychometric profile. Youth are incentivized to participate via a digital token that can be redeemed in a physical or intellectual marketplace. Each individual youth has a digital identity wallet that contains their engagement and certificates, thus building a digital CV that is verifiable through blockchain technology.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>The Yoma marketplace brings together youth, NGOs/grassroots organizations, governmental youth agencies, social impact investors, corporate, SMEs, educational providers, and more. Yoma is supported by a strong group of collaborators such as <a href="https://www.unicef.org/">UNICEF</a>, <a href="https://www.didx.co.za/">DIDx</a>, <a href="https://rlabs.org/">Rlabs</a> and <a href="https://app.cartedo.com/">Cartedo</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A brief explainer video of Yoma can be found below.</p>

					 <p>The Yoma concept was relevant prior to the COVID-19 crisis but given the disproportionate impact on young people’s learning and employment, there is an even greater need for a solution like Yoma.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One of the pathways into the Yoma platform was via a COVID-19 <a href="https://app.cartedo.com/project/8/covid-19-challenge">UNICEF innovation challenge</a> implemented by <a href="https://app.cartedo.com/sign_in">Cartedo</a>, an online design thinking platform. Users who completed the challenge were redirected to the Yoma platform to acquire their certificate of completion. This UNICEF innovation challenge aimed to support youth agency during the COVID-19 pandemic through critical soft-skill development and by identifying high potential individuals whose ideas could be supported and developed further. The core goals for the challenge were to: 1) Give youth a voice, 2) Provide access to credible information, 3) Drive awareness around COVID-19, 4) Develop critical soft skills and future-readiness, and 5) Enhance employability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The challenge was well received with 85,000 youth showing interest, 35,000 starting the challenge, and 9,500 who completed the challenge. For all youth that completed the challenge, Yoma issued a verifiable credential as a proof of completion and as the first verifiable credential added to their verifiable, digital CV.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>An explainer video of the UNICEF COVID-19 challenge can be found below.</p>

					 <p>Trinsic provides a full-stack self-sovereign identity platform leveraged by Yoma. Yoma currently makes use of the cloud wallet and credentialing APIs to provide youth with digital identity wallets into which Yoma issues verifiable credentials to develop their verifiable, digital CVs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The speed of implementation required by Yoma made Trinsic a preferred choice as most of the hard work is already done and ready for consumption. Future iterations of the Yoma ToIP stack implementation will be focused on a blended approach where Trinsic and open-source SSI components will be made available to Yoma ecosystem partners.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We decided to develop on the Sovrin Network as it was purpose-built to solve the pressing problem of SSI. DIDx has a long history of working with Sovrin, and it was the obvious and preferred choice of technology for us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That said, Yoma might spin up its own Indy network in the future, and ongoing analysis will contribute to our long-term strategy and decision-making. For the foreseeable future, Trinsic and the Sovrin Network are a part of our technology stack.</p>

					 <p>In addition to our success with the UNICEF COVID-19 challenge, Yoma recently won the joint <a href="https://toolkit-digitalisierung.de/en/smartdevelopmenthack/winners/">EU/BMZ #SmartDevelopmentHack</a> to accelerate the development and adoption of Yoma with <a href="https://www.atingi.org/">atingi</a> as an ecosystem partner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Future challenges are already planned and will soon launch on Yoma, spanning multiple countries with increased access to opportunities for youth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Given the COVID-19 crisis, the concept and value of the Yoma platform is more relevant than ever, and implementation must be accelerated. Therefore, as part of the #SmartDevelopmentHack, the Yoma initiative has committed to reaching 1.5M youth within 24 months.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>(End of interview)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you are an African youth interested in building your digital CV through the Yoma platform, <a href="https://app.yoma.africa/auth/create-account">get started</a> by creating a Yoma account.

<p>When e-cigarettes first hit the market, they were touted as a less nicotine intensive alternative to cigarettes and as a way to help those struggling to quit to make the leap. As with any new popular innovation, opportunist players entered the field, bringing along with them counterfeit products and youth-targeted marketing tactics. <br><br>According to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-44295336">BBC and Euromonitor</a>, the number of vapers increased from seven million in 2011 to 41 million by 2018. They project that this number will grow to 55 million globally by next year. As the world leader in the tobacco sector, every major tobacco company utilizes <a href="https://www.hauni.com/de/home/">Hauni</a> equipment, and as they watched the market’s exponential growth materialize before their eyes, they chose to use their position within the industry to push for stricter guidelines and safer products to protect minors.</p>



 Hauni for consumer safety 



<p>The Hauni Vaping Technologies team saw a few key issues happening in the space, including the refilling of pods with illegal liquids, the use of flavors that appealed to younger people, and the teen vaping epidemic in the US. Dangerous open tank systems and faulty devices were the cause of over 2,000 hospitalizations last year, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control</a>.</p>



<p>“The industry’s big players are serious about consumer safety but because it’s a regulated product, it’s difficult to solve the problem,” says Dr. Joseph Capone, the Digital Program Manager. “We said ‘Look, if we’re going to do e-cigarettes then we’re going to do right.’ That’s when we reached out to Authenteq about integrating into the app, to give users the ability to not only control their vaping experience but also to give us the ability to secure the whole experience.”</p>



 Nicotine industry, innovation, and age verification 



<p>Nicotine is classified as a tobacco substance meaning that e-cigarette manufacturers have to go through the whole battery of tests, both lengthy and expensive, that pharmaceutical companies do because nicotine is technically a pharmaceutical product.</p>



<blockquote><p>“That’s one reason why there’s been little innovation in the sector since 2014. The products on the market today are pretty much all the same because they base themselves on an approved product. It’s very difficult to get approval for a new product and it’s very expensive bringing this kind of product to market because you need approval in every country.” </p>– Dr. Joseph Capone, Digital Program Manager at Hauni&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>In addition to building an automatable, fully digital, and less harmful product, the Vaping Technologies team has been leveraging data to create in-depth profiles. They analyze 40 different data points per puff. Some of these data points, including preheat time, energy time, and total voltage are designed to enhance the user’s vaping experience. Other data points like pressure and puff duration are crucial to restricting minors from using the products. A female, or younger user, inhales less deeply than a heavy smoker or a healthy man, according to their data. By comparing and analyzing these different interdependent data points, unique user profiles are created as are generational unique profiles.</p>



<p>“Teenagers are really smoking because they think it’s cool, not because they need a nicotine hit,” says Capone. “Teenagers vape much differently than somebody who was a smoker and has switched to vaping. They are doing what is called grazing. Their puff count or frequency is very high, and the puff volume is very small.”</p>



<p>“A smoker who has switched and is an adult will puff five to seven seconds, take a 30-second break, and then take another five to seven second inhale,” he continues. “This puff topography is very unique to each person but also unique for different segments. Of course, it’s all statistical but if we’re 92 percent accurate, it’s better to turn off a device when we suspect it’s a teenager then to allow a teenager to vape.”</p>



 Leading the change to protect minors 



<p>The legislation that has been enacted thus far focuses solely on the purchasing of e-cigarettes, but Capone and his team think that usage must be monitored and legislated in order to truly protect minors. As more consumers look to purchase these devices online, imbuing age, and identity at the very beginning of the process is the only way to ensure this. <a href="https://authenteq.com/authenteq-identity-verification/">Authenteq’s age and identity verification</a> are integrated into their app for precisely this reason, meaning that a user must verify themselves before a device can even be activated. Once verified, if the device usage deviates from the user’s profile, a spot ID check is mandated. If the identity does not match the ID used to activate the device, it is disabled.</p>



<p>Authenteq and Hauni’s Vaping Technologies team are also looking at further protection measures, including the possibility of incorporating lip imprints into the user profile.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“A lip print is just like a fingerprint. It’s unique to every person and it never changes throughout your entire life. If we could manage to map a groove pattern, a lip signature could be created so that only that person who activates it can ever use it.” </p>– Dr. Joseph Capone, Digital Program Manager at Hauni&nbsp;</blockquote>



<p>Capone sees the progress they’ve made as applicable to other industries as well. The technology they’ve built is not exclusive to vaping liquids and could be implemented for asthma inhalers and CBD or THC devices used for therapeutic purposes. Identity verification can validate users, but also match users to the proper prescriptions. In addition to protecting minors and preventing misuse, there is also general risk mitigation in these methods.</p>



<blockquote><p>“A lot of organizations have no idea what is possible today in the areas of identity and age verification, they don’t realize what is possible with data now to identify early indicators of substance abuse or addiction. The whole vice sector needs more information about technologies that are available.”</p>– Dr. Joseph Capone, Digital Program Manager at Hauni&nbsp;</blockquote>

  <p>To better protect employees, an organization decides to distribute wearables among workers when they return to the office following COVID-19. The devices measure proximity to other wearables and emit a small audio signal as a reminder to social distance.</p>
<p>The wearables don’t collect or process any data, and they don’t track where the wearer has been. The result is a wearable that enables the employer to provide employees both safety and privacy without having to trade one for the other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The trade-off would be, how much do we invade privacy to offer a certain level of safety?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While balancing safety, productivity and privacy — three goals seemingly at odds — creates dilemmas for employers, there are ways to achieve all three without trade-offs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Take privacy versus safety for example,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/61755">Bart Willemsen</a>, VP Analyst, Gartner. “The trade-off would be, how much do we invade privacy to offer a certain level of safety? It's making a concession between both values. It would actually be better to try and fulfill both values.”</p>
<p>Download podcast: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/podcasts/thinkcast/balance-safety-privacy-productivity-when-employees-return-to-work">Balance Safety, Privacy and Productivity When Employees Return to Work</a></p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>As employees return to work, employers are <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/3-actions-for-ethical-data-collection-during-pandemics/">collecting more data</a> to ensure both safety and productivity. By taking a risk-based approach, which considers what data is being collected and how it’s being used, organizations can<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-technology-can-curb-the-spread-of-covid-19/"> protect employees</a> while managing privacy risk.</p>
<p>“The higher the risk, the more important it is to justify that a particular solution is indeed balanced and proportional to the risk we are assessing,” says Willemsen.</p>
<p>Here are six principles to guide risk-based employee data collection.</p>
 No. 1: Purposeful processing 
<p>If you do decide to collect data, make sure it has a predefined purpose. Once data has fulfilled its purpose, there’s no reason to keep collecting and storing it. Removing data can also lead to significant cost savings for the organization when it comes to storage.</p>
 No. 2: Proportionality 
<p>Default to the least invasive measure possible to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/7-security-areas-to-focus-on-during-covid-19/">satisfy your goals</a>. Once a measure becomes disproportional to the risk or the purpose can be achieved in a different way, remove it.</p>
 No. 3: Subsidiarity 
<p>Ask yourself, what amount of data is enough? Can you achieve the same purpose with less personal data or without processing personal data at all? Only collect the minimum amount necessary.&nbsp;</p>

 No. 4: Transparency 
<p>Don't do anything in the dark. Be abundantly clear to staff what data you collect, for what purposes and who has access to it.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/are-your-new-remote-workers-visible-to-security-operations/">Are Your New Remote Workers Visible to Security Operations?</a></p>
 No. 5: Mandatory or not 
<p>Apply measures equally for all staff to prevent discrimination and protect autonomy.&nbsp;</p>
 No. 6: Risk-based 
<p>Make decisions in light of the risks you are trying to mitigate, and acknowledge that decisions are subject to change. Don’t hesitate to retrace steps taken early and adjust accordingly as things change.</p>
<p>When it comes to returning to the workplace, every decision leads to a certain risk. Following these principles equips employers to assess and mitigate privacy risk by making decisions based on the current situation and continue to measure the relevance of decisions as conditions change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/tolbert">John Tolbert</a></p><p>MITRE recently published the detailed results of their second round of tests. This test pitted APT29 malware and methods against <a href="https://attackevals.mitre.org/evaluations.html?round=APT29" title="Cybersecurity Vendors">21 cybersecurity vendors</a>. The MITRE testing is an excellent benchmark for comprehensively exercising Endpoint Protection (EPP) and Endpoint Detection &amp; Response (EDR) tools in real-world scenarios where organizations find themselves under attack by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). MITRE describes the environments, methodology, and operation flow of their testing regime in great detail <a href="https://attackevals.mitre.org/APT29/" title="Mitre testing regime">here</a>. The raw results are available for review, and they have created a <a href="https://attackevals.mitre.org/data_analysis_tool.html" title="data analysis">tool to help with data analysis</a>.</p>
<p>Many of the participating vendors have analyzed and posted their interpretations of this latest round of testing. In general, each vendor’s internal analysis tends to focus on their areas in which they do well. In this article, we will call out the most serious of the commonly missed detections of specific procedures in the framework.</p>
<p>There was a wide range in the success rates experienced by vendors, with higher success rates equating to low values for missed detections. As expected, there is a fairly strong correlation between a vendor’s product having specific techniques for detection of procedures and steps in the ATT&amp;CK framework and catching a would-be malicious actor utilizing those actions.</p>
<p>The ATT&amp;CK framework features a matrix of 11 tactics and 171 techniques that adversaries use to conduct a cyber-attack. MITRE has just released an <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v7/" title="MITRE update">updated version</a> of the ATT&amp;CK framework which contains sub-techniques. The techniques and sub-techniques depicted generally relate to application or system level API and/or procedure calls. Legitimate software including operating systems use these API and system calls to accomplish tasks on behalf of users. This is what makes the job of anti-malware and other security tools difficult: they must distinguish the “intent” of the calling code. For example, encrypting files is most often a legitimate operation to protect data. However, ransomware also attempts to encrypt files. How does anti-malware decide to allow some operations to proceed and stop others?</p>
 What is the code’s intent? 
<p>Intent can be discerned by context. Context can be probabilistically inferred by looking at the calling process: which user account launched it, how long has it been running, have other processes injected it, what other calls precede or follow it in the queue, etc. Security vendors build detection models using analysis of code and memory enhanced by Machine Learning (ML) to make these kinds of determinations. Security tools are also informed by collections of threat intelligence and Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).</p>
<p>The following list of techniques are those which many vendor products were not able to detect in the latest round of MITRE testing, and those which we consider the most consequential if exploited.</p>
 Missed detections 
 
 Sandbox evasion techniques such as checking BIOS, manufacturer, model, version 
 Attempts to use PowerShell to get system, domain, logged-on username, running processes, anti-malware presence, and endpoint firewall status 
 Reconnaissance of lateral assets using PowerShell 
 Manipulation of access token for PowerShell 
 Enumerating files in directories commonly used for user data; enumerating media files 
 Enumerating registry keys 
 Capturing screenshots and clipboard contents (lesser instances of keylogging) 
 Decryption of Chrome browser username and password databases 
 Creation of pre-exfiltration staging directories 
 Simple attempts to encrypt C2 traffic using standard crypto techniques 
 Reading user files, while connected to C2 
 Encryption of user data files 
 Exfiltration over non-standard TCP ports 
 Exfiltration over HTTPS 
 Establishment of persistence via javavmtsup 
 
 Recommendations for vendors 
<p>Threat actors are constantly improving and adapting to innovations in security products. Thus, security products with deficiencies in detecting items on the preceding list should focus on:</p>
 
 Anti-evasion: malware detonation sandboxes are standard features in EPP and NDR products, but they can’t help if malware is designed to lay dormant if it can figure out that it’s in a sandbox. Sandbox evasion used to be limited to the most sophisticated malware, but it has become more of a commodity feature. 
 PowerShell scrutiny: PowerShell is a powerful and useful tool, as its name implies. However, given the massive proliferation of file-less malware that uses PowerShell (as a means to avoid detection by signature-based and static file scanners), security solutions must scrutinize every invocation by pulling more context for deeper examination. 
 Recon and lateral movement: APT actors learned to go low and slow to avoid setting off SIEM alerts. Extending data retention periods can make it easier to group what may seem to be outliers into suspicious incidents. For example, seemingly random enumeration requests over long periods may point to a concerted effort to map resources. 
 Secure the browser username/password database. Users often rely on browsers for generating, storing, and protecting credentials. Besides data exfiltration by APTs, insecure browser password databases can lead to Account Takeovers (ATOs) for users’ personal information. 
 Stop staging: Users don’t often move and rename data files, then package it all up to be sent elsewhere. 
 Lock down comms: Applications sending traffic on non-standard ports and/or to suspicious IPs should send up red flags, even if the traffic volume is very low. Continuously updated high quality threat intelligence can mitigate this risk. 
 Encryption scrutiny: Ransomware is still rampant. While many garden varieties can be interdicted by most security tools, ransomware authors are also evolving their tools to defeat ransomware protection. For example, some ransomware groups use APT tactics of making an initial silent compromise, surveying enterprise assets, staging the malicious payloads in various places around the target environment, then simultaneously detonating them to limit the effectiveness of anti-ransomware prevention and detection techniques. Some security tools need to view ransomware in the same way as APTs and combine detection and prevention methods to help at-risk clients. 
 
<p>The good news is that several endpoint and network security vendors did very well in this run of the MITRE ATT&amp;CK evaluation. We have noted this in our latest research: <a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/mc80508/endpoint-protection-detection-and-response/" title="Market Compass Endpoint Protection">Market Compass Endpoint Protection Detection &amp; Response</a>. While the MITRE test is significant in that it covers EPP and EDR, it is only a single test. There are other independent test regimes that should be considered when evaluating endpoint security solutions. If your organization is considering upgrading or replacing EPP or EDR, or adding Network Detection &amp; Response (NDR), KuppingerCole can assist with reviewing your requirements and crafting an RFP based on our up-to-date research. Also, for cybersecurity vendors that need help in prioritizing their product or service roadmaps, we can provide tailored advisory services as well.

<p>Over the past few months, I have been working on a side project that I am really excited about. If you know me well, you probably know I enjoy using my side projects to help other teams meet their goals (and if you don’t, I am a Senior Security H@X0R at Okta. Check out my blog posts <a href="https://developer.okta.com/blog/authors/micah-silverman">here</a>.)</p>

<p>So, when the Okta certification team asked me to help them build a cool developer certification experience, I did not hesitate to say yes.</p>

<p>Before I tell you more about the new exam and the role I played, I want to remind you about the three well-known certifications Okta already has. The Okta Certified Professional, Administrator, and Consultant certifications have been around for almost four years. You can learn more about these three certifications at <a href="https://www.okta.com/certification">https://www.okta.com/certification</a>. They’ve gained quite a bit of attention in four short years from employers and identity experts around the globe. In fact, all three of these certifications are ranked 1st, 2nd, and 6th highest-paying IT certifications worldwide according to <a href="http://certmag.com/salary-survey-2020-new-salary-survey-75/">Certification Magazine’s 2020 Highest Paying IT Certification</a>.</p>

<p>Today, Okta is releasing its first-ever certification for developers who use Okta, the <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/developer-exam-study-guide/">Okta Developer Certification</a>.</p>

<p>The new Okta Developer Certification was designed and built by developers for developers. It is a two-part exam.</p>

<p>In Part I, exam takers are presented with 45 discrete option multiple-choice (DOMC) questions. Those questions focus on knowledge a developer should have in respect to Okta Customer Identity products.</p>

<p>Part II is a web app that guides you through the practical application of Okta’s APIs. If you’ve ever sat for a developer certification exam, you may have had the experience of having to dredge up reference material from memory. This is not that. Instead, you complete use cases and tasks in the form of API calls against an Okta org that’s created just for you during the exam. This is why I was eager to build the app for the certification team. I wanted developers to have an experience that would make the exam delightful and not just a box to check on a resume.</p>

<p>A use case begins with some general instructions that apply to all the tasks in that use case.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Each task within a use case should be completed in the order presented as tasks build on each other.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You have 60 minutes to complete Part I and 90 minutes to complete Part II. When you finish Part II, you are presented with feedback about how you did on the exam (pass/fail).</p>

<p>NOTE: Once you submit Part II, any additional changes you make to your Okta org will not be counted in the grading of your exam.</p>

<p>The release of the new Okta Developer Exam is timely. For Okta, providing developers with the right tools and services is a strong priority. The Developer Exam experience is topnotch. But, don’t take my word for it. Take the exam and use the feedback feature to let us know what you think.</p>

<p>If you are a developer who uses Okta on a regular basis, I encourage you to pursue the Okta Developer Certification. You’re already building these skills and using them for your work—why not make it official on your resume and LinkedIn profile? The developer exam covers real-world relevant topics. Learn more about the new Okta Developer Exam <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/developer-exam-study-guide/">here</a>, and contact the Okta Certification team at certification@okta.com if you have any questions.</p>

  <p>Authentication is an important part of today’s mobile applications, but securely implementing authentication in a mobile app can be a daunting task. In this article, you will learn how to create a basic cross-platform application with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/">Xamarin.Forms</a> and use the <code>WebAuthenticator</code> class from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/essentials/web-authenticator?tabs=android">Xamarin.Essentials</a> together with Okta to quickly and easily add user login to your mobile app.</p>

<p>To continue you will need:</p>

 
   A basic knowledge of C# 
   <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/">Visual Studio 2019</a> 
   An <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer Account</a> (free forever, to handle your OAuth needs) 
   An Android or iPhone device or an emulator for testing (For the article, we show Android as an example but this will work for either platform) 
 

 Create a Xamarin.Forms App with Xamarin.Essentials 

<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/">Xamarin</a> is a framework from Microsoft for building cross-platform mobile apps from one shared source code, written in C#, and compiled to each platform’s runtime. Xamarin.Forms is an abstraction on that, enabling developers to share the UI code as well. Xamarin.Essentials is a NuGet package providing cross-platform APIs for accessing and using native platform capabilities. In this article I will show you how to build a simple Xamarin.Forms app and add authentication to it.</p>

<p>Xamarin.Forms is now included in Visual Studio! Create a new project by clicking File&gt;New Project in Visual Studio, select Mobile App (Xamarin.Forms), and click Next. Name the app OktaAuth and click Create. On the next window, select Blank and click OK.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Visual Studio will automatically create a solution with three projects: <code>OktaAuth.Android</code> for Android, <code>OktaAuth.iOS</code> for iOS, and <code>OktaAuth</code> for shared code and user interface. The projects already include Xamarin.Essentials out of the box - however, the included version doesn’t have the <code>WebAuthenticator</code> class, so you will need to update it to the latest available version which, as of the publish date of this post, is 1.5.3.2</p>

<p>Now, run the app on your attached mobile device (or in the simulator) and you should see a screen like this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Next, it’s time to secure your users login!</p>

 Xamarin.Essentials Auth Flow with an External Identity Provider 

<p>I will use Okta to easily and securely implement user authentication so that I don’t have to implement it from scratch or roll my own identity management. Okta supports user authentication, multi-factor authentication, social authentication as well as all OpenID connect flows out of the box—so it can take care of all the scenarios you might ever need.</p>

<p>In the sample app, I will use Okta’s browser-based OpenID Connect flow to securely authenticate the user via the native browser installed on the device. Using an external browser is the most secure way to authenticate and allows you to log in automatically if you are already signed in the browser. Also, you won’t need to store the ‘client secret’` in your mobile app. When you log in, the browser will redirect you back to your Xamarin app using the redirect URI and pass the requested token as a parameter.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The <code>WebAuthenticator</code> class from Xamarin.Essentials library simplifies implementing this flow and takes care of launching the browser, handling redirect, and parsing received parameters for you.</p>

 Add Authentication with Xamarin.Essentials and Okta 

<p>To get started, log in to your <a href="https://developer.okta.com/">Okta Developer Account</a> via the URL you are emailed after signing up, to access your org’s portal dashboard. Once you log in, make sure to note your Org URL from the upper right corner of the screen:</p>

<p></p>

<p>Now create a new application. Click Applications in the top menu and then Add Application. Select Native and click Next.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Enter a name (I will use OktaAuth again), check Implicit (Hybrid) at the bottom of the screen, and click Done.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Switch back to Visual Studio and add a login and logout button to the app. In the shared <code>OktaAuth</code> project, double-click the <code>MainPage.xaml</code> file and replace its content with this:</p>

   <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?&gt;

&lt;ContentPage xmlns="http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms" xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
xmlns:d="http://xamarin.com/schemas/2014/forms/design" xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006" mc:Ignorable="d" x:Class="OktaAuth.MainPage"&gt;
  &lt;StackLayout VerticalOptions="Center"&gt;
    &lt;Label Text="Welcome to Xamarin.Forms!" x:Name="WelcomeLabel"
      HorizontalOptions="Center" VerticalOptions="CenterAndExpand" /&gt;
    &lt;Button x:Name="LoginButton" Text="Log in with Okta"
      HorizontalOptions="Center" Clicked="LoginButtonClicked"/&gt;
    &lt;Button x:Name="LogoutButton" Text="Log out"  IsVisible="False"
      HorizontalOptions="Center" Clicked="LogoutButtonClicked"/&gt;
  &lt;/StackLayout&gt;
&lt;/ContentPage&gt;
</code>   

<p>In the <code>MainPage.xaml.cs</code> file add empty event handlers for the login and logout buttons:</p>

   <code>private async void LoginButtonClicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
}

private void LogoutButtonClicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
}
</code>   

<p>Next, add a class to the project and name it <code>OktaConfiguration</code>. This class will hold configuration data that you need to pass to Okta and should look like this:</p>

   <code>public class OktaConfiguration
{
  public const string ClientId = "{clientId}";

  public const string OrganizationUrl = "";

  public const string Callback = "com.okta.{yourOktaAccountNameOnly i.e. 'dev-12345'}:/callback";

  public const string CallbackScheme = "com.okta.{yourOktaAccountNameOnly i.e. 'dev-12345'}";
}
</code>   

<p>Copy the Login redirect URI from your app configuration to the <code>Callback</code> field and paste it into the <code>CallbackScheme</code> (excluding the <code>:/callback</code> part). Copy ClientId value to the <code>ClientId</code> field too.</p>

 IOS and Android Setup for Xamarin WebAuthenticator 

<p>Before you use the <code>WebAuthenticator</code> class, you need to perform each platform-specific setup. For Android, add the following class to the <code>OktaAuth.Android</code> project:</p>

   <code>[Activity(NoHistory = true, LaunchMode = LaunchModeSingleTop)]
[IntentFilter(new[] { Android.Content.Intent.ActionView ,
  Categories = new[] { Android.Content.IntentCategoryDefault, Android.Content.IntentCategoryBrowsable },
  DataScheme = OktaConfiguration.CallbackScheme)]
public class WebAuthenticationCallbackActivity : XamarinEssentials.WebAuthenticatorCallbackActivity
{
  protected override void OnResume()
  {
    base.OnResume();
    Xamarin.Essentials.Platform.OnResume();
  }
}
</code>   

<p>For iOS, open the <code>Info.plist</code> file, go to the Advanced tab, click Add Url Type, and enter <code>CallbackScheme</code> value in the URL Schemes field.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You also need to override the <code>OpenUrl</code> method in the <code>AppDelegate</code> class:</p>

   <code>public override bool OpenUrl(UIApplication app, NSUrl url, NSDictionary options)
{
  if (Xamarin.Essentials.Platform.OpenUrl(app, url, options))
  {
    return true;
  }
  return base.OpenUrl(app, url, options);
}
</code>   

<p>Next, add a <code>LoginService</code> class that will build the url with required parameters and also parse the ID token returned by Okta. Paste this code in the <code>LoginService</code> class:</p>

   <code>class LoginService
{
  private string codeVerifier;
  private const string IDToken = "id_token";
  private const string CodeChallengeMethod = "S256";

  public string BuildAuthenticationUrl()
  {
    var state = CreateCryptoGuid();
    var nonce = CreateCryptoGuid();
    var codeChallenge = CreateCodeChallenge();

    return $"{OktaConfiguration.OrganizationUrl}/oauth2/default/v1/authorizeresponse_type={IDToken}ope=openid%20profile&amp;redirect_uri={OktaConfigurationCallback}&amp;client_id={OktaConfiguration.ClientId}state=tate}&amp;code_challenge{codeChallenge}&amp;code_challenge_method={CodeChallengeMethod}&amp;nonce={nonce}";
  }
  
  private string CreateCryptoGuid()
  {
    using (var generator = RandomNumberGenerator.Create())
    {
      var bytes = new byte[16];
      generator.GetBytes(bytes);
      return new Guid(bytes).ToString("N");
    }
  }

  private string CreateCodeChallenge()
  {
    codeVerifier = CreateCryptoGuid();
    using (var sha256 = SHA256.Create())
    {
      var codeChallengeBytes = sha256.ComputeHash(Encoding.UTF8.GetByte(codeVerifier));
      return Convert.ToBase64String(codeChallengeBytes);
    }
  }  
  
  public JwtSecurityToken ParseAuthenticationResult(WebAuthenticatorResultauthenticationResult)
  {
    var handler = new JwtSecurityTokenHandler();
    var token = handler.ReadJwtToken(authenticationResult.IdToken);
    return token;
  }
}
</code>   

<p>The code in the <code>BuildAuthenticationUrl</code> method builds the URL required by the auth code grant flow with PKCE. The base URL, when using <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/#_2-okta-as-the-identity-platform-for-your-app-or-api">Okta as the authorization server</a>, is <code>https://${yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default/v1/authorize</code>. The method then appends <code>client_Id</code>, <code>response_type</code> and <code>scope</code> parameters, sets the <code>redirect_uri</code> to the login redirect URI from the app configuration, and sets other parameters as required by the PKCE flow.</p>

<p>The <code>ParseAuthenticationResult</code> method parses the jwt <code>IdToken</code> returned by Okta into a <code>JwtSecurityToken</code> object that contains all the claims from the token.</p>

<p>You are now ready to use the <code>WebAuthenticator</code> class to start the login flow.</p>

<p>Go to the <code>MainPage.Xaml.cs</code> file and add and initialize <code>LoginService</code> field:</p>

<p><code>private readonly LoginService loginService = new LoginService();</code></p>

<p>Next, replace the <code>LoginButtonClicked</code> method with this:</p>

   <code>private async void LoginButtonClicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
  try
  {
    var callbackUrl = new Uri(OktaConfiguration.Callback);
    var loginUrl = new Uri(loginService.BuildAuthenticationUrl());

    var authenticationResult = await WebAuthenticator.AuthenticateAsync(loginUrl, callbackUrl)
    var token = loginService.ParseAuthenticationResult(authenticationResult);

    var nameClaim = token.Claims.FirstOrDefault(claim =&gt; claim.Type == "given_name")
    if (nameClaim != null)
    {
      WelcomeLabel.Text = $"Welcome to Xamarin.Forms {nameClaim.Value}!";
      LogoutButton.IsVisible = !(LoginButton.IsVisible = false);
    }
  }
  catch (TaskCanceledException)
  {
      //User closed browser
  }
}
</code>   

<p>When the login button is clicked, it builds the authentication url and passes it and the callback url to the <code>WebAuthenticator.AuthenticateAsync()</code> method. The <code>WebAuthenticator.AuthenticateAsync()</code> method will launch an external browser and, when I log in, redirects me back to the app passing the token returned by Okta. It then extracts the <code>given_name</code> claim from the parsed claims and displays its value in the <code>WelcomeLabel</code>.</p>

<p>The logout button will simply reset the app to its initial state:</p>

   <code>private void LogoutButtonClicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
  WelcomeLabel.Text = "Welcome to Xamarin.Forms!";
  LogoutButton.IsVisible = !(LoginButton.IsVisible = true);
}
</code>   

<p>Now run the app, click the Login with Okta button, log in to your Okta account and you will see a screen similar to this:</p>

<p></p>

<p>That’s it!</p>

<p>This is the third in the series on the paradigm shift
to a digital state. In <a href="https://procivis.ch/2020/04/30/the-digital-state-part-1/">Part 1</a>, I pointed out that no

of elections is changing. And in this article, I look at how law-making is going
digital.</p>



<p>Rome, 63 BC</p>



<p>There were no physical
distancing measures in the Roman Senate in the session depicted in this
painting. The scene here is of Cicero delivering the breaking news that he had
uncovered a shocking plot by Catiline to bring down the government of the Roman
Empire. Catiline’s motive was that he thought he would be able to have his
debts, and those of his supporters, cancelled in the ensuing chaos. Even in ancient
Rome, not everyone in power was a stable genius.</p>



<p>In that story we find that
the “checks and balances” against power worked – but only in the nick of time,
and only because the legislators were able to meet physically. Had the
legislators been hiding at home in a lockdown imposed by the executive, things
might have turned out differently.</p>



<p>Other cities, 2020 AD</p>



<p>Fast-forward to the
year 2020. What grand painting about today’s legislatures might be left to
posterity? At the very least, an empty chamber. Despite our advanced digital
societies, our legislators were unable to meet at the height of the pandemic.
For a while, there were few formal “checks and balances” on executive power.
It’s not that the legislators couldn’t arrange a conference call among
themselves – they all have access to phones and computers; and it’s not that
parliaments do not adopt the latest technology – they have already switched
from candles to electric lights; it’s just that their protocols were not
written for the digital age. </p>



<p>The existing protocols
were handed down from an era when grand halls with marble floors and tall columns
defined gravitas and power – like in the painting above. </p>



<p>What would happen to a
bank that doesn’t offer e-banking and insists that its customers have to come
into a branch? What would happen to a stock exchange that doesn’t permit
electronic trading and insists that trading should be done on the marble
trading floor? Would they not become irrelevant? </p>



<p>Can there be any doubt
that parliaments might now look to tweak their protocols to be able to function
during future pandemics? Can there be any doubt that parliaments might now look
to move away from the Roman model from 63 BC? </p>



<p>On that there can be
no doubt. Here is an overview of some of the parliamentary upgrades being worked
on for the digital age. These measures are defined in terms of increasing
citizenship involvement and are not sequenced, i.e. they can run in parallel.</p>



<p>Level 1 upgrade:
remote voting for legislators</p>



<p>The parliamentary votes by legislators on legislation are usually not secret, which makes the votes personally and publicly knowable and auditable. This transparency makes it easier to quickly set up remote voting systems for members of parliament. The picture below shows one such remote voting application by the e-Government firm, Procivis AG.</p>







<p>Source: A remote
voting application for legislators designed by Procivis AG.</p>



<p>In cases where members
of parliament are required to vote in secret (see some examples <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2004_2009/documents/dt/562/562487/562487en.pdf">here</a>), we face the same
hurdles that a remote electronic voting system needs to meet, including the
ability of each voter to verify that their vote was actually cast and delivered
as intended. Some of the considerations in such an upgrade are discussed <a href="https://procivis.ch/2020/07/08/the-digital-state-part-2/">here</a>.</p>



<p>Level 2 upgrade: more differentiated
voting options</p>



<p>In the digital age,
parliaments are struggling to reflect the preferences of increasingly diverse
societies. Survey after survey reveals that voters are not very happy with
their legislature. From the sample data in Figure 1 – for Argentina, Australia,
Chile, Egypt, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and the United States – the percentage
of people who say they have a “great deal” of confidence in their national
legislature ranges from a low of 0.4% (Egypt) to a high of 3.8% (Australia). </p>



<p>Figure 1: Legislatures in trouble</p>



<p>% of respondents saying they have “a great deal” of confidence in their national legislature [1]</p>







<p>Such widespread unhappiness with a legislature is not a new phenomenon, of course, but it is potentially destabilising. When democracies were imploding in Europe in the 1930s, Friedrich August von Hayek&nbsp;(1899-1992), who won the Nobel Prize for economics, tried to understand why the shift away from democracy was occurring. Hayek’s conclusion was that “it is the ineffectiveness of parliamentary majorities with which the people are dissatisfied…the higher the education and intelligence of individuals becomes, the more their views and tastes are differentiated and the less likely they are to agree on a particular hierarchy of values.”[2]</p>



<p>There are numerous ideas how to better align
parliamentary outcomes to what the people want. One solution is to change what
people vote on and how they allocate their votes. By giving voters a
“voting budget”, they can allocate their votes according to their preferences.
One such method is called “quadratic voting” and was tested in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting">experiment</a> for real legislation in the United
States. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Giving voters (both members of parliament as well as
the public) more differentiated options becomes easier if the technology is a custom-built
digital voting application, as opposed to a pen and paper. As with any proposal
to tweak voting arrangements, there will always be pros and cons, and it will
be for each democracy to decide what trade-offs they are prepared to accept in
order to best align legislative outcomes with what the people want.</p>



<p>We also know that trust in parliament is highest when people
are satisfied with their democracy (figure 2). We cannot expect voters to be
satisfied with their democracy when every time they go and vote, the policy
outcomes of the newly elected legislature and executive do not sufficiently represent
their preferences. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Figure 2: The correlation between satisfaction with democracy and trust in parliament [3]</p>







<p>Level 3 upgrades:
Hybrid systems</p>



<p>Legislatures are
slowly but surely being “disintermediated”, in other words, they are losing
their erstwhile prime real estate monopoly in the capital city as their clients
go online. In practice, this means that at all three levels of government
(national or federal, state or provincial, and local or municipal) people are increasingly
getting involved directly in the business of initiating, drafting and even
approving legislation. Details about these trends can be found under concepts
such as the “<a href="https://procivis.ch/2019/05/21/technology-and-citizen-participation-%EF%BB%BF/">crowd-sourcing of legislation</a>” and “<a href="https://procivis.ch/2019/03/22/how-to-spend-it-a-focus-on-participatory-budgeting/">participatory budgeting</a>” –
both links here include examples, from Madrid to New York City, and from
Finland to Brazil.</p>



<p>Concluding thoughts</p>



<p>Just as this pandemic
has greatly accelerated structural changes that were already under way in the
private sector (such as the move to the home office), the same thing is
happening with regard to citizen interaction with the state: you don’t have to
leave your home. The power shifts are even more radical in democracies: you can
now govern from your lockdown.</p>



<p>Of course, not
everyone is happy with these trends – and some even fear them – but the point
is that digitalization is making them easier and easier. These developments are,
in any case, as unstoppable as the move away from the definition of power
captured in the painting above: white men in togas. </p>



<p>There is no getting
away from the central question, though: In the digital age, how can we better align legislatures with the
people’s priorities? Some states will actually figure this out and get it
right. It is inconceivable that this won’t involve more power to the people as
well as new digital forms of interaction between citizens and their
legislature. &nbsp;</p>



<p>In the next article, Part 4, I’ll look at the digitalization of state-issued money and the implications for financial governance in the digital age.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-successful-chinese-companies-adapted-to-covid-19/">COVID-19 pandemic </a>has revolutionized the way people work. To maintain the safety and well-being of the workforce, the majority of organizations across the world have adopted a <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-lead-better-remote-meetings/">remote work culture.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accurate expectation-setting and transparency of data are key to build mutual trust and lead successful remote teams</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gartner research shows that organizations with high levels of trust increase their average employee engagement by 76% over those with low levels of trust. Managers must establish mutual trust to build successful remote teams.</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
  Be transparent 
<p>Managers often worry about the lack of visibility in the workflows and routines of their remote direct reports. Create a transparent system of performance measurement that quantifies outcomes, not just activities or the amount of time spent on tasks. Accurate expectation-setting and transparency of data are key to build mutual trust and lead successful remote teams.</p>
  Be accessible and responsive 
<p>Remote working may trigger feelings of isolation and not being unnoticed. Prioritize employees' needs when they are stuck on a project and they require your feedback to progress. Be clear on what communication tools you prefer to use, share your availability frequently and organize regular scheduled calls for everyone. Communicate a response time when acknowledging a request and encourage others to do the same.</p>
  Create team profiles to increase engagement 
<p>Remote working has put pressure on teamwork and camaraderie. Some companies have started creating groups to share coffee chats and pictures, and using apps like Houseparty to organize virtual pizza team parties, farewells and welcomes. They have also accepted other forms of virtual social interactions using apps like Prelude, VirtuWall, QuizBreaker, Kahoot and Water Cooler Trivia to increase engagement among team members.</p>
<p>Have team members create profiles of their personal interests, hobbies and development areas so that employees who have the same interests can share photos and conversations that ultimately foster friendship and enhance collaboration with work colleagues.&nbsp;</p>
  Maintain confidentiality 
<p>As employees work remotely, they continue to have the same obligations to maintain the <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-communicate-important-covid-19-data/">confidentiality of personal data</a>, client information and all third-party work. Agree on norms for what information can be shared outside the team and what access control is required.</p>
  Assess progress proactively 
<p>Remote workers can feel sidelined or isolated, which can affect the progress of their workload. Proactively ask your staff if they are facing challenges in advancing their projects or are unable to prioritize their work. Ask if they need extra support and assistance. You can easily detect signs of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/manage-employee-stress-with-flexibility-and-transparency/">anxiety and stress in the office</a>, but remotely it is more difficult to discern. Therefore, you need to be more proactive and understanding.</p>
  Recognize the team 
<p>In a remote working culture, visual signs of recognition are nonexistent. Managers must appeal to the most intimate needs for recognition of human beings. Identify what the employee is seeking — achievement, status or affiliation.</p>
 
 If the need for achievement prevails, recognize their good work by engaging them in challenging projects. 
 If the need for status prevails, involve the person in a prestigious project, let them lead a working group or engage them in a project sponsored by top management 
 If the need for affiliation prevails, involve them in a project or product that is not working well because of tensions between team members.

<p>We used to send long letters by airmail to keep in touch with friends overseas. Today, we stay connected electronically with free messaging that takes just an instant to send. While the tools we use to stay in touch have evolved over time, other ways such as the process of sending gifts, can still be an expensive, slow process.</p>



<p>Now, an easy new option for sending a gift to keep in touch recently became available with Civic Wallet. You may now send small virtual gifts to friends and family in the form of crypto. The process is fast, so compared to other methods of sending money, or even shipping something physical, gift-giving with crypto has become a much easier option. Whether your friends use Civic Wallet or another digital wallet, sending and receiving crypto is nearly instant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On top of this, the crypto you hold in Civic Wallet is protected by a <a href="https://www.civic.com/faq/#coincover">$1 Million Cryptocurrency Protection Guarantee</a> (<a href="https://www.coincover.com/terms-and-conditions">full terms &amp; conditions</a>). If your friends are receiving money via Civic Wallet, they are also covered by the guarantee.</p>



 



 How to send crypto from your Civic Wallet to a friend’s Civic Wallet 



<p>There are two ways to send funds to a friend who is receiving it via Civic Wallet:</p>



<p>By username</p>



  



<p>Select the digital currency you’d like to send. Tap the Send icon and enter your friend’s username. Once you locate the username, enter the payment amount, and press Confirm &amp; Send.</p>



<p>By QR code</p>



<p>The second way to send crypto works if you are physically in the same room as the recipient.</p>



  Your friend begins by selecting the currency they’d like to receive in their wallet and tapping the Receive icon to generate a QR code on the next screen.  Open your Civic Wallet, tap the green Scan button on the bottom of the screen.  Scan your friend’s QR code using your phone, and enter the payment amount.  



 



 How to send crypto from your Civic Wallet to a friend outside of the Civic network 



<p>The last way to send currency is directly to an address, which varies by currency type.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By receiving address</p>



  



  Your friend should begin by opening their digital wallet and locating their receiving address. From here, your friend should copy the receiving address and text it to you.  Next, open your Civic Wallet and tap the Send icon for the crypto you’d like to send. Paste in the receiving address, enter the payment amount, and press Confirm &amp; Send.

For many years, medium sized enterprises have struggled to deploy Identity Management as well as Identity Governance (IGA) solutions and show true business value and a return on investment. This is largely due to the complexity of implementation and the level of configuration and customization to fulfill the requirements. As a result, many companies have deployed Access Management solutions like single sign-on only to find that while great for user convenience, they bring little to the table for proper lifecycle management and governance.

  <p>In May 2020, a smartphone caller identification app reported a security breach in which the personal data of more than 47.5 million users was exposed. This was only one of the many instances that left data exposed and caused vulnerabilities in 2020. From healthcare institutions to tech, software, social media and meal delivery companies, cybercriminals have targeted every industry, stealing billions of records.</p>

<p>At the same time, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/10-ways-to-quickly-reduce-it-costs/">reduced IT budgets</a> meant that chief information security officers (CISOs) had to cut costs and compromise on risk management programs. One area of focused budget cuts was application security testing, an expensive but imperative part of the process.</p>

<p>[swg_ad]</p>
<p>“Security testing helps identify vulnerabilities early on in the application development process,” says <a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/62770/Mark-Horvath">Mark Horvath</a>, Senior Director Analyst, Gartner. “However, CISOs find it difficult to justify the costs of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/future-proof-application-strategy/">application</a> security testing. Compromising on this step can have serious implications, and it is important to not skip it.”</p>
<p>In contrast to common perception, app security testing doesn’t always have to be a heavy investment. CISOs can consider these seven tips to conduct security testing effectively without putting a strain on their budgets.</p>
 Include security experts in the architectural review at the start of development 
<p>Early testing minimizes the cost of fixing software defects. Including security experts at an early stage of development helps identify the gaps in security and remediate the risks. Organizations can avoid remodeling and remediation efforts if threats are mitigated at the very beginning.</p>
<p>Threat modeling is an expensive exercise, but in many cases can be done internally with free downloadable software. This is not restricted to new applications and can be extended to existing software, too. Especially when existing software is being repurposed or exposed as web services, a structured assessment of the risks and scenarios where an application can be attacked offers the opportunity to create test cases.</p>

 Select affordable testing options when budgets are reduced 
<p>In scenarios where budget constraints are a big hurdle to security testing, CISOs can benefit from affordable and open-source options. While these alternatives are often incomplete in terms of language, framework and vulnerability coverage, and functionality, with the appropriate customization and plug-ins, they can enable an effective application security program with minimal resources.</p>
<p>The free software doesn’t come with enterprise functionality such as dashboards, comprehensive reporting, distributed scanning sensors or plug-ins to integrate into the software development life cycle. However, internal experts can fill this gap by writing their own scripts, or can operate the tools manually where needed.</p>
 Use security testing services to jump-start your application security program 
<p>Involve developers in the testing process so that they can produce high-quality code once they understand the possible threats. “Assign one of your developers to shadow the pentester or application security testing service, or have your developer manage the program,” says Horvath.</p>
<p>Gartner research suggests that developers in this kind of program are prone to make significantly fewer security errors. These developers can also act as subject matter experts or security champions and identify issues more quickly for the team in the future.</p>
<p>In addition to involving developers in testing, CISOs can also introduce numerous “ethical hacking” courses available online to developers. This can enable developers to understand the world view on securing applications and how attackers operate.</p>
 Reevaluate your mix of security techniques on a periodic basis 
<p>As the program matures, and as new styles of coding and new technologies are introduced, vulnerabilities evolve. CISOs need to plan for this by scheduling periodic evaluations of the security techniques in practice.</p>
<p>For example, “If you have an application that is mostly in maintenance mode and requires mostly cosmetic changes, move resources from code scanning into pentest,” Horvath says.</p>
<p>Periodic testing is wrongly perceived as a cost-draining process. However, semiannual or quarterly reevaluation of priorities can optimize resources and ensure that development and security teams are familiar with all the tools.</p>
 Rotate testers and apply time limits to prevent overfamiliarity and burnout 
<p>Gartner research suggests that the number of threats found by a security tester reduces gradually over a period of five weeks and significantly declines after eight weeks of running a code. This doesn’t mean that the threats have been reduced. Because the tester is viewing the code multiple times, fatigue sets in. This can be a problem with critical sections of code or software, especially when the full functionality of the code may not always be tested or exercised.</p>
<p>Introducing code testing to a fresh set of eyes can help identify vulnerabilities that someone who has been working on the software for too long may have overlooked.</p>
 Avoid wasting paid testing hours 
<p>Underpreparedness is not new to the testing environment. Often when consultants arrive to begin testing, they are not fully briefed or prepared for the kinds of tests that have been requested. This causes delays in testing, less accurate results, and lower productivity for development teams and pentesters.</p>
<p>Prepare for the testing ahead of time by meeting with vendors and discussing the types and scale of testing you want to conduct, and preselect areas of code, infrastructure and processes you identify as gaps in your overall testing coverage. Use external testers to find business logic errors instead of the more “low-hanging fruit” types of issues that your internal testing can uncover.</p>
 Be flexible when scheduling opportunities for testing 
<p>Rolling out testing changes to a small population is a common practice within DevOps organizations. As these tests are performed in a controlled environment, it reduces the risks of exposing the entire organization to threats. CISOs can plan for canary or A/B testing during breaks in normal business hours, such as weekends and holidays. Another option is to set up parallel environments for security testing.</p>
<p>“Issues that appear as security vulnerabilities are often a product of poor code development. By using these security testing tips, organizations can create a robust framework for their applications’ security,” says Horvath.</p>

 The GiD Report #120 — How persistent identity can shape better online communities <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-119-ray-dalio-examines-history-to-understand-the-chaos-were-experiencing-today-690ec1c73548">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>What we’ve got for you this&nbsp;week:</p>  1a. Vitalik Buterin on persistent identity + free&nbsp;speech,  1b. Juan Benet on identity baked into the&nbsp;browser  1c. Balaji Srinivasan on portable identity network effects for 2-sided marketplaces  2. Big 4 antitrust hearings pushed to&nbsp;Wed  3. New OCC guy allows bank custody of&nbsp;crypto  4. Chinese state launches blockchain network  5. Ray Dalio on the Big Cycle of the U.S. and where it is&nbsp;now   1. For all the ways our internet platforms have better connected us, made it easier to create and to consume, there are some striking issues with the place we’ve arrived at in 2020. I won’t get into that since we’re all pretty aware of the primary critiques. <p>What about solutions?</p><p>Juan Benet (Filecoin), Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum), and Balaji Srinivasan (former Coinbase CTO, a16z) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTxE9KV3YrE&amp;feature=emb_logo">gave their future-y takes in a “debate” last wee</a>k (via <a href="https://global.id/junhiraga">/junhiraga</a>).</p><p>For starters, we need to rethink the incentive structures that drive our behavior. We also need to rethink how our platforms are structured. And we also need a lot more experimentation around&nbsp;both.</p><p>But we also need to rethink identity.</p><p>Here’s a thought exercise for you. How could we foster the free and independent speech and thought that comes with anonymity without devolving into a free for all like 4Chan and all the bad behavior that comes with&nbsp;it?</p><p>Here’s Vitalik:</p>Vitalik Buterin, TechCrunch<blockquote>So I feel like a 4Chan type of thing is a great example of the difference between anonymous and pseudonymous. 4Chan is much more on the anonymous side of the spectrum. And I think the difference is that you can focus on decentralization in the sense of avoiding other people’s negative incentives. That’s definitely part of what’s going on, but the other important thing is actively creating positive incentives right?</blockquote><blockquote>And if you don’t have any notion of persistent identity, then you can’t have positive incentives because there’s no persistent thing for those incentives to hook onto. There’re a lot of ways you can have persistent identity, persistent reputation — even in ways that are very strongly privacy preserving.</blockquote><blockquote>You can have pseudonyms, but then you could even do crazy things — for example, you switched to a new pseudonym every two weeks, but you would have some zero-knowledge proofs that links your pseudonym to some older pseudonym, and you don’t really know which one, but some kind of reputation score carries&nbsp;over.</blockquote><blockquote>You could even have negative reputation scores carry over potentially on someone — and if the research came up with a way of doing that in a privacy-preserving way so that there was a lot of room in terms of designing incentives to encourage actively good behavior.</blockquote><blockquote>And in that sense it can mean a lot of things. It can mean micropayments and monetary rewards. It could be just a reputation and having more people see your content. There’s a lot of things you can do that are fully compatible with the idea that people should be able to post under identities that are separate from their real identities that they use for personal like and work and so&nbsp;forth.</blockquote><p>All of which, BTW, is aligned with the spirit of the GlobaliD namespace. Your GlobaliD name doesn’t have to be your real name. And you can always have more than one name. That’s your prerogative.</p><p>It’s also the super exciting thing about identity in general. The deeper you dive into it, the more you start to understand how it can help reshape the way we interact and transact online in a fundamentally constructive way — far beyond the limits of what we’ve experienced so&nbsp;far.</p><p>Even simple things such as account recovery have creative solutions that both enhance trust while removing bottlenecks.</p><p>Here’s Vitalik on the concept of social recovery:</p><blockquote>If you lose your account, you have to appeal to customer service and sometimes they just never respond. More privileged people can have private channels where they could yell more and get listened to more. A lot of people just don’t have access to those kinds of channels. It’s a problem where people think that you can just talk to the kindly human at the end, they’ll figure it out. But often, it just isn’t true. This is an idea where you have some group of friends — somewhere between five and 10 contacts — and say any two thirds of them can reset your&nbsp;account.</blockquote><p>Of course, Vitalik also concedes that certain functions are simply better served by verification providers — and here, Vitalik is still speaking our language:</p><blockquote>The other half of the identity problem is proving real-world properties about yourself that are attested by authorities — like proving you’re a citizen of some country, proving that you graduated from some university, all of those things. And ultimately, you can’t decentralize those because they’re just fundamentally dependent on the centralized authority. But what you can do is create a kind of common standard and common platform for these attestations to&nbsp;happen.</blockquote><p>Now here’s Juan echoing Greg’s thoughts on baking identity into the&nbsp;browser:</p><blockquote>I think we need to return to the idea of persona, which was like Mozilla’s effort to create identity directly baked into the browser. I think if the operating systems we had coupled identities for data closer to the kind of identities for logging into the device, that would be a good win. The browser or the O/S might be the right place to put&nbsp;it.</blockquote><p>The long time upside, though, will be the network effects of having these verified, persistent, and portable identities.</p><p>Here’s Balaji:</p><blockquote>One thing I want to just point out — this may be very obvious — but I think it’s actually pretty interesting for us. One of the advantages of Substack is there’s a hundred thousand people on there who have credit cards. And so a new publication has a built-in network effect. If you had an Ethereum ID with crypto in there, you start to get a network effect among things where all Ethereum users or all Bitcoin users can go and sign up for a site and you have a similar kind of network effect — where you would prefer it to be logged in with Ethereum or logged in with Bitcoin, and then you can pay and you’ve got identity and so on and so&nbsp;forth.</blockquote><blockquote>In some ways, that’s an obvious use case, but I think it rotates it a little bit where you just need a community of those folks who will all go and just click to sign up at a site and you start to get a network effect, and then you start getting more products built around that core. And the critical thing there, of course, is that the account and the money are both decentralized. So they’re not associated with Amazon.com or Substack or what have you, but with a decentralized community.</blockquote><blockquote>Then you can also have something where you have an Ethereum wallet, for example, or a Bitcoin wallet where you are pushing notifications and you get paid. Let’s say now you get to a future where there’s enough apps that they want to go and attract Ethereum holders, right? Then they pay a task to that wallet, which is a known purchaser of subscriptions. And now, boom, a little offer or task appears and you can click to go and purchase it. That’s a sketch of something where you can start building a two-sided marketplace around account holders on one hand and services on the&nbsp;other.</blockquote><p>That’s the long term vision of an interoperable, portable identity — one that’s not beholden to any single platform (or even any particular wallet or cryptocurrency for that&nbsp;matter).</p><p>Anyway, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTxE9KV3YrE&amp;feature=emb_logo">there’s plenty more from the full talk if you want to dive&nbsp;in</a>.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/the-simple-and-practical-steps-the-federal-government-should-take-to-fix-online-speech">The Simple and Practical Steps the Federal Government Should Take to Fix Online&nbsp;Speech</a>  <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-employee-leaks-show-they-feel-betrayed?utm_campaign=%5Bcovid19%5D%2BTech%2BImpac&amp;utm_content=564476&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=cio&amp;utm_term=196813">“Facebook Is Hurting People At Scale”: Mark Zuckerberg’s Employees Reckon With The Social Network They’ve&nbsp;Built</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-creates-teams-to-study-racial-bias-on-its-platforms-11595362939">WSJ News Exclusive | Facebook Creates Teams to Study Racial Bias, After Previously Limiting Such&nbsp;Efforts</a>  <a href="https://indicio.tech/a-global-pandemic-lights-the-fuse-on-a-technology-revolution/">A global pandemic lights the fuse on a technology revolution | Indicio&nbsp;Tech</a>   2.

					 <p>When I was hired at the <a href="https://sovrin.org">Sovrin Foundation</a> as the first software engineer, my #1 task was to help developers start using <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk">Hyperledger Indy</a> quickly. It wasn’t an easy task—two years, loads of documentation, an entirely <a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries">new Hyperledger project</a> (Aries), and countless workshops later, we’d taken what used to take about six months to accomplish and reduced it to a couple of weeks. I took that knowledge and created a paid training course for SSI developers that brought in $100k+ of revenue for the Sovrin Foundation. However, I’ve always had a bigger vision of what could be done for the SSI developer community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When I helped start Trinsic, I wanted to create the best developer experience possible. The first version of our API was released exactly a year ago, with only four developers as the first users. Since then, we’ve grown into a community of hundreds of developers. We’ve released two additional APIs and worked hard to make it easy to start building applications that utilize SSI capabilities.</p>

			 Introducing Trinsic's documentation site 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Our engineering team at Trinsic is thrilled to present our <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs">new documentation site</a>, which we believe is the best place for someone new to SSI to get started learning. To begin, we explain the concepts of SSI in understandable terms. Our API reference then shows how these concepts are applied in workable building blocks. The reference applications we’ve built will make it easy to call the API in the programming language of your choice. If you have any questions, we have a discussion board for you to ask any questions you might have. Let’s dive in to some of the major features of this new developer hub.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Knowledge base 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Good knowledge about SSI has historically been hard to come by. Distributed across multiple blogs, repos, docs, webinars, and online courses are hundreds of pages of content, some of which is out of date. We’ve taken the knowledge that has historically only been available from hours of searching or paid consultants and made it accessible for everyone. The knowledge base includes:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					   Conceptual documentation  Technical documentation  Guides/tutorials  Reference applications  Glossary<br><br>  <p>We have big plans for this knowledge base and intend to continually improve it over time. Please let us know if there are topics you’d like to see explained, and we’ll make sure to cover it. The best way to understand something is not by being taught but by actually doing it. That’s why the best part of the knowledge base is that it’s right next to the API Reference.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 API reference 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Our APIs are our core product, used all around the world by developers in all industries. Previously, accessing the API was a multi-step process, including copying &amp; pasting API keys (and remembering to use the ‘bearer’ scheme!) and navigating to a SwaggerHub page. The new API reference lives in the same place as the documentation and will soon share authentication with the Trinsic Studio, which means you’re automatically authenticated while you’re logged-in to your Trinsic account.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That means you can go from reading this blog post to making API calls in less than 30 seconds—seriously. Getting started couldn’t be easier.</p>

					 <p>A public community forum is a part of the documentation site as well. That means you can read documentation, make an API call, and ask a question without ever leaving the site. You can also search through questions previous developers have asked and contribute your answers. This forum is indexed by search engines, which means your comments can be discoverable by future developers who run into similar issues.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>We’re also launching a private Trinsic community in Microsoft Teams for our paid subscribers. Here our customers get early access to features, co-marketing opportunities, and a private support channel with our team. See our <a href="https://trinsic.id/pricing/">plans &amp; pricing</a> to learn more.</p>

					 <p>We still have a long way to go, but I’m thrilled at how far the SSI developer community has come since I joined it three years ago. With this new documentation site coupled with our APIs, it’s now easier than ever for developers to get started with verifiable credentials. Check out the documentation site for yourself at <a href="http://docs.trinsic.id/">docs.trinsic.id</a>. Then, join the hundreds of developers using our API by signing up for a Trinsic account at&nbsp;<a href="http://studio.trinsic.id/">studio.trinsic.id</a>. We can’t wait to have you join our community.</p>

Further, it is easy to become paralyzed by the potential directions and options, which leaves many leaders asking one question: What are the biggest digital strategy mistakes that we should avoid?&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Digital transformation success needs to operate at three levels — corporate governance, management and execution — but companies make mistakes at all three levels</p></blockquote>
<p>“Over 80% of CEOs responding to our annual CEO Survey said they have a digital transformation program underway to make their companies more digital,” says<a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/18594"> Mark Raskino</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner. “However, our recent years’ surveys have also shown a lack of business model change penetration and other indicators, which causes us to think that many of these digital initiatives may not be sufficiently deep corporate transformations.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-revitalize-a-stalled-digital-transformation/">Digital transformation success</a> needs to operate at three levels — corporate governance, management and execution — but companies make mistakes at all three levels that will frustrate transformation. Knowing where those mistakes may happen can help enterprises avoid falling into these traps.</p>
<blockquote><p>Over 80% of CEOs responding to our annual CEO Survey said they have a digital transformation program underway to make their companies more digital</p></blockquote>
 
 Misread the true scope of digital change. Sometimes an enterprise may misread a situation from the outset by, for example, failing to examine how digital forces will change an industry or having an insufficient corporate mission to see and seize product and business model innovation. Not having a strong understanding of what is happening in your industry can lead to a superficial or narrow scope of change for any digital transformation. Raskino says organizations should think in terms of using digital to reinvent what their industry does. 
 Too much inward thinking. Too often organizations focus on what they want to do rather than analyzing customer needs, the opportunities those present, and a full competitive market view for examples and lessons. Raskino said this type of thinking is presuming that digital change is just another operating model change, but that is not the case. “An operating model focus does not consider the overall market. It focuses primarily on efficiency and effectiveness. A business model focus considers the market and how it is monetized. An outside-in perspective is what most successful digital transformation projects hinge on,” he said. 
 “It’s not my job.” Some <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/how-to-get-the-board-to-say-yes/">boards of directors</a> treat digital transformation as a management issue and not part of their role, while at the same time, some executive team members avoid the subject and treat it as something owned by IT. This cascading disassociation behavior impedes real change. Digital transformation must be part of the mission of the organization and in the core of its leaders. If it is not, patchy progress may be made, but transformational progress will elude the company. 
 Digital is undefined. Goals are vague. The organization has a hazy and confused vision for digital transformation because digital has not been defined. There are no associated specifics or a coherent plan in place. There is aspiration, and a collection of cool projects, and there is will, but there’s no specificity on what the digital journey is really about. Organizations must do the upfront hard work to define their goals, set specific targets and metrics, and then measure those to ensure the transformation project is on track. 
 Incrementalism. When digital is undefined, initiatives may only be focused on improving today and not putting the funding, systems and specific plans in place for real<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/fight-digital-transformation-fatigue/"> transformation</a>. Management should ask: Is it really “transformational”? The meaning of that word has become very diluted. Digital business works at the level of revenue and business model change and product reinvention. Look for the structural investment. If it is not there, you're very unlikely going to truly transform. 
 Fixed minds. A fixed mindset is one of constrained capabilities. People with fixed mindsets are not in learning mode. Organizations must learn how to develop a growth mindset to build an innovative culture that will thrive in the era of digital business. A growth mindset embraces the idea that new capabilities can be developed through smart learning, good strategies and input from others. Those who embrace this mindset see challenges as opportunities to grow and evolve, and they are resilient even when faced with failure. 
 Overplanning. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/choose-your-digital-transformation-starting-point/">Transforming to digital</a> is more about doing than planning. Organizations can get caught up in endless rounds of analysis paralysis, which slows the transformation project. To combat this, organizations should institutionalize lean startup thinking at every level. Lean startup thinking favors experimentation over top-down planning. This process aims to quickly and iteratively build an innovation to become a “minimum viable product” that can be released to the customer, and then through feedback it continues to evolve the innovation. 
 Technology-centric. Organizations should watch out for buying into the hype of the “next big thing.” Organizations should instead focus on reinventing their industry with a collection of technological tools. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/foster-innovation-to-drive-digital-transformation/">Transformation is never just doing the next big thing</a>. “Aim at unmet needs — the needs of the market and customers that our industry has never served before,” Raskino said. “Use the technological tools collectively to invent solutions to do things nobody could do before.” 
 Culture blindness. <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/cios-break-through-culture-barriers-to-enable-digital-transformation/">Culture is one of the biggest barriers</a> to scaling digital transformation. Culture is perceived to be big, unwieldy and hard to change. Attributes that may be culture barriers for some are, in fact, enablers for others. Organizations should focus on resetting purpose and beliefs to drive culture change. Determine the purpose of the company, what it yields for the world and what the beliefs are of the people coming to work each day. Use<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/10-culture-hacks-for-digital-transformation/"> culture hacks</a>, some of which can be implemented in less than 48 hours, to move culture from a barrier to an accelerator.

  People have experienced issues verifying the identity of potential dating matches for years. It is impossible to know if the person you're messaging is the love of your life or a scammer. With Verifiable Credentials like email, phone number and ID documents, BloomID can help solve all of that.

<div class='wrap'>

<p>People have been experiencing issues with verifying the identity of potential matches while dating for hundreds of years. Classified ads in newspapers made that worse, and online dating has made it nearly impossible for you to know if the person that just messaged you is, in fact, the person of your dreams, someone trying to scam you, or even someone who poses a potential danger in real life.</p><p>Lots of solutions have been tried and tested to resolve this problem, but none have stuck. Whether you were on Lavalife in the 90s, Match.com or Plenty of Fish in the early 2000s, or are using Tinder or Bumble today, you may always have that sneaking suspicion about who’s really behind the keyboard until one of you gets the courage to ask for a video call or to meet up in person.</p><p>BloomID can help solve all of that. With Verifiable Credentials, like email address, phone number, ID document (with facial matching), social media accounts and more, adding Bloom’s technology to a dating app can significantly reduce the number of people getting fooled and, therefore, souring on your product and the experience. This can have a snowball effect, especially on a smaller platform. Authentic identity makes for authentic connections.</p><p>Today, Match.com provides ID verification for paid users, and checks that ID against a variety of databases to ensure the individual is not a criminal. However, <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/hillaryflynn/tinder-lets-known-sex-offenders-use-the-app-its-not-the">Match Group does not implement this security feature across any of their free platforms</a>, including Plenty of Fish, Tinder, Meetic, Pairs, OkCupid, and others. It readily admits registered offenders are using its free products.</p><p>We didn’t come across any other dating platforms that allow you to verify an identity, including platforms targeted at seniors and retirees, therefore putting individuals at risk of being scammed, assaulted, or worse (<a href="https://www.datingnews.com/industry-trends/online-dating-statistics-what-they-mean-for-future/">see statistics 23-27</a>).</p><p>This problem can be seen as a tradeoff between bringing in a high number of users to your platform versus fewer people using a paid platform, although the latter would introduce more inherent trust. What you can do, instead, is introduce a middle-path: allow people to bring their reusable Verified Credentials to your dating platform to enable verified profiles, and have people self-select whether they want to focus on chatting with people with verified identities or not.</p><p>Let’s see how you can implement BloomID in your app!</p> Let’s Start Server Side <p>Let’s assume you have a back end that can handle some JavaScript in the form of Node.js, or that can be passed a payload from said Node.js library. </p><p>To that end, we’re going to implement <a href="https://bloom.co/docs/verify-kit/overview">Verify Kit</a> so that we can verify someone’s name on their profile is, in fact, the name on their photo ID that they have already verified. Verify Kit makes it simple to go from an http payload to a verified identity document in just a few steps.</p><p>We’re going to install Verify Kit using this command:</p> <code>npm install --save @bloomprotocol/verify-kit
</code> 
<p>Use the validateUntypedResponseData function from verify-kit, which returns an object with a kind property with potential values of 'invalid' or 'validated'. Assuming a 'validated' payload, the object will contain a data property structured as a <a href="https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/#presentations-0">verifiable presentation</a>.</p><p>Next, given a verifiable presentation, we extract the id-document from its verifiableCredential property and parse the JSON payload to receive the raw identity document data, which is structured like this:</p> <code>export interface IBaseAttIDDocData extends IBaseAttDataObj {
    date: TDateOrTime;
    name?: TPersonalName;
    country?: string;
    document_type?: string;
    authentication_result?: 'unknown' | 'passed' | 'failed' | 'skipped' | 'caution' | 'attention';
    biographic?: {
        age?: number;
        dob?: TDateOrTime;
        expiration_date?: TDateOrTime;
        name?: TPersonalName;
        gender?: string;
    };
    classification?: {
        classification_method?: 'automatic' | 'manual';
        id_type_name?: string;
        id_class?: TDocumentClass;
        id_class_name?: string;
        country_code?: string;
        issue_date?: TDate;
        issuer_name?: string;
        issue_type?: string;
        '@provider_specific'?: {
            issuer_code?: string;
            keesing_code?: string;
            generic?: boolean;
        };
    };
    facematch_result?: {
        is_match?: boolean;
        score?: number;
        transaction_id?: string;
    };
    images?: {
        front?: string;
        back?: string;
        selfie?: string;
    };
}
</code> 
<p>The most important properties of an identity document are the authentication_result and facematch_result. Any value in authentication_result that is not 'passed' requires manual review to verify the authenticity of the document. </p><p>Instead of starting from scratch, you can use the server side code from <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/bloom-starter/tree/master/bloom-starter-kyc/server">bloom-starter-kyc</a> as a way to kickstart your integration efforts!</p><p>Once you have all that in place, you’re ready to accept data from Share Kit!</p> Let’s Head Client Side <p>Share Kit is the front end library needed to generate a data sharing request. </p><p>Let’s assume you are building an Android app. You can find the Java Share Kit library here in Bloom’s GitHub account.</p><p>For this demonstration, let’s keep it simple by requesting the ‘id-document’ and ‘facebook’ verifications since you can extract ‘full-name’ from both and, with your own code that we will leave you to write in the language of your choice, compare the two server side!</p> Building the Android Library   Open the ShareKit project in Android Studio and let the project sync with gradle.  When the project is ready, click on the Build menu and then select Clean Project i.e. Build -&gt; Clean Project, in Android Studio.  Then also click on the Build menu and then select Rebuild Project i.e. Build -&gt; Rebuild Project, in Android Studio.  Finally navigate to the ShareKit directory and open the folders app -&gt; build -&gt; outputs -&gt; aar and copy the app-debug.aar library file generated. Paste this file anywhere in your filesystem and preferably rename it to sharekit.aar   Android Installation <p>Make sure your Android project has a minSdkVersion of 16 or greater, otherwise adding the library will cause your project to fail to build.</p><p>Add the sharekit.aar library generate above by doing the following in your Android Studio project:</p>  Click File -&gt; New -&gt; New Module.  Click Import .JAR/.AAR Package then click Next.  Enter the location of the compiled sharekit.aar file then click Finish.  Then make sure the sharekit library is added in your settings.gradle file i.e. include ':app', ':sharekit'  In your projects build.gradle file add a new line for the sharekit lib in the dependencies block i.e. dependencies { implementation project(":sharekit") }  Finally click on Sync Project with Gradle Files for your project to sync with the sharekit library.  <p>If the above steps are done successfully then you should be able to clean and Rebuild your project successfully as specified above i.e. Build -&gt; Clean Project &amp; Build -&gt; Rebuild Project</p> Usage <p>To use RequestButton in your project, do the following:</p>  Import the ShareKit class into your Activity/Fragment i.e. import com.bloom.sharekit.ShareKit;  Then initialize the RequestButton, set the share-kit request data &amp; callback-url and add it to your layout view programmatically like this:   <code>@Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        LinearLayout layout = findViewById(R.id.example_activity);

        // initialize the request data JSON Object and the types array
        JSONObject requestData = new JSONObject();
        JSONArray attestationTypes = new JSONArray();
        try {
            requestData.put("action", ShareKit.attestation);
            requestData.put("token", "3b922185-68c6-4e83-9b79-30e0b5fbf873");
            requestData.put("url", "receive.datingapp.co/api/receive");
            requestData.put("org_logo_url", "https://commcomm.xyz/bloom/DatingApp-Logo.png");
            requestData.put("org_name", "DatingApp");
            requestData.put("org_usage_policy_url", "https://datingapp.co/legal/terms");
            requestData.put("org_privacy_policy_url", "https://datingapp.co/legal/privacy");

            // add the attestations
            attestationTypes.put("id-document");
            attestationTypes.put("facebook");
            requestData.put("types", attestationTypes);
        } catch (JSONException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        // this is the callback-url/deep link for your app which will be used by the bloom app to re-direct you to your after the request is handled
        String callbackUrl = "https://datingapp.co?token=3b922185-68c6-4e83-9b79-30e0b5fbf873";

        // initialize the button by passsing the activity, bloom requestData and your app's callback-url
        Button bloomButton = new ShareKit().RequestButton(this, requestData, callbackUrl);

        //add button to the layout
        layout.addView(bloomButton);

        // set the button padding if necessary
        layout.setPadding(30,50,10,10);
    }
</code> 
<p>That token above is unique to your app. It is not a token provided by Bloom. You choose your own as it’s a unique identifier for your app, allowing you to distinguish data sharing requests from multiple sources, or to ensure the data is being shared from your app, and not someone else’s.</p><p>Note that for a new Android Studio project, the layout created will be a ConstraintLayout instead of a LinearLayout as shown above. Also please add an id to the layout xml file before initializing it so that it looks as follows:</p> <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;android.support.constraint.ConstraintLayout 
    xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:id="@+id/example_activity"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    tools:context=".MainActivity"&gt;

   
&lt;/android.support.constraint.ConstraintLayout&gt;
</code> 
  And then initialize the layout as a ConstraintLayout instead of a LinearLayout i.e. ConstraintLayout layout = findViewById(R.id.example_activity);  After this, everything else in the above example will remain the same.  <p>4. Finally build and install the APK into a device or emulator and once your app pops up, you should see the RequestButton displayed!</p><p>Also, the first time you tap the button, you'll be presented with a variety of options for which app to use to open the link. Just select Open With -&gt; Bloom -&gt; ALWAYS so that it defaults to opening the Bloom App if it's installed instead of a web browser.</p><p>So how can this look and feel in a dating app? Let’s see some examples.</p><p>Here’s what the view for editing your own profile could look like:</p>A screenshot of our demonstration dating app featuring the "Verify with Bloom" button<p>And if “Felix” goes through the process of verifying his ID, that process looks like this.</p>  Tap “Verify with Bloom”  View and confirm the data sharing request  The Bloom data sharing request for DatingApp, our demo app<p>3. &nbsp;Success!</p>The success screen. We completed the data sharing request!<p>Felix’s view of his settings and profile could now look like this, with the Bloom icon (or another indicator of some kind) showing that he has verified his name is actually Felix.</p>The user's view of their own profile after verifying their name<p>Ta-da! He’s verified his name is actually Felix, we confirmed this server-side using the two Verifiable Credentials provided (the ‘full-name’ subtype from the ‘id-document’ and ‘facebook’), and so now can apply some kind of indicator to his profile to show that. </p><p>Now, how would this look to other users when viewing profiles of potential matches? We have some examples of that as well. </p>A view of Felix's profile when viewed as othersAnd a view of Mia's profile as seen by others<p>You could also provide the ability for users to verify their age, their phone number, email address, or implement some computer vision to compare the photo on their ID document to their dating profile photo!</p><p>That is just one of the many use cases where you can use Bloom’s open source technology to enhance trust and security within your platform on a user-permissioned basis, while maintaining data security and privacy. Verify the data provided, delete it from your Verify Kit service, and allow your users to connect knowing you have taken at least one concrete step towards making your dating platform safer for all parties.</p><p>More Resources:</p>  <a href="https://bloom.co/docs/share-kit/overview">Share Kit Documentation</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/share-kit-android">Share Kit Android GitHub Repository</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/share-kit-ios">Share Kit iOS GitHub Repository</a>  <a href="https://bloom.co/docs/verify-kit/overview">Verify Kit Documentation</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/verify-kit">Verify Kit GitHub Repository</a>  <a href="https://github.com/hellobloom/bloom-starter">Bloom Starter GitHub Repository</a>   Bloom: Your Data, Your Credit, Your Privacy <p>At Bloom, we are giving you the tools to take back control of your data all in one simple app. No more centralized data storage.

<p><a href="https://authenteq.com/ready-for-scale-may-june-product-update/">Last month at Authenteq</a>: don’t have a developer team on-site? We have your back! Last month we wrapped up the building of the new infrastructure that allowed for API simplification, improved security measures, and integration speed. What is more, we added more languages to our service and implemented nifty image compression features to make sure that you can maximize your conversion. And even though we work hard this month, our product update is short, sweet, and full of automation. Here’s what we achieved this month:</p>



 Automated flagging&nbsp; 



<p>Automation is the key to successfully scaling internal ID verification and KYC processes. As we want you to become efficient with your time and resources, we decided to automate the flagging process. What does this mean? Instead of your compliance team having to flag suspicious users, our technology does that for you – automatically. This improvement allows for eliminating the negative side of the human factor. Therefore, lean back, save time, and let our AI-powered solution handle the fraudsters for you.&nbsp;<br></p>



 Data quick view&nbsp; 



<p>Every click matters, and we’re aware of that. To simplify the dashboard and your daily workflow, we’ve improved dashboard data visualization. Now you can take a glimpse at the user data by hovering over the user account instead of having to view the user information and come back to the main dashboard.&nbsp; </p>



 All onboard&nbsp; 



<p>Remember our old blockchain system – the idea is still extraordinarily futuristic and something we might come back to once the world is ready for <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/issues/privacy-by-design/">privacy-by-design</a> notions. Long story short, we shut it down and migrated the last client to the new system. All of that went hassle-free, and we’re happy to run our services and cater to our customers on one, continuously improving the system.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>The “bricks to clicks” trend of retailers ramping up their e-commerce presence to keep up with the likes of Amazon is at light speed amid the pandemic, and it’s upending retail supply chains everywhere. There are many reasons for this turmoil: Retailers may keep less stock on hand, people may not be buying as many things for outside the house (clothes, jewelry, etc.), manufacturers themselves may need to slow production, and the list goes on.</p>
<p><br>
The disruption is driving a need for manufacturers to take more digital paths to market. Don’t get me wrong—supply chains will always exist—but we’re seeing an increase in the number of manufacturers who are shifting how they connect with customers. And it’s raising the bar for customer shopping experiences, making the demand to offer <a>extraordinary digital experiences</a> an imperative.</p>

  <p>COVID-19 might dominate the headlines, but it’s just one of eight key factors that will reshape business in this decade. The global pandemic will have long-lasting and far-reaching impact on the business world, but other shifts in macrobusiness environment areas — such as oil prices, weakening international relationships and climate change — have not gone away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Highly leveraged debt, crumbling international alliances and bubble-like asset prices. These were overdue for a reckoning</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/what-functional-leaders-should-know-about-scenario-planning/">Executives </a>will have to grapple with a host of other challenges during the 2020s, but from that maelstrom will rise new business opportunities.</p>
<p>“The COVID-19 pandemic arrived at a time when economies were already on the edge,” says<a href="https://www.gartner.com/analyst/18594/Mark-Raskino"> Mark Raskino</a>, Distinguished VP Analyst, Gartner. “A decade-long boom, generated substantially from inexpensive finance and lower-cost energy, led to structural stresses such as highly leveraged debt, crumbling international alliances and bubble-like asset prices. These were overdue for a reckoning.”</p>
<p>[swg_ad]</p>
 No. 1: Global pandemic 
<p>The impact of <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lead-through-volatility-with-adaptive-strategy/">COVID-19 </a>will depend heavily on how long the pandemic lasts. A shorter time frame means that people will revert more quickly to pre-pandemic ways of operating. For example, after 9/11, people reverted to normal flying behavior three years later. If the pandemic persists, it’s more likely to have long-lasting societal effects. For example, the Great Depression impacted food habits for decades.</p>
<p>Think about how the pandemic will affect societal behaviors like personal hygiene and personal space norms, social gatherings and family interactions, the savings ratio and consumer buying habits.</p>
 No. 2: Market crash and recession 
<p>Although COVID-19 served as the visible catalyst for the 2020 market crashes and subsequent recovery, the reality is the markets were already fragile and precarious. In fact, Gartner found that in 2018 and 2019, half of CEOs were anticipating and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/use-this-3-phase-framework-to-navigate-the-covid-19-downturn/">preparing for an economic downturn</a>, which makes this recession unique to those in 2002–2003 and 2009.</p>
<p>Consider a variety of business and economic growth rate curves and test recovery plans against different possibilities. It’s likely that organizations will see reconfiguration and trend shifts in capital markets.</p>
 No. 3: Tech exuberance fade 
<p>For the past 10 years, a variety of game-changing emerging technologies were a big focus for companies looking to innovate and differentiate. This tech enthusiasm may deflate during the next few years. Some technology, like <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-artificial-intelligence/">artificial intelligence</a> (AI), will continue to be popular, but uptake of more “bleeding-edge” technologies like <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-cios-guide-to-quantum-computing/">quantum computing</a> and<a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/the-reality-of-blockchain/"> blockchain</a>, with less-obvious use cases, could slow.</p>
<p>Revisit plans for speculative investment in new technology as skeptical boards reduce interest in less-proven technology. Begin thinking about restructuring plans for digital transformation in the current environment. There will be a trend toward outcome focus and pragmatism over open experimentation and innovating with the latest technologies.</p>
 No. 4: Talent shortage 
<p>Despite an increase in unemployment rates globally, key talent shortages will continue to plague executives. While COVID-19 has increased unemployment and underemployment, it has not created <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/lack-of-skills-threatens-digital-transformation/">new pools of in-demand talent</a>.</p>
<p>Reconsider what types of skill sets will be needed in the post-COVID-19 world, and begin or increase reskilling programs during downtimes. Also consider ways to widen the talent availability pool by rethinking remote work or gig economy options.</p>
<p>Read more: <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/build-the-workforce-you-need-post-covid-19/">Build the Workforce You Need Post-COVID-19</a></p>
 No. 5: Systemic mistrust 
<p>Even before COVID-19, global consumer and citizen trust was at an all-time low. Now, closed borders, combined with a mistrust of “other”— even previously close trading partners — threatens to widen the gap. However, it’s possible that over the long term, a common enemy in the virus will inspire empathy, common purpose and cooperation.</p>
<p>In the meantime, consider whether consumers will continue to be loyal to long-standing brands or shift to those that have supplies of limited goods. CEOs had to make difficult decisions in response to COVID-19.</p>
<p>See if those actions have irrevocably shifted attitudes toward the brand. A more personal connection — such as an open, authentic and <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/embrace-proactive-customer-experience-in-the-midst-of-covid-19/">empathetic email to customers</a> — might help overcome distrust.</p>
 No. 6: Weak productivity 
<p>Slow productivity growth and a lack of focus on efficiency and productivity has been at odds with the economic growth of the past decade. COVID-19 could drive changes that require executives to take a closer look at operations of the organization, from out-of-date products to bureaucratic roadblocks.</p>
<p>Consider how an increased proportion of remote working will affect overall productivity. The cost of operating in a socially distanced world will increase costs, requiring significant reengineering to return to pre-COVID productivity.</p>
 No. 7: Oil price conflict 
<p>The current global economy relies on oil. At its peak in 2008, oil reached a price per barrel of $150, but now faces the opposite and unplanned extreme. In March 2020, due to a dispute between Russia and Saudi Arabia, the price per barrel dropped to around $20 and after recovering, has hovered around $40. This has the ability to reset assumptions that are the basis of global competition in many industries and reshape economies.</p>
<p>Consider how hydrocarbon energy will compete with solar and wind and how this will impact global aviation, chemicals, plastics and others. Also, consider the possibility that an overshoot on oil supply cutbacks could cause the price to spike again.</p>
 No. 8: Climate change 
<p>At the very start of 2020, climate change was moving to the forefront of framing long-term business strategy and plans. Although temporarily overshadowed by COVID-19, executives should assume it will continue to influence businesses for the next decade.</p>
<p>Don’t be fooled by temporary environmental wins caused by lockdowns and reduced travel, although you can look to these outcomes for inspiration on how to adjust work permanently. Keep in mind that major infrastructure projects designed to mitigate climate change could be delayed by a redirection of funding to stimulus packages, requiring alternative carbon reducing strategies to be invented.</p>
<p>No matter how tired or jaded their team becomes, executive leaders must <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/what-functional-leaders-should-know-about-scenario-planning/">never short-change time spent on scenario planning</a> and replanning. Expect to return to these macro factors repeatedly over the next two years. That work will be crucial to short-term corporate survival and long-term health.</p>

  <p>Nowadays, Identity and Access Management (IAM) is undeniably the first line of defense for organizations worldwide. It enables employees to securely access applications while enhancing control and transparency. But IAM is also on the change. It is already more than just the traditional employee IAM. Digital business requires advanced identity services, well beyond the human identities.</p>
<p>The segregation between various dimensions of IAM is blurring. IAM today treads the line between providing security and acting as a business enabler. It has left behind the notion of being "just IT" and turned into a necessity for implementing security and policy and a facilitator of modern business models.&nbsp;But how can security leaders turn the challenges, both legacy and new, into opportunities to mitigate risk and add value to the business? And all this in a way that will elevate the position, and change the perception, of security at the same time?</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/remote_work_iam"></a>

					 <p>Last week, the Decentralized Identity Foundation <a href="https://medium.com/decentralized-identity/building-interoperable-zkp-credential-systems-70bc20a8a809">announced work on interoperable zero-knowledge proof schemes</a> that Trinsic participated in. Since then, we’ve had some folks ask us, “What are zero-knowledge proofs?” It’s a great subject for our first Trinsic Basics post—a series of blog posts geared toward educating people who are new to the community about the powerful aspects of <a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) and verifiable credentials. So let’s kick it off!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In short, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) allow you to prove a piece of information is true (like, that you’re over 18) without revealing the information itself (your birthdate). For this post, we’ll talk about ZKPs in the context of SSI.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 The concept 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Suppose there’s a circular cave that has a door in the back (see the drawings below for detail). The door in the back requires a 4-digit code to unlock, and the only way from one side to the other is through the door. If you want to prove to your friend that you know the code without revealing the code, how could you do it? Easy! Hangout at the back by the door and come out whichever side your friend asks you to. If you do this enough times successfully, your friend will feel confident you know the code. Through this process, you will have proven you know the code without revealing the code.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
							
																					When your friend isn't looking, you go into one side of the cave.¹
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
							
																					You wait for your friend to tell you which side to come out of.²
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
							
																					If you succeed enough times, your friend will trust that you know the code.³
										
					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Applying ZKPs to verifiable credentials and SSI gives individuals the ability to leverage this power in their everyday lives.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 When would ZKPs be helpful? 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Consider a simple proof-of-age scenario. In the United States, for example, you must be 21 years old to rent a car. What if you could prove you are at least 21 years old to the rental car company without revealing your actual birthdate? Instead of handing them your driver’s license (which includes your birthdate and other personal information such as your home address), a ZKP would allow you to send a digital <a href="https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/glossary#proof">proof</a> that simply states you are 21 or older.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Other potential use cases for ZKPs include the following:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Qualifying for a loan. Instead of revealing your actual credit score to the bank, you can use a ZKP to prove that your credit score is above a certain number. The bank can trust that your credit is above a certain threshold that it defines, and you don’t have to reveal more than is necessary.  Proof of Address. If you needed to prove you lived in a certain voting district, you could use a ZKP to prove you lived in the correct area, without disclosing your address.  Not a Bot. Using ZKPs, you could prove that you are a verified person through any business flow, without disclosing any information about yourself.  <p>These scenarios center around human traits, but there are plenty of industrial, medical, automotive, and other interesting use cases as well. ZKPs are useful any time privacy or data minimization is a priority.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 How you can use ZKPs 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Trinsic allows you to take advantage of the power of ZKPs through our platform. First, you will need a digital wallet. The <a href="http://www.trinsic.id/trinsic-wallet">Trinsic Wallet</a> is a great place to start.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Second, you’ll need some credentials in that wallet. You can use the Trinsic Studio to create your own credentials in less than 5 minutes. Or you can get some sample credentials by doing a <a href="https://trinsic.id/getting-essential-workers-back-to-work-with-ssi/">demo</a> or <a href="https://www.metadigital.tech/demo/">two</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once you have a digital wallet with credentials, you’re ready to prove some stuff about yourself! To create a verifier, head to the <a href="https://studio.trinsic.id/">Trinsic Studio</a> and click on “Verifications.” Click the “Create Verification Template” button, then the “+ Policy” button, then select “Predicate.”</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>There are a lot of powerful things you can do with these verification templates, but we’ll just focus on the ZKP for now. As you can see, in this example we’re setting up a verification policy that will ask someone to prove their age is ≥ 18.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>After I’ve set up the policy, I can send it to the digital wallet. Here’s what it looks like:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
																					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>From here, the digital wallet allows you to select from any credential that satisfies the policy you sent to it.&nbsp;It’s that easy! You’ve successfully presented a proof of age without revealing any personal data.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Closing 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>While this was a lightweight introduction to zero-knowledge proofs, the topic is rich with technical complexity. At Trinsic, we strive to take complex topics and make them simple to implement. If you’d like to get started with zero-knowledge proofs in less than 10 minutes, head to the Trinsic Studio and <a href="https://studio.trinsic.id/">get started</a>!</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Decentralized Identity is a concept that may not be mainstream yet, but it is a term that embodies the sentiment that many individuals feel regarding the control they wish they had over their personal data. The public has become increasingly more vocal about the misuse of their data, and global regulation has responded to this outcry with the GDPR, CCPA, ePrivacy Directive, and more. While this grants some control over some aspects of user data, there is an assumption that underpins these privacy regulations: that personal data can be held and used by an entity other than the owner.</p>
 Identity verification a promising use case for decentralized identity 
<p>But for a decentralized identity solution to succeed, it will likely need to make a place for itself in the enterprise space first, rather than going directly to the masses. And for this strategy to work, it needs a different business case, one that addresses the public’s needs from the angle of the enterprise. This should take the difficulties that enterprises face into consideration; that enterprises are saddled with a honeypot of data – a vulnerability that must be protected – and users seek out ways to simplify their many accounts by reusing passwords. A promising use case for decentralized identity is identity verification, possible in various iterations of customer onboarding, reusable KYC, or proof-of-(attribute).</p>
 Is blockchain the obvious choice? 
<p>A decentralized architecture appears to be the most promising way forward. The entire concept is decentralized – instead of an organization holding a mass of employee and end-user data centrally, the SSI concept envisions a way where each individual is the only one that holds their identity data.</p>
<p>Blockchain has been the decentralized architecture of choice, given its strengths in the chronological sequencing of events with transparency and tamper-proof auditability. It does face a trade-off with scalability and decentralization: when a blockchain is fully decentralized, the work and time it takes per block consensus is quite high. Sacrifice the decentralized format for a network of trusted nodes (usually operated by a consortium of organizations, or a single organization), and the transactions can be trusted without such labor-intensive consensus processes.</p>
 Privacy as a challenge to blockchain 
<p>The other challenge that blockchain faces for decentralized identity is privacy. Any data published to the blockchain is permanent, making it an ill-suited match for exchanging identity data which must have the power to be removed at the owner’s request. There are workarounds, such to anonymize or pseudonymize identity data stored in each block.</p>
<p>So, is blockchain really the technology that will deliver decentralized identity solutions? We already see a few solutions coming on the market that use alternatives to blockchain, like directed graph technology. Some notable differences between the directed graph approach and the blockchain are:</p>
 
 Directed graphs do not arrange linkages in a chronological chain – as transactions are ordered with blockchain – but in a web of interconnected digital repositories. 
 Consensus is reimagined, without cryptocurrencies and mining. Some implementations require nodes issuing a transaction to validate two transactions from other nodes before its own is validated. This resolves scalability challenges that Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains face, because the more exchanges that are made with a directed graph implementation, the faster they are validated. 
 Data held in the nodes of directed graphs can be linked to a single source of truth. This means that if a piece of identity data, for example the expiration date on a license, is updated in the “off-graph” storage, it is updated in each instance throughout the graph. This is unlike blockchain, where a transaction published to the chain is permanent without the option of updates. 
 
 Directed Graphs could be better suited to identity use cases 
<p>Directed graphs seem to be better able to handle relationships, instead of transactions as we’ve seen with blockchain implementations of decentralized identity. This leaves more room for roles to change, for identity attributes to become valid and invalid, and for different personas to be used in private and professional settings. Directed graph solutions for decentralized identity are still new on the market, and more research and the test of time will reveal how this technology plays out.</p>

 What is API Security? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether an application is targeting consumers, employees, partners or otherwise, the client-side of an application (e.g., a mobile app, a web app) interacts with the server-side of an application via an Application Programming Interface (API). Simply put, APIs make it easy for a developer to create a client-side app. Microservice architectures are also made possible by APIs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because they’re often available over public networks (access from anywhere), APIs are typically well documented or easily reverse-engineered. Also highly sensitive to denial of service (DDOS) type incidents, APIs are attractive targets for bad actors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An attack might include bypassing the client-side application in an attempt to disrupt the functioning of an application for other users or to breach private information. <a>API security</a> is focused on securing this application layer and addressing what can happen if a malicious hacker were to interact with the API directly.</p>

 Frequently asked questions  What is GlobaliD? <p>GlobaliD is a digital identity platform that puts you in control of your identity and your data, allowing you to go about your day-to-day business online without sharing your personal information — unless you want&nbsp;to.</p><p>With GlobaliD, you collect verifications, which protect your privacy while giving you permission to take important actions online — like applying for a job, renting a room, or sending and receiving funds. Your GlobaliD identity and your verifications areportable, meaning that you can use it with any GlobaliD partner, and lets you control others’ access to your&nbsp;data.</p> What is a digital identity? <p>Your digital identity is a digital representation of all the identifiers and behaviors that make up who you&nbsp;are.</p><p>This could mean personal information such as your date of birth, your home address, or your government ID number. Or it could mean a secret passcode, a photograph, or even facial biometric data. With your GlobaliD digital identity, you collect verifications of those identifiers, which allows you to develop your reputation and digital trust, providing access to products and services.</p> What makes my GlobaliD different from social&nbsp;login? <p>Most digital identity platforms take ownership and control of your digital identity and your data for their own purposes. For instance, social media companies make money from selling your data to unauthorized third parties. Further, common forms of digital identity are limited and siloed, meaning that if you develop a positive reputation on one platform, you aren’t able to reuse that reputation elsewhere.</p><p>In contrast, GlobaliD is privacy-first by design, allowing you to take ownership and control of your own digital identity, so that you can use it any way you and anywhere see fit. This means that you can represent and verify yourself online in a trusted way, while retaining ownership and control of your digital identity and your&nbsp;data.</p><p>Only you can decide how your data is accessed or used, and who can access and use it. Since you own your GlobaliD digital identity, it is fully portable, allowing you to take the trust and reputation that you develop with you wherever you&nbsp;go.</p> What is a portable identity? <p>A portable identity is one that you can take with you along with the trust and reputation you’ve already established, meaning that you can use it to access and to use services anywhere.</p><p>Common forms of digital identity today aren’t portable and are instead locked within their respective platforms, so that a trusted reputation that you have worked hard to build — such as on a social media platform cannot be used at&nbsp;, an auctions marketplace, or a home rentals marketplace.</p><p>With GlobaliD, your identity is fully portable, meaning that you can take your trusted reputation with you wherever you go. This is analogous to how phone numbers were once fully-owned by network carriers, requiring you to get a new phone number every time you switched, but are now portable so that you can keep the same number even if you switch carriers.</p> What is self-sovereign identity? <p>The Sovrin Foundation: Self-sovereign identity (SSI) is a term used to describe the digital movement that recognizes an individual should own and control their identity without the intervening administrative authorities. SSI allows people to interact in the digital world with the same freedom and capacity for trust as they do in the offline&nbsp;world.</p> What are verifications? <p>Verifications are credentials you can collect that provide objective proof that your provided information has been verified as true by a specific third-party verification agency.</p> What are verification providers? <p>Verification providers are independent, third-party agencies that provide verifications for your GlobaliD digital identity. You can collect verifications from providers of your choosing to develop your reputation and digital trust. New verification providers are regularly added to the GlobaliD ecosystem.</p><p>Examples of verification providers you can access&nbsp;today:</p>  Email (Ekata, Berbix, Mandrill, and&nbsp;others)  Age (AgeChecker.Net)  Phone number (Ekata, Berbix, Civic, and&nbsp;others)  Address verification (Ekata, Onfido, Yodlee, and&nbsp;others)  Liveness (Google, Verifi.me)  Government ID (Onfido, Berbix, Veriff, Civic, and&nbsp;others)  Social media account (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google)  Bank account (Yodlee and&nbsp;others)  Cryptocurrency wallets&nbsp;(Zabo)  Accredited investor status (InvestReady)  Sanctions watchlists screening (Uphold)  College degree (National Student Clearinghouse)  Peer-to-peer vouches  Among many&nbsp;others!   What is a GlobaliD&nbsp;Name? <p>Your GlobaliD Name is a unique handle that represents your digital identity. Any verifications you collect are tied to your GlobaliD Name, allowing you to build a trusted reputation for this identity. You can claim any GlobaliD Name of your choosing as long as it’s available — it doesn’t have to be your real name. You can also claim more than one GlobaliD&nbsp;Name.</p> How does GlobaliD protect my privacy and my&nbsp;data? <p>GlobaliD protects your privacy and data through our verifications system and industry-leading security practices. GlobaliD verifications are statements that describe something about you that an independent, third-party verification agency has verified to be&nbsp;true.</p><p>Using public key cryptography, your private data is encrypted and stored in the GlobaliD Vault and can only be accessed or shared with your explicit consent. This means that your data isn’t being redundantly stored by each new service provider you choose, is only accessed on a need-to-know basis, and that these verifications of yours are portable since they can be used to verify your identity with other GlobaliD partners.</p><p>In the case of a partner data breach, your data is safe since they were never storing it themselves. That service provider can then request to delete your private data from the GlobaliD Vault. Nobody — including GlobaliD — can decrypt your personal data without your express permission.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/globalid-frequently-asked-questions-738947ebcfeb">GlobaliD—Frequently asked questions</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/small">Mike Small</a></p><p>On July 22nd, 2020 IBM announced their <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/financial-services">IBM Cloud for Financial Services</a> – what is this, why have IBM taken this step, and what does this announcement mean?</p>
 Financial Services Compliance Challenges 
<p>One recurring challenge for all organizations is complying with the ever-increasing number of laws and regulations. When IT services are delivered on-premises organizations often believe that this ensures the oversight, control and visibility needed to ensure and prove compliance. This is not the case with cloud-delivered services where there is a shared responsibility model and less visibility of the CSP controls. However, digital transformation initiatives are adopting cloud services to provide speed and agility, and this is leading to tensions between the organization's functions for digital transformation and those responsible for risk and compliance. Nowhere is this more apparent than in financial services.</p>
<p>The hyperscale CSPs such as AWS, Azure and IBM provide easy access to the capabilities needed by development teams to accelerate the creation of critical new business applications. While the major cloud service providers go to great lengths to secure the infrastructure of their environments it is up to the customer to secure their use and to prove compliance. This is often outside the skills of DevOps teams or is overlooked and can lead to the existence of critical vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cyber adversaries.&nbsp;</p>
 Compliance is not enough – you need to prove you are compliant 
<p>Another challenge is that even where a cloud service is well secured and is being used in a compliant manner, the customer must prove that this is the case to regulators. CSPs often approach this by publishing long lists or the laws and regulations with which their service is compliant. However, this is not sufficient to solve the customers’ compliance challenges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>From the customer’s perspective, there is a need to show how the controls that they have in place contribute to meeting their regulatory obligations. These obligations vary from customer to customer as do the risks and so each customer will have an individual mapping between risks, controls, and obligations. This mapping is complex and must include all IT services involved irrespective of how they are delivered. This means including how the controls within the service are governed as well as how they are used and there must be adequate proof the controls not only exist and are effective but also how they map to obligations and risks. In effect, this is a specialized form of cloud security posture management described in a previous <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/small/cloud-security-posture-management-tools">blog</a>.</p>
 IBM Policy Framework for Financial Services 
<p>It is in this area that IBM have taken action for Financial Services.</p>
<p>In collaboration with Bank of America, and using the knowledge from the IBM Promontory, IBM has created the IBM Policy Framework for Financial Services. This is intended to deliver the benefits and flexibility of a public cloud in a secure environment, to enable financial institutions, ISVs and SaaS providers to host apps and workloads in the cloud with confidence and trust.</p>
<p>IBM has established an Industry Cloud Advisory Council in support of the IBM Policy Framework for Financial Services. This will support this effort and advise on its ongoing advancement. Chief Technology Officer Tony Kerrison will represent Bank of America on the Council, which will be led by Howard Boville, SVP, IBM Cloud. The Council will be focused on bringing major financial institutions together to help drive the strategic evolution of cloud security in this highly regulated sector.</p>
<p>This Policy framework defines a set of controls based on financial services needs mapped into specific controls on the IBM Cloud. For example, the obligation to protect data end to end is supported by a wide range of IBM Cloud features and controls. These include IBM Cloud™ Hyper Protect Crypto Services which is a key management and cloud hardware security module (HSM) and puts controls of keys into clients’ hands to meet obligations for key management and data protection.</p>
<p>The Policy Framework is based on:</p>
 
 IBM public cloud controls aligned with NIST that are relevant to financial services’ needs. 
 Implementation and deployment practices to guide ISV and SaaS providers with cloud services architectures. 
 Implementation and evidence guidance for ISV and SaaS providers to complete and evidence compliance to the Policy Framework. 
 
<p>In support of this IBM have also announced their Financial Services Compliance Centre which is based on their OpenPages GRC tool augmented by assets acquired through their <a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2020-06-15-IBM-Acquires-Assets-from-Spanugo">recent acquisition of Spanugo</a>.</p>
 My Opinion 
<p>This is an interesting development in the cloud space. It addresses the compliance challenges that are faced by financial services organizations and which according to IBM are limiting their adoption of public cloud services. It illustrates the difficulties faced by all organizations where the hybrid IT delivery model driven by digital transformation has added to the complexities of matching controls to risks and demonstrating compliance in a consistent manner. This approach is likely to become important in other regulated industries.</p>

 Attacks and account take-overs like last week’s Twitter hack are completely avoidable. Enterprises must implement biometric multi-factor authentication to ensure that only the right users have access to the right systems at all times. If they don’t, users will continue being vulnerable to hacks and&nbsp;scams. <blockquote>“A New York Times report that has yet to be confirmed by Twitter said that hackers breached employee Slack accounts and found credentials for the Twitter backend pinned inside a Slack channel,” — <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-says-hackers-downloaded-the-data-of-eight-users-in-wednesdays-hack/">ZDNet</a></blockquote><p>The hackers responsible for last week’s attack were able to breach Twitter’s backend systems by stealing credentials from within the social media platform’s private employee Slack channel. Once inside Twitter’s systems, the attackers were then free to take over at least <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-says-hackers-downloaded-the-data-of-eight-users-in-wednesdays-hack/">103 accounts and download the personal data of at least 8 accounts</a>.</p><p>In light of this unprecedented attack, we have to ask ourselves some serious questions — what were login credentials doing on the public Slack channel in the first place? Why were they posted there publicly for ease of access? How did the hackers get access to Twitter’s slack? Were those credentials phished out of an employee in an advanced social engineering attack?</p><p>If there’s one thing that’s certain, it’s that passwords are inherently insecure, and failing us. Despite the known security risks, even the world’s biggest companies still struggle with enforcing proper password&nbsp;hygiene.</p><p>Why then, are companies like Twitter still using passwords as a means of accessing their backend systems, when biometric multi-factor authentication solutions for the workforce are on the&nbsp;market?</p><p>To avoid disastrous hacks and breaches, companies must immediately stop using passwords to authenticate employees and start embracing biometric multi-factor authentication as a weapon to permanently end hacks caused by compromised credentials.</p> Why would biometric multi-factor authentication have stopped the Twitter&nbsp;attack?  1. Without passwords, there is nothing to steal, lose or remember. <p>Biometric multi-factor authentication can help secure corporate systems by removing human error from the equation altogether. Unlike passwords, biometrics can’t be easily stolen, faked, or phished. Biometrics also can’t be shared between multiple users, written down and published online, or forgotten.</p><p>If Twitter (and Slack) were using biometric multi-factor authentication, the entire attack could have been foiled — saving Twitter and Slack their respective reputations, and Twitter’s users hundreds of thousands of&nbsp;dollars.</p> 2. Biometric MFA can stop bad actors from moving through a&nbsp;network <p>Biometric multi-factor authentication solutions allow for seamless and secure authentication that is minimally disruptive to workflow and the user-experience. This means biometric MFA can be used to set stringent access controls for users, ensuring that only the right people have access to the right systems at the right&nbsp;time.</p><p>In last week’s attack, once the hacker gained access to Twitter’s systems via the compromised credentials found on the company’s Slack channel, they were then free to move through the network until they found a way to hack the accounts of prolific&nbsp;users.</p><p>The hacker’s ability to move through the network indicates that Twitter wasn’t using MFA to secure employee access at multiple entry points to its corporate systems.</p><p>Access controls ensure that lower-level employees aren’t able to move through a network, meaning that if a single set of login credentials are compromised, a hacker can’t then use them to freely move within a network until they find sensitive and private&nbsp;data.</p><p>Having biometric MFA checks at each access point in Twitter’s system would have prevented the attacker from moving laterally through Twitter’s network, which would have stopped them from breaching multiple&nbsp;systems.</p> 3. Biometric multi-factor authentication provides greater security than two-factor authentication <blockquote>“Twitter said hackers got “through” their two-factor protections but did not specify if it referred to the backend accounts or the Slack accounts.” — <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-says-hackers-downloaded-the-data-of-eight-users-in-wednesdays-hack/">ZDNet</a></blockquote><p>Why didn’t Twitter’s two-factor authentication stop the&nbsp;attack?</p><p>The short answer is obvious: Twitter’s 2FA solution still relies on passwords — which are inherently insecure.</p><p>Twitter uses 2FA solutions that combine passwords (something only the user should know) and one-time codes (sent to either the user’s phone via SMS or push or the user’ email address — which only the user should have access to) to authenticate its&nbsp;users.</p><p>The problem with 2FA solutions that partly depend on passwords is that one half of the entire solution is unreliable. If a password is compromised or shared willingly between people (as was the case with credentials being pinned in Twitter’s Slack), all a bad-actor then needs to do is compromise the user’s device or email accounts to bypass 2FA. Unfortunately, this is easily done if the user’s passwords for these accounts have also been compromised.</p><p>One-time codes (the second half of 2FA solutions) sent via text or email have their own security risks; if an email account or phone number has been compromised without the victim’s knowledge, then bypassing the 2FA security becomes entirely possible.</p> If one thing is certain: Biometric multi-factor authentication would have stopped the Twitter&nbsp;hack <p>Biometric multi-factor authentication solutions depend on the user proving who they are via their unique biometrics (something that can’t be easily stolen or faked), and via proof that they have their registered device (by only logging into accounts from these devices). With biometric MFA, the reliably strong methods for authenticating users are fundamentally more secure than 2FA solutions that depend on inherently insecure authentication methods.</p> To prevent hacks for good, biometric MFA must also be privacy-enhancing and universal <p>While biometrics remove human error from the cybersecurity equation, they aren’t necessarily immune to being hacked — that’s why it’s critical that biometric multi-factor authentication solutions are also privacy-enhancing.</p><p>At <a href="http://keyless.io">Keyless</a>, we combine multi-modal biometrics with privacy-enhancing technology to provide a passwordless, secure and privacy-enhancing authentication solution. Our multi-factor solution can be implemented at every access point, ensuring that only the right users have the right access at the right&nbsp;time.</p><blockquote>“Designed with privacy in&nbsp;mind”</blockquote><p>By providing a secure, frictionless way to establish access controls at multiple entry-points, Keyless prevents unauthorized movement through a company’s private systems. This protects from threats like the Twitter hack, where an unauthorized user wreaked havoc simply by stumbling upon a set of compromised credentials.</p> Privacy-enhancing technology allows Keyless to do two&nbsp;things:  1) Ensure biometric data is never&nbsp;exposed. <p>Keyless uses <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/a-beginners-guide-to-shamir-s-secret-sharing-e864efbf3648">privacy-enhancing technology</a> to transform biometric data so that it never represents personally identifiable information. This is done via a one-way encryption function. The transformed data is then split into fragments and stored on different servers (nodes) in the Keyless Cloud Network (instead of on the user’s device). This means that even if one (or all) of the nodes are compromised, that a user’s personal information is never at risk of being compromised.</p> 2) Authenticate users without viewing raw biometric data. <p>Keyless uses <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/a-beginners-guide-to-secure-multiparty-computation-dc3fb9365458">secure multiparty computation </a>— a privacy-enhancing technology — that allows multiple nodes in our network to authenticate users without needing to view the raw components of the&nbsp;data.</p><p>To protect end-users and organizations against fraudulent takeovers, Keyless leverages advanced liveness detection and anti-spoofing techniques, in addition to the built-in multi-factor security. This allows Keyless to ensure that only the real user gains access to private accounts.</p> There’s no excuse to continue using passwords — it’s time to go passwordless <p>At Keyless, we believe biometrics are the answer for solving the key challenges that have arisen in cybersecurity, which ultimately led to the Twitter hack last&nbsp;week.</p><p>Biometric multi-factor authentication allows us to close the gap between security, privacy, and convenience. By leveraging biometric solutions, organizations can offer both a seamless authentication experience and powerful security. Thereby putting a permanent stop to hacks and threats caused by compromised or weak credentials.</p><p>If companies want to avoid future large-scale attacks and hacks like last week’s Twitter hack, then they should immediately be looking to ditch passwords for good. It’s time for enterprises and technology companies to embrace passwordless authentication to secure corporate systems, implement access controls, and protect their&nbsp;users.</p><p>If they don’t, they’ll leave themselves and their users vulnerable to financial scams, privacy breaches, fraud, and identity&nbsp;theft.</p> Request a Free Trial of&nbsp;Keyless <p>Keyless™ authentication can help deliver secure and seamless digital experiences for your end-users and for your increasingly remote workforce.</p><p>Head to our <a href="http://keyless.io">website</a> to learn more about our biometric authentication and identity management solutions.</p><p><a href="http://www.keyless.io">www.keyless.io</a></p><p>Alternatively, you can email us directly at <a href="http://info@keyless.io">info@keyless.io</a></p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/if-twitter-did-this-one-simple-thing-last-weeks-attack-would-never-have-happened-fca128786bd3">If Twitter did this one simple thing, last week’s attack would never have happened</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech">KeylessTech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Shortly after 4PM last Wednesday, the Twitter accounts of major celebrities, tech companies, and CEOs all began posting tweets promising free cryptocurrency to followers who sent Bitcoin to a specific address within the next 30 minutes. The crypto scam turned out to be part of a massive coordinated hack affecting dozens of major Twitter accounts with millions of followers, the largest security breach in the company’s history.</p><p>The hack compromised the Twitter accounts of former U.S. President Barack Obama and presidential candidate Joe Biden, billionaire tech founders and CEOs Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and major tech companies such as Apple and Coinbase. Overall, 130 accounts were targeted. After fears grew that Twitter had been fatally compromised, the company blocked tweets from verified accounts as it assessed the damage, many of which were restored a few hours later. </p><p>According to the Bitcoin address used in the tweets, scammers likely made off with over a hundred thousand dollars within just a few minutes. The tweets were all a variation of the same message, offering followers a chance to double their Bitcoin in return for simply sending some to a specified address.</p><p>“I am giving back to the community. All Bitcoin sent to the address below will be sent back doubled! If you send $1,000, I will send back $2,000. Only doing this for 30 minutes,” read a typical tweet. The crypto scam closely followed the Bitcoin impersonation scams that proliferated on Twitter following the big crypto boom in 2017, except this time, instead of scammers impersonating Twitter accounts, they hacked them.</p><p>While on the surface it appears like the attack was primarily carried out to scam followers out of Bitcoin, it’s possible that the attackers were actually after something more valuable - the direct messages of high-profile politicians, tech executives, and celebrities. According to Twitter’s official support account, attackers were able to download all of the data for eight of the compromised accounts using the platform’s “Your Twitter Data” tool.</p><blockquote><p>For up to eight of the Twitter accounts involved, the attackers took the additional step of downloading the account’s information through our “Your Twitter Data” tool. We are reaching out directly to any account owner where we know this to be true.</p>— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1284331132255756288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 18, 2020</a></blockquote> <p></p><p>That would include direct messages and, in some cases, synced address books. Depending on which accounts the attackers stole data from, this information could be worth far more than whatever Bitcoin they collected from the crypto scam. While Twitter has not directly disclosed the eight impacted accounts, the company has said that none of the eight were Verified accounts.</p><p>Regardless, the fact that the attackers were able to download user data signals that they most likely had full access to the accounts. In order to carry out the hack, it appears as though the attackers targeted Twitter employees to gain access to the company’s internal systems. In a Twitter Support tweet, the company said, “We detected what we believe to be a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools.”</p><p>In a followup thread on Thursday, the company said that there was no evidence that attackers accessed passwords and that instead they accessed tools only available to Twitter’s internal support teams. As of Saturday, the company <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident.html">confirmed in a blog post</a> that of the 130 accounts targeted, “for 45 of those accounts, the attackers were able to initiate a password reset, login to the account, and send Tweets.”</p><p>Social engineering remains one of the most glaring weak spots when it comes to cybersecurity, as shown by last week’s hack. Some of the biggest data breaches of all time have been the result of social engineering schemes, from a <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3180762/inside-the-russian-hack-of-yahoo-how-they-did-it.html">phishing attack that led to 3 billion Yahoo accounts</a> being compromised to a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/anatomy-of-the-target-data-breach-missed-opportunities-and-lessons-learned/">major breach that exposed over a 100 million credit cards at Target</a> in 2013.</p><p>With such vast reach, a critical security compromise of a major social media platform such as Twitter could have a far more disastrous impact if, for instance, more nefarious hackers were to gain access to and send threatening or alarmist messages from the account of a high profile politician or executive. Such a scenario could severely impact the stock market or elicit a negative response from another country.</p><p>That exact scenario happened in 2013, when a <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-day-in-history-hacked-ap-tweet-about-white-house-explosions-triggers-panic-2018-04-23">single post from the Associated Press’ Twitter account</a> sent the Dow Jones into a tailspin and momentarily wiped $136.5 billion off of the S&amp;P 500’s total market capitalization. “Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama Injured,” read the tweet. It turned out to be fake and was quickly deleted, but it made clear the real world effects of insecure social media platforms.</p><p>We’re lucky that Wednesday’s hack was used for the rather mundane purpose of attempting to get followers to part with some of their cryptocurrency, it could have been much worse. Still, the frequent occurrence of major hacks and data breaches continues to be alarming.

 The GiD Report#119 — Ray Dalio examines history to understand the chaos we’re experiencing today <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-118-the-fastest-growing-cybercrime-and-what-it-tells-us-about-identity-65807d150062">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Some quick housekeeping:</p><p>Check out <a href="https://medium.">Greg’s Linqto panel appearance (alongside Uphold’s JP and&nbsp;others)</a>.</p><p>Greg also recently participated in a special class with Moscow School of Management SKOLKOVO and International Investor Organization INVESTORO. You can <a href="https://www.investoro.com/gregkidd/en">check it out&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>This week we’ve&nbsp;got:</p>  Ray Dalio on the big cycle of the U.S. part&nbsp;1  The world’s largest companies (and how they’ve changed over the last 10&nbsp;years)  The EU’s big ruling on U.S. cloud services and data&nbsp;sharing  Ben Thompson on the TikTok&nbsp;war  The New Yorker on the history of platforms and the future of online&nbsp;speech  Stuff happens   1. Ray Dalio has been working on a series of reports outlining the history of big cycles to help him understand what’s going on today — which we’ve covered in the past. (Ray’s the founder of Bridgewater, one of the biggest hedge funds around in terms of&nbsp;AUM.) <p>[<a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-a-tragic-week-explained-catholicism-without-hell-and-a-new-world-order-855f217d8537">Check out our last report on Ray&nbsp;here</a>.]</p><p>For Ray, each big cycle is comprised of 3 main&nbsp;parts:</p>  the long-term debt/monetary cycle,  the wealth and political gap&nbsp;cycle,  and the global geopolitical cycle  <p>So it’s pretty intuitive to see how it applies to where we are today — at the end of another big cycle. Debt is at record highs. Inflation is zero or negative. And governments and central banks around the world are borrowing and printing just to stay&nbsp;afloat.</p><p>We’ve also seen wealth and power accumulate at the top — expanding inequality and fueling monopolies as the winners take all. In parallel, we’re seeing the rise of populism on the left and right with people like Bernie, AOC, and Trump and movements like&nbsp;BLM.</p><p>With the center — socially, economically, and politically — crumbling, the U.S. has never been more divided. It’s a climate in which wearing a mask sparks intense debate, drawing social and political lines in the&nbsp;sand.</p><p>Geopolitically, things are only getting messier. A lot messier. And if things were feeling a bit biblical already with the pandemic, there’s also that locust&nbsp;plague:</p><blockquote>Locusts in swarms the size of Manhattan have been ravaging crops through East Africa, the Middle East and South Asia and could be “a bigger threat in some of these countries than Covid-19,” according to Gro Intelligence CEO Sara&nbsp;Menker.</blockquote><p>Anyway, Ray just published Part 1 of his latest report, Chapter 4, which covers <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/chapter-4-big-cycle-united-states-dollar-part-1-ray-dalio/">the Big Cycle in the context of the U.S</a>. Part 1 is mostly history — much of which is super interesting and detailed, but probably the biggest takeaways are the principles he outlines.</p>Ray Dalio, Bridgewater<p>Some highlights:</p>  Severe economic downturns with large wealth gaps, large debts, and ineffective monetary policies make a combustible combination that typically leads to significant conflicts and revolutionary changes within countries.  Deflationary depressions are debt crises caused by there not being enough money in the hands of debtors to service their debts. They inevitably lead to the printing of money, debt restructurings, and government spending programs that increase the supply of, and reduce the value of, money and credit. The only question is how long it takes for government officials to make this&nbsp;move.  During periods of severe economic distress and large wealth gaps, there are typically revolutionarily large redistributions of wealth. When done peacefully these are achieved through large tax increases on the rich and big increases in the supply of money that devalue debtors’ claims, and when done violently they are achieved by forced asset confiscations.  <p>All of which leads us to today. I’ll wait for Ray’s next piece and let him outline where we’re going since this is heady stuff and really the only concrete conclusions I can make is that things are going to change and there’s going to be a lot of uncertainty.</p><p>Mostly I just have questions:</p>  How will this change the way we think about and manage our money and our value and our&nbsp;wealth?  How will the rise of populist forces impact the current corporate-led political establishment? (And in turn what does that mean for the country’s most powerful companies — the majority of which are&nbsp;tech?)  How will this impact how society thinks about bottom-up approaches versus top&nbsp;down?  How do we think about trust in a world that becomes increasingly distrustful?  Who are the real winners and losers in the rejiggered landscape? (Aside from… Tesla and Moderna.)  China?  <p>Here’s how Ray frames what potentially might come within a historical context:</p><blockquote>What is fascism, and why was it adopted in countries like Germany and Japan? Consider the following three big choices that one has to make in order choose a country’s approach to governance:</blockquote><blockquote>a) bottom-up (democratic) or top-down (autocratic) decision-making,</blockquote><blockquote>b) capitalist or communist (with socialist in the middle) ownership of production, and</blockquote><blockquote>c) individualistic (which treats the well-being of the individual with paramount importance) or collectivist (which treats the well-being of the whole with paramount importance).</blockquote><blockquote>Pick the one from each category that you believe works best for your nation’s values and ambitions and you have your preferred approach. Fascism is autocratic, capitalist, and collectivist. Fascists believed that top-down autocratic leadership, in which the government directs the production of privately held companies in a way that individual gratification is subordinated to national success, is the best way to make the country and its people wealthier and more powerful.</blockquote><blockquote>The United States and Great Britain believed that the democratic, capitalist, and individualistic mix was better, while the Soviet Union believed that the autocratic, communist, and collectivist mix was&nbsp;best.</blockquote><p>Of course, that was then. What comes next is still up in the&nbsp;air.</p><p>Ultimately, that’s the silver lining here. Everything is primed for&nbsp;change.</p><p>That’s scary. It’ll be messy. And I certainly don’t want to downplay the negative impact that all of this is and will continue to have on so many people around the&nbsp;world.</p><p>But it’s also a massive opportunity to help shape whatever comes&nbsp;next.</p><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-13/bank-of-england-debating-digital-currency-creation-bailey-says">Bank of England Debating Digital Currency Creation, Bailey&nbsp;Says</a>  <a href="https://pv.glenbrook.com/covid-19-will-finally-force-b2b-digital-adoption/">COVID-19 Will (Finally!)

In terms of the consolidation of power and wealth, here’s a report from Fifth Era that highlights the cosmic shift in corporate power over the last&nbsp;decade. <p><a href="https://list-manage.agle1.cc/onlinelink/6745784850644992/6329074142150656/PBXHWo1PHDnoJ?ns=fifthera">Fifth Era</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><p>2010 World’s Largest Companies by Market&nbsp;Cap</p>  PetroChina ($329&nbsp;bn)  Exxon ($316&nbsp;bn)  Microsoft ($256&nbsp;bn)  ICBC ($246&nbsp;bn)  Apple ($213&nbsp;bn)  BHP Billiton ($209&nbsp;bn)  Wal-Mart ($209&nbsp;bn)  Berkshire Hathaway ($200&nbsp;bn)  General Electric ($194&nbsp;bn)  China Mobile ($193&nbsp;bn)  <p>5 years&nbsp;later:</p><p>2015 World’s Largest Companies by Market&nbsp;Cap</p>  Apple ($621&nbsp;bn)  Google ($408&nbsp;bn)  Microsoft ($347&nbsp;bn)  Berkshire Hathaway ($318&nbsp;bn)  Exxon Mobile ($304&nbsp;bn)  Johnson &amp; Johnson ($257&nbsp;bn)  General Electric ($248&nbsp;bn)  China Mobile ($243&nbsp;bn)  Novartis($240 bn)  Nestle ($233&nbsp;bn)  <p>And now:</p><p>2020 World’s Largest Companies by Market&nbsp;Cap</p>  Apple ($1,576&nbsp;bn)  Microsoft ($1,551&nbsp;bn)  Amazon.com ($1,432&nbsp;bn)  Alphabet ($980&nbsp;bn)  Facebook ($676&nbsp;bn)  Tencent ($620&nbsp;bn)  Alibaba ($579&nbsp;bn)  Berkshire Hathaway ($433&nbsp;bn)  Visa ($413&nbsp;bn)  Johnson &amp; Johnson ($370&nbsp;bn)   3. Speaking of increasing distrust, the big news last week is that the EU ruled against American cloud services. <p>The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/eus-top-court-restricts-personal-data-transfers-to-u-s-citing-surveillance-concerns-11594888385">WSJ reports</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/ctomc">/ctomc</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/hn">/hn</a>):</p><blockquote>Thousands of companies will face restrictions on storing information about European Union residents on U.S. servers, after the bloc’s top court ruled that such transfers exposed Europeans to American government surveillance without “actionable rights” to challenge it.</blockquote><blockquote>The surprise ruling Thursday from the European Court of Justice, which invalidates a widely used EU-U.S. data-transfer agreement known as Privacy Shield, is a victory for privacy activists who have long said the U.S.’s surveillance practices should make it ineligible to store European&nbsp;data.</blockquote><blockquote>The decision, which pits European data-privacy concerns against U.S. national-security priorities, will create legal headaches and potentially disrupt operations for thousands of multinational companies. Depending on how it is applied, the ruling could force some of them — including tech giants such as Amazon.com Inc., AMZN +4.04% Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc. GOOG +2.41% and Apple Inc. — to decide between a costly shift toward data centers into Europe or cutting off business with the&nbsp;region.</blockquote><p>Also:</p>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/eus-top-court-restricts-personal-data-transfers-to-u-s-citing-surveillance-concerns-11594888385">EU’s Top Court Restricts Personal-Data Transfers to U.S., Citing Surveillance Concerns</a>  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/13/india-regulator-non-personal-data-draft-report/">India seeks new regulator for nonpersonal data — TechCrunch</a>   4. And that distrust goes both&nbsp;ways. <p>Here’s <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/the-tiktok-war/">Ben Thompson on The TikTok&nbsp;War</a>:</p><blockquote>After all, this certainly wasn’t the first time that TikTok has seemed to act politically: the service censored #BlackLivesMatter and #GeorgeFloyd, blocked a teenager discussing China’s genocide in Xinjiang, and blocked a video of Tank Man. The Guardian published TikTok guidelines that censored Tiananmen Square, Tibetan independence, and the Falun Gong, and I myself demonstrated that TikTok appeared to be censoring the Hong Kong protests and Houston Rockets basketball team.</blockquote><blockquote>The point, though, is not just censorship, but its inverse: propaganda. TikTok’s algorithm, unmoored from the constraints of your social network or professional content creators, is free to promote whatever videos it likes, without anyone knowing the difference. TikTok could promote a particular candidate or a particular issue in a particular geography, without anyone — except perhaps the candidate, now indebted to a Chinese company — knowing. You may be skeptical this might happen, but again, China has already demonstrated a willingness to censor speech on a platform banned in China; how much of a leap is it to think that a Party committed to ideological dominance will forever leave a route directly into the hearts and minds of millions of Americans untouched?</blockquote><p>…</p><blockquote>First, data security is absolutely a concern. To that end all companies that deal with valuable intellectual property or national security-related information should ban the use of WeChat by any of their employees, as should the government; it is simply too easy to pass information, even by accident. In addition, that same group of companies and governments should not use Zoom until the (American) company has shifted the bulk of its engineering out of China and demonstrated vastly improved corporate controls.</blockquote><blockquote>What matters more in an ideological war, though, is influence, and that is why I do believe that ByteDance’s continued ownership of TikTok is unacceptable. My strong preference would be for ByteDance to sell TikTok to non-Chinese investors or a non-Chinese company, by which I mean not-Facebook. TikTok is not only a brilliant app that figured out video on mobile, it is also shaping up to be a major challenge to Facebook’s hold on attention and thus, in the long run, advertising. This would be a very good thing, and I fear that simply banning TikTok will simply leave the market to Instagram Reels, Facebook’s TikTok&nbsp;clone.</blockquote> 5. All of that is compounded by a general sense of distrust in technology overall. Well, maybe distrust isn’t the right word here. But the pressures of where we are in the cycle and the impact of these rapidly accelerating trends is making us reevaluate our understanding of the platforms that more so than ever define&nbsp;us. <p>Here’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/trump-twitter-facebook-and-the-future-of-online-speech">a nifty New Yorker piece on the future of online speech</a> and the history of those platforms and the relevant regs that fostered them (via <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><blockquote>Ultimately, the problems that need solving may not be ones of content moderation. In the book “Platform Capitalism,” published in 2017, the economist Nick Srnicek explores the reliance of digital platforms on “network effects,” in which value increases for both users and advertisers as a service expands its pool of participants and suite of offerings. Network effects, Srnicek writes, orient platforms toward monopolization; monopolization, in turn, makes it easier for a single tweet to be an extension of state power, or for a single thirty-six-year-old entrepreneur, such as Zuckerberg, to influence the speech norms of the global digital commons. Both outcomes might be less likely if there were other places to go. The business model common to many social-media platforms, meanwhile, is itself an influence over online speech. Advertisers are attracted by data about users; that data is created through the constant production and circulation of user-generated content; and so controversial content, which keeps users posting and sharing, is valuable. From this perspective, Donald Trump is an ideal user of Twitter. A different kind of business might encourage a different kind of&nbsp;user.</blockquote><blockquote>Nothing about the current arrangement should be treated as inevitable; the commercial Internet is relatively young. Many scholars and tech critics have begun to look beyond the issue of moderation. Some argue for legislation requiring algorithmic transparency, which would illuminate how information is prioritized and amplified; Klonick has suggested that tech companies should register as public-benefit corporations, which would be required, by their charters, to benefit society as well as make money. (The Corporation for Public Broadcasting and New York’s M.T.A. are P.B.C.s.) In an article published in the Minnesota Law Review, “The Law of the Platform,” Orly Lobel, a law professor at the University of San Diego, argues that many of the most innovative Web sites don’t sell products, as such; instead, they offer their users access to algorithms, and to “a digital system of reputation and trust” that connects them. Regulating these never-before-seen businesses effectively, she writes, may require going “back to first principles,” thinking in fresh ways about what online platforms are and how we want them to&nbsp;behave.</blockquote><p>Related:</p>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/inside-the-federal-trade-commissions-facebook-probe-2b2b58c6-8469-40a7-832e-4fc8d8b9de0f.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axioslogin&amp;stream=top">Inside the Federal Trade Commission’s Facebook&nbsp;probe</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/twitters-big-hack-bares-broad-dangers-b6c05341-c2a6-468e-b719-5b52b411c941.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top">Twitter’s big hack bares broad&nbsp;dangers</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/twitter-doesnt-need-web-3-0-to-solve-its-identity-problem">Preston Byrne: Twitter Doesn’t Need Web 3.0 For Its Identity Problem — CoinDesk</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/m">/m</a>— <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/hackers-take-over-prominent-crypto-twitter-accounts-in-simultaneous-attack">Twitter Hack Takes Down Joe Biden, Elon Musk Accounts in Widespread Bitcoin Scam Attack — CoinDesk</a>  Via <a href="https://global.id/toddjcollins">/toddjcollins</a>— <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/15/twitter-accounts-hacked-crypto-scam/">High-profile Twitter accounts simultaneously hacked to spread crypto scam — TechCrunch</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/money-reimagined-this-isnt-good-for-bitcoin">This isn’t good for&nbsp;Bitcoin</a>   6.

<p>Dental staff are among the most vulnerable professions for COVID-19 infection risk. In March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that healthcare systems prioritize urgent visits and delay elective care to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in healthcare settings.</p>
<p>According to the April 1, 2020 edition of ADA News ("HPI poll examines impact of COVID-19 on dental practices"), by early April, 95% of dental practices were fully shuttered—or open only for emergency care.</p>
<p>A COVID-19 pandemic does not mean your teeth go on a vacation from needing cleanings, fillings, or root canals. Eventually, dental-office staff and patients need to go back to supporting their communities with peace of mind.</p>
<p>In order to enhance safety and confidence, the Georgia Academy of General Dentistry (GAGD) has partnered with MedCreds to more safely bring its members and their communities together. By promoting FDA-approved COVID-19 tests and using MedCreds’ verifiable credentialing for those tests, dentists, staff, and patients can now verify one another’s COVID-19-test-result status before any dental procedures.</p>
<p>Through COVID-19 testing and using MedCreds’ privacy-preserving COVID-19 test result credentials — which are owned and controlled exclusively by the patient—dentists can better protect staff and patients from COVID-19 infection risk.</p>
<p>ESSENTIAL TO THE PUBLIC’S HEALTH</p>
<p>In an April 17, 2020 letter written by American Dental Association (ADA) President Chad P. Gehani and Executive Director Kathleen T. O’Loughlin to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, dentistry was labeled “essential to the public’s health”.</p>
<p>“Enabling dentists to test patients prior to dental treatment will help lower the ‘very high exposure risk’ of dental personnel in contracting COVID-19 when treating infected but asymptomatic patients,” wrote Gehani and O’Loughlin in the HHS letter.</p>
<p>O'Loughlin added that testing patients prior to dental treatment would add a layer of safety for both dental personnel and the patients they treat.</p>
<p>DENTAL STAFF TEAM SAFETY</p>
<p>Dentists, dental assistants, dental hygienists, and office staff are among the most at-risk medical professions in this pandemic.</p>
<p>By strictly following ADA and CDC guidelines, and incorporating MedCreds’ verifiable COVID-19 test results credentials into safety protocols, dentists make a visible commitment to the safety of patients, staff, and their families.</p>
<p>MEDCREDS TECHNOLOGY</p>
<p>At its core, MedCreds offers a digital verifiable credential that is a simple, private, and trusted way for a person to hold—and verify to others—their medical test results.</p>
<p>Built on blockchain and cryptography technology and accepted as an open-source global technology standard, MedCreds’ verifiable credentials allow people to verify and share their health status from a smartphone or personal computer, while fully controlling who is able to access their health status information.</p>
<p>By using blockchain-supported verifiable credentials, dental patients can prove their COVID-19 and other health test result status without also sharing unnecessary personal information. This protects personal privacy, and empowers individuals to securely share personal health information.</p>
<p>At the same time, dental practices have greater confidence that staff and patients are meeting best-practice requirements for COVID-19 safety.</p>
<p>THE ‘TRIANGLE OF TRUST’</p>
<p>Verifiable credentials facilitate interactions using a pattern called the "Triangle of Trust"</p>
<p>Issuers (e.g. a certified lab or doctor) issue digital credentials to a patient.</p>
<p>Holders (that would be you) receive a digital credential from an Issuer. This credential is stored in a “digital wallet” (a mobile app) which is accessible from a phone or computer.The holder can then share their COVID-19 test result status.</p>
<p>Verifiers (e.g. a dental receptionist) are those who may request a patient’s COVID-19 test result by sharing a web-link or QR code that prompts a patient for their consent to share their test result status.</p>
<p>HOW TO IMPLEMENT MEDCREDS</p>
<p>Any dentist office can simply and quickly have a MedCreds account created. After that, dentist-office staff can invite all patients and staff to create their free accounts at MedCreds.com by sending to them an email or SMS. The test result credentials can be easily and securely issued via the MedCreds web-portal platform.</p>
<p>When a patient arrives at a dentist office, the receptionist will request that they share their COVID-19 test result (and/or other type of test such as body temperature) by scanning a QR code, or responding to an email or text message. The credential verification proof will show the required information, such as COVID-19 test date, who administered the test, and the test result. But, that verification proof will only be shared after the credential holder (the patient) reviews and approves the sharing of their credential information.</p>
<p>In addition, your patient can also share this status at other locations (e.g. schools, office buildings, airplanes), or any place/situation that requires verifying their COVID-19 test result.</p>
<p>MedCreds enables your patients and staff at your dental office to confirm that each others’ COVID-19 test results were issued by an authorized medical authority.</p>
<p>When a patient schedules a dental appointment, there are important steps that should be taken before issuing a MedCreds “digital credential.”</p>
<p>THE MEDCREDS PATIENT PROCESS</p>
<p>Step #1: A patient remotely asks a dentist to order an FDA-approved COVID-19 test from their local lab.</p>
<p>Step #2: The dentist chooses a lab where the test will be performed.</p>
<p>Step #3: The dentist receives and reviews the test result, and—using the MedCreds’ platform—issues to the patient their personal, verifiable test-result credential.</p>
<p>Step #4: The patient now owns and controls the digital COVID-19 test result credential, and can share their result using a scannable QR code.</p>
<p>Step #5: Upon arriving at the dentist office, a patient scans the QR code prepared by the office staff, and the credential verification is instantly received, proving the legitimacy of their test result. This can also create an anonymous “paper trail” of office visitors’ health test results status, if desired by the dental practice manager.</p>
<p>MEDCREDS RECOMMENDED TIMETABLE</p>
<p>Due to the current challenges and limited availability of testing in some locations, it is advisable for dentists and their patients to follow a schedule such as the one below:</p>
<p>3 Weeks Before A Dental Appointment - Schedule an appointment with a doctor to get a referral for a COVID-19 test,</p>
<p>2 Weeks Before A Dental Appointment - Have a telemedicine visit with a doctor to have a health screening. The patient will be referred to a COVID-19 test at a convenient location,</p>

<p>1-4 Days Before Your Dental Appointment - Visit a testing site to have a test administered using an approved COVID-19 test,</p>
<p>1 Day Before Your Dental Appointment - The patient receives a medical-professional-issued COVID-19 test-result credential from MedCreds.</p>
<p>Day of Patient’s Dental Appointment - Prior to arriving at the dental office, the patient shares with the office a verification proof of their COVID-19 test result via the MedCreds app. The dental office will then have a cryptographically verifiable record of COVID-19 test results issued by an authorized medical provider.</p>
<p>This process provides assurance that all dentist-office visitors have a suitable COVID-19 test result, prior to visiting, that has been issued by an authorized medical professional.</p>
<p>By following this procedure, patients and their dental-care team are assured that participants have made extensive efforts to create a safe environment for everybody, including having cryptographically verifiable records documenting the process.</p>
<p>MEDCREDS PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL SAFEGUARD</p>
<p>According to a May 29, 2020 ADA press release ("CDC Guidance for Dental Settings Echoes ADA Guidance"), the CDC's Guidance for Dental Settings provides detailed patient management and facility consideration information for before, during, and after dental appointments.</p>
<p>This is in close alignment with the ADA’s Return to Work Interim Guidance Toolkit.</p>
<p>CDC and ADA recommendations include:</p>
 
 Request that dental staff call patients prior to the scheduled appointment to ask questions about their current health status.<br>
Advise patients to wear a face covering when entering the dental practice. 
 Limit the number of people who accompany a patient to the appointment. If possible, the patient should make the visit alone. 
 Assess all patients upon arrival; temperature checks may be completed. 
 Remove items in office waiting rooms such as toys or reading material to limit potential transmission through high touch surfaces. 
 Encourage social distancing practices by minimizing the number of patients in the waiting room by spacing appointments thoughtfully and perhaps by asking patients to wait in their car until the dental staff is ready to treat the patient. 
 Advise dental staff members to wear additional personal protective equipment (PPE) as appropriate, such as surgical masks or N95 masks, full face shields or goggles with side shields to ensure an environment that is as safe and healthy as possible for patients and the dental team. 
 Place hand sanitizer generously around the office for use, and ensure surfaces are cleaned regularly. 
 
<p>Headquartered in Pacifica, CA, MedCreds enables anyone that has a COVID-19 test result to hold a digital verifiable credential that can instantly and privately prove the results of their COVID-19 test, using only their mobile phone or personal computers</p>

<p></p>



<p>As the whole world has grappled with COVID-19, consumer behavior has shifted dramatically, and businesses had to respond in real-time. And while some of the changes will be temporary, industries like telemedicine, entertainment, hospitality, and fintech may never look the same. However, within real estate and self-tour, COVID-19 has acted as an accelerant, pushing companies to live in a reality that likely would have taken years to reach under any other circumstances. It’s a reality that one company is welcoming with open arms.</p>



<p>Self-isolation and social distancing have become a new way of life for most and legally mandated for many. Adapting to these new rules and norms as an individual does not mean that plans will follow suit; leases expire, families grow, and out of town job opportunities are all still very real. For an industry that has seen a rise in fraudulent actors on both sides, companies and renters alike typically only had two options: group open houses or one on one viewings, neither of which are seen as safe options today. For <a href="https://walk.in/">Walk.in</a>, a self-touring app, COVID-19 has acted as a means to expand offerings to those looking for a new home or office space in a way that feels comfortable and safe on their own terms.<br></p>







<p></p>



<p>Walk.in had already started outfitting properties with smart locks before the pandemic hit. They also built an app to facilitate self-tours to rental properties either with or without smart locks and used their own company as a test pilot.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote><p>“The whole tour was a black box. A decision was made. We needed follow up, we needed metrics.”</p>– Ofir Sperling, CTO of Walk.in<br></blockquote>



<p>Before they found <a href="https://authenteq.com/">Authenteq’s KYC solution</a>, interested prospective renters selected a listing online and once they clicked on it, were prompted to provide a cell phone number where a link to download the app was sent. Sperling began researching the space for identity verification tools that could be integrated into the process.</p>



<p></p>



<blockquote><p>“A lot of companies were offering a lot of unnecessary services, too many bells and whistles, Authenteq took a surgical approach to ID verification and that’s what we really needed.”</p>– Ofir Sperling, CTO of Walk.in</blockquote>



<p>For Sperling, while identity verification was crucial, it didn’t allow for confirmation of who was actually entering the building and when. Authenteq’s selfie verification – which matches biometric data to the verified government-issued identification – allows them to not only answer those questions but brings peace of mind as it keeps the privacy and security of residents already living at that property at an all-time high. Choosing a fully automated system ensures that this all happens in real-time, eliminating both any lag time, thus enhancing the overall user experience, and the risk of human error. They have also included an AI-enhanced chat option for live feedback during tours.</p>



<p>Sperling and his team are currently collaborating with Authenteq on an advanced dashboard that will include the option for rental agents to manually override certain decisions in the rare instances where human intervention may be needed. </p>



<blockquote><p>“We do want to give our managers autonomy in the ID verification process where special circumstances may arise, but those are very rare.”&nbsp;</p>– Ofir Sperling, CTO of Walk.in</blockquote>







<p>Within the last 10 months, Walk.in has expanded from a simple auto-generated SMS text message system to a fully automated sophisticated KYC and identity verification system that allows for in-depth metrics to better evaluate business operations and reduces fraudulent claims overall.</p>



<p>The launch of Walk.in during COVID-19 was a daunting feat but as Sperling puts it, “it was the ideal real-world stress test for the system,” as they were able to make ad hoc adjustments and upgrades during the launch based on usage, feedback, and any new or temporary legislation. As a family-owned business with nearly 70 years in real estate, Walk.in’s team is uniquely positioned to understand what all parties involved need and they have brought that knowledge and experience into the technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before COVID-19 hit, 30 percent of their properties were listed on the Walk.in app, after the integration with Authenteq, 100 percent are now on the platform. </p>



<blockquote><p>“If you look at history, sometimes the biggest accelerators are disasters. There are a lot of technologies that come out of wars, it’s the same thing in medicine. And if you look at the self-tour space, it was us and two other companies, now there are at least 10 others that emerged during COVID. Our main advantage is that we come from this world of real estate, we grew up here, we know it much better than somebody coming from the tech world, just trying to capitalize on this moment.”</p>– Ofir Sperling, CTO of Walk.in</blockquote>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p> 
<p>Back in February (oh, how time flies! Just to think that it was right before the&nbsp;beginning of the&nbsp;COVID-19 pandemic…) I wrote a blog post looking at Oracle’s ambitious plans for developing&nbsp;its&nbsp;cloud strategy and expanding&nbsp;its&nbsp;worldwide infrastructure footprint. The post was titled “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/will-2020-be-the-year-of-oracle-cloud">Will 2020 Be the Year of Oracle Cloud?</a>” and just five months later the company has already demonstrated that it&nbsp;does not just&nbsp;finally&nbsp;have&nbsp;a&nbsp;promising&nbsp;vision for Oracle Cloud, but also a strong commitment to delivering&nbsp;on&nbsp;it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>A week&nbsp;ago,&nbsp;I attended an online event (yet&nbsp;another sign of the post-COVID times) hosted by Oracle’s Larry Ellison, where he spent a whole hour outlining his company’s recent achievements. And those are quite impressive indeed.&nbsp;The company’s cloud infrastructure shows significant growth not just in customer adoption, but physical size as well – currently, Oracle Cloud already has 24 regions worldwide, same as AWS,&nbsp;and planning to&nbsp;reach 36 regions by 2021. Very attractive pricing for customers with massive egress traffic requirements has already made a few prominent companies switch to Oracle from other clouds to reduce their costs – perhaps the most notable being Zoom.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>However, as I mentioned a few times in earlier posts already, Oracle has finally learned to focus their marketing efforts not on pricing alone, but on their unique differentiators – capabilities no other cloud service provides&nbsp;currently have. The key buzzword of this strategy is of course “autonomous”. Starting with the Autonomous Database in 2018, Oracle has brought Autonomous Linux to the market a year later and this time, Autonomous Data Guard was announced as a service to&nbsp;protect business-critical data in the cloud from disasters and network outages.&nbsp;Sealed from any external administrative access and powered by artificial intelligence, autonomous solutions&nbsp;largely&nbsp;eliminate the possibility of&nbsp;human&nbsp;negligence, misconfiguration, vulnerabilities left unpatched, or&nbsp;many&nbsp;kinds of malicious activities.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>The biggest announcement however was that autonomous services, which for several years were only offered as a part of Oracle’s public cloud portfolio, are finally available in the company’s private cloud platform,&nbsp;Cloud@Customer. Powered by the next-generation Exadata&nbsp;Cloud@Customer&nbsp;platform, Oracle’s Autonomous Database, with all its performance benefits and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/small/can-autonomous-improve-security-posture">security features</a>, is finally available to customers which for various reasons were avoiding the public cloud. While the hardware and the data reside on the customer’s premises, the infrastructure is fully managed by Oracle Cloud’s engineers and the pricing is equal to the one in the public cloud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Thanks to the company’s cloud infrastructure platform which&nbsp;maintains&nbsp;a&nbsp;strict separation between the cloud control plane and customer&nbsp;instances and ensures that Oracle’s engineers can never access sensitive customer data, this allows for completely new hybrid deployment scenarios.&nbsp;For example, Oracle can now build a new cloud datacenter for a single customer and operate it as a dedicated&nbsp;cloud&nbsp;region with full feature parity with its public cloud&nbsp;and the same unified management console. It is by no means a cheap solution with pricing starting at $500k per month, but this just announced service already has several early adopters.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Even though Oracle has entered the cloud race significantly later than current market leaders, it had an&nbsp;opportunity to learn from their mistakes and avoid repeating them. Instead,&nbsp;it&nbsp;focused&nbsp;on its unique expertise and made&nbsp;autonomous security the foundation of its development strategy. With the latest announcements of its Gen 2&nbsp;Cloud@Customer&nbsp;platform, Oracle can offer its customers exactly the same functionality on-premises as in its public cloud, ranging from just the Autonomous Database to a full-featured private cloud datacenter with over 50 managed services. To the extent of my knowledge, no other major CSP has anything comparable to offer&nbsp;at the moment.&nbsp;</p>
 
 
<p>Last but not least, it’s worth mentioning that Oracle’s second-generation cloud infrastructure has been architected&nbsp;with a much stronger emphasis on “security by design”. Incorporating such features as advanced tenant- and resource-level isolation and off-box network virtualization, it can ensure that customers’ sensitive data is kept off-limits not just from “nosy neighbors” but from Oracle’s own administrators as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though Oracle has never positioned itself as a security vendor, its cloud strategy clearly indicates that security is the company’s top priority and a foundational principle for their cloud infrastructure. This might be just the right thing you need in these turbulent times.</p>

Unfortunately, not a single week goes by without another large-scale data breach or leak reported by the media – it seems that a company of any size or industry can fall victim to insufficient or ineffective data protection controls.

  <p>OpenID Connect has become a leading standard for providing relying parties with identity information. With a growing global adoption, OpenID Connect faces new use cases, like eGovernment, telecommunications, and health applications, where just providing identity information is not enough. Instead, the identity provider (IDP) needs to explicitly attest the verification status of the claims delivered. More precisely, it must distinguish verified from unverified claims and provide information about the verification itself: What data was verified? How was that checked and according to which rules? When was it checked and by whom? What evidence was used in the process? This information facilitates mapping between regulatory/legal contexts and provides a basis for dispute resolution and auditing. OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance aims to solve this problem: The standard defines a robust and unambiguous representation of verified claims and verification metadata. Based on global collaboration, it includes identifiers for various international trust frameworks, identity documents, and verification methods. Fine-grained data minimization controls ensure user privacy and compliance. This talk gives an introduction to the current status of OpenID Connect for Identity Assurance: From the design objectives to the data structures.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve5_2020_07_16_lodderstedt"></a>

  <p>I have such a great job. I’m constantly inspired by ForgeRock customers all over the world who are delivering breakthrough digital experiences. So I know that these individuals are innovating beyond expectations, but it’s always gratifying when the industry also gives credit where credit is due. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/">KuppingerCole</a>, Europe’s leading analyst firm for Information Security, awarded BMW its prestigious KC Virtual Award.</p>

<p>The KC Virtual Awards honor outstanding Identity Management (IM) and Security projects and this year the award for the best IAM for Digital Transformation project was bestowed upon BMW. The globally recognized automaker has a strong focus on identity. The company manages 25 million identities ranging from employees to customers to dealers, ensuring the right people are using the right products and apps, and enjoying the best possible digital experience.</p>

 How Did BMW Do It? 

<p>It was important to BMW to ensure ease-of-use so its customers and partners can easily and safely access various BMW applications. To achieve this, BMW needed to consolidate its numerous disparate systems and build a central Identity Platform (IDP) for the whole organization to better serve its employees, customers, partners, car dealers and technical providers. Prior to the consolidation, BMW was developing tons of custom code to connect various systems, which was costly and time-consuming. The disparate systems also required users to log in to multiple systems multiple times, which complicated the goal of a seamless user experience.</p>

<p>BMW embarked on an identity strategy, called OneIDP, which required the company to consolidate 20 different Identity Management and Access Management (IAM) systems that supported its three brands (BMW, Mini and Rolls Royce and other entities like BMW Financial Services) into one. With this project, BMW wanted to:</p>

  Offer an exceptional and seamless user experience&nbsp; 
	 Reduce onboarding and maintenance cost through automation 
	 Achieve faster time to market through automation 
	 Increase scalability 
	 Enable new business cases such as IoT 
	 Increase performance 
 <p>ForgeRock’s platform enabled the company to bring together its identity systems and achieve significant cost savings, improve time to market, scalability and compliance. The new approach, which supports 25 million users, also allows BMW to deliver critical data and services to consumers, partners quickly, easily and securely. Stephanus Reiger, Group IT--Infrastructure and Technology Management for BMW Group, recently participated in a virtual panel during <a href="https://www.forgerock.com/identity-live">ForgeRock Identity Live</a> and said, “ForgeRock is essential for us to create a central IDP for BMW.”</p>

 BMW for the Win! 

<p>Since deploying OneIDP, BMW has surpassed expectations. For example, rolling out new applications was costly and took up to 15 days. With ForgeRock, the process is automated, making it possible to deploy new apps within seconds and at zero cost. Additionally, internal performance tests revealed that BMW can process 8,000 authentication requests per second. During the award ceremony, Gerald Maier, IT Solutions Architect for BMW, said, "I'd really like to thank the 2 partners, IC Consult...and of course ForgeRock because in my opinion they not only have excellent software, they really supported us with excellent knowledge and experience."</p>

The person then takes a FDA-approved COVID-19 test, and the medical provider sends the patient their test result as a verifiable credential which they can store on their mobile phone or computer.  The person can then easily share their test result by scanning a QR code at places like their dentist’s office, their workplace, or the airport.

					 <p>MedCreds recently announced that it partnered with <a href="https://www.bravemaker.com/">BraveMaker</a>, a California-based nonprofit film arts organization, to help its film crews more safely return to work for a recent filming project. A preliminary trial was done as a first step toward standardizing the use of verifiable credentials for COVID-19 test results into a reliable process to help re-start movie production as safely as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Ben Littlejohn is a board-certified, family-medicine physician who works with MedCreds as a medical advisor. Of the partnership between MedCreds and BraveMaker he said the following:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				“I am excited that patients to whom I have issued MedCreds verifiable credentials can prove to any other party, with certainty, that I issued these test results. Until now, this level of verification for medical test results has not been possible. I am proud to help BraveMaker studios get back to work and restart the independent film industry."			</p>
					</blockquote>
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>The film industry is not alone in using MedCreds to return to work. MedCreds has <a href="https://medcreds.com/georgia-academy-of-general-dentistry/">partnered</a> with the <a href="https://www.gagd.org/">Georgia Academy of General Dentistry</a> (GAGD) to provide free COVID-19 test credentials to their providers and patients. Using MedCreds, dentists can significantly reduce the risk of spreading and contracting COVID-19 for both them and their patients. The video below provides a brief summary of how this works.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Streamlining the process 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>The current process of delivering COVID-19 tests results is cumbersome and inefficient. When a medical professional receives the result of a COVID-19 test, they must call the patient to deliver the result. If the patient does not answer (a frustratingly frequent occurrence), the provider must keep calling until the patient does answer because leaving voicemails with test-result information is a violation of HIPAA regulations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If a patient wants documentation of their test results, they must either pick up a printout of their test result or have the result faxed to them. Emailing the test result to the patient is not HIPAA-compliant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is essentially impossible to verify that a test document is legitimate because:</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Printouts are notoriously easy to forge.  There is no standardized format for COVID-19 test results, so it’s hard to visually spot a fishy-looking document.  And there are a dizzying number of labs and types of tests—all of varying quality.  <p>&nbsp;</p><p>You may think someone finding a suspicious-looking document could simply call the lab or doctor to verify its authenticity, but the lab or provider would be unable to answer any questions because—you guessed it—that’s not HIPAA-compliant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With MedCreds, the medical professional delivers the test result straight to the patient’s phone or computer, skipping the hassle of contacting them by phone. The patient can share the result in a private way with anyone, and anyone can verify (using Trinsic’s advanced cryptography) that it was issued by such-and-such lab and hasn’t been tampered with or altered. And, it is HIPAA-compliant!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Brent Blue is a family-practice physician and another medical advisor for MedCreds. In the following video, he explains why his practice uses MedCreds, and why he recommends it to his colleagues.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Reducing uncertainty 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>While it is impossible to eliminate all risk, the MedCreds system significantly reduces the risks of reentering the office, going to the dentist, boarding an airplane, etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Knowing that someone recently tested negative for the novel coronavirus significantly reduces the likelihood that they are spreading the disease. This information can be combined with other data such as COVID prevalence in a certain area, how close people are likely to interact in a certain setting, and the age or health demographics of groups to make better decisions about when and how to reopen, and how to do so safely. Trinsic CEO Riley Hughes <a href="https://medium.com/trinsic/call-to-action-verifiable-credentials-covid-19-a180155a157c">wrote</a>:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				"By risk decisions, I mean that everyone can autonomously decide how much risk they’re willing to take on. For example, an airline could specify passengers will only be allowed to board if they can present a negative result from a test that was taken in the last two hours. But the employee loading the bags into the plane maybe only needs to have taken a test in the last 48 hours. The policy can be set depending on the risk level of the activity."			</p>
					</blockquote>
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>The steps to safely reopen society and the economy are not cut and dry. And we’re still learning every day about the best ways to reopen economies. But MedCreds provides a valuable tool to make better risk decisions and reduce the risk of spreading or contracting the virus.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/balaganski">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>It looks like the whole world is currently talking (at least, tweeting) about the latest large-scale Twitter hack. High profile accounts of the likes of Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Bill Gates, and Jeff Bezos, as well as companies like Apple or Uber, were suddenly promoting a cryptocurrency scam. At first, they referred to a specific crypto-related website, but as it was quickly taken down, the hackers switched to spreading multiple Bitcoin addresses, asking people to send money to them to get a double amount of their investment back.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even though this type of scam is nothing new and should look obviously suspicious to anyone, the sheer size of the Twitter platform allowed hackers to reach enough gullible people to collect over $100,000 within hours.</p>
 The hack was an inside job 
<p>Looking at the number of accounts affected (including major corporations with strong security practices), it quickly became obvious that the attack was performed by a single actor with a possibility of it being an insider job at Twitter. The company later confirmed “a coordinated social engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools.”</p>
<p>Several screenshots of the alleged internal tool have also leaked, showing what an employee could do to an account, including changing the email address linked to it to prevent legitimate owners from restoring their access. Various press outlets are currently speculating about the methods the hacker could have gained access to this tool from a Twitter employee: was it really a social engineering attack or an action of a malicious insider.</p>
 Inconvenient assumptions 
<p>For me, however, this is by far not the biggest question. Judging by the attack timeline and Twitter’s reaction to it, it becomes rather clear that they were not aware of malicious activities happening on such a massive scale until the attack was already underway, causing public outcries and even calls from concerned politicians. Does it imply that the company has no appropriate security monitoring tools in place, which would have at least alerted about suspicious behavioral anomalies in their network?</p>
<p>Also, the idea of employees having unchecked access to such powerful administration tools, giving them a potential ability to manipulate any account, access sensitive personal data, or even post on their behalf raises a lot of concerns. Does Twitter even have any privileged access controls in place for these tools? How could it be compliant with regulations like GDPR and CCPA?</p>
 What can users do? 
<p>Can we even trust anything posted on the platform anymore, if nobody can be protected from such attacks, not even Elon Musk or Donald Trump? And by the way, who is supposed to be held responsible for this debacle? The first thing I tried to do after I’ve read about the attack is to find the name of Twitter’s chief security officer. But apparently, the company does not have one since 2018…</p>
<p>Finally, what can we the users do? Nothing apparently. Protecting sensitive systems from malicious insiders can only be done, well, from inside the company. Unfortunately, it’s apparently too late to teach Twitter about PAM, compliance and security best practices, but at least we could teach you… Check out our latest <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/kcvepam">KCLive Event on Privileged Access Management</a>, for example – this could be a good start towards becoming smarter than Twitter!</p>

  Digital transformation has made it possible for the Organisations to become more effective and more efficient in developing new products and the ways of working, at the same time Organizations now face many challenges to their digital security. The increased connectivity needed to support mobile employees, to integrate business partners into internal processes and to get closer to their customers has increased digital risks. Protecting the digital assets, the systems, and applications in this complex hybrid IT environment requires a well-thought-out understanding of risks and countermeasures.

Identity and Access Governance (IGA) with its two core elements, Identity Provisioning and Access Governance, is essential to enabling and securing digital transformation.

This KCLive Event will focus on the main points of IGA, Its core capabilities, how to enable and protect the Digital Transformation with IGA.

Help you understand Why having infrastructure for Identity Provisioning and Access Governance in place is the cornerstone for successfully managing identities, their accounts, and their entitlements across the heterogeneous and increasingly hybrid IT infrastructure of organizations.

<p>Last week, GlobaliD co-founder and CEO Greg Kidd participated in the Linqto Global Investor Conference, where he’s a regular panelist.</p><p>Focusing on the future of digital assets, <a href="https://youtu.be/qmmBKMYJFDk">the panel</a> also featured:</p>  JP Thieriot, CEO of&nbsp;Uphold  Bill Sarris, CEO of&nbsp;Linqto  Jamie Finn, President of Securitize  Matthew Le Merle, co-founder and Managing Partner of Fifth Era and Keiretsu&nbsp;Capital  JP, Bill, Greg, Matthew, and&nbsp;Jamie<p>Here are some highlights from their discussion on the current market and their investment strategies:</p>  Benefits of moving any asset class from paper to native&nbsp;digital  Uphold’s developer-first approach to the&nbsp;wallet  GlobaliD’s distinct contribution—portability   On “the benefits of moving any asset class from paper to a native digital&nbsp;format”: <p>Greg: I take a sociopolitical view. Obviously with GlobaliD, we’ve been big in terms of financial inclusion — that’s getting everybody a seat at the table. But there’s also just an access issue with getting every asset, every form of value at the&nbsp;table.</p><blockquote>“So while there’s getting everyone a seat at the table, it’s letting everything in the room be a chip on the table. That’s just a fun box that I want to see opened. I want to see it happen in my lifetime and I’m excited. Let the show&nbsp;begin.”</blockquote><p>That’s an amazing transformation of society. We can’t even begin to imagine if everything around us is liquid, then all sorts of things that we didn’t used to think of as money are now a form of money or exchange. It doesn’t matter whether you’re a communist or a capitalist. We all live in an exchange society — and the idea that there would only be certain types of things that are liquid in the world versus everything — it’s an access issue to&nbsp;us.</p><p>So while there’s getting everyone a seat at the table, it’s letting everything in the room be a chip on the table. That’s just a fun box that I want to see opened. I want to see it happen in my lifetime and I’m excited. Let the show&nbsp;begin.</p><p>On “the biggest barriers to getting this digitally enabled world really humming”:</p><p>Greg: When I was at the Federal Reserve, we had this fleet of learjets. It wasn’t for people — it was for flying checks around. Because you had to present the checker where it came from to get settlement. 9/11 happened and we suddenly realized with all the planes grounded that we weren’t going to be able to clear because the jets couldn’t&nbsp;fly.</p><blockquote>“There’s this little thing called COVID. You might’ve heard of it. The transformation in terms of what people are now doing through conference calls like this and the fact that this seems like the new normal has shown that it’s possible to take something that we took for granted doing in person — going to work and seeing each other. And what we’re doing now — this accelerated all my expectations about digitization.”</blockquote><p>Somebody said, “Well, you know, maybe we should just send the information on the checks around like everyone else in the world does.” And if we didn’t do that, the whole U.S. financial system would have melted down. We realized we didn’t need the physical asset to do clearing and settlement. But we needed a crisis. And after the crisis, it was clear — we don’t need Learjets. We could do this digitally.</p><p>What’s the crisis that we have today? There’s this little thing called COVID. You might’ve heard of it. Who would have thought that we’d be having this meeting or watching NASCAR or Hamilton in a digital format — as opposed to going in-person to NASCAR or going to see Hamilton. The transformation in terms of what people are now doing through conference calls like this and the fact that this seems like the new normal has shown that it’s possible to take something that we took for granted doing in person — going to work and seeing each other. And what we’re doing now—this accelerated all my expectations about digitization.</p><p>So if you’re going to have these kinds of conversations and do a whole bunch of things that we were used to doing physically, now, we’re going to do virtually. It gives me hope that this process of moving toward digitization of all assets can be sped up. Just like the process of moving from in-face meetings to teleconference calls. You look at the growth of Zoom — it’s possible. We have had a kick in the pants now. Never let a good crisis go to waste — just like as happened with the Fed, just like is happening now with&nbsp;COVID.</p><blockquote>“First, the brave go forth and have to climb steep curves to make small inroads. Then second, the talented see the future vision, and they begin to make small profits. Then third, the strong command and conquer the necessary markets. And finally fourth, the masses follow, turning disruption into what is the&nbsp;norm.”</blockquote><p>Bill: I’ve been in disruption in three different industries and inertia is the main deterrent. Disruptive change happens in a series of steps. First, the brave go forth and have to climb steep curves to make small inroads. Then second, the talented see the future vision, and they begin to make small profits. Then third, the strong command and conquer the necessary markets. And finally fourth, the masses follow, turning disruption into what is the&nbsp;norm.</p><p>This usually takes a long period of time for that to gestate. As Greg is saying, with what’s happening with the pandemic, it’s like what happened with the dinosaurs. We lost 75 percent of all species during a very short 30 million period at one point 65 million years ago. Well, we’re already in the third phase — as the strong are conquering the markets right now. And with the pandemic — that’s why I said earlier, I think this is all just exponentially [decreasing] the time it’s going to take for us to get through the disruption of this space. It will be happening totally within the next 5–10 years and not 20 years from&nbsp;now.</p> On Uphold’s developer-first approach to the&nbsp;wallet: <p>Matthew: I just want to explain why Alison [Davis] and I were investors in Inktomi that powered the best search engines. They’re all gone, AltaVista, Ask Jeeves — we don’t even know their names. And the reason was that Google came along. Well, I’m an investor in Coinbase and in Circle and in Kraken — and we were in Zoom — and now I’ve seen Uphold and it feels like that same sort of moment. It is so much easier. And it’s mashing together Coinbase and PayPal and Telegram and other things. What’s your distinctive contribution, JP, to this dialogue.</p><blockquote>As an example, another of your panelists will soon be building a wallet on top of Uphold and hopefully dozens more behind him will be doing similarly. So following a Stripe sort of path to the future — that’s certainly one big differentiator.</blockquote><p>JP: The thing that differentiates us from that list of companies you just went through is our ability to act as a platform as opposed to as a single retail-oriented property. As an example, another of your panelists will soon be building a wallet on top of Uphold and hopefully dozens more behind him will be doing similarly. So following a Stripe sort of path to the future — that’s certainly one big differentiator.</p><p>The other is in driving third-party ecosystems that are not today served by the banking system by those let’s call it rival exchanges you just allied to or by anybody else. The example I’ve used there is the Brave ecosystem. Brave proposes to reorganize the way money moves between advertisers and publishers and users of the internet.</p><p>There just isn’t another platform out there that can handle the complexity, handle the millions of constituents in those three buckets around the world. We do the same for Coil. We’re going to announce some other big partners. So as the world heads toward Web 3.0 monetization and towards a gig economy that will see more freelance workers than corporate employees in 5–10 years, we’re purpose-built for&nbsp;that.</p> On GlobaliD’s “distinctive contribution”—portability: <p>Greg: We have the Copernicus issue. For a long time before Copernicus, people thought that the sun revolved around the earth and that meant that your identity belonged to a government or a corporation. It might be a bank; it might be Facebook. It might be any of those. And the inversion that we’re doing is your identity belongs to you — that the earth revolves around the sun and you are the sun. So it is your ability to attach any source of assets you want to your identity and do with them what you&nbsp;want.</p><blockquote>So whether it’s porting your reputation from Airbnb or Uber or porting your money from Wells Fargo or Schwab, it’s your money. So portability for us is the big differentiator. We’re neutral. We support all the identity platforms. We would connect to all asset sources. As long as you have a name, you attach all your assets to&nbsp;that.</blockquote><p>We believe simply because your assets sit on this server or that server controlled by this country or that company — that shouldn’t get in the way of you doing what you want with your assets within the law, right? So the law might say, you have to have a certain amount of identity or whatnot, but once you’ve checked the boxes from a compliance point of view, where those assets sit shouldn’t affect whether they’re liquid and usable. We’re pioneering that — that concept that you get an identity first, and then you’re a user of all these other&nbsp;systems.</p><p>So whether it’s porting your reputation from Airbnb or Uber or porting your money from Wells Fargo or Schwab, it’s your money. The fact that you want to use Uphold or some other platform, well that’s because they have the best user experience. But if you change your mind, you can take your assets with you where you&nbsp;go.</p><p>So portability for us is the big differentiator. We’re neutral. We support all the identity platforms. We would connect to all asset sources. As long as you have a name, you attach all your assets to that. And yes, we do believe the earth revolves around the sun, even though historically it’s worked the other way&nbsp;around.</p><p>Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmmBKMYJFDk&amp;feature=youtu.be">the full video of the panel&nbsp;here</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/global-id/greg-kidd-portability-as-digital-identitys-key-differentiator-6d2eed098679">Greg Kidd: Portability as digital identity’s key differentiator</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/global-id">GlobaliD</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

   Another day, another data breach. If you pay attention to the news at all, you can’t help but notice the sudden splash of coronavirus-related spear phishing attacks. This could potentially launch a tidal wave of data breach headlines, considering it takes an average of 279 days to identify and contain a data breach.

<p>Emerging technology is incredibly stimulating, yet so often it is idealistic in nature and seemingly theoretical. The self sovereign identity&nbsp;(SSI)&nbsp;conceptual architecture has existed in the ‘idealistic’ bucket for some time. This is familiar territory — to win hearts, souls, and break new ground, it’s proponents must be prepared to set fire to ingrained foundations. If the SSI community had incepted too close to traditional archetypes it would have risked a constrained imagination. The only real option for emerging technology is to build a far, faraway island, and beat your drum loud enough for people to hear. With that comes an obligatory&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/research/methodologies/gartner-hype-cycle">hype cycle</a>, and the requirement to at some point close the technical chasm. The SSI community has built that isolated island (all a little too familiar for us kiwis), and now it’s time to build the boat.</p>



<p>SSI offers an opinionated shift in the way traditional Identity Management (IdM) is architected, which often results in the two models being pitted against each other — as if one must disappear for the other to exist. This dogmatic framing overlooks the potential which exists to extend traditional IdM protocols (think boat…) towards a more user-oriented SSI model.</p>



 OpenID connect, and its advantages 



<p>When it comes to interactions that involve expressing a digital identity, the web takes the lion’s share. In relation to IdM on the web today, one core protocol that has consistently grown in popularity is OpenID Connect (OIDC). For those unfamiliar, OIDC provides the pipes that enable the use of a third party login service (eg. “Login with Facebook”) rather than creating a new account with every website you visit. OIDC provides&nbsp;many&nbsp;practical benefits — it is a pervasive, simple login service. It has reduced administrative overhead, allowing individuals to simplify the number of accounts (or distinct digital identities) they have to maintain.</p>



 OpenID Connect — what’s missing? 



<p>With all of its success, OIDC has failed users in ways that were likely unforeseen at the time. It does not provide users with a way to organise their digital existence in one place, and fails to provide complete transparency over where and how their information is used. Keeping track of, and being able to utilise our digital information to access services shouldn’t be difficult in the first place. The currently constrained (and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/2130877/the-biggest-data-breaches-of-the-21st-century.html">damaging</a>) user experience is symptomatic of broader problems with how traditional IdM and protocols like OIDC are architectured — best illustrated by the&nbsp;<a href="https://indieweb.org/NASCAR_problem">identity NASCAR problem.</a></p>



The Identity Nascar Problem



<p>The term was coined to describe the assemblage of third party icons on a websites login page, which resemble the crammed sponsorship decals covering&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR">NASCAR</a>&nbsp;racing cars. This has long been lamented by designers because it creates an overwhelming and crowded user experience. The logos impose a cognitive burden on users who have to choose an Identity Provider (IdP), and keep track of which one they use and where.</p>



<p>This style of federation also has distinct market consequences. In order for a website to reduce the crowd of logos on their login screens, they have to pick (say, two or three). To ensure sufficient user coverage, the websites will pick the most well known (say, Facebook and Google), creating a predictable cycle where the popular become more popular.&nbsp;Like in NASCAR, it is now near impossible to break in, as a few large oligopoly-like brands are incumbent. This can hinder the progress and adoption of emerging technologies, particularly if they threaten incumbent business models. But the evidence is showing us we need a better way — entrusting something as fundamental as how users identify on the web to a select few sets up a dangerous environment, one where even brands like Apple who pride themselves on privacy are unable to avoid&nbsp;<a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/researcher-sign-apple/">massive mistakes</a>.</p>



<p>In addition, because users converge around a few main IdPs, the amount of data accumulated is colossal (known as the&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/samuelgoto/WebID#the-rp-tracking-problem">relying party tracking problem</a>) — this includes what sites you visit and services you use. They do not have in place measures to minimise their data collection or reduce correlation. Many Governments legally forbid the assignment of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eff.org/issues/national-ids">national identifiers</a>. Good digital identity will exist only when corporations operate in frameworks where global identifiers aren’t assigned to us either.</p>



 How do we make things better? 



<p>SSI advocates for a component between the issuer/IdP and the relying party that acts on behalf of the user. This independent piece of software infrastructure acts to better preserve a user’s privacy and&nbsp;improve&nbsp;their experience. The component is often referred to as a ‘digital wallet’ or in other terminology circles as the&nbsp;‘holder’)</p>







 What makes an ecosystem that features a digital wallet more resilient against problems described above? 



<p>A couple of key points:</p>



 1. Separation of Authority and Facilitation 



  In traditional IdM, the IdP is both the issuer of the user’s identity information, AND the facilitator of services around how the user expresses their identity. This necessitates a close relationship between the issuer and the relying party (and the aforementioned&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/samuelgoto/WebID#the-rp-tracking-problem">tracking and correlation</a>).  In SSI, the digital wallet is an intermediary that acts on behalf of the user — akin to their agent. The facilitator component is removed from the IdP and is reassigned to the digital wallet. This means that the relying party doesn’t need to ‘phone home’ to validate the information from the authoritative source.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">Kim Cameron</a>&nbsp;calls this “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruF1s9jF6_w&amp;feature=youtu.be">the separation of claims and recognition</a>”, acknowledging it as SSI’s biggest value.  



 2.&nbsp;Portable Identity 



  With today’s IdM technology, whether a user likes the practices of the IdP or not, it is incredibly difficult to switch to another provider. For example if you have an identity with a service that is dependent on your google account (centered around an @gmail.com address) and you would like to keep that identity but use another provider instead of google, this is virtually impossible.  In SSI, digital wallets utilise underlying technologies such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralised Identifiers</a>&nbsp;(DIDs), which enable users to seamlessly move between different wallets — without losing their identity.  



 3. A single view for where and how your information is being used 



  In traditional IdM, individuals have no single place to go to view and organize the different dimensions to their digital identity. They have different siloed apps and website accounts, sure, but no way to view and manage this in one place. This leads to fragmentation and lack of transparency for users. A digital wallet represents a new opportunity to fill in these gaps and provide users with greater visibility into the digital presence.  



 4.&nbsp;Finally, a note on standards 



  Behind the glossy and simple user interface (isn’t this just a simple app?), digital wallets are&nbsp;incredibly complex technical beasts. This can’t really be understated. There is a robust standardisation progress occurring around the SSI community. Standards compliance and interoperability is a&nbsp;requirement&nbsp;(albeit not easy). This takes time and effort, and arm-waving is incredibly detrimental to progress. We hope to see emphasis on standards compliance show up in trust framework accreditation processes.  



 Did someone mention a boat? 



<p>Little known to many, when OIDC Core was being standardised (back in 2014), a chapter in the original specification alluded to a world similar to that put forth by SSI proponents. The&nbsp;<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#SelfIssued">Self-Issued OpenID Provider&nbsp;</a>(SIOP) chapter sets out a way (albeit incomplete) on how something akin to a “digital wallet” component could fit into infrastructure based around OIDC.</p>







<p>The diagram shows the introduction of an intermediary piece of software which acts on behalf of the subject/user facilitating interactions involving their identity. SIOP introduced the idea that the user could have a role to play between the two parties, and that there could be multiple issuers of claims that could be provided to a relying party to access services. Unfortunately at the time there was no concept of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralised Identifiers</a>&nbsp;(DIDs), so whilst the idea was good, it was found wanting.</p>



<p>Now that we have technologies like DIDs,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a>, decentralized ledgers, and a thriving SSI community progressing and aligning to the standards, the idea is back on the table. There is a laundry list of things to bring this to reality.&nbsp;<a href="https://mattrglobal.github.io/oidc-client-bound-assertions-spec/">Client Bound End-User Assertions</a>&nbsp;is one contribution we have made to this effort. This specification addresses the need for a more formal binding mechanism between the issuer and the digital wallet.</p>



 What’s next? 



<p>There are lots of organisations involved in the effort to bring SSI and existing IdM closer together, and it is spawning momentum. To get involved look out for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/siop-virtual-meetup-2-tickets-113754506792">second&nbsp;SIOP virtual meetup</a>, and initiatives occuring in OpenID and DIF. As always,&nbsp;<a href="http://mattr.global/">reach out to us</a>&nbsp;if you want to chat. This particular effort just might be the sail for our boat.</p>

 The GiD Report #118 — The fastest growing cybercrime and what it tells us about the state of&nbsp;identity <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. You can <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/the-gid-report-117-why-larry-summers-thinks-crypto-will-succeed-kara-swisher-on-tech-antitrust-b5af5497d5ba">check out last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>Here’s what we have this&nbsp;week:</p>  The Fed’s new report on synthetic identity payments fraud (and what that tell us about the state of identity)  Stuff happens   1. The Fed’s new report on synthetic identity payments fraud (and what that tell us about the state of identity) <p>First off, Here’s <a href="https://fedpaymentsimprovement.org/strategic-initiatives/payments-security/synthetic-identity-payments-fraud/">a report that Greg contributed to from the Federal Reserve on synthetic identity payments fraud</a>. We’ve talked about <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/how-self-sovereign-identity-mitigates-fraud-and-builds-a-more-inclusive-future-1b238464cd09">synthetic identity fraud in the past</a>, and it continues to be a buzzy topic. Why? According to McKinsey, it’s the fastest growing cybercrime today.</p>Photo: Pixabay<p>It’s also the type of fraud that highlights exactly what’s wrong with the system today, hitting the U.S. particularly hard because of our outdated identity frameworks and our over-reliance on Social Security Numbers. 40 percent of synthetic IDs are just random SSN numbers with some real PII sprinkled in for good&nbsp;measure.</p><p>That’s compounded by all the data breaches in recent years (which are only growing), providing criminals with a growing pool of stolen PII. Siloed data only exacerbates the issue, making detection difficult. 95 percent of synthetic identities go undetected using current fraud models, according to the&nbsp;Fed.</p><p>Naturally for the Fed, it’s a big problem for most of the reasons that you’d&nbsp;expect:</p><blockquote>Synthetic identities can be used to deceive government or corporate systems into thinking they are real people — creating far-reaching impacts on the U.S. financial system, healthcare industry, government entities and individual consumers. While synthetic identities are sometimes used without criminal intent, there are serious consequences when criminals use them to steal funds, escape detection or facilitate drug and human trafficking. They also have been linked to crime rings, including those that fund terrorism.</blockquote><p>What’s more scary is that there’s going to be a huge delay between the rising growth we’re seeing now and the painful but delayed societal impact we’re going to experience down the road. Right now, there’s minimal detection, minimal investigation, minimal awareness, and minimal reporting.</p><p>Especially if you’re a&nbsp;kid:</p><blockquote>According to the Child Identity Fraud Study conducted by Javelin Strategy &amp; Research, more than a million children were victims of identity fraud in 2017. While this figure is not specific to synthetic identity payments fraud, it indicates the potential magnitude of risk to children, who are a favorite target for this type of fraud. Synthetic identity fraud can lie dormant for years, only being uncovered once individuals turn 18 and apply for their first car or student loans. Other consequences of synthetic identity fraud extend beyond payments fraud to include denial of disability benefits, rejection of tax returns and inaccuracies in health&nbsp;records.</blockquote><p>And let’s just say — with the way things work now, trying to reclaim your identity once it’s been compromised is not&nbsp;fun.</p><p>The solutions aren’t easy either because the problem is systemic so any response needs to be comprehensive. For starters being able to digitally verify a SSN would be a step in the right direction. That initiative started last month. (Are you surprised that we weren’t able to do&nbsp;that?)</p><p>The other pillars, according to the Fed, have to do with regulations and data integrity.</p><p>And the more you read into the report and think about where things need to go, the more you start to realize that the world is eventually going to start to look a lot like what we’re building at GlobaliD:</p>  Actually verified claims attached to your&nbsp;identity  A portable identity that you own/control  An identity that you can easily reclaim in the case of&nbsp;fraud  No more data silos — they’re easily hackable and make fraud prevention all but impossible  <p>Not because it’s cool, or anything — even though it is. But because we pretty much have to. And with the current trend toward a more digital life only accelerating with everything going on, the stakes are only getting higher — along with the opportunity cost of not&nbsp;acting.</p><p>Anyway, I’ll leave you with this quote from David McCourt of Granahan McCourt Capital <a href="https://twitter.com/1WorldIdentity/status/1280554811088347138">during an OWI identity panel last&nbsp;week</a>:</p><p>When I started in the network company, the phone company owned your phone number.

<p>Liveness Detection is an important element in user identity fraud protection. IDnow has just launched a vastly improved Liveness Detection solution for IDnow AutoIdent. Our blog article explains what Liveness actually is and what this means for our users.</p>
  
 What is “Liveness”? 
<p>In biometrics, Liveness Detection is an AI computer system’s ability to determine that it is interfacing with a physically present human being and not an inanimate spoof artifact. So, fraudsters using stolen photos, Deep Fake videos, or masks in order to access or create online accounts will be uncovered and stopped.</p>
 How to measure the successful of the application. 
<p>The sophistication of a biometric system is measured by the False Acceptance Rate (FAR). This is a specific key performance indicator that measures false acceptances with a biometric security system. It tracks and evaluates the precision of a biometric system, and therefore determines the rate at which unauthorized users are verified by the system.</p>
<p>Current regulations require a biometric system for governmental use to have a FAR of below 0.1%. In general, AI-powered solutions are able to outperform even these very high requirements. IDnow AutoIdent has a FAR of only 0.05%.</p>
 The new IDnow Liveness Detection solution. 
<p>The new solution offers an even better False Acceptance Rate of 0,00002% (that’s 1/4.2 Million!). Furthermore, the user experience has been significantly improved based on usage data and user feedback: our previous design required users to rotate their heads, which wasn’t too comfortable for many. With the new solution, the user just has to move his face closer to the camera, and the Liveness Detection will recognize and confirm in less than two seconds that it is indeed a live person’s face. This is not only an incredibly smooth user experience, but it also provides the highest level of security: even advanced masks, imposters, lookalikes, and doppelgangers can be spotted with an unprecedented level of accuracy.<br>
</p>
 Trust in AI-powered solutions. 
<p>IDnow continues to see an increasing trust in AutoIdent – from January until June, transactions have increased over 1000%. And based on our expertise, this confidence is justified: with the new Liveness Detection solution, we are able to provide an outstanding user experience and reliably prevent identity fraud at the same time.</p>

					 <p><a href="https://trinsic.id/what-is-self-sovereign-identity/">Self-sovereign identity</a> (SSI) is a movement that claims digital identity should be just as legitimate and nuanced as a person’s human identity, while being accessible to all, privacy-preserving, and not reliant on a single government or corporation. It was originally conceived by idealists seeking to provide people more autonomy and control of their digital relationships. Over the past decade, the world has seen a shift from legacy on-premise software to the cloud, creating tremendous value/innovation on the one hand (Salesforce, Veeva, Twilio, etc) and centralization/surveillance problems on the other (Facebook, Google, etc). Talking about cloud, a Web 2.0 technology, in the context of a Web 3.0 technology like SSI may seem unrelated. However, the combination of cloud with SSI can offer much needed usability and benefits compared to more traditional delivery models and otherwise decentralized systems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>TL;DR: </p>  Cloud-native software done right can deliver more benefit than its on-premise/locally-hosted alternative while reducing costs and risk.   Organizations should understand the trade-offs between cloud and local deployments for self-sovereign identity specifically for individuals and organizations.   Any who pursue a cloud solution for SSI should seek well-architected platforms that take advantage of cloud-native functionality.   Trinsic is a modern platform that provides a full-stack SSI platform leveraging the best of cloud and local elements.   
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Key benefits of cloud 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Ongoing innovation</a>
					 
					 <p>In multi-tenant cloud software, all new features are pushed to all customers simultaneously, creating a virtuous R&amp;D cycle and enabling engineering resources to focus on innovating rather than supporting previous releases (analysts estimate that up to 80% of on-prem software vendors’ R&amp;D spend is on maintaining old versions/products).</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Lower-cost</a>
					 
					 <p>Cloud software can utilize platform-specific functionality (Azure KeyVault or AWS Lamda), which can’t be equally represented across a myriad of different hardwares, databases, or operating systems. In addition, hosting, security, and compliance costs can be amortized across all customers rather than reinventing the wheel for each new deployment.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Customer service</a>
					 
					 <p>With a subscription or usage-based pricing model, the vast majority of revenue from a given customer will come to the vendor far in the future, causing SaaS companies to rely heavily on customer retention for survival. The incentive therefore is to provide fantastic customer service to existing customers, not exclusively seek out new ones. Cloud-based solutions are also much, much easier to provide satisfactory support due to the other reasons listed.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Aligned incentives</a>
					 
					 <p>Generally speaking, SaaS companies seek to align pricing with value. That way, the software provider only receives revenue when the customer creates value. SaaS companies are incentivized to remove barriers to entry and help their customers receive value because doing so is the only way the SaaS company will scale.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Seamless, dependable upgrades</a>
					 
					 <p>Cloud software is architected to ensure that new features can be introduced with no downtime, cost, or disruption to their customers.&nbsp;This is possible because there are common variables for infrastructure and installations without the variability (OS, databases, hardwares, etc.) a customer’s own environment introduces.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Security and stability</a>
					 
					 <p>Cloud-based solutions are typically more secure than self-managed ones—especially in highly-regulated industries¹, because any security failures risk the vendor’s reputation and potentially data of all customers at once. This creates a strong incentive to make stability, security, and data privacy a core competency of the platform.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Scalability</a>
					 
					 <p>Cloud-native software scales much better than on-prem software because as more resources are needed, more resources can easily be utilized. AWS, Azure, and other cloud platforms utilize usage-based payment models that accommodate for spikes in usage and make building redundancy into the product straightforward.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Core competencies</a>
					 
					 <p>Historically, large organizations (e.g., Coca-Cola) have had no choice but to build and maintain large IT divisions (instead of—you know—making beverages). This is becomingly increasingly unnecessary with cloud technologies.&nbsp;Every company can specialize in their expertise and focus on their business—vendor and customer alike.</p> 
				 
					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Concerns with cloud 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Data security/privacy</a>
					 
					 <p>Entrusting another organization with your sensitive data is no easy task—20 years ago, Salesforce struggled at first to get companies to entrust their customer lists to the cloud. But by 2020, most security professionals <a href="https://www.continuitycentral.com/index.php/news/technology/4384-cloud-is-safer-than-on-premise-say-that-majority-of-security-leaders">believe</a> data is safer in the cloud than on-premise. It also appears the severity of on-premise software breaches is higher than cloud-based².</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Control</a>
					 
					 <p>Having access to and control over the source code of your software means that customizations can be made—as long as the licensing agreement allows it. While this is advantageous for some use cases, it can be costly to implement and unclear whether/how the customizations will interact with or potentially break other components of the software.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Centralization</a>
					 
					 <p>Some cloud-based softwares are so far superior to their substitutes that they can create monopolies that centralize power and unfairly exploit their position in markets. It should be noted that centralization has massive benefits—but it’s important that there is interoperability, open source alternatives, and healthy competition to avoid a bad situation.</p> 
				 
					 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>The benefits and concerns present with cloud technologies are just as true for SSI as they are for other types of software. </p>

					 <p>Trinsic’s cloud platform consists of the following products. You can get started free and enjoy robust documentation and support for each.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>  Trinsic Studio: An easy-to-use web interface for managing credential exchange with no code. Also serves as the mechanism to acquire API keys and manage billing for paid plans.<a href="https://studio.trinsic.id/"> Try it yourself free</a>, and issue a credential in less than 5 minutes!  Provider API: Our newest API enables developers to programmatically provision issuer and verifier cloud agents. Learn more about the provider API in the recent launch<a href="https://trinsic.id/trinsic-launches-ssi-provider-product/"> announcement</a>.  Credentials API: Our core API enables developers to have a turnkey way to issue, verify, and manage verifiable credentials on any Hyperledger Indy network. Check out our<a href="http://docs.trinsic.id/"> documentation</a> or one of our<a href="https://github.com/streetcred-id/issuer-reference-app"> reference</a><a href="https://github.com/streetcred-id/verifier-reference-app"> applications</a> to get started.  Wallet API: An API for creating and managing cloud wallets on behalf of credential holders. It’s the backend of our Mobile SDK, which you can read more about in our recent<a href="https://trinsic.id/ssi-wallets-3-decisions/"> post</a> about building your own SSI wallets. Get started with the API by checking out the<a href="http://docs.trinsic.id/"> documentation</a>.

					 <p>Trinsic has built the first end-to-end, cloud-native, hyper-scalable cloud architecture for self-sovereign identity. Not only can you programmatically issue verifiable credentials, but you can programmatically create credential issuers. (Which can themselves issue credentials!) We utilize certain cloud-native functionality to achieve this.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Enterprise-grade key management</a>
					 
					 <p>By utilizing a cloud-native secure key management service, we ensure encryption keys can only be accessed by backend servers associated with those keys. Nobody at Trinsic has access to encryption keys.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Scalable databases</a>
					 
					 <p>Open source implementations use SQLite databases within the wallet, which has scalability limitations. We substitute these wallets for globally-distributed databases specifically built for scale. These also enable advanced indexing and querying.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Partitioning</a>
					 
					 <p>Proper architecture ensures information from one organization can’t be accessed by another organization and that wallets that live in the cloud are secure.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Data residency</a>
					 
					 <p>Our services can be deployed in data centers in most geolocations around the world, ensuring regulatory compliance.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Redundancy</a>
					 
					 <p>Uptime guarantees and SLAs up to 99.99%.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Self-hosted key management</a>
					 
					 <p>If required, your organization can control its own keys, while keeping the agent software hosted in the Trinsic cloud.</p> 
				 
							 
					 
												
															
								
													
												<a>Custom analytics</a>
					 
					 <p>We leverage an analytics infrastructure capable of handling millions of events per second, enabling real-time analytics and insights.</p>

					 <p>Self-sovereign identity will improve security around the world and hopefully make identity theft entirely obsolete, but not for the reason most people think.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Many believe that this is because SSI decentralizes storage of personal data. Instead of PII honeypots that become targets for hackers because millions of people’s data can be stolen from one breach (see: Equifax), SSI information is stored in end-users’ wallets on their phones so a breach would only expose one person’s data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Right? Well…sort of.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One important reason that SSI will reduce identity theft is by reducing our world’s dependence on knowledge of secrets and increasing dependence on possession of secrets. Imagine a future where applying for a bank account in the USA requires a social security number (SSN) in a verifiable credential. By proving possession of the credential, I’m allowed to open an account. Even if a hacker discovered my SSN, they couldn’t open an account in my name because possession of the credential is necessary, not just knowledge of the identifier.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The other reason that hacking is reduced is that each wallet is encrypted using separate keys. In addition to breaching enterprise security systems, a hacker would need to individually decrypt each wallet, which increases the costs to hack cloud-based SSI services exponentially.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So while it’s true that SSI will reduce the occurrence of centralized honeypots of data, the real benefit is that it reduces the value of the data inside the honeypot and increases the cost to access that data, which in turn reduces the incentive to hack it.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Self-sovereignty means key ownership 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>A philosophical belief of many in the SSI community is that self-management of encryption keys is necessary for SSI. This is especially true of people from other blockchain communities where possession of a single key means possession of money (and loss of the key means<a href="https://coinnounce.com/10-dramatic-stories-of-people-who-lost-their-bitcoin-private-keys/"> loss</a> of the money). When it comes to SSI, the issue is different for individuals and organizations.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Individuals 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>As it relates to individual people,the issue is nuanced. To date, totally decentralized key management technologies have not been widely adopted because they introduce additional inconveniences for end-users. So naturally, a spectrum exists to accommodate users who value convenience. As mentioned in a Medium<a href="https://medium.com/@rileyparkerhughes/immunity-passports-and-verifiable-credentials-a-response-to-critiques-142499fba4fb"> post</a> in response to critiques about key management technologies for SSI:</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					<blockquote>
			<p>
				"The degree of inconveniences, security, and user-control depend on the implementation. The simplest key management solution is a complete custodian model. Coinbase has done a great job doing this for cryptocurrencies. A hybrid model could also be employed (this is the one used in the Trinsic Wallet today); a user can back up an encrypted copy of their wallet to a secure cloud or export the wallet to keep in storage of their choosing. Completely decentralized solutions indeed require a great deal of technical knowledge and/or inconvenience but importantly exist for those who don’t want to rely on anyone other than themselves to safeguard their data."			</p>
					</blockquote>
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>That being said, any cloud-based/custodian wallet solution must enable the end-user to export their wallet from the cloud into a wallet where they control the keys. Otherwise, the vendor has total control over the user’s identity – and that isn’t self-sovereign.</p> 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 
			 
		 
				 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
			 Organizations 		 
				 
						 
			 
		 
						 
			 
		 
				 
						 
				 
				 
			 
					 
				 
				 
					 <p>Organizations are organized under the laws of a particular jurisdiction and governed by individual people. Unlike natural persons, organizations do not have unalienable rights or dignity. Put simply, people are self-sovereign, organizations are not. Therefore, the ideals that apply to individuals apply differently to legal entities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To drive this point home, organizations cannot manage their own keys no matter how much they want to because they are inanimate, socially-constructed legal entities. The best those legal entities can do is to enter into legal agreements to employ qualified natural persons to manage the keys on their behalf. Alternatively, an organization can enter into a legal arrangement with another firm, including a SaaS provider, to manage keys on its behalf.</p>

					 <p>We recommend utilizing a cloud-native³ SSI platform, just as your organization (and you as an individual) surely utilize the cloud for other solutions. If cloud isn’t right for you, we recommend you explore the<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-dotnet"> open source</a> reference implementations. They are a free way to install working software on-prem, although it can take a significant development/expense to make it scalable and secure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trinsic’s cloud platform is available for anyone to try out free at<a href="http://studio.trinsic.id/"> studio.trinsic.id</a>.

While they were reeling from the impact, one shining light was the fact that their cloud-based solutions were not infiltrated.(<a href="https://www.logicworks.com/blog/2017/05/wannacry-public-cloud/">https://www.logicworks.com/blog/2017/05/wannacry-public-cloud/</a>).<br><br>  It should be noted that there is a difference between a cloud-native, multi-tenant architecture, and a traditional on-premise software solution deployed and hosted in the cloud. In many ways, hosting deployable software somewhere other than on-premise can give you the worst of both worlds—you are paying for the high development costs of a product that works across hardwares/clouds/OS/etc., but you don’t get the benefits of customization or control. And since it’s not cloud-native, security becomes trickier—products built to accommodate more hardwares/databases/OS will inevitably have more attack vectors than a native solution (think: security of a PC vs a Mac).

<p>by Jacqueline Arlt, Senior  Recruiting Manager&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the last couple of years, IDnow has been growing exponentially, not just in its number of employees, but also concerning market share and global expansion.</p>
<p>Today, we tend to look at IDnow as a scale-up, rather than a start-up. There are a few key differences between those two notations: A start-up is highly experimental with short product and engineering iteration cycles. They are often in the early stages of the funding cycle and haven’t yet figured out which processes work best for them, e.g., in Sales or Marketing. On the contrary, over the course of the last couple of years, IDnow has validated the main building blocks for accelerated growth: product-market fit, a proven go-to-market strategy in its core DACH region, as well as an established business model.</p>
 
  To be able to ensure the product-market-fit, it is not only essential to understand the market needs, but also how to satisfy those needs in the best possible way: we have proven that our product suite is beneficial to a lot of companies and we completely validated its distribution channels. This is true not only for the financial services sector but also for other market segments like mobility, gaming or insurance. 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  In October 2019, we concluded our series C funding round with Corsair Capital LLC as the leading investor. Since then, we have invested in further developing our growth plans – for example, we opened up offices in London and Paris for our 10 colleagues being based in the UK and France. In addition to that, we concentrated on sharpening our technology and on scaling up our team.<br>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  IDnow set out to hire a strong pool of talent. Instead of hiring all-rounders, we started advertising for more focused roles, so that we could boast an array of experts joining across different departments. Moreover, we concentrated on enhanced delegation in hiring department heads and team leads.<br>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  At IDnow, we have an established onboarding process. All new starters take part in a number of sessions with every single department to get fully immersed into the IDnow team. This way, they get introduced to our company culture and mission to make the connected world a safer place. On top of this, all new starters get assigned two buddies – one within the respective department and one from another team – who will support them during the onboarding process.<br>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
  Marketing also plays a major role during the scale-up phase. One has to find the right balance between efficiency and volume – plus dive deep into the data and look at the various channels in their entirety. Our Business Intelligence team is playing a key role in enabling the commercial teams to review dashboards each week and, in turn, measure performance. 
 
<p>While focusing on growth the majority of the time, it’s still important to develop the organization in a healthy manner. With some of the changes last year, we put the company’s management on a broader footing. Now we are working with the next level of leadership to empower and enable them to take the company to the next level as a scale-up. The last couple of months have also seen a strong focus on building a comprehensive and robust reporting grid for both operational and financial key performance indicators. Given the complexities of our business in terms of products, technology, and business model, it’s key to perform an in-depth analysis to be able to base&nbsp;decisions and strategies on it.</p>
<p>One of the questions we get asked in pretty much every interview is, “What’s it like working for IDnow?” In short, the culture is really open and collaborative – if you need help, you will find at least a handful of colleagues being there to answer any question you have, and it’s really fun working together. Even though we now have around 130 employees within the core team, everyone still knows each other by name, thanks to the close-knit culture IDnow displays. This isn’t just within the respective team but also between different departments – and even with colleagues based in different locations – thanks to after-work events, workouts and interdisciplinary projects. By now, we have a lot of processes and structures in place, but nothing is set in stone – if you have an idea and want to try a different course of action, then you don’t have to wait weeks for the approval. The management is highly responsive and open, so if you are up for it, you can easily make a great impact at IDnow. Even though we are not a start-up anymore, we have held on to the most important characteristics of it. We want to keep the atmosphere of a young, agile business, and continue to combine it with the benefits of an established company.&nbsp;What’s next for IDnow – what are we working toward?</p>
<blockquote><p>“The current challenge is to accomplish the scaling phase in a healthy and successful way. IDnow is well-known and established in the DACH region – we have a comprehensive customer portfolio and strong market access. Now we are focusing on the mission to expand this success and the company’s footprint to other markets and industries whilst broadening our product portfolio – we aim to be scalable, replicable and projectable. Therefore you need an experienced and passionate team that’s able to grow in an efficient way,” says Andreas Bodczek, CEO.</p></blockquote>

<p>At Authenteq, we’re continuously perfecting our product and services. However, we’ve always been silent about what we’re up to. As the security space is becoming crowded, and the Covid19 pushes the need for further digitalization in the business landscape, we are ready to break the silence and pledge to share our product updates.</p>



<p>After all, great technology is transparent technology! Here’s what we’re up to during May and June:</p>



 Building a new and fast infrastructure 



<p><a href="https://authenteq.com/privacy-by-design-and-electronic-identity-verification/">Privacy-by-design</a> is our aspiration; however, we noticed that the market is not ready for fully decentralized ID verification and <a href="https://complyadvantage.com/knowledgebase/kyc/">KYC</a> solution. Therefore, we decided to take a step towards building a new system that is built to meet&nbsp;the highest data security standards. Also, the new system is not only faster, but it will also give an opportunity to larger firms that require top-level security to store the data locally. We’re ready to enable our larger customers to scale with ease, while we’ll handle the data security and fraud prevention.</p>



 Image compression to decrease the drop-off rate 



<p>We understand the importance of your user experience, and therefore, over the last couple of months, we worked on improving our image compression services. With the current set-up, your users can upload their documents and selfies and finish the full onboarding process under 60 seconds.</p>



 Benefit from the localization functionality 



<p>As an internationally operating organization with various clients across the globe, we understand the importance of language. Therefore, we strive to continuously add more languages to our product. This month we added Russian language support to our Mobile SDK. We now support English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish, and Russian languages! The language detection depends on both your application and the Users phone settings, and we know that this nifty localization-centric functionality will increase your conversion rates.</p>



 Simplified API 



<p>We want the Authenteq technology to be accessible to any organization that needs a trustworthy partner in navigating the ID authentication and KYC space. That’s why we improved our API and API documentation – to provide your team with a frictionless integration process even when you don’t have a delegated developer on site.</p>



<p>These couple of months enabled us to step back, evaluate our dreams, and take a healthy step forward in rebuilding the product infrastructure. The new infrastructure is future-proof and is ready to grow for scale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s all for the past two months! The upcoming period will be even more exciting as the new infrastructure will allow for more functionality to ease and enhance your user experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ready to give it a try and explore what Authenteq has to offer? Start your <a href="https://customer-dashboard.app.authenteq.com/registration/">30 days trial</a>, get to know your customer, and mitigate risk.</p>

<p>We’ve heard from many of you about your love of cryptocurrency. Many of you have accumulated a few different wallets along the way and have asked about the best way to HODL crypto. Now that Civic Wallet is in app stores, we hope you’re excited&nbsp;to take advantage of the wallet’s features. With Civic Wallet, you can bring in your crypto and start protecting it with the company’s <a href="https://www.civic.com/faq/#coincover">$1 Million Cryptocurrency Protection Guarantee</a> (<a href="https://www.coincover.com/terms-and-conditions">full terms &amp; conditions</a>). The protection is already part of each Civic Wallet, and there’s no need to sign up for it.</p>



<p>Now, let’s say that you lose your phone or somehow lose access to your Civic Wallet. Depending on the digital wallet you use, this could mean that you lose access to your cryptocurrency permanently. But, here’s what Civic Wallet gets right, where other digital wallets may fail: because Civic Wallet is multisig and has already verified your identity during enrollment, restoring your digital identity and cryptocurrency is easy.</p>



<p>Having lived through some of crypto’s earlier years, many of us are familiar with stories of people who have misplaced passwords or somehow lost their private keys. Thankfully, with Civic Wallet, there are no more passwords or seed phrases to track.</p>



<p>How to bring your digital currency into Civic Wallet</p>



<p>After downloading Civic Wallet and setting up an account with some basic information, you may easily send yourself some digital currency (USD, BTC, ETH or CVC) from a digital wallet outside of the Civic network.</p>



 Tap Receive to transfer funds into Civic Wallet from another wallet or exchange. 



  Open your Civic Wallet and select your currency type. For example, if you choose to start with BTC, tap on the Receive icon. Once on the Receive screen, copy your unique BTC address to your phone.  Then, go to your other digital wallet, input an amount, paste your Civic Wallet address as the recipient of the funds, and pressed send.  



<p>That’s it! The transaction takes a few minutes, and before long you’ll see the crypto in your Civic Wallet. Check out our Help Center for more instructions on <a href="https://support.civicwallet.com/hc/en-us/sections/360006096413-Sending-Receiving-Funds">how to send and receive funds</a>.</p>

  <p>Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions have become essential for compliance and security. A wide range of PAM solution choices is available, with the next generation of solutions designed to address the entire PAM process, not just the individual PAM challenges. Next-gen solutions are also built to optimize business operations with automated processes, simplified deployment and easily integrate with existing environments. They take into consideration the way admins work, provide maximum transparency and remove the operational friction that was typical of first-gen solutions. Plus, they scale and transform your PAM program as your environment and business evolves. Attend this session to examine the factors that go into a next-gen PAM solution and why you should invest in a next-gen PAM solution that is able to keep up with and not stand in the way of change.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve4_2020_07_07_gyongyosi"></a>

It is tightly linked to both cybersecurity and IAM initiatives, and there is also an interplay to ITSM. In his talk, Martin Kuppinger will look at how PAM relates to other areas and how to set up a comprehensive initiative that focuses on mitigating risks and improving security, by linking PAM to the rest of IT in a well-thought-out manner.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/kcve4_2020_07_07_kuppinger"></a>

One of the biggest challenges is finding the right balance between enabling WfH and security.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/working_from_home_is_not_secure_without_iam"></a>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/bailey">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>There are ongoing discussions from <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/commission-white-paper-artificial-intelligence-feb2020_en.pdf">high-level expert groups from the EU Commission</a> about what regulation of Artificial Intelligence – particularly the algorithms that process data – will look like. There is a high priority to not only create alignment with the GDPR but to add flexibility for future advancements so that a baseline level of data protection is always provided, even as new AI applications are implemented.</p>
<p>There are many elements of the GDPR that are particularly worth looking closer at regarding algorithmic models for recommendations, predictions, and decisions.</p>
<p>Labeling AI systems according to the risk they pose</p>
<p>Article 22 of GDPR speaks to a data subject’s right to be exempt from decisions that are wholly made with automated processing. A precursor to this right is that a data subject must know if a decision is powered only by automated processing before they can request to be exempt. Labeling automated processing systems is the solution that many companies use to address this, and many working groups call for widespread labeling of AI systems and propose it for upcoming EU regulation.</p>
<p>One option was proposed by the German Data Ethics Commission and is a <a href="https://www.bmjv.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Themen/Fokusthemen/Gutachten_DEK_EN_lang.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=3">five-level risk-based system for AI regulation</a>. It assumes that there is a gradient of how much harm an algorithm could potentially cause and lays out increasingly strict requirements and interventions accordingly. The AI system’s potential to cause harm would be calculated by the likelihood and severity of that harm. The level of risk assigned to a system would impact the requirements of corrective and oversight mechanisms, specifications regarding the transparency of algorithmic systems and the explainability and comprehensibility of the results, and rules on the assignment of responsibility and liability within the context of the development and use of algorithmic systems.</p>
<p>A regulation that follows this framework would define five levels of risk that an AI system could have, and among other safeguards would apply a label that corresponds with the level of risk the system poses. This figure is from the <a href="https://www.bmjv.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Themen/Fokusthemen/Gutachten_DEK_EN_lang.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=3">Opinion of the Data Ethics Commission</a> report published in January 2020, outlining the five levels of risk and potential requirements that a system in each risk category would need to comply with.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Local explainability</p>
<p>The right to an algorithmic explanation in the GDPR has been heavily debated on what exactly that entails, and even if an explanation is required at all, leaving obvious gaps in the ability of the GDPR to assure protection to data subjects on this topic. The existence of this debate makes it almost certain that a clause on explainability in upcoming AI regulation will be included.</p>
<p>This of course means that regulators and eventually companies using AI will have to confront the paradox that while nearly every proposed framework for AI governance requires explainability, many algorithms do not have a satisfactory means of providing local, or individual, explanations. And even one of the front-runner solutions that determines the smallest change to input values that would deliver the desired outcome – first seen in LIME, sometimes called “<a href="https://plus.kuppingercole.com/article/ev80505/ibm-watson-openscale/">contrastive explanations</a>” by IBM and “<a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/counterfactual.html">counterfactual explanations</a>” in the academic community – is rejected by the German Data Ethics Commission. They do not consider it a suitable option for local explanations because it doesn’t offer the user a complete picture of what affected the decision and may give the impression that some attributes are more influential than others when that is not the case.</p>
<p>What to expect</p>
<p>Regulation on the application of AI is still a long way from being finalized. But the EU will likely be among the first to provide legally binding guidance. We can expect more flexible phrasing than in the GDPR to address how quickly it has proved inadequate in governing data protection for AI and facial recognition applications. The risk-based framework is one option that would bring flexibility and allow for ongoing innovation but will cause interpretability issues and may leave huge numbers of algorithms unregulated – for example, all that falls under the level 1 risk.</p>
<p>Explainability may be regulated very harshly and may become an even larger barrier to maturity for machine and deep learning models than before. When there is a clear rejection of a specific explainability method by organizations that will likely influence the design of AI regulation, we can expect requirements that may not be technically possible yet, which would trigger a retraction of some solutions already on the market.</p>
<p>And we can expect AI regulation to be made in the model of the GDPR, using similar terminology and striving to fill the gaps in data protection that have been exposed since its implementation in 2018. One example<a></a> is that we will likely see the terms “data controller” and “data processor” again, updated to fit the context of AI development and implementation. Another is that the “conditions for consent” will likely reappear in reference to populating training data sets and when the model is being implemented.</p>
<p>Legally binding regulation for AI is still on the distant horizon. The EU Commission is still finalizing its <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/ai-alliance-consultation/guidelines">recommended framework for AI governance</a>, a project two years in the making. Its next update was expected in June 2020. A regulation built on that framework will likely still take a few years to be approved.</p>

<p>A Roman coin from around 60 BC depicting a voter putting a ballot into a container.</p>



<p>by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/costavayenas/">Costa Vayenas</a></p>



<p>This is the second in the series on the paradigm shift to a digital state. In Part 1, published <a href="https://procivis.ch/2020/04/30/the-digital-state-part-1/">here</a>, I pointed out that the state is becoming increasingly digital and that no pillar of government is going to remain untouched.</p>



<p>In this article, I focus on one area of
citizen-government interaction that is being digitized, namely the technology
of elections. </p>



<p>The 2020 accelerator</p>



<p>The coronavirus has been a massive accelerator of all
things digital involving the state. In the area of public health, 28 governments
were able to rapidly introduce COVID-19 apps. [1] Tracking the virus at sewage
plants has also given governments a one-week city by city heads-up on where
outbreaks will be confirmed next. [2]</p>



<p>Beyond digital public health initiatives, dozens of
governments around the world either postponed elections in 2020 and/or changed
the election process to “remote” (i.e. permitting voting from home). [3] </p>



<p>New kinds of ballots</p>



<p>Over thousands of years, the ballot has been many
different things: a show of hands, the spoken word, light and dark pebbles,
engravings on bits of clay, entries on small wax tablets, olive leaves, pieces
of bronze, papyrus, parchment, vellum, marbles, the lifting of swords, and
paper. [4]</p>



<p>In our age, a number of state entities have
experimented with e-voting. The US was one of the first countries to experiment
with voting by email, at first just for the military abroad. At the time, it
didn’t seem to matter that the votes were not really secret – someone still had
to print them out at the other end. More recently, West Virginia became the
first US State to permit the military to vote via mobile phones using
blockchain. [5]</p>



<p>There is a lot of trial and error involved. I remember
how impressed I was by the Norwegians, who explained why one of their electronic
elections nearly turned into a disaster as a result of an error in the
encryption code. [6] If this type of thing could nearly happen in Norway, a
wealthy country with a technocratic administration, then we might well ask what
could all go wrong if e-voting were launched in less well-prepared countries
that have fewer resources and lower standards of transparency and governance?</p>



<p>Voting technology is not neutral – it can shift the
outcome of elections </p>



<p>That technology influences how the people instruct
their representatives is as old as recorded history. My choice of the Roman
coin above illustrates one of the ways that voting took place two thousand
years ago.</p>



<p>There was a time when elections were not conducted by
secret ballot, neither in ancient Greece or Rome, nor in the United Kingdom&nbsp;or
in the United States. In the UK, the secret ballot was only introduced as late
as 1872 and later in the US. Before the introduction of secret ballots, one
method of voting was for voters to verbally tell an appointed election official
at the polling station who their vote was for. The official then had to record
that and tally the results. </p>



<p>When society decided it was time to switch to a secret
ballot, a different voting technology was required. The new method delivered
its objective – a secret ballot – but it also changed election outcomes. In one
study, voter turnout in the US declined by around seven percentage points after
the introduction of the secret ballot. [7] A possible explanation for
this decline is that some voters had only gone to the polls as a result of
pressure from their landlord or their employer, or as a result of gifts from a
particular candidate. The introduction of the secret ballot also discriminated
against those who could not read or write, thus keeping them away from the
polls. </p>



<p>Another effect of the introduction of the secret
ballot, noted after Rome introduced it in 139
BC, was that gifts from candidates were now redistributed to specific tribes or
regions. Sometimes the gifts were provided after the regional result became
available, thereby confirming the quid pro quo. [8]</p>



<p>The Swiss experience: Postal voting changes the
numbers </p>



<p>What about the impact of postal voting on election outcomes?
In Switzerland, every eligible
citizen, regardless of where they are registered in the world, automatically
receives a ballot in the post, complete with a self-addressed return envelope,
whether they want it or not. A long-term study that looked at the impact on
voter turnout following the introduction of postal voting&nbsp;in Switzerland
found that it resulted in an increased voter turnout of around four percentage
points. [9] At first glance, that is a surprisingly low number considering that
the ballot arrives at your home without you requesting it, and includes a
return envelope addressed to the ballot-counting authority. How much easier can
it be than that? But that is also a reminder of how uninterested the average
person is in politics – they don’t even want to open the envelope. Getting
people to vote is hard work. On the other hand, a permanent increase of four
percentage points in voter turnout shows that more convenience does make a
difference. And given how narrow some election wins are, four percentage points
can make a huge difference in some places. Seen from that perspective, a
permanent increase of four percentage points is a big deal in politics.</p>



<p>The type of ballot matters, therefore</p>



<p>So, if you change the ballot or tweak the election
process (who can vote, when, where and how?), you change the voter turnout and
that may change the election outcome. </p>



<p>As the state goes digital in a big way, voting from
one’s mobile phone from home in one’s pyjamas will inevitably have an impact in
certain jurisdictions if the voting choices are considered relevant. Evidence
from different jurisdictions is that the introduction of e-voting resulted in
different rates of usage and different trends. It was considered a flop when
introduced in a limited way in France for French residents living abroad, but
was better used by Swiss residents overseas in their elections. In Estonia, e-voting has resulted in more persons
voting from more different places (i.e. also when they were outside the
country) – a result which is more in line with the idea that if something is
relevant, then people will probably use it. But voters are not going to be
persuaded to use their new devices to vote for candidates and choices that do
not appear relevant to them. </p>



<p>Many aspects play a role in this new remote voting value-chain,
including how user-friendly the technology is. A legally-recognized digital ID
will be a major component of a more user-friendly system. This is indeed one of
the foundational technologies that has made e-voting widely used in Estonia. </p>



<p>New rights created</p>



<p>There is also evidence that new voting technology has
created important new freedoms: eligible citizens have acquired new freedoms in
terms of when they can vote (anytime, day or night, from the time early
votes are accepted) and where they can vote (from anywhere). This
technology has even created the new freedom (which exists in Estonia) for voters to change their vote,
as often as they wish, switching it from one candidate to another, until the
polls close. The reasons for such a feature are two-fold: first, because the
technology makes it possible (that’s what technological innovation is all
about, after all – if the app offers the feature, some will use it), and
second, because it makes it less likely for coercion to occur at home or at
work since voters can keep changing their preferences from anywhere at any
time. All three of these new freedoms were triggered by a new voting technology
– a paper-based system would not make it easy to keep a polling booth open 24/7
or allow voters to change their vote after they had cast it or allowed voters
to vote from anywhere.</p>



<p>Concluding thoughts</p>



<p>E-voting (assuming honest software, good governance
and the appropriate checks and balances) [10] potentially represents a major
upgrade of democracy. It will become cheaper and easier to
formally obtain the people’s consent. The “transaction costs”, to use the
academic jargon, will fall dramatically – both for the voter and for the state.
The implications of this efficiency gain will differ from country to country.
But its real disruptive potential lies elsewhere: It opens the possibility,
unforeseen by the founding fathers of old constitutions, that it would become
logistically much easier to consult the people on more things more frequently.
Once that realization dawns in more places, someone, somewhere is going to
become the first to want to try out such a disruptive thought. If the ballot is
a button on your mobile phone, should the app only be used for general
elections every few years? What about the in-between years? Should the people
not be consulted more often on more things? If not, why not? </p>



<p>The growing availability and use of technology
enabling electronic voting will, over time, open up a Pandora’s box. It will
challenge the centuries-old customs of a representative system that was built
in the days when the majority of the voters were labouring in the fields and
knew very little about the policy debates taking place in a faraway
legislature.</p>



<p>The availability of new technology by which the people can choose to make their will known, combined with the growing complexity faced by modern-day legislatures, is hastening the decline of the representative system as we’ve known it. </p>

<p>The legal challenges come from three main angles: first, there is the claim that the technology might not ensure the secrecy of each individual’s choice (like when you mark your cross on a piece of paper privately behind a curtain at a polling booth), second, that what happens on the inside of the computer is not verifiable by ordinary members of the public (like when election observers can see how the ballot boxes are emptied onto counting tables to be counted and the people doing the counting can be monitored), and third, that each vote might not be given equal treatment if different types of ballots and different mechanisms are used for recording, transmitting, sorting, counting and storing votes in different constituencies. This latter point becomes especially important in very tight races and when recounts are needed, and a tiny number of votes can make the difference.</p>

<p>Unexpected events that highlight our vulnerabilities and weaknesses are often the catalysts for large transformation. The events of 9/11 prompted governments around the world to tighten airport and aircraft security overnight, which had been relatively lax up until that&nbsp;morning.</p><p>Could Coronavirus, and the onslaught of cyber attacks and threats targeting displaced workforces, be the inflection point that finally pushes us towards adopting secure and private authentication technology?</p> Passwords are the real security&nbsp;threat <p>When it comes to remote-work security, passwords are doing more harm than good. In the last week alone, remote workers attempting to access San Francisco Airport’s systems remotely had their credentials compromised, after the airports websites were hacked; and the usernames and passwords of half a million Zoom users, who had their accounts hacked last month, went up for sale on the dark web this&nbsp;week.</p><p>Earlier in the year — pre-Coronavirus — Marriott Hotels suffered a massive privacy breach, where the records of 5.6 million guests were exposed after just two employees had their passwords compromised.</p><p>These examples highlight two things: how vulnerable corporate systems and databases are when they are protected by passwords, and how attractive companies become to criminals when they store user login credentials in their databases.</p><p>Yet despite passwords inviting a range of cyber threats, dismantling password authentication systems has been largely avoided. Rather than overhauling how we authenticate, Band-Aid security solutions that aim to bolster passwords have been the&nbsp;go-to.</p> There’s no Band-Aid solution for passwords <p>Solutions like password managers fail to adequately protect against threats because hackers know that maintaining password hygiene has become too much of a challenge for the average user. The vast majority of people ignore password best practices; whether by recycling their passwords across multiple accounts, or choosing weak passwords.</p><p>To make matters worse, it’s easy for hackers to get their hands on stolen passwords — the going rate for a set of compromised credentials is less than a dollar on the dark web. Once a hacker has a single set of login credentials, they can use those to crack passwords to other accounts.</p><p>Because of this, just one stolen password should be treated for what it is — a major security threat. The famous computer security expert, Window Snyder, put it best when she said: ‘one single vulnerability is all an attacker&nbsp;needs’.</p><p>It’s likely that Coronavirus-related attacks will continue to highlight how weak passwords are, hopefully driving us to adopt smarter authentication technologies that don’t put us at unnecessary risk.</p> Biometric authentication has never been more&nbsp;secure <p>Biometrics have come a long way in the past decade, and are now at the point where they are secure enough to completely replace passwords. Unlike passwords, a user’s unique biometrics and characteristics can’t be guessed or&nbsp;cracked.</p><p>Advances in machine learning, including deep learning, have substantially boosted the security and reliability of facial recognition systems, which have enabled new research directions in novel authentication modalities, like behavioral biometrics; where users are authenticated by how they interact with smartphones and desktops rather than via their physical characteristics.</p><p>These authentication techniques allow us to authenticate users based on how they interact with their devices, rather than via their physical characteristics. They don’t require user attention and can, therefore, be used for continuous authentication. With continuous authentication, the user’s device continuously monitors the user (by processing keystrokes or smartphone movements in the background) and makes frequent authentication decisions based on this&nbsp;data.</p><p>New authentication protocols that combine these advancements with emerging privacy-preserving technologies, such as secure multi-party computation and zero-knowledge cryptography, allow for biometric data to be stored securely.</p><p>As with all emerging technology, despite its readiness and potential, widespread adoption can be slow; but unprecedented events can also often lead to decisive&nbsp;action.</p> Lockdowns’ silver lining for cybersecurity <p>Coronavirus lockdowns and the subsequent cyber threats are the most significant disruption to work-place security in modern history. They may also, however, have a silver lining; they could help usher us into a new era of online security and&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>If the Coronavirus pandemic lockdowns force us to replace passwords with something far more secure — like our own unique digital DNA — then it wouldn’t have been for&nbsp;nothing.</p><p>Once we make the inevitable decision to switch to biometric authentication, we will significantly improve security and privacy — effectively putting a permanent stop to a vast majority of cyber&nbsp;threats.</p><p>This is a repost of an Article written by Paolo Gasti — Chief Technology Officer at Keyless Technologies featured in <a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/opinions/covid19-catalyst-biometrics/">Infosecurity Magazine</a></p> Keyless is the world’s first privacy-preserving biometric authentication and identity management platform.  <a href="http://keyless.io">Schedule a Demo</a> and #GoKeyless  <p><a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech/will-covid-19-be-the-catalyst-to-finally-replace-passwords-with-biometrics-7a51c6cea1d3">Will COVID-19 be the Catalyst to Finally Replace Passwords with Biometrics?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/keylesstech">KeylessTech</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  When organizations modernize their Identity and Access Management (IAM), they have three fundamental requirements: an understanding of current capabilities, a migration strategy to transform the IAM infrastructure and finally, the staff with the expertise to execute the plan. The challenges on the way from legacy IAM to a modern IAM infrastructure are manifold and should be considered beforehand.

<p>Pacifica, CA July 6, 2020: MedCreds, which offers private and trusted verifiable credentialing solutions for COVID-19 and other health conditions, has partnered with BraveMaker, a Redwood City, California-based non-profit film arts organization to help its crew members more safely return to work.</p>
<p>Built on a blockchain and cryptography technology, MedCreds allows people to verify and share their health status from a smartphone or personal computer, while owning and controlling who sees their personal information.</p>
<p>Using blockchain-supported verifiable credentials that are owned ONLY by the individual, the MedCreds app safely helps get people back to workplaces, dentists, schools, airplanes/trains, restaurants, and shopping malls, while helping to reduce the possibility of  COVID-19 transmission.</p>
<p>“I am glad that MedCreds has created their app so my cast and crew can share their recent COVID-19 test results in a way that protects their privacy, and at the same time gives me the comfort of knowing the results are verified from an authorized medical authority,” says  Tony Gapastione, Bravemaker CEO. “Running a company and producing films comes with a lot of stress and anxiety, but I feel better knowing that we are doing everything we can to create a safe work environment that assures my staff we are taking every precaution possible to help reduce health risks on our work sets.”</p>
<p>Tony Rose, CEO of MedCreds, is excited to be working with BraveMaker Films to help independent-film-production companies go safely back to work.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 has shut down many businesses,” says Rose. “MedCreds is proud to offer our tools to help California's economy start back up again. MedCreds is different from other COVID-19 and contact-tracing apps because it allows ONLY the  individual to retain ownership and control of their medical credential and information.”</p>
<p>How MedCreds Works</p>
<p>One week before the production start date, BraveMaker Films’ offers to its cast and crew members the opportunity to remotely ask a doctor to order an FDA-approved COVID-19 test from their local lab. Many film-crew members then chose various labs where they wished to have the test performed.</p>
<p>The doctor then reviews the test results, and—using MedCreds’ verifiable credentials—issues to crew members that completed a COVID-19 test their personal, verifiable test result credential.</p>
<p>Each of those BraveMaker Film crew members owns and controls their digital COVID-19 health credential, and can share their results by scanning a QR code upon entering the set.</p>
<p>An appointed BraveMaker representative instantly receives verification of the legitimacy of those crew member's test results, following the QR scan.</p>
<p>For BraveMaker and its Crew Members, MedCreds:</p>
 
 Enables crew members with COVID-19 test results to confirm their COVID-19 status was issued by an authorized medical authority 
 Gives cast and crew members the ability to download the MedCreds app on their smartphone or personal computer to share their COVID-19 status at other filming locations; the dentist; senior-care centers; for International travel; or any other situation that requires verifying the result of their COVID-19 status. 
 Allows BraveMaker to keep a secure log of credential proofs, demonstrating that they have taken advanced health and safety precautions to protect their film crew. 
 
<p>Ben Littlejohn, MD, a board-certified, California based, family-medicine physician, who works with MedCreds as a medical advisor, believes that MedCreds is the most private technology to enable businesses and the economy to begin opening up again.</p>
<p>“I am excited that patients to whom I have issued MedCreds verifiable credentials can prove to any other party, with certainty, that I issued these test results,” says Dr. Littejohn. “Until now, this level of verification for medical test results has not been possible. I am proud to help Bravemaker studios get back to work and restart the independent film industry.”</p>
<p>Headquartered in Pacifica, CA, MedCreds enables anyone that has a COVID-19 virus or antibody test result to hold a digital verifiable credential that can instantly and privately prove to any person or company the results of their COVID-19 test, using only their mobile phone or personal computer.</p>

<p>Once upon a time in Hollywood on the first day of a production, gaffers, key grips, boom operators, and lighting techs would show up for work—ready to make magic.</p>
<p>Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit and everything suddenly changed, leaving the industry wondering how to protect production crews so they can come back to work.</p>
<p>The solution: like hospitals requiring a COVID-19 test within 48 hours of elective surgery, testing can create a safe production set for cast and crew.</p>
<p>BraveMaker Films, an independent film production non-profit, is starting to bring their cast and crew back to work after months in quarantine.</p>
<p>BraveMaker has an urgent need to ensure that cast and crew have a safe production set, so they can bring their business back to life.</p>
<p>MedCreds Creates a Verifiably Safe Work Environment for BraveMaker</p>
<p>On July 6, 2020, MedCreds (which offers private and trusted verifiable-credentialing solutions)  <a href="http://https://blog.medcreds.com/ghost/#/editor/page/5f036d4ec82e8e0001ead65f">announced it has partnered with BraveMaker</a> to assist them in creating a verifiably safe work environment.</p>
<p>Right now, film production crews are still developing best practices for providing safe production sets, and the film-industry unions (DGA, SAG-AFTRA, IATSE and Teamsters) recently came out with safety guidelines on set.</p>
<p>MedCreds, working with Bravemaker, learned about the challenges involved to coordinate group COVID-19 testing with production schedules.</p>
<p>Challenges with COVID-19 Testing</p>
<p>On Wednesday, July 1, 2020, BraveMaker had 21 people from the Bay Area visit Dr. Ben Littlejohn a physician, via a Telemedicine Zoom call to be referred for a COVID-19 test.</p>
<p>We discovered that since everyone was from a different place, each city and county have different rules regarding who can get tested. Many of the COVID-19 testing facilities did not have appointments available for 3 days or more. In some cases, lab results took 4 days after the test was completed.</p>
<p>MedCreds and BraveMaker learned valuable lessons for getting a film production crew back to work safely.</p>
<p>Challenges</p>
 
 Cities, counties, and states have different eligibility requirements for COVID-19 testing 
 Insurance plans differ in which testing facility they contract with 
 Each testing facility has availability of appointments that vary depending on ever changing supply and demand 
 
<p>A Plan for Production Sets</p>
<p>Due to the current challenges and limited availability of testing in some locations, we can offer the following insights:</p>
 
 
<p>3 Weeks Before Production Start Date - Cast and crew are directed to schedule an appointment with their own doctor or a MedCreds Network doctor to get a referral for a COVID-19 test</p>
 
 
<p>2 Weeks Before Production Start Date - Cast and crew have either a zoom or in-office visit with their doctor to have a health screening. Each person is referred to a COVID-19 test at a lab convenient to their location</p>
 
 
<p>1-4 Days Before Production Start Date - Each person visits a testing site to have a test administered using an approved COVID-19 test</p>
 
 
 
 
<p>1 Day Before Production Start Date - All cast and crew have received their medical professional issued COVID-19 test result credential from MedCreds</p>
 
 
<p>Production Start Date - Prior to arriving on set, or upon arrival, cast and crew scan a QR code and consent to sharing their COVID-19 test result status, via MedCreds verifiable credential proof, with the production company. The company will then have a cryptographically verifiable record of COVID-19 test results issued by authorized medical providers for each of their cast and crew.</p>
 
 
<p>This process provides assurance that everyone has been screened and educated about health and safety policies, and a COVID-19 test result has been issued by an authorized medical professional.</p>
<p>By following this procedure, production companies can be assured they have made extensive efforts to create a safe environment for their cast and crew, and such companies have cryptographically verifiable records documenting the process.</p>
<p>Given the current situation, with this process, Film Production Companies can be sure that everyone arriving on set has had a recent COVID-19 test.</p>
<p>In the future, testing will be more widely available, and businesses will be able to re-open with confidence.</p>
<p>Ben Littlejohn, MD, a board-certified, California based, family-medicine physician, who works with MedCreds as a medical advisor, believes this is the most private technology to enable businesses and the economy to begin opening up again.</p>
<p>“I am excited patients to whom I have issued MedCreds verifiable credentials can prove to any other party, with certainty, I issued these test results,” says Dr. Littejohn. “Until now, this level of verification for medical test results has not been possible. I am proud to help Bravemaker studios get back to work and restart the independent film industry.”</p>
<p>Headquartered in Pacifica, CA, MedCreds enables anyone that has a COVID-19 virus or antibody test result to hold a digital verifiable credential that can instantly and privately prove to any person or company the results of their COVID-19 test, using only their mobile phone or personal computer.</p>

   Have you been affected by the new anti-money laundering regulations in Estonia? The scandal, in which 200 billion euros were laundered through an Estonian branch, has reinforced the urgent need for financial institutions to implement Know Your Customer (KYC) as a part of their larger Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts.

<p>Cryptocurrencies have transformed the way society views money, its value, how it can be traded, where it is stored, and who regulates it. Hailed as both revolutionary and dangerous, depending who you ask, the allure has been unmistakable. More than 50 central banks globally have experimented with cryptocurrencies or are developing their own. The cryptocurrency space has moved exponentially faster than the more traditional financial institutions, which has resulted in a lag between innovation and regulation, with some countries banning them entirely. </p>



<p>Estonia was not one of those countries. Long seen as a leader in the digital space, Estonia has become a type of haven for blockchain and cryptocurrency leaders, which is why last week’s news that it had revoked licenses from 500 crypto companies came as a shock to some.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The move has been tied to a larger crackdown on illicit financial transactions as the investigation into a Danske Bank money laundering scandal comes to a close. The scandal, in which 200 billion euros were laundered through an Estonian branch, has reinforced the urgent need for financial institutions to implement Know Your Customer (KYC) as a part of their larger Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts.&nbsp;</p>



 Estonia’s New Regulations 



<p>Since loosening the restriction for cryptocurrency companies in 2017, Estonia issued a whopping 1,400 licenses to firms in the subsequent years. While part of the regulation that stipulates firms must begin operations within six months of obtaining a license is not new, it is the enforcement of this piece alone that led to the country revoking more than 30 percent of Estonian crypto companies’ licenses.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-11/eu-nation-at-center-of-dirty-cash-storm-cracks-down-on-crypto">Bloomberg</a>, the head of Estonia’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), the regulator responsible for issuing the licenses, claimed that the new regulations are a response to stricter AML requirements and risk mitigation, and not meant to suppress the crypto field, nor are the regulations industry-specific.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Estonian government has also passed a bill amending the processing time for 30 to 90 days and has upped the license fees substantially. Any crypto company registered in Estonia must now either incorporate in the country or open a local branch.&nbsp;</p>



 KYC Strengthens AML Efforts&nbsp; 



<p>The basic idea behind and value of KYC from a financial institution’s perspective is to understand who their customer base is (whether as individuals or as a firm) and what types of transactions they will be carrying out with that account. KYC becomes a crucial part of AML in assessing the risk any given customer or account poses. It can be monitored and flagged, thus to a large extent preventing illicit activity from happening at all.</p>



<p>While the <a href="https://authenteq.com/the-true-cost-of-kyc-and-how-authenteq-lowers-it/">true cost of KYC</a> varies depending on the number of users any given company has and processes, the cost of non-compliance is grave. Danske Bank is facing fines in the billions. In addition to fines and legal fees, ideals of credibility, security and safety can all be tarnished indefinitely, resulting in lower customer retention rates, the loss of partnerships, or outside investment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Opting for a <a href="https://authenteq.com/">fully automated</a> identity verification and KYC solution can not only reduce processing times while increasing AML efforts, it removes the need for in-house staff during the approval process, reducing both costs and removing the risk of human error. A trusted and compliant solution eliminates the need and associated costs to the development of proprietary technology. Creating a frictionless onboarding process for customers allows companies to focus on their overall user experience and purpose.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One thing for certain is that regulation that prevents identity theft and fraud will only become more prevalent, and companies without KYC baked into their business model run the risk of being shut down or never starting at all.&nbsp;</p>
