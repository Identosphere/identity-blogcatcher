<p>Crypto platforms must comply with tightening AML laws worldwide—from MiCA in the EU to Travel Rule enforcement in the U.S., UK, Singapore, and UAE. This article explores global KYT, KYC, and AML expectations for VASPs and how iComply helps automate screening, verification, and cross-chain compliance.</p>
 
 The crypto industry has grown from fringe innovation to a core component of global finance – but with that growth comes regulation. In every major market, Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) are now expected to meet traditional financial crime standards. For crypto exchanges, custodians, token issuers, and wallets, this means embracing full-spectrum AML compliance: from real-time identity verification to transaction monitoring and data sharing protocols. 
 
 The Global AML Landscape for Crypto 
 European Union 
 
 Frameworks: MiCA, AMLD6, and Travel Rule compliance 
 Expectations: KYC for all users, KYB for corporate clients, transaction monitoring (KYT), and cross-border data sharing via TRP (Travel Rule Protocol) 
 
 United States 
 
 Regulators: FinCEN, SEC, CFTC, state regulators 
 Requirements: MSB licensing, Travel Rule compliance, sanctions screening (OFAC), suspicious activity reporting (SARs), and BOI reporting for corporate accounts 
 
 United Kingdom 
 
 Regulator: FCA 
 Requirements: Registration, AML risk assessment, PEP and sanctions screening, transaction monitoring, and Travel Rule data transfer 
 
 Singapore 
 
 Regulator: MAS 
 Requirements: VASP licensing, CDD/EDD, KYT, and secure data transfer of originator/beneficiary details under the Travel Rule 
 
 United Arab Emirates 
 
 Regulators: VARA (Dubai), SCA (federal) 
 Requirements: KYC, transaction monitoring, UBO reporting, and Travel Rule compliance for all virtual asset transfers 
 
 
 Core Compliance Responsibilities for Crypto Firms 
 
 KYC/KYB: Identity verification of users and business clients 
 KYT: Monitoring of blockchain transactions for anomalies, structuring, and prohibited counterparties 
 Sanctions + PEP Screening: Ongoing checks of users, addresses, and counterparties 
 Travel Rule: Transmitting originator and beneficiary information securely and in real time 
 Audit-Ready Documentation: Logging all decisions, escalations, and screening events 
 
 
 Why Compliance Is Harder in Crypto 
<p>1. Pseudonymity: Wallet addresses lack inherent identity linkage</p>
<p>2. Cross-border complexity: Differing enforcement timelines and data localization laws</p>
<p>3. Fragmented tooling: Most tools only cover part of the AML process</p>
<p>4. User drop-off risk: Friction-heavy verification drives away users if poorly implemented</p>

<p>The soon-to-be-released <a href="https://portal.hpp.io/">HPP Migration Portal</a> and the Bridge will serve as the official gateways for transitioning from legacy tokens (AERGO and AQT) into the new HPP economy. Through the portal, holders will be able to seamlessly convert their tokens into the unified HPP Token, while the bridge guarantees integrity and security across&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Both the portal and bridge will be rolled out progressively as the migration advances, ensuring a smooth and reliable transition for all participants.</p><p>The following is a preview of how the migration will be carried out, outlining the two-step process required to complete the transition into the HPP ecosystem.</p><a href="https://portal.hpp.io/">https://portal.hpp.io/</a> Migration Steps <p>Step 1: Swap AERGO / AQT → HPP(Ethereum)</p>  AERGO(both native and ERC-20) and AQT(ERC-20) are converted into HPP(Ethereum).  Ratios: 1 AERGO = 1 HPP 1 AQT = 7.43026 HPP (only the whole number will be converted; decimal remainders will not carry&nbsp;over)  <p>Why this step is&nbsp;required</p><p>Ethereum is the most liquid and interoperable base layer. Converting legacy tokens into HPP (Ethereum) ensures:</p>  A unified token supply across&nbsp;chains  Compatibility with existing exchange infrastructure  Secure accounting and custody before moving into the new Layer&nbsp;2  <p>Step 2: Finalize HPP(Ethereum) → HPP(Mainnet)</p>  Convert your HPP(Ethereum) to HPP(Mainnet) through the official&nbsp;portal.  HPP(Mainnet) is for Exchange listings, DAO governance &amp; rewards, and Ecosystem utilities  <p>Why this step is&nbsp;required</p><p>HPP(Mainnet) is the execution layer optimized for AI-native workloads. To participate in governance, earn rewards, and access dApps, tokens must reside on the HPP Mainnet. Keeping Ethereum as an intermediate layer ensures smooth bridging, liquidity routing, and compliance.</p> Key Notes   Both the portal and bridge will be rolled out as the migration advances.  A detailed, step-by-step migration guide will be released concurrently with the launch of the&nbsp;portal.  To fully participate in the HPP ecosystem, including governance, staking, rewards, and trading, it is essential to complete both steps of the migration.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/official-path-to-hpp-portal-and-bridge-opening-soon-df0e5e2b0318">Official Path to HPP: Portal and Bridge Opening Soon</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				 <p>By Helen Garneau</p>
<p>Mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) are <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-mobile-drivers-licenses/">gaining traction worldwide</a> as governments look for secure, digital alternatives to physical identity documents. The promise is clear: residents and citizens can carry a government-issued license on their phone, verify their identity, keep their privacy, and reduce reliance on physical cards.</p>
<p>But there’s a challenge to adoption. While it’s easy to issue an mDLs, verifying one across different systems, borders, and industries is not. Without an easy way to verify an mDL, its usefulness is limited.</p>
<p>This is what <a href="https://indicio.tech/indicio-proven/">Indicio Proven®</a> solves. Proven makes mDL verification simple, mobile, and cost-effective. With Proven, an mDL can be used and trusted at banks, airports, and businesses.</p>
 Closing the mDL verification gap 
<p>Proven bridges the verification gap in two ways.</p>
<p>For organizations that want integration at the system level, Proven provides APIs that can be embedded into existing workflows.</p>
<p>And for those who want to verify quickly, without system integrations, Proven provides a mobile verifier, downloadable as an app that is simple to use and cost-effective to adopt.</p>
<p>This makes it easy to verify an mDL:&nbsp;at a government agency, at a retailer for proof of age — anywhere, anyone needs to prove who they are.</p>
 Interoperability by design 
<p>With Proven, you have a system for digital identity that scales to your needs and meets the requirements for verifiable digital identity around the world. Proven enables you to issue, verify, and combine with <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/governments-can-now-directly-issue-digital-passport-credentials-using-indicio-proven/">Digital Travel Credentials (DTC)</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/indicios-support-for-the-w3c-did-specification-and-its-path-to-standardization/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/implement-digital-identity-in-europe-with-sd-jwt-vcs-from-indicio-proven/">SD-JWT VC</a>, <a href="https://indicio.tech/verifiable-credentials-2/">AnonCreds</a>, and interoperate with the <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/destination-europe-unlock-markets-create-seamless-services-with-indicio-provens-eudi-wallet-integration/">European Digital Identity Wallet.</a> (EUDI).</p>
<p>Proven also allows you to combine authenticated biometrics with Verifiable Credentials to provide the highest level of digital identity assurance and mitigate the threats of biometric identity fraud and AI-generated deepfakes.</p>
<p>Through <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/regula-and-indicio-partner-to-transform-identity-verification-with-verifiable-credentials/">our partnership with Regula,</a> Proven now provides access to document validation for 250-plus countries and territories — all of which can be combined with biometric authentication.</p>
<p>This breadth of options in Proven provides enterprises and governments with a range of innovative, easy-to-implement solutions that meet current and future document and identity authentication needs — all with the assurance of interoperability, privacy-by-design, and open-standard robustness.</p>
 Lower cost, increase revenue 
<p>Indicio Proven isn’t just about saving you on identity verification, fraud, and security costs, it provides a way to monetize verification. Very small fees for verification are imperceptible to users but soon add up when your solution scales. It’s a boon for government infrastructure — rapid deployment, user simplicity, immediate revenue.</p>
<p>No other digital identity technology offers this benefit trifecta.</p>

  August 21st marks six months since the infamous Bybit exploit  
  Here we discuss some of the laundering methodologies and tactics observed, including use of refund addresses, cross-chain laundering, mixers, and the creation of new, worthless tokens<br><br>  
  
<p>On February 21st 2025, Dubai-based exchange Bybit fell victim to the largest confirmed crypto theft in history. Across just two transactions, approximately $1.46 billion in Ether (ETH) and ERC-20 tokens were transferred to a single attacker-controlled <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x47666fab8bd0ac7003bce3f5c3585383f09486e2">address</a>. Elliptic was one of the first to <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/bybit-hack-largest-in-history">publicly call</a> the exploit a North Korean act.<br><br>In our February blog we explained how initial stolen assets were distributed across multiple addresses for the first stage of laundering. In this article we’ll discuss some of the other techniques and methods employed to launder the funds to eventual endpoints, with a particular focus on those which differed from North Korea’s usual laundering tactics, techniques and procedures.<br><br>zeroShadow’s recent <a href="https://www.zeroshadow.io/post/coalition-public-statement">report</a> indicates that over $1 billion of the stolen funds have now been laundered. It is unlikely that funds remained in the control of DPRK operatives at all stages. <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/sanctions-and-terrorism-how-the-cartels-use-crypto-to-launder-the-proceeds-of-narcotics-trafficking">Professional ‘laundering as a service’ operations</a> are thought to have been employed from early stages of the laundering, with ‘North Koreans receiving the face value of the funds to be laundered, minus their fee, at the point of exchange’. This theory is bolstered by multiple reports of ‘user’ complaints being raised on occasions when Bybit stolen funds have been frozen by services; i.e., launderers seeking to maximise their own, personal profits as opposed to recovering a loss for their client.</p>

<p>Decentralized systems have been in vogue at least since the rise of Web3, particularly in Europe. Unlike in the USA or China, where centralized structures prevail, Europe consists of many comparatively small democratic nations that must coordinate in all areas of life to provide their citizens with a high quality of life. </p>
<p>Similar to participants in decentralized Web3 networks, individual citizens in Europe enjoy a high degree of autonomy, freedom, and self-determination. While this autonomy is inherently embedded in the software code of Web3, in Europe, national governments create the legal frameworks. Examples like <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">eIDAS</a> and <a href="https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Crypto/guideline_self-sovereign_identities.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=2">Self-sovereign Identities</a> (SSI) establish EU-wide standards that enable secure cross-border digital transactions.</p>
<p>At Datarella, we have actively participated in decentralized systems through our projects, most recently in the <a href="https://gaia-x.eu">GAIA-X</a> funding project <a href="https://moveid.org">moveID</a>. The experiences gained lead to two key conclusions: The values and benefits of decentralized systems are recognizable and measurable, offering flexibility and innovation in dynamic environments. However, decentralized systems are not feasible or value-creating without a direct connection to centralized elements. This may sound contradictory at first, but it is not.</p>
<p>The Necessity of Centralized Elements in Decentralized Systems</p>
<p>Decentralized systems do not develop from within themselves; they always require a central idea or organization as the initial spark. Furthermore, a central entity must permanently handle tasks in governance, administration, and management. Without this, decentralized systems tend toward apathy or inactivity, as current incentive models do not ensure long-term constructive activity. A decentralized system remains active only as long as central functions provide the necessary incentives. Additionally, basic infrastructure must be created and operated – a task typically handled centrally, with costs distributed among participants.</p>
<p>From the perspective of organization theory, this aligns with contingency theory: There is no universally best structure; the choice between central and decentralized depends on the environment. In stable contexts, centralized systems provide efficiency and control, while decentralized ones promote agility in volatile markets. <a href="https://mintzberg.org">Henry Mintzberg</a> describes in his organizational models that centralized structures (e.g., Machine Bureaucracy) are suitable for standardization, whereas decentralized ones (e.g., Adhocracy) foster innovations. Disadvantages of centralized systems include the lack of flexibility, while decentralized systems can lead to coordination issues. </p>
<p>Symbiosis as the Path to Success</p>
<p>In short, decentralized and centralized systems can form a beneficial symbiosis that compensates for the drawbacks of monolithic approaches and generates more prosperity for all participants. Hybrid models, as recommended in organization theory, combine stability with agility and are exceptionally sensitive in complex environments. </p>
<p>A necessary prerequisite for this symbiotic interplay is the ability and willingness of participants to understand the advantages and limitations of each system, along with the commitment to contribute to governance constructively. Only then do the positive outcomes emerge. Participants who see only the benefits of a monolithic structure should be excluded to maintain integrity.</p>
<p>At Datarella, we apply these insights in our data-driven solutions for health and sustainability, developing hybrid systems that link autonomy with reliable governance. </p>

 How ONT ID Can Restore Trust in the Face of Manipulative AI <p>The rise of generative artificial intelligence has opened unprecedented technological horizons, but it has also raised a fundamental question: how can we distinguish truth from falsehood in a world where content text, images, videos, audio can be manipulated or entirely created by algorithms? AI-generated deepfakes and fake news threaten to undermine trust in the media, institutions, and even human interactions. In the face of this digital truth crisis, innovative solutions are needed. This article explores how ONT ID, Ontology’s decentralized identity solution, can serve as a robust verification mechanism to authenticate content and restore trust in the digital ecosystem.</p> The Trust Challenge in the Age of Generative AI <p>Generative AI, capable of producing text, images, sounds, and videos with striking realism, has transformed the content creation landscape. However, this capability comes with a major downside: the ease with which it can be used to generate misleading or outright false information. Deepfakes of public figures, AI-generated news articles spreading misinformation, and automated online comments manipulating public opinion have become tangible&nbsp;threats.</p><p>The problem goes beyond the technical detection of manipulated content, which is an endless race between creators and AI detectors. The real issue is the erosion of trust. If users can no longer distinguish authentic content from synthetic content, the value of information itself diminishes. This has profound implications for democracy, commerce, education, and social relationships. Developing mechanisms to prove the origin and integrity of content and restore trust in the digital ecosystem has become imperative.</p> ONT ID: An Anchor of Trust in a Sea of&nbsp;Content <p>This is where ONT ID, Ontology’s decentralized identity solution, comes into play. Built on blockchain technology and adhering to W3C standards for Decentralized Identifiers (DID) and Verifiable Credentials (VC), ONT ID provides a robust framework to establish the provenance and authenticity of digital content. Instead of relying on centralized platforms that can be compromised or manipulated, ONT ID allows content creators to digitally sign their work with their decentralized identity.</p><p>Imagine a content creator whether a journalist, artist, or researcher using their ONT ID to cryptographically link their identity to each piece of content they produce. This digital signature, recorded on the blockchain, becomes immutable proof of the content’s origin. Any consumer can then verify this signature using an ONT ID-compatible tool, confirming that the content genuinely comes from the claimed source and has not been altered since its creation.</p><p>Moreover, ONT ID can be used to attest to the nature of the content. For example, a creator could label content as “AI-generated” or “human-verified.” This transparency allows users to make informed decisions about the credibility and nature of the content they consume. By providing a verifiable and decentralized anchor of trust, ONT ID offers a powerful means to combat misinformation and restore confidence in the digital ecosystem.</p> Practical Implementation and&nbsp;Benefits <p>Applying ONT ID for content verification can take several&nbsp;forms:</p>  Digital content signatures: Content creation platforms (news outlets, press agencies, digital art studios) could integrate ONT ID to allow authors and artists to digitally sign their work. These signatures would be visible and verifiable by the public, adding a layer of&nbsp;trust.  Marking AI-generated content: Generative AI tools could be required to integrate ONT ID to indelibly mark the content they produce as AI-generated. This allows consumers to immediately know whether they are interacting with human or synthetic content.  Source identity verification: In journalism and research, ONT ID could be used to verify the identity of information sources, ensuring that the information comes from legitimate people or organizations rather than bots or malicious entities.  Digital reputation and credibility: Over time, content creators who regularly sign their work with ONT ID and are recognized for the reliability of their information could build a verifiable digital reputation on the blockchain. This would encourage the production of authentic, high-quality content.  <p>The advantages of this approach are manifold: a significant reduction in misinformation, restoration of public trust in media and online information, increased protection against fraud and identity theft, and a more transparent and accountable digital ecosystem. By shifting the burden from detection to proof of authenticity, ONT ID offers a proactive and sustainable solution to the trust challenge in the AI&nbsp;era.</p> Conclusion <p>The rise of generative AI has created a digital landscape where truth is increasingly difficult to discern. In the face of proliferating manipulated content and deepfakes, restoring trust has become a top priority. Ontology’s ONT ID provides a powerful, decentralized solution to this challenge. By enabling creators to digitally sign their content and providing consumers with tools to verify authenticity and provenance, ONT ID can serve as an essential anchor of trust in the digital ecosystem.</p><p>By adopting decentralized identity technologies like ONT ID, we can not only fight misinformation but also build a more transparent, secure, and trustworthy digital future one in which truth can once again flourish.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/the-age-of-digital-distrust-21c796608581">The Age of Digital Distrust</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Welcome back to our series on building the Many-to-Many System. In our first two posts, we explored the project’s origins, the challenge of structuring our complex knowledge, and the human pace required to do it well. We left off discussing the need to create a digital “guide” to help people navigate the deep and interconnected learnings from our&nbsp;work.</p><p>Over the past three months, that abstract idea has become a tangible reality. We have been working in parallel on two major outputs: a linear, narrative-driven Field Guide and a modular, interactive website. These two pieces have been in constant conversation, shaping each other as they evolve. In this post, we, Arianna, Gurden, and Michelle, share our reflections on bringing this part of the system to life, the power of a good design process, and what it feels like to see emergence in&nbsp;action.</p><p>Arianna: Maybe I can start. The last three months have been a back-and-forth conversation between our two major outputs: the Field Guide and the website. We were working on them in parallel, so every new page or piece of content for the Field Guide would influence the website, and the website would influence the Field Guide. A really interesting part was categorising all the tools. For you too, Michelle, I imagine writing in the Field Guide and then seeing the first draft of the website that Gurden built really helped clarify what should remain in a linear format and what could become an interactive element.</p>Working on copy and storytelling on the website, it’s not easy to go from the Field Guide which has 80+ pages to a 3 paragraphs maximum&nbsp;format.<p>This double narration is key. The Field Guide is linear, so people can follow page by page, and we’ve put a lot of effort into diagrams that synthesise and distinguish each section clearly. On the website, we’re trying to simplify the experience with shortcuts and modular recalls so that everything is interconnected. That has been our core challenge and focus these last&nbsp;months.</p>Our two ways to discover and learn about the Many-to-Many System.<p>Gurden: Yeah, listening to you, Arianna, it’s really cool to watch this flow of content between the Field Guide and the website. We made these structural decisions months ago, sitting in a park during our workshop, and it’s a great feeling to see them validated now. We were a bit unsure at the time because we’re dealing with so much complexity: many, many, many things, as the name suggests! But we made a conscious decision to have both a linear and an interactive flow, and the process has proven that was the right&nbsp;call.</p>The Field Guide is not simply a PDF report, it has guiding elements, small interactive buttons, guiding diagrams, and visual elements to help navigate complexity.<p>As the Field Guide grew, the website structure grew with it. To make sure the website is structurally sound, I set up a skeleton database in Notion for the main content. To be honest, my expectations were a bit low when I asked Michelle and Annette to fill it, but big shoutout to Annette, her mind works just so quickly. She immediately got the object-oriented structure and filled it up, making the connections brilliantly. That gave me a distilled version of the content to populate our website via the Content Management System.</p>Screenshot from Sanity, our content management system, showing linkages between&nbsp;data.<p>I’m glad we didn’t try to perfect everything at once. We moved fast, built a rough first version, and brought it to life, which is now live internally. We’ve already done a few quick user tests. If we had just stayed in Figma, we’d still be there six months from&nbsp;now.</p><p>Michelle: I have so little to add because you’ve both covered most of it! My main addition is to highlight how everything has informed everything else. You’ve talked about the Field Guide and website, but they, in turn, provided enough structure for the database so Annette could go in and finish it. That process gave all of us a deeper understanding of our tools, examples, case studies and other assets we needed to&nbsp;create.</p><p>It’s a good example of real emergence. A lot of people talk about emergence when they’re really just describing chaos without enough boundaries. But here, we had pieces that genuinely formed the next piece, that formed the next piece. What was supposed to come out and what would be useful for other people was illuminated by going through this process. It gave birth to key assets we hadn’t yet imagined, like Angela’s “Experimenter’s Logbook”, which will be available soon on the website. I’m not sure that would have been conceived in the same way without this interplay. It’s a testament to what a good design process does, and even though we didn’t invent the design process, it was nice to be part of one that was so fruitful.</p>Index preview of the Field Guide, which will be avilable&nbsp;soon.<p>Gurden: I agree. The process exists, but I’ve seen so many teams not follow it well. And credit to you, Arianna, the interconnected diagrams you created are now coming to life. When you navigate the website, you see a problem and the related tools linked directly to it. These interlinkages are what make it a living system, not just a static&nbsp;page.</p><p>Of course, that’s also our next challenge: making sure the user experience works, that people don’t get lost. A website is a living organism, and new ideas will constantly come in. The hard part now is making conscious decisions about what we need to fix before launch versus what can wait for the next&nbsp;version.</p><p>Arianna: That brings me to another point: how we are all holding many hats. We aren’t a typical product team where each person has one defined role. The core team is tiny, and each of us holds three or four different roles. This has positives, we can communicate rapidly, and as designers and coders, we are deeply embedded in the content, thanks to the time Michelle and Annette took to teach us. But on the other side, by holding many roles, we have to compromise. We can’t excel at everything. So, for this first version, we might focus less on perfecting accessibility, for example, because our goal is to launch an alpha or beta version. When we have more time to focus, we can scale it and do it&nbsp;better.</p><p>Michelle: That’s a super good reflection on the human side of the process. So, to wrap up, we’ve now asked a set of close collaborators to give us feedback over the next month.

 The certification reinforces IDnow’s role as a trusted, future-proof partner for regulated businesses and ensures that IDnow’s core solutions are fully aligned with current and upcoming EU compliance requirements, including EUDI Wallet readiness by 2027.&nbsp; 



 



<p>IDnow has become one of the first companies in Europe to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/europes-identity-verification-providers-eidas/">receive certification under the latest ETSI</a> standard for remote identity proofing, which is a key requirement for eIDAS 2.0 compliance and EUDI Wallet readiness by 2027.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This milestone cements IDnow’s position as a trusted and future-proof partner for regulated industries and ensures its solutions are aligned with both current and upcoming EU compliance frameworks.&nbsp;</p>



 Certified for the future of European Digital Identity&nbsp; 



<p>The certification, developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and officially endorsed by the European Commission, confirms that several of IDnow’s core products meet the strict biometric integrity, security, and assurance levels required for digital onboarding in highly regulated sectors. These solutions are now certified as compliant with eIDAS 2.0 at the Extended Level of Identity Proofing (LoIP) – the highest level defined under the revised regulation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The certified identity verification methods include:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/expert-led-verification/">Expert-led video verification</a>&nbsp;  



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">Automated identity verification</a>&nbsp;  



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-introduces-nfc-based-verification-for-digital-ids/">NFC-based ID verification</a>&nbsp;  



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-eid/">eID (electronic ID) verification</a>&nbsp;  



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/identity-wallet/">EU Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet verification</a>&nbsp;  



 Why ETSI standards are so important for remote identity verification&nbsp; 



<p>In achieving certification, IDnow demonstrated compliance with the following ETSI standards:&nbsp;</p>



  ETSI TS 119 461 V2.1.1 – Identity proofing component requirements&nbsp;  



  ETSI EN 319 401 V3.1.1 – General policy requirements for Trust Service Providers&nbsp;  



  ETSI EN 319 411-1 V1.5.0 – Requirements for TSPs issuing certificates&nbsp;  



  ETSI EN 319 411-2 V2.6.0 – Requirements for TSPs issuing qualified certificates&nbsp;  



  ETSI EN 319 412-2 V2.3.1 – Certificate profiles for legal persons&nbsp;  



  ETSI EN 319 412-5 V2.4.1 – Certificate profiles for identity proofing&nbsp;  



 Addressing rising fraud with certified security&nbsp; 



<p>With AI-powered fraud tactics like deepfakes and injection attacks growing rapidly in both sophistication and scale, IDnow’s certification arrives at a critical moment for digital security. According to a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/pindrops-2025-voice-intelligence--security-report-reveals-1-300-surge-in-deepfake-fraud-302479482.html">2025 report by Pindrop</a>, deepfake fraud attempts have surged urged by over 1300% in 2024, escalating from an average of one per month to seven per day. This alarming increase underscores the growing sophistication and frequency of AI-driven fraud, particularly targeting financial services and contact centers. The report also forecasts a <a href="https://www.pindrop.com/article/deepfake-fraud-could-surge/">162% rise in deepfake-related fraud in 2025</a>, highlighting the urgent need for robust verification solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ETSI TS 119 461 standard provides essential safeguards through its strict requirements for features such as presentation attack detection (PAD), injection attack detection (IAD), biometric integrity assurance, and real-time fraud prevention – offering businesses and users protection at the highest level of assurance.&nbsp;</p>



 Built for Europe’s regulatory future&nbsp; 



<p>This certification reinforces IDnow’s commitment to providing secure, flexible and scalable identity verification solutions across Europe. The platform is uniquely positioned to support evolving compliance needs, including:&nbsp;</p>



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas-2-0/">eIDAS 2.0&nbsp;</a>  



  Sixth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/amld6-anti-money-laundering-directive/">AMLD6</a>)&nbsp;  



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/eudi-wallets-privacy-usability/">EU Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallet readiness&nbsp;</a>  



<p>“This latest certification confirms IDnow’s position as a trusted and future-proof technology partner for regulated businesses across Europe,” says Armin Berghaus, founder and Managing Director at IDnow. “It represents our intention for IDnow to continue to provide the most flexible and future-proof identity verification and fraud prevention platform for businesses navigating complex European compliance and customer experience demands.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 2027, all banks operating in the EU will be required to work with providers certified under ETSI TS 119 461. This gives IDnow customers the confidence that their identity verification processes are not only secure and compliant today, but also ready for what’s next.&nbsp;</p>

             Security that strengthens – not sidelines – democratic freedoms 
<p>The same digital tools that power modern life can also erode rights and resilience. At DSEI 2025, Thales shows how to protect people, data and national lifelines—openly and responsibly—across government, critical infrastructure and enterprise.</p>
 Why protecting freedoms needs a new trust framework 
<p>Digital transformation has blurred the line between convenience and exposure. Critical services now depend on complex ecosystems—cloud platforms, managed providers and converged OT/IT—so a single weak link can cascade into national disruption. At the same time, the UK’s evolving policy landscape demands stronger resilience with privacy and accountability intact.</p>
<p>The answer is a shared, outcome-driven model: clearly define who protects what, and how evidence is logged. Just as important, ensure services recover quickly—without compromising civil liberties.</p>
 The customer reality: three arenas, shared pressures 
 
 Government &amp; public sector. Deliver capabilities with democratic oversight; manage cross-border data flows; ensure transparency in AI decisions; and meet new cyber-resilience duties across sprawling provider ecosystems. 
 Critical National Infrastructure. Modernise legacy OT, manage IT/OT convergence, counter sophisticated cyber-physical attacks, and harden supply chains while sustaining operations through geopolitical shocks. 
 Private sector &amp; enterprise. Retain control of sensitive data in cloud environments, navigate international data-transfer constraints, and build customer trust through privacy-preserving design. 
 
 Thales approach: freedom through digital trust 
 
 Zero Trust—everywhere (IT &amp; OT). Move beyond perimeters to authenticate every user, service and device; encrypt or tokenise sensitive data; continuously monitor for anomalies; and migrate legacy systems towards Zero Trust-compatible services. 
 Proven identity foundations. PKI, strong authentication (including FIDO) and lifecycle identity onboarding underpin confidential services and citizen-centred experiences—at national scale. 
 Secure-by-Design, continuously verified. Build resilience into the lifecycle; reinforce with threat intelligence and regular audits against recognised frameworks. 
 Data sovereignty you can prove. UK-managed processing and national key control to protect from extraterritorial interference while sustaining high-trust citizen services. 
 
 Bridging cyber and physical: where freedoms meet the real world 
<p>Threats don’t respect domains. We secure cyber-physical systems—from control rooms to remote sites—by combining identity-first security, secure communications and layered sensing, tailored for OT realities. For hostile or careless drone activity near sensitive locations, our counter-UAS options scale from jamming to RF-directed energy — always aligned with policy and safe operation.</p>
 From policy to practice: resilience as a service 
<p>Skills are scarce and threats move fast. Thales augments customer teams with managed detection &amp; response, through-life assurance and exercises on our UK cyber range—so playbooks are rehearsed and recovery is measured.</p>
 What to explore in the Protecting our Freedoms zone 
 
 Keep essential services online during cyber attacks. See how rapid detection, investigation and response shrink disruption from hours to minutes. 
 Own your data—even in the cloud. Learn how to keep encryption keys under national control and meet sovereignty and privacy requirements. 
 Communicate securely when it matters most. Resilient, secure voice and data for dispersed teams, built for hostile environments and critical operations. 
 Smarter border protection, delivered as a service. Integrated sensing, analytics and mission support you can scale with demand. 
 Harden critical infrastructure end-to-end. From control rooms to remote assets (even subsea routes), see how cyber and physical security work as one. 
 Frictionless, phishing-proof sign-in. Try strong authentication (FIDO) that boosts security without slowing staff or citizens. 
 Zero Trust you can actually roll out. Pragmatic steps to secure users, devices and apps across IT and OT—without big-bang change. 
 Intelligence that joins the dots. Watch cyber alerts fused with threat intel to prioritise what matters and guide clear, auditable decisions. 
 
 At-a-glance: the capabilities behind the experience 
 
 Digital Trust &amp; Identity – identity-first controls, encryption and continuous monitoring across users, services and devices. 
 Sovereign Cloud &amp; Data Control – UK-managed processing, national key control and privacy-by-design services. 
 CNI Resilience – Secure-by-Design and Zero Trust for OT/IT to reduce successful attacks and keep services running through disruption. 
 Integrated Physical-Cyber Defence – from counter-UAS to perimeter and CPS security, combining sensors, comms and effectors.

             Regain control of the air with faster, smarter, integrated defence 
<p>Airspace is now contested at every altitude and vector — from low-cost drones to hypersonics, electronic warfare and cyber. At DSEI, our Securing the Skies zone shows how integrated air and missile defence (IAMD) restores decision advantage and protects forces, infrastructure and citizens.</p>
 Why control of the air is harder than ever 
<p>Modern air defence must counter simultaneous, coordinated attacks: hypersonic glide vehicles, stealthy cruise missiles, massed UAV swarms, electronic warfare and cyber intrusions. Decision time is shrinking from minutes to seconds — leaving traditional, siloed systems struggling to keep up.</p>
 “Decision time is shrinking from minutes to seconds — leaving legacy systems behind.” 
 Closing the integration gap 
<p>Most forces still rely on fragmented architectures where sensors and effectors can’t easily share data or coordinate responses. The result? Slower decisions, wasted interceptors, and critical coverage gaps.<br>
IAMD offers the opportunity to replace that fragmentation with a networked approach: connecting sensors, decision tools and effectors into one resilient, layered system that maximises coverage and ensures the right response, at the right time.</p>
<p>Any sensor → the right decider → best effector</p>
 What does this mean in practice? 
 
 Multi-domain sensing: Long-range radars, passive and space-based sensors stitched into a single picture. 
 Intelligent C2: AI-enabled tools process hundreds of feeds, highlight what matters, and give commanders transparent recommendations — with humans always in control. 
 Layered effectors: From ground-based missiles to directed energy and electronic warfare, commanders get the right-cost, right-effect response — not just “fire and hope.” 
 
 “Any sensor. The right decider. The best effector. That’s how you win back the skies.” 
 Proven today, preparing for tomorrow 
 
 Combat-proven: In NATO ForceShield trials, integrated radars and interceptors defeated drone swarms at 70% lower cost per engagement compared to traditional missiles. 
 Allied by design: As lead in the 23-nation EISNET consortium, we’re helping to set interoperability standards that keep coalition operations seamless. 
 Trusted AI: Our cortAIx platform accelerates classification and engagement while maintaining transparency and human oversight, aligned with TrUE AI principles. 
 
 Investing in sovereignty, skills and growth 
<p>IAMD is more than a military capability — it’s part of the UK’s industrial strategy. We’re investing in sovereign AI and skills, including a £40m cortAIx UK hub creating 200 specialist roles, and building stronger ties with UK SMEs and academia.</p>
<p>The result: sovereign control of critical technologies, jobs in the UK supply chain, and faster delivery of capability to the frontline.</p>
 See it at DSEI: live in Securing the Skies 
<p>On-stand experiences will show how:</p>
 
 AI-powered analysis helps commanders classify threats in seconds, not minutes. 
 Integrated sensors create a clearer picture of the battlespace. 
 Orchestration tools pair “any sensor” to the “best effector” in layered scenarios. 
 Next-gen systems like SAMP/T NG, RapidDestroyer DE and ForceShield demonstrate resilience against emerging threats. 
 
 At-a-glance: Securing the Skies delivers 
 
 Decision advantage in a compressed-time battlespace 
 Allied interoperability through NATO/EISNET standards 
 Trusted AI for faster, explainable decisions 
 Sovereign growth via UK skills, jobs and technology 
 
<p>Find us at DSEI (Stand S8-110) to explore how integrated air defence delivers operational advantage today — and resilience for tomorrow.</p>

       Redirect URI: <code>com.okta.{yourOktaDomain}:/callback</code> 
       Post Logout Redirect URI: <code>com.okta.{yourOktaDomain}:/</code>
 (where <code>{yourOktaDomain}.okta.com</code> is your Okta domain name). Your domain name is reversed to provide a unique scheme to open your app on a device. 
     
   
   In the Controlled access section, select the appropriate access level 
   Click Save 
 

<p>NOTE: When using a custom authorization server, you need to set up authorization policies. Complete these additional steps:</p>

 
   In the Admin Console, go to Security &gt; API &gt; Authorization Servers 
   Select your custom authorization server (<code>default</code>) 
   On the Access Policies tab, ensure you have at least one policy:
     
       If no policies exist, click Add New Access Policy 
       Give it a name like “Default Policy” 
       Set Assign to to “All clients” 
       Click Create Policy 
     
   
   For your policy, ensure you have at least one rule:
     
       Click Add Rule if no rules exist 
       
        <p>Give it a name like “Default Rule”</p>
       
       
        <p>Set Grant type is to “Authorization Code”</p>
       
       Set User is to “Any user assigned the app” 
       Set Scopes requested to “Any scopes” 
       Click Create Rule

  Where are my new app's credentials?

<p>Creating an OIDC Native App manually in the Admin Console configures your Okta Org with the application settings.</p>

<p>After creating the app, you can find the configuration details on the app’s General tab:</p>

 
   Client ID: Found in the Client Credentials section 
   Issuer: Found in the Issuer URI field for the authorization server that appears by selecting Security &gt; API from the navigation pane. 
 

   <code>Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli-client">Okta CLI Client</a> or <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-powershell-cli">Okta PowerShell Module</a> to automate this process. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-mobile-app/-/create-okta-application/">this guide</a> for more information about setting up your app.</p>



<p>Replace {yourOktaDomain} with your Okta domain.</p>

 Prefer phishing-resistant authentication factors 

<p>Every new Integrator Free Plan admin account must use the Okta Verify app by default to set up MFA (multi-factor authentication). We’ll retain the default settings for this project, but you can tailor the authentication policy for your organization’s needs. We recommend phishing-resistant factors, such as Okta Verify with biometrics and FIDO2 with WebAuthn. These configurations help defend against credential theft and phishing and align with Okta’s Secure Identity Commitment, standards like NIST SP 800-63, and industry regulations like SOC 2 or HIPAA.</p>
 
   Prefer MFA or phishing-resistant factors for real users 
   Tailor policies based on risk level, environment (dev vs prod), and user behavior 
 

<p>Thoughtfully configuring your <a href="https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/identity-engine/policies/modify-first-party-app-policies.htm">authentication policies</a> protects your users while maintaining a seamless login experience.</p>

 Create an iOS project with Okta’s mobile libraries for authentication 

<p>Before diving into integration, ensure you have the following prerequisites:.</p>

 
   Xcode version 15.0 or later. This guide assumes you’re comfortable working in Xcode and building iOS apps in Swift. 
   Swift - This guide uses Swift 5+ features. 
   Swift Package Manager (SPM) - We’ll use Swift Package Manager for managing dependencies. Ensure it’s available in Xcode. 
   Node and npm installed locally to run the backend server 
 

 Creating your Xcode project 

<p>If you are starting from scratch, create a new iOS app:</p>

 
   Open Xcode 
   Go to File -&gt; New -&gt; Project 
   Select iOS App and select Next 
   Enter the name of the project 
   Set the Interface to SwiftUI or UIKit, depending on your preference
    <blockquote>
      <p>In this post, we will be using SwiftUI</p>
    </blockquote>
   
   Select Next and save your project locally 
 

<p>You’re now ready to add Okta’s SDK into your project.</p>

 Authenticate your iOS app using OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0 with Okta 

<p>To integrate the Okta SDK into your iOS app, follow these detailed steps using Swift Package Manager (SPM), the recommended and modern way to manage dependencies in Xcode.</p>

<p>Follow these steps:</p>
 
   Open the project if it’s not already open 
   Select File → Add Package Dependencies 
   In the search bar at the top right of the window that appears, add the <code>https://github.com/okta/okta-mobile-swift</code> repository and select Enter. Xcode will fetch the package details. 
   Choose the latest version available (recommended) or the version you prefer. 
   When prompted to choose the products to add, make sure to select your project next to <code>BrowserSignin</code> in the Add to Target column 
   Select Add Package 
 

<p>This package provides the full login UI experience and token handling utilities for OAuth 2.0 with PKCE. It’s the core component for authentication in your iOS app.</p>

<p>Once added, you’ll see the Okta SDK listed under your project’s Package Dependencies.</p>

 Add the OIDC configuration to your iOS app 

<p>To use the <code>OktaBrowserSignin</code> flow, initialize the shared client with your specific app credentials.</p>

<p>The cleanest and most scalable way to manage configuration is to use a property list file for Okta stored in your app bundle.</p>

<p>Create the property list for your OIDC and app config by following these steps:</p>
 
   Right-click on the root folder of the project 
   Select New File from Template (New File in legacy Xcode versions) 
   Ensure you have iOS selected on the top picker 
   Select Property List template and select Next 
   Name the template <code>Okta</code> and select Create to create a <code>Okta.plist</code> file 
 

<p>You can edit the file in XML format by right-clicking and selecting Open As -&gt; Source Code. Copy and paste the following code into the file.</p>

   <code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;scopes&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;openid profile offline_access&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;redirectUri&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;com.okta.{yourOktaDomain}:/callback&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;clientId&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;{yourClientID}&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;issuer&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default&lt;/string&gt;
    &lt;key&gt;logoutRedirectUri&lt;/key&gt;
    &lt;string&gt;com.okta.{yourOktaDomain}:/&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;
</code>   

<p>Replace {yourOktaDomain} and {yourClientID} with the values from your Okta org.</p>

<p>If you use something like this now in code, you can directly access the <code>BrowserSignin</code> shared object, which will already be allocated and ready for use.</p>

 Manage authentication actions for your iOS app using the Okta Swift SDK 

<p>We’ll build the core authentication layer for our app, the <code>AuthService</code>. This service handles login, logout, token refresh, and user info retrieval using the <code>OktaBrowserSignin</code> module.</p>

<p>Create a new folder named <code>Auth</code> under your project’s folder structure. We’ll use this folder to organize our authentication code. Inside that folder, create a new Swift file named <code>AuthService.swift</code> and define the protocol and class:</p>

   <code>import BrowserSignin
protocol AuthServiceProtocol {
    var isAuthenticated: Bool { get }
    var idToken: String? { get }
    
    func tokenInfo() -&gt; TokenInfo?
    func userInfo() async throws -&gt; UserInfo?
    func signIn() async throws
    func signOut() async throws
    func refreshTokenIfNeeded() async throws
}
final class AuthService: AuthServiceProtocol {
    // Implementation will go here
}
</code>   

<p>After doing this, you will get an error message saying that the <code>AuthService</code> does not conform to protocol <code>AuthServiceProtocol</code> because we haven’t implemented the functions yet. We will implement the functions as we progress.</p>

<p>Create a folder named <code>Models</code> inside the <code>Auth</code> folder. Within the <code>Models</code> folder, create a new file named <code>TokenInfo.swift</code>, and add the code shown:</p>

   <code>struct TokenInfo {
    // we will add properties in the next section
}
</code>   

<p>Next, we will add the <code>signIn</code> and <code>signOut</code> methods inside the <code>AuthService</code> class.
With the Okta Swift SDK, handling user authentication is straightforward and secure – thanks to the built-in <code>signIn</code> and <code>signOut</code> methods in the <code>BrowserSignin</code> client. Let’s break down how to build these methods in your <code>AuthService</code>.</p>

 The <code>signIn</code> method 

<p>The <code>signIn</code> method redirects the user to authenticate using Okta, handles the PKCE flow, and retrieves the authentication tokens upon successful login. Open the <code>AuthService</code> class, find the comment <code>Implementation will go here</code>, replace the comment with the following code:</p>

   <code>@MainActor
func signIn() async throws {
    BrowserSignin.shared?.ephemeralSession = true
    let tokens = try await BrowserSignin.shared?.signIn()
    if let tokens {
      _ = try? Credential.store(tokens)
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s unpack this:</p>

<p><code>BrowserSignin.shared?.ephemeralSession = true</code></p>

<p>This property controls the type of browser session used for authentication:</p>
 
   If set to true, it forces an ephemeral browser session, meaning no cookies or session state will persist across authentication attempts. It’s like opening a private/incognito window for each login attempt. 
   If set to false, it shares the browser state with the system browser, allowing Okta to remember the user’s login state across sessions (for example, for single sign-on across apps). 
 

<p>In our demo, we set <code>ephemeralSession = true</code> to treat each login as a fresh authentication, which is ideal for testing.</p>
 
   <code>signIn(from: window)</code>
  This function launches the Okta-hosted sign-in page.
  The window parameter provides context for where to present the login UI, typically your app’s current window if building in UIKit. 
   <code>Credential.store(tokens)</code>
  After login, we store the tokens securely (e.g., access token, ID token, and refresh token) using Okta’s built-in Credential storage helper. 
 

 The <code>signOut</code> method 

<p>Signing out is also straightforward. We will proceed by adding it immediately below the <code>signIn</code> method in the <code>AuthService</code> class:</p>

   <code>@MainActor
func signOut() async throws {
  guard let credential = Credential.default else { return }
  try await BrowserSignin.shared?.signOut(token: credential.token)
  try? credential.remove()
}
</code>   

<p>Here’s what happens:</p>
 
   We check if there’s a current credential by calling <code>Credential.default</code>. 
   We call <code>signOut</code> on the shared <code>BrowserSignIn</code> instance, passing the current token for session revocation. 
   After a successful logout, we remove the credential from secure storage. 
 

<p>This ensures the user’s session is entirely revoked and cleared from the app and Okta’s backend.</p>

 Add handling for OAuth 2.0 and OIDC tokens and the authenticated session 

<p>Once we’ve set up authentication flows, we must handle token management and session state. This step ensures that your app knows when the user is authenticated, how to access their tokens, and how to refresh tokens when needed.</p>

<p>The protocol requires implementing two computed variables and three functions to help us manage the tokens and the session.</p>

<p>Add the following code in the implementation of the <code>AuthService</code> class right above the <code>signIn</code> method:</p>

   <code>var isAuthenticated: Bool {
  return Credential.default != nil
}
</code>   
<p>Let’s go through the code.</p>

<p>The <code>isAuthenticated</code> computed property checks whether there’s a valid token stored in the app:</p>
 
   It uses <code>Credential.default</code>, a singleton that securely stores the user’s tokens. 
   If a valid token exists, the user is considered authenticated; otherwise, they are not. 
 

<p>Next, we’ll add the second helper computed property, which we will use to retrieve the user’s ID token. In the <code>AuthService</code> class, under the <code>isAuthenticated</code> property, add the following code:</p>

   <code>var idToken: String? {
  return Credential.default?.token.idToken?.rawValue
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>idToken</code> property retrieves the raw value of the ID token from the stored credential:</p>
 
   The ID token is a signed JSON Web Token (JWT) containing user identity information, such as the user’s email, name, and subject (<code>sub</code>). 
 

<p>We successfully implemented the computed properties required by the protocol. Next, we’ll add the implementation for the three helper functions.</p>

<p>Tokens always expire, which means that at some point, they are no longer valid, and we must refresh them. Lucky, Okta’s SDK provides us with a solution for this need. We can leverage the refresh function, which is part of the <code>Credential</code> object.</p>

<p>Inside the <code>AuthService</code> class, right after the <code>signOut</code> method, add the <code>refreshTokenIfNeeded()</code> function:</p>

   <code>func refreshTokenIfNeeded() async throws {
  guard let credential = Credential.default else { return }
  try await credential.refresh()
}
</code>   
<p>The <code>refreshTokenIfNeeded</code> method ensures that tokens are up-to-date by attempting a token refresh when necessary:</p>
 
   It calls the <code>Credential.refresh()</code> method, which uses the refresh token (if available) to get a new access token and ID token. 
   This helps avoid token expiration issues that could interrupt the user’s session. 
 

<p>At this point, we’ll add an empty implementation to the other two functions, which will help us get some information about the token and the user. In our case, we will present some data on the screen. Add the following code after the <code>refreshTokenIfneeded()</code> function:</p>

   <code>func tokenInfo() -&gt; TokenInfo? {
  return nil
}
    
func userInfo() async throws -&gt; UserInfo? {
  return nil
}
</code>   

<p>With this added, we resolved the errors we saw in <code>AuthService</code>, and you’ll be able to build the project successfully.</p>

 Use the auth service in your Swift app 

<p>Now that we’ve built the <code>AuthService</code> to handle sign in, sign out, token management, and user info retrieval, let’s see how to integrate it into your app’s UI.</p>

 Use <code>AuthService</code> in your views 

<p>Since this app is about authentication, rename the auto-generated view <code>ContentView</code> to <code>AuthView</code> and rename the file to match. Don’t forget to rename all the existing and auto-generated references to <code>ContentView</code> and use <code>AuthView</code> instead.</p>

<p>Next, in the same folder as the <code>AuthView</code>, we will create the <code>AuthViewModel</code>. The <code>AuthViewModel</code> handles all user actions and authentication:</p>

   <code>import Foundation
import Observation
import BrowserSignin

@Observable
final class AuthViewModel {
    // MARK: - Dependencies
    
    /// This is the service that handles all the sign-in, sign-out, token, and user info logic.
    private let authService: AuthServiceProtocol

    // MARK: - UI State Properties

    /// True if the user is currently logged in.
    var isAuthenticated: Bool = false
    
    /// The user's ID token (used for secure backend communication).
    var idToken: String?
    
    /// Shows a loading spinner while something is happening in the background.
    var isLoading: Bool = false
    
    /// If something goes wrong (e.g., login fails), the error message will show in the UI.
    var errorMessage: String?
    
    /// This holds a message returned from the resources server.
    var serverMessage: String?

    // MARK: - Initialization

    
    /// Create the view model and immediately update the UI with the current authentication status.
    init(authService: AuthServiceProtocol = AuthService()) {
        self.authService = authService
        updateUI()
    }
    
    // MARK: - UI State Management

    /// Updates the `isAuthenticated` and `idToken` values from the authentication service.
    func updateUI() {
        isAuthenticated = authService.isAuthenticated
        idToken = authService.idToken
    }
    
    // MARK: - Authentication
    
    /// Called when the user taps the "Sign In" or "Sign Out" button.
    /// Signs the user in or out, updates the UI, and handles any errors.
    @MainActor
    func handleAuthAction() async {
        setLoading(true)
        defer { setLoading(false) }

        do {
            if isAuthenticated {
                // User is signed in → sign them out
                try await authService.signOut()
            } else {
                // User is signed out → sign them in
                try await authService.signIn()
            }
            updateUI()
        } catch {
            errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
        }
    }
    
    // MARK: - Token Handling
    
    /// Refreshes the user's token if it's about to expire.
    /// Keeps the user logged in longer without needing to manually sign in again.
    @MainActor
    func refreshToken() async {
        setLoading(true)
        defer { setLoading(false) }

        do {
            try await authService.refreshTokenIfNeeded()
            updateUI()
        } catch {
            errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
        }
    }
    
    // MARK: - User Info
    
    /// Requests user information (like name, email, etc.) from the authentication service.
    @MainActor
    func fetchUserInfo() async -&gt; UserInfo? {
        do {
            let userInfo = try await authService.userInfo()
            return userInfo
        } catch {
            errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
            return nil
        }
    }

    // MARK: - Token Info

    /// Retrieves token metadata like expiry time or claims.
    /// Returns nil if no token is available.
    func fetchTokenInfo() -&gt; TokenInfo? {
        guard let tokenInfo = authService.tokenInfo() else { return nil }
        return tokenInfo
    }

    // MARK: - Helpers
    
    /// Sets the loading state (used to show/hide a spinner in the UI).
    private func setLoading(_ value: Bool) {
        isLoading = value
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Next, we must extend the <code>AuthView</code> to use the view model and all the properties and functions we added. This view will change depending on whether the user is authenticated and will incorporate displaying the ID token and a button to refresh the token. Open <code>AuthView.swift</code> and replace the code with the following.</p>

   <code>import SwiftUI
import BrowserSignin

/// The main authentication screen that shows the current login state,
/// allows the user to sign in or out, and access token/user info and server message.
struct AuthView: View {
    // View model manages all auth logic and state
    @State private var viewModel = AuthViewModel()

    // Presentation control flags for full-screen modals
    @State private var showTokenInfo = false
    
    // Holds the fetched user info data when available
    // And presents the UserInfoView when assigned value
    @State private var userInfo: UserInfoModel?

    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 20) {
            statusSection
            tokenSection
            authButton
            if viewModel.isAuthenticated {
                refreshTokenButton
            }
            if viewModel.isLoading {
                ProgressView()
            }
        }
        .padding()
        .onAppear {
            // Sync UI state on view load
            viewModel.updateUI()
        }
        .alert("Error", isPresented: .constant(viewModel.errorMessage != nil)) {
            Button("OK", role: .cancel) {
                viewModel.errorMessage = nil
            }
        } message: {
            // Show error message if available
            if let message = viewModel.errorMessage {
                Text(message)
            }
        }
    }
}

private extension AuthView {
    /// Displays "Logged In" or "Logged Out" depending on current state.
    var statusSection: some View {
        Text(viewModel.isAuthenticated ? "✅ Logged In" : "🔒 Logged Out")
            .font(.system(size: 24, weight: .medium))
            .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
    }

    /// Shows the user's ID token in small text (only when authenticated).
    var tokenSection: some View {
        Group {
            if let token = viewModel.idToken, viewModel.isAuthenticated {
                Text("ID Token:\n\(token)")
                    .font(.system(size: 12))
                    .multilineTextAlignment(.center)
            }
        }
    }

    /// Main login/logout button. Text and action change based on login state.
    var authButton: some View {
        Button(viewModel.isAuthenticated ? "Sign Out" : "Sign In") {
            Task { await viewModel.handleAuthAction() }
        }
        .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
        .disabled(viewModel.isLoading)
    }

    /// Opens the full-screen view showing token info.
    var refreshTokenButton: some View {
        Button("🔄 Refresh Token") {
            Task { await viewModel.refreshToken() }
        }
        .font(.system(size: 14))
        .disabled(viewModel.isLoading)
    }
}

struct UserInfoModel: Identifiable {
    let id = UUID()
    let user: UserInfo
}
</code>   

<p>With this in place, you can run the application and test the authentication. Currently, we are not using the <code>TokenInfo</code> and the <code>UserInfo</code> from the <code>ViewModel</code> because we will expand the view in the next section.</p>

 Read token info 

<p>After successfully authenticating a user, it’s helpful to extract meaningful details from the ID token and present them in a user-friendly format. For this purpose, we created a <code>TokenInfo</code> model in the previous sections. It will be initialized from the ID token and includes a <code>toString()</code> function to generate a nicely formatted description of the token data for display in the UI.</p>

<p>Open <code>TokenInfo.swift</code> and add the code shown.</p>

   <code>import Foundation
import BrowserSignin

struct TokenInfo {
    var idToken: String
    var tokenIssuer: String
    var preferredUsername: String
    var authTime: String?
    var issuedAt: String?
    
    init?(idToken: JWT) {
        guard let idToken = Credential.default?.token.idToken else {
            return nil
        }
        
        self.idToken = idToken.rawValue
        self.tokenIssuer = idToken.issuer ?? "No Issuer found"
        self.preferredUsername = idToken.preferredUsername ?? "No preferred_username found"
        
        let formatter = DateFormatter()
        formatter.dateStyle = .medium
        formatter.timeStyle = .medium
        
        if let authTime = idToken.authTime {
            self.authTime = formatter.string(from: authTime)
        }
        
        if let issuedAt = idToken.issuedAt {
            self.issuedAt = formatter.string(from: issuedAt)
        }
    }
    
    func toString() -&gt; String {
        var result = ""
     
        result.append("ID Token: \(idToken)")
        result.append("\n")
        result.append("Preffered username: \(preferredUsername)")
        result.append("\n")
        result.append("Token Issuer: \(tokenIssuer)")
        result.append("\n")
        if let authTime {
            result.append("Auth time: \(authTime)")
            result.append("\n")
        }
        
        if let issuedAt {
            result.append("Issued at: \(issuedAt)")
            result.append("\n")
        }

        return result
    }
}
</code>   

<p>In the previous sections, we introduced two methods for fetching information about the token and the authenticated user. However, we left their implementation empty. It’s now time to implement those functions, and we will start by implementing the <code>tokenInfo()</code> function.</p>

<p>Navigate to your <code>AuthService</code> class and in there find the <code>tokenInfo()</code> function, which should look something like this:</p>

   <code>func tokenInfo() -&gt; TokenInfo? {
  return nil
}
</code>   

<p>To initialize our TokenInfo modal view, we need the ID token. Okta’s Swift SDK lets us fetch the ID token directly from the <code>Credential.default</code>. Remove the <code>return nil</code> from the function implementation and add the following code:</p>

   <code>func tokenInfo() -&gt; TokenInfo? {
  guard let idToken = Credential.default?.token.idToken else {
    return nil
  }
      
  return TokenInfo(idToken: idToken)
}
</code>   

<p>This implementation extracts the ID token from the default Credential and tries to instantiate the <code>TokenInfo</code> object.</p>

<p>Next, we must implement the second empty function introduced in the previous sections, <code>userInfo()</code>. We’ll use the SDK’s <code>UserInfo</code> model to pass the data around. Replace the existing implementation of <code>userInfo()</code> with the code shown.</p>

   <code>func userInfo() async throws -&gt; UserInfo? {
  if let userInfo = Credential.default?.userInfo {
    return userInfo
  } else {
    do {
      guard let userInfo = try await Credential.default?.userInfo() else {
        return nil
      }
      return userInfo
    } catch {
      return nil
    }
  }
}
</code>   
<p>If your Okta setup includes them, you could extend this method to extract more claims, such as email, given name, family name, or custom claims.</p>

<p>With this code in place, we need to display the information to the user somehow in the UI. First, we’ll create a <code>TokenInfoView</code> to display all the information we fetched previously. Create a new Swift file in the root folder of your application and name it <code>TokenInfoView.swift</code>. After creating the file, add the following code:</p>

   <code>import SwiftUI

struct TokenInfoView: View {
  let tokenInfo: TokenInfo
  @Environment(\.dismiss) var dismiss

  var body: some View {
    ScrollView {
      VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 20) {
        Button {
          dismiss()
        } label: {
            Image(systemName: "xmark.circle.fill")
            .resizable()
            .foregroundStyle(.black)
            .frame(width: 40, height: 40)
            .padding(.leading, 10)
          }
                
          Text(tokenInfo.toString())
          .font(.system(.body, design: .monospaced))
          .padding()
          .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)
      }
         
    }
    .background(Color(.systemGroupedBackground))
    .navigationTitle("Token Info")
    .navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.inline)
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Proceed with adding one more Swift file named <code>UserInfoView.swift</code>. This view displays previously fetched information about the User. In your newly created file, add the following code:</p>

   <code>import SwiftUI
import BrowserSignin

struct UserInfoView: View {
  let userInfo: UserInfo
  @Environment(\.dismiss) var dismiss
    
  var body: some View {
    ScrollView {
      VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 20) {
        Button {
          dismiss()
        } label: {
            Image(systemName: "xmark.circle.fill")
              .resizable()
              .foregroundStyle(.black)
              .frame(width: 40, height: 40)
              .padding(.leading, 10)
          }
                
        Text(formattedData)
          .font(.system(size: 14))
          .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)
          .padding()
      }
    }
      .background(Color(.systemBackground))
      .navigationTitle("User Info")
      .navigationBarTitleDisplayMode(.inline)
  }
    
  private var formattedData: String {
    var result = ""
     
    result.append("Name: " + (userInfo.name ?? "No Name set"))
    result.append("\n")
    result.append("Username: " + (userInfo.preferredUsername ?? "No Username set"))
    result.append("\n")
    if let updatedAt = userInfo.updatedAt {
      let dateFormatter = DateFormatter()
      dateFormatter.dateStyle = .medium
      dateFormatter.timeStyle = .short
      let date = dateFormatter.string(for: updatedAt)
        result.append("Updated at: " + (date ?? ""))
      }

      return result
    }
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, we need to add some actions to the <code>AuthView</code> to see the views we just created. In the <code>AuthView</code> class at the end of the file, you will find the private extension that we previously defined. After the <code>refreshTokenButton</code> in the private extension of <code>AuthView</code>, add the following buttons:</p>

   <code>/// Opens the full-screen view showing token info.
var tokenInfoButton: some View {
  Button {
    showTokenInfo = true
  } label: {
      Image(systemName: "info.circle")
        .foregroundColor(.blue)
    }
    .disabled(viewModel.isLoading)
  }

  /// Loads user info and presents it full screen.
  var userInfoButton: some View {
    Button("👤 User Info") {
      Task {
        if let user = await viewModel.fetchUserInfo() {
          await MainActor.run {
            userInfo = UserInfoModel(user: user)
          }
        }
      }
    }
    .font(.system(size: 14))
    .disabled(viewModel.isLoading)
}
</code>   

<p>Now that we have the buttons implemented, we need to add them to the <code>body</code> of <code>AuthView</code> so that the user can see them and click them. Scroll to the top of the file and find <code>struct AuthView:View</code>. Add both buttons right after <code>refreshTokenButton</code>, and then the <code>VStack</code> in your body should look like this:</p>

   <code>VStack(spacing: 20) {
  statusSection
  tokenSection
  authButton
  if viewModel.isAuthenticated {
    refreshTokenButton
    tokenInfoButton // tokenInfoButton added here
    userInfoButton // userInfoButton added here
  }
  
  if viewModel.isLoading {
    ProgressView()
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Within the definition for <code>body</code>, we need to call two view modifiers to be able to see the TokenInfoView and UserInfoView. You’ll add the following code right after the closing brace of the <code>message: {}</code> property:</p>

   <code>// Show Token Info full screen
.fullScreenCover(isPresented: $showTokenInfo) {
  if let tokenInfo = viewModel.fetchTokenInfo() {
    TokenInfoView(tokenInfo: tokenInfo)
  }
}
// Show User Info full screen   
.fullScreenCover(item: $userInfo) { info in
  UserInfoView(userInfo: info.user)
}
</code>   

<p>Now, if you run the application, you should be able to click on the Info button to get the token information and the User Info button to get the user information.</p>

<p>And there you have it! 🎉 We built a sample app from scratch using Okta’s new Swift SDK and the <code>BrowserSignin</code> module to show the authenticated user’s ID claims. By following these steps, you’ve learned how to:</p>

 
   ✅ Configure Okta and set up your application 
   ✅ Implement a robust AuthService to handle login, logout, and token management 
   ✅ Build a SwiftUI interface that displays user info and handles authentication flows seamlessly 
 

<p>With just a few lines of code, you have a fully functional, secure login flow integrated into your iOS app – no more OAuth headaches or token handling nightmares.</p>

<p>Authentication is the first step in an app, but we want to display data from a backend resource securely.</p>

 Add backend authorization using a custom resource server 

<p>If you want to go beyond authentication and add authorization checks for your APIs, we can experiment using Okta’s Node.js Resource Server example as a starting point.</p>

<p>Here’s how to connect your iOS app to a backend that validates access tokens:</p>

 Set up a customer resource server for your mobile app 

<p>Clone the example Node.js resource server:</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/okta/samples-nodejs-express-4.git
cd samples-nodejs-express-4
npm ci
</code>   

<p>Open the project in an IDE like Visual Studio Code. I like Visual Studio Code because it has a built-in terminal, but you can make the required code changes directly to the file. Open <code>resource-server/server.js</code>. Look for the configuration block where <code>oktaJwtVerifier</code> is initialized. Update it like this:</p>

   <code>const oktaJwtVerifier = new OktaJwtVerifier({
  issuer: '/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{yourClientID}',
});
</code>   

<p>Replace the <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> with your Okta org domain, and replace the <code>{yourClientID}</code> with the client ID of your iOS project.</p>

<p>Serve the resource server by running the following command in the terminal.</p>

   <code>npm run resource-server
</code>   

<p>You should see your server running locally at: http://localhost:8000/</p>

<p>This server will validate incoming access tokens and respond with two messages if the token is valid:</p>

   <code>{
   "messages":[
      {
         "date":"2025-07-03T19:06:59.799Z",
         "text":"I am a robot."
      },
      {
         "date":"2025-07-03T18:06:59.799Z",
         "text":"Hello, world!"
      }
   ]
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s create the model conforming to this payload.</p>

<p>Create a file named <code>MessagesResponse.swift</code> in the <code>Auth/Models</code> folder and add the code.</p>

   <code>import Foundation

struct MessageResponse: Codable {
   let messages: [Message]
}

struct Message: Codable {
   let date: String
   let text: String
}
</code>   

 Make authorized API requests from your iOS app 

<p>To call the resource server API from our iOS code, we must first implement a function inside our <code>AuthService</code> to fetch messages.</p>

<p>Open the <code>AuthService</code> file and add one more function at the end of the <code>AuthServiceProtocol</code>:</p>

   <code>protocol AuthServiceProtocol {
  var isAuthenticated: Bool { get }
  var idToken: String? { get }
  
  func tokenInfo() -&gt; TokenInfo?
  func userInfo() async throws -&gt; UserInfo?
  func signIn() async throws
  func signOut() async throws
  func refreshTokenIfNeeded() async throws
  func fetchMessageFromBackend() async throws -&gt; String // added
}
</code>   

<p>Because we introduced a new function to the protocol, it requires an implementation. In the <code>AuthService</code> class, immediately after the implementation of <code>userInfo()</code>, add the following code:</p>

   <code>@MainActor
func fetchMessageFromBackend() async throws -&gt; String {
  guard let credential = Credential.default else {
      return "Not authenticated."
  }

  var request = URLRequest(url: URL(string: "http://localhost:8000/api/messages")!)
  request.httpMethod = "GET"

  await credential.authorize(&amp;request)

  let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(for: request)
  let decoder = JSONDecoder()
  let response = try decoder.decode(MessageResponse.self, from: data)
  if let randomMessage = response.messages.randomElement() {
      return "\(randomMessage.text)"
  } else {
      return "No messages found."
  }
}
</code>   

<p>With this, you will get an error message that some classes aren’t found. That’s because we must <code>import Foundation</code> into our <code>AuthService.swift</code> file just below <code>import BrowserSignIn</code>.</p>

   <code>import BrowserSignin
import Foundation // added
</code>   

<p>Okta’s iOS SDK provides a handy method for automatically adding your access token as an Authorization header on a URL request.</p>

<p>We need to go back to the <code>AuthViewModel</code> and add a function to call <code>fetchMessageFromBackend()</code> and set the server message to our <code>serverMessage</code> property of the <code>viewModel</code>. Add the following code right after <code>fetchTokenInfo()</code>:</p>

   <code>// MARK: - Server Messages

/// Asks the backend for a message and saves it for display in the UI.
@MainActor
func fetchMessage() async {
  setLoading(true)
  defer { setLoading(false) }
  
  do {
    let message = try await authService.fetchMessageFromBackend()
    serverMessage = message
  } catch {
    errorMessage = error.localizedDescription
  }
}
</code>   

<p>We need to extend the <code>AuthView</code> to use this function and show the fetched server message as an alert to the user. For this purpose, go to the <code>AuthView</code> file and in the extension just below the <code>userInfoButton</code>, we will add one more button like this:</p>

   <code>/// Requests a message from the backend and shows it in the UI.
var getMessageButton: some View {
  Button("🎁 Get Message") {
    Task {
        await viewModel.fetchMessage()
        
    }
  }
  .font(.system(size: 14))
  .disabled(viewModel.isLoading)
}
</code>   

<p>Next, we need to present this button to the view. In the <code>body</code>of <code>AuthView</code>, let’s add <code>getMessageButton</code> and the body will look like this:</p>

   <code>VStack(spacing: 20) {
  statusSection
  tokenSection
  authButton
  if viewModel.isAuthenticated {
    refreshTokenButton
    tokenInfoButton
    userInfoButton
      getMessageButton // getMessageButton added here
  }
  if viewModel.isLoading {
    ProgressView()
  }
}
</code>   

<p>Lastly, we’ll alert the user with the message contents received from our backend if the authentication is successful. To do so, we need to add the <code>.alert</code> view modifier to the body of <code>AuthView</code> after the final <code>fullScreenCover</code> closing bracket, like this:</p>

   <code>// Show Alert with the fetched message
.alert("Message Response", isPresented: .constant(viewModel.serverMessage != nil)) {
    Button("OK", role: .cancel) {
        viewModel.serverMessage = nil
    }
} message: {
    // Show message if available
    if let message = viewModel.serverMessage {
        Text(message)
    }
}
</code>   

<p>With all this in place, you’ll see a message alert when pressing the Get Messages button.</p>

<p>This is the recommended approach for securely connecting your mobile app to backend APIs using OAuth 2.0 and JWT validation. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-swift-mfa-redirect-example">completed project in a GitHub repo</a>.</p>

<p>🎉 And that’s it! Your iOS app now has authentication and calls a backend API with the access token for fully integrated authorization verification.</p>

<p>Facial recognition technology has become increasingly common in our daily lives. From unlocking phones to airport security, it is changing the way we identify and <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-biometric-playground/">verify people</a>. This technology uses advanced software to analyze facial features and match them with existing databases, making many tasks faster and more secure.</p>
<p>While facial recognition offers convenience and improved safety, it also comes with challenges. Privacy concerns, accuracy issues, and ethical questions are important factors to consider before adopting this technology. Understanding the advantages and disadvantages of facial recognition can help businesses and individuals make informed choices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is Facial Recognition Technology? 
<p><a href="https://recognito.vision/face-recognition-sdk/">Facial recognition technology</a> is a type of software that identifies or verifies a person by analyzing their facial features. Cameras with facial recognition capture images or video of faces. The software then compares these images to a database to identify a match.</p>
<p>It is widely used in security, banking, law enforcement, and even marketing. While it offers convenience, it also raises concerns about privacy and accuracy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Advantages of Facial Recognition Technology 
<p>Facial recognition technology offers several important benefits. Here are some of the key advantages:</p>
 1. Enhanced Security 
<p>One of the main advantages of facial recognition is improved security. It can identify individuals in crowded places, detect unauthorized access, and prevent fraud. For businesses, this technology can help protect sensitive areas.</p>
 
 Banks use facial recognition to verify clients for online transactions. 
 Airports and government buildings use it to control access and ensure safety. 
 
<p>By providing a layer of security beyond passwords or ID cards, facial recognition technology reduces the risk of theft and unauthorized entry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Convenience and Speed 
<p>Facial recognition can make daily tasks faster and easier. Unlike traditional authentication methods, it does not require remembering passwords or carrying cards.</p>
 
 Phones and laptops can be unlocked instantly. 
 Airports can speed up boarding with automated facial scans. 
 Offices can track attendance without manual checks. 
 
<p>This convenience saves time for both individuals and organizations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. Contactless Identification 
<p>In the era of health concerns and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">pandemics</a>, contactless systems have become essential. Facial recognition is a non-intrusive, touch-free technology. It reduces the need for physical contact, which is safer in public spaces and healthcare environments.</p>
<p>This feature makes it ideal for hospitals, banks, airports, and retail stores.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Law Enforcement and Public Safety 
<p>Facial recognition technology can assist law enforcement agencies in tracking and identifying suspects. It is useful for finding missing persons, preventing crimes, and investigating incidents.</p>
<p>Cameras with facial recognition can scan crowds in real time, alerting authorities to potential threats.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. Integration with Other Systems 
<p>Facial recognition can work with other technologies, such as security cameras, mobile apps, and access control systems. This integration allows for smarter solutions. For example, smart home systems can use facial recognition to unlock doors for family members but restrict access to strangers.</p>
<p>Platforms like <a href="https://recognito.vision/">Recognito</a> make it easy to integrate facial recognition into existing systems efficiently.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Disadvantages of Facial Recognition Technology 
<p>Despite its advantages, facial recognition technology has limitations and potential risks. Here are some of the main disadvantages:</p>
 1. Privacy Concerns 
<p>One of the biggest disadvantages of facial recognition is the potential invasion of privacy. Constant surveillance can make people feel watched and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Data collected through facial recognition can be misused if not properly secured. Some governments and companies have faced criticism for using this technology without consent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 2. Risk of Misidentification 
<p>Facial recognition is not 100% accurate. Lighting, camera quality, facial expressions, and changes in appearance can affect results. Misidentification can lead to wrongful accusations or denied access.</p>
<p>This is a serious concern, especially in law enforcement and security applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 3. High Costs 
<p>Facial recognition requires good cameras, software, and secure storage, which can be expensive. Maintenance and upgrades also add to the cost. Tools like Recognito offer cost-effective solutions, making it easier for businesses to adopt without overspending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 4. Ethical and Legal Issues 
<p>Facial recognition raises ethical questions. How and where should the technology be used? What limits should be set? Different countries have different laws regarding the use of facial recognition, making compliance challenging.</p>
<p>Improper use could lead to legal penalties or public backlash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 5. Potential for Bias 
<p>Some facial recognition systems have shown bias against certain ethnic groups or genders. This can result in unfair treatment, especially in hiring processes, law enforcement, or financial services.</p>
<p>Developers are working to reduce bias, but it remains a concern.</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Balancing the Pros and Cons 
<p>When considering this technology, it is essential to carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of facial recognition. For example, businesses may benefit from enhanced security and convenience. However, they must also address privacy, accuracy, and ethical concerns.</p>
<p>Public awareness, transparency, and regulations play a key role in ensuring facial recognition is used responsibly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 The Future of Facial Recognition 
<p>Facial recognition technology continues to evolve. Advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning are improving accuracy and reducing bias. We are likely to see more industries adopt this technology for secure, efficient, and contactless operations.</p>
<p>However, its future will also depend on legal frameworks and public acceptance. Companies must use it responsibly and prioritize the protection of user data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>The advantages and disadvantages of facial recognition highlight both its strengths and limitations. Facial recognition technology offers many advantages, including better security, convenience, and integration with modern systems. At the same time, it comes with risks such as privacy concerns, misidentification, and ethical challenges.</p>

				  Indicio Proven adds Digital Passport Credentials aligned to ICAO DTC-2 Specifications  
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>SEATTLE / AUGUST 19, 2025 — Governments are now able to issue Digital Passport Credentials directly to their citizens using Indicio Proven. These credentials align with the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) specifications for Digital Travel Credentials (DTC-2) that are government issued.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio developed and successfully deployed the world’s first Digital Passport Credential which involved travelers deriving a Verifiable Credential from the electronic chip in their passport and combining it with face-mapping, liveness check, and document validation. This Digital Passport Credential aligned with ICAO DTC-1 specifications and allowed for preauthorized travel and seamless border crossing. </p>
<p>By combining authenticated biometrics in Verifiable Credentials, Indicio transformed portable digital identity and provided a simple way to mitigate the growing risks of biometric and AI-identity fraud. In recognition, Acuity Market Intelligence’s 2024 Prism Report described Indicio’s solution as “masterful.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio has now developed the next step in “government-grade” digital identity technology —&nbsp;Digital Passport Credentials that are issued directly by governments to accompany physical passports. These credentials follow the DTC-2 specifications outlined by ICAO.</p>
<p>A traveler is now able to carry a cryptographically secure digital passport on their smartphone, smartwatch, or fob linked to their existing physical passport. This can be instantly verified with simple software when crossing borders or presented anywhere across the travel ecosystem, including bookings, check-in, boarding, and hotel arrival.</p>
<p>“Our mission is to create digital identities that make life easier, safer, and more streamlined for everyone,” said Heather Dahl, CEO of Indicio. “We’ve&nbsp; shown how easy it is to create privacy-preserving, government-grade digital identity. We’ve shown the kinds of transformation this can achieve — the benefits to airlines, airports, and travelers that follow from having a fast and reliable way to streamline identity authentication. Now, we’re making it easy for governments to issue interoperable Digital Passport Credentials, secure borders, and welcome tourists.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio Proven is the world’s most advanced system for creating and deploying decentralized identity and Verifiable Credentials in interoperable workflows. It allows users to select from SD-JWT VC, AnonCreds, and mdoc/mDL credential types, customizable schemas, mobile SDK for Android and IoS, a white-label digital wallet, field-leading mediation to handle issuance and verification at any scale, and a global ledger network to support deployments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Digital Passport Credentials, Indicio Proven’s Issuer software is easy to implement into existing systems and combine with biometric infrastructure and vendors. Verifier software is available in server or mobile configurations. Implementation is rapid, scale is simple, and compliance with data protection easy. Above all, Indicio Proven provides highly cost-effective ways to create both enterprise and public sector digital infrastructure that meets current and evolving business, consumer, and traveler needs.</p>

			 Tokeny–recently acquired by leading global financial services provider Apex Group–is set to tokenize two of SkyBridge’s funds on the Avalanche blockchain network. 
<p>NEW YORK, 19th August 2025 – <a href="https://www.skybridge.com/">Skybridge Capital</a> today announced it will tokenize $300 million of its flagship hedge funds on the <a href="https://www.avax.network/">Avalanche</a> blockchain network. This landmark initiative represents a collaboration with enterprise-grade tokenization leader <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a> and its parent company, <a href="https://www.apexgroup.com/">Apex Group Ltd.</a>, a global financial services provider servicing over $3.5 trillion in assets.</p>

		 
	 
    Tokenizing our funds on Avalanche, supported by the technology and operational infrastructure of Tokeny and Apex Group, represents a significant step forward in modernizing the alternative<br>
investment landscape. We look forward to bringing our hedge funds into the digital, on-chain era, improving transparency, liquidity, and accessibility for our investors, and demonstrating how traditional finance and blockchain can work together to create smarter, more efficient investment solutions.  Anthony ScaramucciFounder &amp; CEO of SkyBridge Capital    
	 
		 
			<p>A former Goldman Sachs executive and White House Communications Director, Scaramucci has long been a prominent voice in alternatives and digital assets, with deep networks across pensions, sovereign wealth funds, and family offices.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, SkyBridge will tokenize its Digital Macro Master Fund Ltd and Legion Strategies Ltd leveraging the proven ERC-3643 standard with operational infrastructure delivered through Apex Group’s Digital 3.0 platform. The platform offers a single-source solution for the entire investment lifecycle, enabling institutional clients to seamlessly transition their funds to blockchain-based rails with integrated capabilities for creation, issuance, administration, and distribution.</p>

		 
	 
    This milestone shows how Apex Group and Tokeny are breaking down the operational and technology barriers that have historically slowed institutional tokenization. SkyBridge’s tokenization on Avalanche proves that with the right technology, trusted operators, and regulatory clarity, tokenization at scale is not just possible, it’s happening.  Daniel CoheurGlobal Head of Digital Assets at Apex Group and Co-Founder of Tokeny    
	 
		 
			<p>Avalanche was selected for its institutional-grade architecture, offering the transaction speed and near-instant finality required for large-scale tokenization. As a leading blockchain for real-world assets (RWAs), Avalanche’s rapidly expanding institutional ecosystem already hosts regulated offerings in tokenized money market funds, private credit, and more. The network’s EVM compatibility and scalability make it an ideal foundation for bringing traditional assets on chain to unlock new distribution channels, utility, and blockchain-naive products and services.</p>

		 
	 
    Our work with Tokeny, Apex Group, and SkyBridge marks a pivotal moment for institutional adoption and serves as a powerful market signal that tokenization has entered the mainstream. SkyBridge Capital’s leadership and network within the allocator community makes this a strong validation of Avalanche's position as the premier platform for connecting capital.  John WuPresident of Ava Labs.    
	 
		 
			<p>This collaboration brings together next-generation technology, enterprise-grade infrastructure, and institutional credibility, a critical combination for accelerating the adoption of RWAs across hedge funds, private credit, and multi-strategy vehicles.</p>

<p>If you’ve wondered what working group chair skills actually matter, I have news for you: you don’t need to be a spec-writing wizard to be effective.</p>



<p>I do get it, though. I chair working groups, and I still can’t read specs the way implementers do. Half the time I open a technical specification, my eyes glaze over after the abstract. I couldn’t code myself out of a wet paper bag. (Unless that wet paper bag happens to include m4 and sendmail rulesets. Those, I can do.)</p>



<p>That said, if you take nothing else away from this post, take this and embed it in your brain: you don’t have to be a spec-writing wizard to be an effective contributor, or even to chair a working group.</p>



<p>In fact, some of the most valuable skills in standards work have nothing to do with writing code.</p>

 What a chair actually does (and doesn’t do) 



<p>There’s a misconception that working group chairs must be the ultimate subject-matter experts, the kind of person who can answer any question off the cuff. I used to believe that too. *buzzer sound* Wrong, try again! The job is about facilitation and neutrality, not encyclopedic knowledge.</p>



<p>A good chair brings the right working group chair skills to the table:</p>



 
 Manages time, the agenda, and the meeting queue. 



 Keeps the room neutral and separates their “chair hat” from their personal opinions. 



 Tests for consensus and documents objections. 



 Guides the group back to its charter when things start to sprawl. 
 



<p>What a chair doesn’t do:</p>



 
 Decide the technical design. 



 “Win” arguments on the mic. 



 Gatekeep new contributors. 
 



<p>Yes, a baseline of knowledge helps, mainly to keep the group on track and ask the right questions. But if you’re the loudest voice in the room or the person with the most opinions? That’s a red flag.</p>



 The Madrid moment 



<p>This post was inspired by a moment at the recent IETF meeting in Madrid.</p>



<p>I was sitting in a session (not one I was running) feeling wildly inadequate. The chair of that meeting seemed to know everything: answering questions without pause, bouncing ideas around, and generally radiating expertise. I thought, I can’t do that. I’ll never be that person.</p>



<p>Later, I mentioned my self-doubt to a friend who’s been in standards work since Gandalf was a baby (i.e., a very long time). They said something that stuck:</p>

<p>“That kind of deep subject-matter expertise isn’t what makes a good chair. The job is to be neutral, help the group come to consensus, and keep the process fair. If you’re too invested in the outcome, you can’t do that well.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And they were right. In a session I chaired the next day, I reminded myself of that. Instead of getting pulled into the details, I paused, restated the questions we were debating, and asked for commitments to review from experts in the room. We left the meeting with clear decisions and action owners. Go, team!</p>



<p>No wizard-level technical knowledge required.</p>



 Where non‑coders shine 



<p>Even if you’re not a chair, these are the same skills that make you a great contributor and help you develop working group chair skills if you want to take that step later. Non‑coders are often the ones who:</p>



 
 Turn pain points into crisp user stories. “We need X because Y breaks if we don’t.” 



 Write readable summaries for product managers, lawyers, and execs. 



 Triage issues on GitHub—label them, close duplicates, line up proposals for meetings. 



 Spot interoperability gaps. Help set up test plans, track what passes/fails, and document blockers. 



 Herd the cats. Draft pre-reads, take notes, and make sure decisions actually get written down. 
 



<p>These are the unglamorous but critical pieces that keep work moving forward. Without them, groups stall, meetings get repetitive, and good ideas die in the noise. Groups well and truly need someone brave enough to ask “stupid” questions (that are never actually stupid) about how it all works.</p>



 How to start if you’re “not technical enough” 



<p>If you want to get involved but don’t know where to start, try this:</p>



 
 Read the charter of the group and two or three recent GitHub issues. 



 Introduce yourself on the mailing list with a sentence about what you can help with (e.g., “I’m a PM and can help with use cases or meeting notes”). 



 Volunteer once. Scribe a meeting, write a summary, or draft a use-case doc. 



 Ask the chairs: “What would unblock you this week that doesn’t require coding?” 



 Shadow a consensus call and notice how the chair phrases questions and records outcomes. 
 



<p>These small steps get you known as someone who adds value quickly. That reputation goes a long way.</p>



 For managers: send the right people 



<p>If you lead a team, the worst thing you can do is assume only senior engineers belong in standards groups. You should be sending:</p>



 
 PMs, solution architects, and analysts. 



 Tech writers who can make decisions and docs accessible. 



 Support or operations leads who know what customers actually need. 
 



<p>Give them specific assignments: draft use cases, clean up issues, track interop progress. And measure their impact by outcomes that matter: fewer rehashed meetings, clearer issues, faster consensus.</p>



 Common traps (and how to avoid them) 



<p>Even experienced chairs and contributors stumble into these:</p>



 
 Wearing the company hat too heavily. Remember: your job is to move the group’s work forward. 



 Turning meetings into tutorials. Save deep dives for dedicated docs or issues. 



 Letting the loudest voice set direction. Ask for explicit “can live with it” signals from the room. 



 Treating silence as consent. It usually isn’t. 
 



<p>A simple chair’s checklist helps: agenda posted in advance (see the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/important-dates/">Important Dates</a> page for IETF meetings) → pre‑reads linked → scribe/timekeeper assigned → decisions written down → minutes posted within 48 hours.</p>



 Why this matters 



<p>Standards work touches every part of the identity world—federation, digital credentials, browsers, payments. These decisions shape products and policies your teams will live with for years. I mentioned this a while back in <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/03/11/standards-versus-reality/">Standards Versus Reality</a> with how even well‑intentioned technical choices can clash with deployment realities, which is why diverse voices are so important.</p>



<p>But the process isn’t self-sustaining. If only engineers and spec authors show up, important perspectives get lost. And that hurts interoperability, usability, and deployment.</p>



<p>You don’t need to be the smartest engineer in the room to develop strong working group chair skills. You need to listen, ask questions, and help the group get to a decision.</p>



 Your turn 



<p>If you’ve thought, standards aren’t for me, try showing up once. Scribe a meeting. Draft a use-case doc. Or if you lead a team, send someone who can listen, write, and keep things moving.</p>

 Introduction 



<p>[00:00:26] Let’s get into it.</p>



<p>[00:00:29] Hi everyone, and welcome back to the Digital Identity Digest.</p>



<p>[00:00:33] Today I want to talk about something I hear often from people who are curious about standards work but never take the leap to participate.</p>



<p>[00:00:42] It’s that feeling of “I’m not technical enough. Standards are for engineers, so I’ll just sit this one out.”</p>



<p>[00:00:50] If that’s you, this episode is for you.</p>



<p>[00:00:54] The truth is, standards work is not just for coders. Some of the most important roles in working groups don’t involve writing a single line of code.</p>



 



 *** 



 Why Standards Work Isn’t Just for Engineers 



<p>[00:01:04] I want to pull back the curtain on my own experience as a working group chair. I’ll share:</p>



 
 The skills that actually make standards work successful 



 How non-coders can contribute 



 How to build the confidence to jump in 
 



<p>[00:01:24] Here’s my confession: I chair groups in the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>



<p>[00:01:33] But if you handed me a technical specification to implement — I couldn’t do it. I can’t code my way out of a wet paper bag.</p>



<p>[00:01:42] I can read the text of a specification.<br>[00:01:48] I can follow the arguments and track design decisions.<br>[00:01:53] But I don’t read specs like implementers do.</p>



<p>And that’s okay. Because being a chair is not about being the ultimate expert — it’s about facilitating process, guiding discussion, and keeping the group focused.</p>



 



 *** 



 What a Working Group Chair Actually Does 



<p>[00:02:16] So what does a chair really do?</p>



<p>[00:02:24] On a good day, you’re:</p>



 
 Setting the agenda and keeping discussions on track 



 Managing the queue so everyone knows when it’s their turn 



 Listening carefully and testing for consensus 



 Making sure objections are heard and documented 



 Guiding the group back to its agreed charter 
 



<p>[00:03:06] Importantly, chairs do not decide technical design. They don’t win arguments or gatekeep contributors.</p>



<p>[00:03:14] Yes, technical knowledge helps — but being the loudest, most opinionated person in the room? That’s a liability for a chair.</p>



 



 *** 



 Lessons from Experience 



<p>[00:03:30] This all came to mind recently at an IETF meeting in Madrid.</p>



<p>[00:03:36] I was sitting in a session I wasn’t chairing and felt completely inadequate. The chair was brilliant — answering every question instantly and recalling years of history.</p>



<p>[00:04:06] I shared my self-doubt with a long-time standards veteran. Their advice stuck: A good chair isn’t about deep expertise. It’s about neutrality and guiding consensus.</p>



<p>[00:04:28] The very next day, while chairing my own session, I leaned on that advice. Instead of diving into debate, I paused, restated the question, and asked the group to continue the discussion asynchronously.</p>



<p>[00:05:09] The result? We left the room with clear decisions and owners for next steps.</p>



 



 *** 



 Why Non-Coders Are Essential 



<p>[00:05:19] Here’s the truth: non-coders bring incredible value to standards development.</p>



<p>[00:05:31] Examples include:</p>



 
 Turning pain points into crisp user stories 



 Writing clear summaries for product managers, executives, and legal teams 



 Triage work: labeling GitHub issues, closing duplicates, organizing proposals 



 Spotting interoperability gaps between specifications 



 Setting up test plans and documenting blockers 



 “Herding cats” by taking notes and tracking decisions 
 



<p>[00:06:44] None of these require writing code — but all are vital to progress.</p>



 



 *** 



 How to Get Started in Standards Work 



<p>[00:06:58] If you’re wondering where to begin, here are practical steps:</p>



 
 Read the group’s charter and skim recent issues to understand scope 



 Introduce yourself on the mailing list — even a short message offering to scribe is welcome 



 Ask the chairs directly what one thing you could do this week to help 



 Observe consensus calls to learn how experienced chairs guide groups 
 



<p>[00:08:20] These small steps build confidence and help you learn core chairing skills: listening, documenting, and facilitating decisions.</p>



 



 *** 



 Advice for Managers 



<p>[00:08:31] If you lead a team, don’t assume only senior engineers should join standards groups.</p>



<p>Send your:</p>



 
 Product managers 



 Solution architects 



 Analysts 



 Technical writers 
 



<p>[00:08:56] Give them specific assignments like drafting use cases, cleaning up issues, or tracking interoperability progress. Measure outcomes such as:</p>



 
 Fewer rehash meetings 



 Closed issues and pull requests 



 Documented progress 
 



<p>[00:09:23] This builds institutional knowledge in your organization while helping the group succeed.</p>



 



 *** 



 Common Traps to Avoid 



<p>[00:09:31] Even experienced chairs fall into these traps:</p>



 
 Wearing your company hat too heavily 



 Turning meetings into tutorials that eat time 



 Letting the loudest voice set direction instead of true consensus 



 Treating silence as consent instead of seeking explicit signals 
 



<p>[00:11:04] A simple checklist can help avoid these pitfalls:</p>



 
 Post agendas in advance 



 Share pre-reads 



 Assign a scribe and timekeeper 
 



<p>It’s basic, but it works.</p>



 



 *** 



 Why This Matters 



<p>[00:11:30] Standards work touches every part of digital identity — from federation to credentials, browsers to payments.</p>



<p>[00:11:46] But if only engineers show up, critical perspectives are lost. That hurts usability, interoperability, and adoption.</p>



<p>[00:11:57] You don’t need to be the smartest engineer in the room to contribute. You just need to listen, ask questions, and help the group reach decisions.</p>



 



 *** 



 Final Thoughts 



<p>[00:12:10] If you’ve thought “standards development isn’t for me,” I challenge you to reconsider.</p>



<p>Show up once.<br>Scribe a meeting.<br>Draft a use case.<br>Or, if you lead a team, send someone who can write, listen, and help keep things moving.</p>



<p>[00:12:26] These are the skills that keep standards work healthy.</p>



<p>[00:12:30] So ask yourself: What non-coding skill could you bring into a working group this month?</p>



<p>[00:12:48] Thank you for listening to the Digital Identity Digest.</p>

Trust Crisis in Stablecoins<p>The biggest challenge in scaling stablecoin payments isn’t speed. It’s&nbsp;trust.</p><p>Stablecoins are everywhere. They’re powering remittances, cross-border commerce, crypto payroll, and even merchant checkout systems. From Stripe to Shopify to major exchanges, stablecoin adoption is accelerating.</p><p>But while blockchains have solved the problem of speed and cost, they’ve quietly ignored the biggest bottleneck in real-world use: identity.</p><p>If stablecoins are going to scale globally, across regions, merchants and users, they need more than fast rails. They need a decentralized identity&nbsp;layer.</p> The Problem With Stablecoin Compliance Today <p>Most stable coins weren’t built with compliance in mind. And now that they’re being used in payments, cracks are&nbsp;showing.</p>  Merchants don’t know who they’re accepting money&nbsp;from  Platforms are duct-taping KYC providers into&nbsp;apps  Users go through verification again and&nbsp;again  There’s no standard for crypto KYC that works across wallets, bridges, and&nbsp;dApps  <p>The result? A fragile trust layer built on centralized data silos and repetitive identity checks. The exact same problems crypto was supposed to&nbsp;solve.</p> Stablecoin Payments Need Verifiable Identity, Not Just&nbsp;Wallets. <p>Verifiable Identity is the missing layer in the stablecoin stack.</p><p>As governments push for stablecoin regulation such as MiCA in the EU and the GENIUS Act in the US, platforms are scrambling to become compliant.</p><p>But compliance doesn’t have to mean surveillance.</p><p>With decentralized identity, users can hold their own credentials, verify once, and move between apps and services without repeating KYC. This is the foundation for self-sovereign identity, where users control their data and platforms remain compliant without storing sensitive information.</p> What’s Needed: A Portable, Privacy-First Trust&nbsp;Layer <p>Stablecoin adoption at scale will only happen if three things become possible:</p>  Users prove who they are without exposing everything  Merchants can verify transactions without handling private&nbsp;data  Developers can plug into identity infrastructure that works cross-chain  <p>That’s what Ontology is building. A modular identity and privacy framework that makes stablecoin payments secure, compliant, and user-controlled.</p> Ontology: The Identity Infrastructure for Stablecoin Adoption <p>Unlike issuers, Ontology isn’t creating another dollar-pegged token. We’re building the trust infrastructure that makes stablecoins usable in the real&nbsp;world.</p><p>Here’s what that looks&nbsp;like:</p>  DID-based KYC that users&nbsp;control  Zero Knowledge Proofs to verify facts without revealing data  Reusable identity credentials for wallets, dApps, and fiat&nbsp;on-ramps  Cross-border compliance without centralized trust  <p>This infrastructure goes beyond payments. The next era of Web3 relies on a rebuilding of the crypto identity infrastructure.</p> The Future of Stablecoin Compliance is User-Controlled <p>If stablecoins want to compete with traditional infrastructure, they can’t just be faster. They have to be trusted. And that trust can’t be outsourced to centralized APIs or third party data&nbsp;silos.</p><p>It has to be built into the protocol layer and embedded in how users verify themselves, how dApps authorize transactions, and how compliance gets done in a decentralized world.</p><p>Speed is solved. Identity isn’t. Ontology is solving&nbsp;it.</p> About Ontology <p><a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a> is a high-performance, open-source blockchain specializing in decentralized identity and data infrastructure. Built to power the next generation of Web3 applications, Ontology provides developers with the tools to build secure, privacy-preserving systems through Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials.

<p>Capital markets firms face unique AML challenges across jurisdictions due to their cross-border activity and high-risk products. This article outlines key KYB, KYC, KYT, and AML expectations in the U.S., UK, EU, and other financial centre – and how iComply helps automate compliance workflows with speed and precision.</p>
 
 Global capital markets are fast, fluid, and increasingly regulated. Broker-dealers, custodians, exchanges, and asset managers operate across jurisdictions where expectations for AML, sanctions screening, and beneficial ownership verification continue to grow. 
<p>In high-risk sectors like trading, custody, private placements, and tokenization, regulators want more than just client onboarding—they expect continuous monitoring, automated escalation, and clear audit trails.</p>
 
 AML Frameworks Shaping the Sector 
 United States 
 
 Regulators: SEC, FINRA, FinCEN 
 Requirements: CDD Rule, ongoing customer due diligence, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, sanctions screening (OFAC) 
 
 United Kingdom 
 
 Regulator: FCA 
 Requirements: CDD/EDD, transaction monitoring, PEP screening, audit logs, and AML controls under MLR 2017 
 
 European Union 
 
 Regulators: ESMA, local NCAs 
 Requirements: 6AMLD, MiCA (for tokenized assets), UBO verification, and harmonized AML rules under AMLA (in progress) 
 
 Switzerland &amp; Luxembourg 
 
 Regulators: FINMA, CSSF 
 Requirements: KYC/AML for securities and fund transactions, strong data protection, and beneficial ownership transparency 
 
 
 Key Compliance Tasks 
<p>Capital markets participants must:</p>
 
 Verify legal entities and individuals across onboarding and lifecycle events 
 Monitor transactions for anomalies or regulatory breaches 
 Screen all clients against sanctions, PEP, and adverse media lists 
 Capture beneficial ownership for institutional and private placements 
 Log decisions and escalate based on internal risk policies 
 
 
 Industry-Specific Challenges 
<p>1. Cross-border account flows → Require localized data handling and multilingual tools</p>
<p>2. Institutional onboarding → Often slow due to document-heavy workflows and complex UBO structures</p>
<p>3. Layered due diligence → Multiple parties, custodians, and intermediaries complicate audit trails</p>
<p>4. Tokenized and digital assets → Face rapidly evolving rules under MiCA, AMLD, and SEC guidance</p>
 
 How iComply Accelerates AML for Capital Markets 
<p>iComply provides a secure, modular platform that streamlines compliance from onboarding to monitoring:</p>
 1. KYB + UBO Automation 
 
 Validate entities using public and commercial registries 
 Map complex ownership and nominee structures 
 Generate audit-ready UBO reports 
 
 2. Edge-Based Identity Verification 
 
 Fast, private KYC flows for individuals across global jurisdictions 
 On-device processing for secure and compliant identity checks 
 
 3. Transaction Monitoring (KYT) 
 
 Score trades and transactions by geography, frequency, value, and behavioural anomalies 
 Custom rules for escalations and risk segmentation 
 
 4. Centralized Case Management 
 
 Combine onboarding, AML, and due diligence into a unified audit trail 
 Assign reviews, manage escalations, and export regulatory reports 
 
 5. Flexible Deployment 
 
 On-premise, private cloud, or hybrid environments 
 Data localization and language support for global operations

Launch will be announced when ready, ensuring fairness and transparency to all participants simultaneously.</p><p>출시 일자는 유연하게 설정하여 충분히 준비가 완료된 후에 진행하는 것이 무엇보다 중요합니다. NASA 콜롬비아호 사고 역시 일정 압박이 한 원인이 된 사례로 자주 언급됩니다. HPP는 모든 준비가 철저히 마무리된 시점에, 모든 참여자에게 공정하고 투명하게 동시에 출시 사실을 알리는 방식으로&nbsp;진행됩니다.</p> 4. Are we going to do buybacks? <p>Buybacks are usually done by companies with revenue or exchanges tied to trading volume. HPP is performing strongly compared to the CMC100, even in a tough&nbsp;market.</p><p>Additional Context</p><p>Buybacks are more of a market signal than a sustainable growth strategy. They are often tied to short-term campaigns or exchange-driven burn mechanisms, which can create only temporary price support without strengthening the fundamentals. The reality is that their impact tends to be limited and short-lived, making them less effective for long-term ecosystem growth. Our approach is different. We aim to ensure that value stems from genuine fundamentals and usage, rather than from market engineering.</p><p>바이백은 보통 매출을 내는 기업이나 거래량과 연결된 거래소에서 진행합니다. HPP는 어려운 시장 환경 속에서도 CMC100 대비 강한 성과를 내고&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>추가 설명</p><p>바이백은 장기적 성장 전략보다는 시장에 “신호”를 주는 성격이 강합니다. 단기 캠페인이나 거래소 주도의 소각 메커니즘과 연결되는 경우가 많으며, 일시적인 가격 지지 효과를 내지만 근본적인 가치 강화에는 기여하지 못합니다. 즉, 효과는 제한적이고 단명하는 경우가 대부분입니다. HPP의 접근 방식은 다릅니다. 우리는 인위적인 시장 개입이 아니라, 토큰의 실제 사용성·펀더멘털·생태계 확장을 통해 지속적인 가치를 만들어가고&nbsp;있습니다.</p> 5. Why doesn’t HPP pump with other&nbsp;tokens? <p>HPP has outperformed the CMC100 over 12 months and the past 5 months. Movement doesn’t always align with BTC/ETH, which are influenced by ETFs and macro&nbsp;flows.</p><p>HPP는 지난 12개월과 최근 5개월 동안 CMC100보다 우수한 성과를 보여왔습니다. 단, 움직임이 항상 BTC/ETH와 일치하지는 않습니다. BTC와 ETH는 ETF나 거시경제 자금 흐름 등 외부 요인에 더 큰 영향을&nbsp;받습니다.</p> 6. What are cryptocurrency investment agents (on the roadmap)? <p>The specific product details are not disclosed yet. However, the vision and target direction have already been introduced under ArenAI. ArenAI will serve as an intelligent, AI-driven trading and asset management layer, enabling users to interact with DeFi and exchange platforms through natural language, agent automation, and portfolio optimization.</p><p>For more background and context, please refer to our previous article on ArenAI, which outlines the concept and future potential of this product: <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/arenai-the-ai-powered-command-center-for-intelligent-asset-management-d6910742bad2">https://medium.com/aergo/arenai-the-ai-powered-command-center-for-intelligent-asset-management-d6910742bad2</a></p><p>구체적인 제품 내용은 아직 공개되지 않았습니다. 하지만 방향성은 이미 ArenAI를 통해 제시되었습니다. ArenAI는 AI 기반의 지능형 자산 관리 및 트레이딩 레이어로, 사용자들이 자연어 인터페이스, 자동화된 에이전트, 포트폴리오 최적화를 통해 DeFi 및 거래소와 상호작용할 수 있도록&nbsp;설계됩니다.</p><p>자세한 내용은 ArenAI에 관한 이전 아티클을 참고해 주세요: <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/arenai-the-ai-powered-command-center-for-intelligent-asset-management-d6910742bad2">https://medium.com/aergo/arenai-the-ai-powered-command-center-for-intelligent-asset-management-d6910742bad2</a></p> 7. Updates on Upleat collaboration and stablecoin? <p>Aergo(HPP) provides tech infrastructure to Blocko and enterprise clients. No direct connection to the referenced stablecoin announcement.</p><p>Additional Context</p><p>Stablecoins are more than just blockchain-based technology. They interface directly with monetary policy tools, such as M1 (currency in circulation plus demand deposits) and M2, meaning their issuance may affect the real-world money supply and economic dynamics. That is why any project launching a stablecoin without operating within the bounds of formal governmental frameworks, such as Korea’s K-BTF (Korea-Blockchain Trust Framework), runs the risk of being inconsequential. These frameworks are crucial for establishing trust, gaining legal recognition, and integrating with national payment&nbsp;systems.</p><p>Without adherence to such regulatory and policy frameworks, a stablecoin project may technically function, but it will lack the necessary legitimacy, operational resilience, and broader institutional acceptance. To be meaningful, stablecoins must not only run on code but also align with economic infrastructure and compliance standards.</p><p>Aergo(HPP)는 Blocko와 엔터프라이즈 클라이언트들에게 기술 인프라를 제공합니다. 하지만 이번에 언급된 스테이블코인 발표와 직접적인 연결은&nbsp;없습니다.</p><p>추가 설명</p><p>스테이블코인은 단순한 블록체인 기술이 아니라 통화정책 도구(M1, M2 등)와 직접 연결됩니다. 즉, 발행은 실제 화폐 공급과 경제 역학에 영향을 줄 수 있습니다. 그렇기 때문에 한국의 K-BTF(Korea-Blockchain Trust Framework) 같은 정부 주도의 제도적 틀 안에서 운영되지 않는 스테이블코인 프로젝트는 실질적 의미가 크게 제한될 수밖에&nbsp;없습니다.</p><p>이러한 제도적·정책적 프레임워크는 신뢰 확보, 법적 인정, 국가 결제 시스템과의 통합을 위해 반드시 필요합니다. 이런 기반이 없다면 스테이블코인은 기술적으로는 작동할 수 있어도 제도적 정당성, 운영 회복력, 기관 차원의 수용성을 확보하지 못합니다. 진정한 의미의 스테이블코인은 코드만으로 존재하는 것이 아니라, 경제 인프라와 규제 준수 기준에 맞추어야&nbsp;합니다.</p> Closing <p>The session closed with reminders that no universal solution exists to “make a token pump.” The team continues to deliver milestones on time, with the imminent launch of the Public&nbsp;Mainnet.</p><p>이번 세션은 “토큰 가격을 펌핑시킬 수 있는 보편적 해법은 없다”는 점을 다시 확인하며 마무리되었습니다. 팀은 퍼블릭 메인넷을 비롯한 주요 마일스톤을 계획대로 달성해나가고&nbsp;있습니다.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-talks-21-public-mainnet-buybacks-and-arenai-4d71e7046c14">[Aergo Talks #21] Public Mainnet, buybacks, and ArenAI</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>At the present, it is rare to get lost because there are many geolocation technologies that will help us to navigate in almost every place in the world. Literally, geolocation is used in a wide range of applications and services, including mapping and navigation, location-based services, targeted advertising, asset tracking, and security. This article will help you to discover what is the meaning of geolocation and Top 5 popular geolocation tools in 2025.</p>







 What is Geolocation Meaning? 



<p>Geolocation refers to the process of determining and identifying the geographic location of an object, such as a device, user, or website, using various data sources and techniques. This can include identifying the latitude and longitude coordinates of a device or user and providing additional location-related information.</p>



 What are Geolocation Methods? 



<p>Geolocation can be performed using different methods, including:</p>



 GPS (Global Positioning System) 







<p>GPS is a satellite-based navigation system that provides accurate location information by triangulating signals from multiple satellites. GPS is commonly used in smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices to determine their precise geographic coordinates.</p>



 IP Geolocation 







<p>IP geolocation involves mapping an IP address to a geographic location. This method uses databases and algorithms to associate IP addresses with specific geographic regions. For instance, countries, cities, or postal codes. While IP geolocation may not be as precise as GPS, it can provide valuable location information, especially for identifying the country or city from which a device is connecting to the internet.</p>



 Wi-Fi Triangulation 







<p>Wi-Fi triangulation involves using the signals from nearby Wi-Fi networks to estimate the location of a device. By analyzing the strength and proximity of Wi-Fi signals from multiple access points, we can determine the device’s approximate location within a certain radius.</p>



<p>Cellular Triangulation</p>



<p>Cellular triangulation, also known as cell tower triangulation, uses the signals from nearby cell towers to estimate the location of a mobile device. By measuring the signal strength and timing from multiple cell towers, it is possible to determine the device’s approximate location.</p>



 How Geolocation Works 



<p>Geolocation works by determining the geographic location of a device. For example, it could be a smartphone, computer, or IoT (Internet of Things) device, based on various sources of information, including GPS, Wi-Fi networks, cellular networks, and IP addresses.</p>



<p>Here is a step-by-step description of overall process:</p>



 Step 1: Device Initialization 



<p>The process begins when a user’s device, such as a smartphone or computer, initializes its geolocation system. This may involve activating the device’s GPS receiver, connecting to Wi-Fi networks, or accessing cellular networks.</p>



 Step 2: GPS Satellite Signals (If Available) 



<p>If the device has a built-in GPS receiver, it begins receiving signals from satellites in the GPS constellation orbiting the Earth. These signals contain precise timing information and orbital data that allow the device to calculate its exact position on Earth’s surface using trilateration.</p>



 Step 3: Wi-Fi Scanning 



<p>The device scans for nearby Wi-Fi networks and collects information about their network identifiers (BSSIDs) and signal strengths. It then compares this information to a database of known Wi-Fi access points and their geographic locations. This process, known as Wi-Fi positioning or Wi-Fi fingerprinting, helps the device estimate its location based on the known locations of nearby Wi-Fi networks.</p>



 Additional Steps: Cellular Triangulation or IP Geolocation (If GPS is Unavailable) 



 
 Cellular Triangulation: If GPS signals are weak or unavailable, the device can determine its location by triangulating its distance from nearby cellular towers. By measuring the signal strength and timing of signals from multiple towers, the device can estimate its position relative to the towers. This technique, known as cell tower triangulation, provides location information in areas where GPS signals are weak or unavailable. 



 IP Geolocation: In some cases, the device’s IP address can be used to approximate its geographic location. IP geolocation databases map IP addresses to geographic locations based on information provided by ISPs (Internet Service Providers) and other sources. While IP geolocation is less accurate than GPS or Wi-Fi positioning, it can still provide useful location information, especially for desktop computers and devices connected to wired networks. 
 



 Step 4: Data Fusion 



<p>The device combines the location estimates obtained from GPS, Wi-Fi, cellular, and IP-based techniques to calculate its final position. By combining data from multiple sources, the device can improve the accuracy and reliability of its location estimate.</p>



 Step 5: Location Services 



<p>Once the device’s location has been determined, it can be used for various purposes, such as navigation, location-based services, asset tracking, emergency response, and targeted advertising.</p>

 Unlocking Africa’s Digital Identity and Web3&nbsp;Future <p>Africa is standing on the brink of a digital revolution. With a youthful population, rising smartphone adoption, and a fast growing blockchain ecosystem, the continent is well positioned to leapfrog traditional systems into the decentralized future. Yet, one major challenge persists: trust, identity, and&nbsp;access.</p> This is where Ontology Network (ONT) steps&nbsp;in. <p>Ontology is a high-performance, open-source blockchain specializing in decentralized identity (DID) and data management solutions. Unlike many blockchains that focus only on transactions, Ontology is designed to empower individuals and businesses with ownership and control over their data, all while enabling trust across&nbsp;borders.</p> Why the Ontology Network is important for&nbsp;Africa <p>1. Solving the Digital Identity&nbsp;Gap</p><p>Across Africa, millions remain unbanked or underserved due to the lack of reliable identity systems. Traditional ID infrastructures are often fragmented, slow, or inaccessible in rural areas. Ontology’s ONT ID solution provides a blockchain based identity that is secure, verifiable, and user controlled.</p><p>This means a young entrepreneur in Nigeria, a farmer in Kenya, or a freelancer in Ghana can create a trusted digital identity without relying on centralized institutions. With ONT ID, they can access banking, healthcare, education, and even global job opportunities.</p><p>2. Empowering Financial Inclusion</p><p>Blockchain has long been seen as a gateway to financial freedom in Africa. Ontology takes this further by enabling cross-border payments and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) applications with lower costs and faster processing compared to traditional systems.</p><p>By combining digital identity with financial tools, Ontology makes it easier for Africans to build credit histories, secure micro-loans, and engage with the global digital economy without being excluded by legacy&nbsp;systems.</p><p>3. Data Ownership in the Web3&nbsp;Era</p><p>In the Web2 world, users give up their data for free while tech giants profit. Ontology flips this model. With its self sovereign data framework, Africans can own, control, and monetize their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Imagine a student in South Africa who shares academic records with universities abroad, or a healthcare worker in Uganda who securely exchanges medical credentials across borders all on their own terms, without third party exploitation.</p><p>4. Building Trust in Governance and&nbsp;Trade</p><p>Trust remains a key challenge in African governance, business, and cross border trade. Ontology’s blockchain infrastructure makes it possible to verify supply chains, authenticate documents, and increase transparency in governance.</p><p>For example, farmers can prove the authenticity of their produce in export markets, while governments can use tamper-proof systems to reduce fraud and corruption.</p><p>5. A Bridge Between Web2 and&nbsp;Web3</p><p>Ontology is not just about the future it is building bridges to the present. Its technology integrates easily with existing systems, meaning African startups, SMEs, and governments can adopt Web3 without completely abandoning current tools. This makes the transition smoother, faster, and more inclusive.</p> Final Thoughts <p>Africa’s future is digital, and the Ontology Network provides the infrastructure to make that future more inclusive, trustworthy, and empowering. By addressing challenges like identity, financial exclusion, data ownership, and trust, Ontology positions itself as a game changer for the continent’s growth in the Web3&nbsp;era.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/the-ontology-network-e44b9583b40c">THE ONTOLOGY NETWORK</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork">OntologyNetwork</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency market is buzzing with opportunity, but finding safe and profitable investments can feel daunting. Which coins offer the best potential in 2025? Our curated list of the top 5 crypto to buy now unveils promising picks, balancing growth potential with stability. From established giants to emerging gems, discover how to unlock profits safely in this dynamic market. Stay ahead and invest wisely!</p>



 Why Invest in Crypto Now? 



 2025 Trends: Solana’s Growth 



<p>Solana’s blockchain is thriving in 2025, driven by its high-speed transactions (up to 65,000 TPS) and <a href="https://blog.herond.org/cryptocompare-best-bitcoin-price-tracker-2025/">low fees</a>, making it a hub for DeFi, NFTs, and meme coins. Analysts predict <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana’s price</a> could hit $400-$500 by year-end, fueled by institutional interest, the Firedancer upgrade, and a growing developer base. Its market cap has surged, with SOL trading around $172-$185, positioning it as a strong Ethereum rival.</p>









 Profit Potential vs. Volatility Risks 



<p>Solana meme coins offer high profit potential, with tokens like Snorter Bot (175% ROI) and TRUMP ($10B market cap) showing massive gains. However, extreme volatility – evidenced by Popcat’s 54% yearly drop and TROLL’s wild swings—poses risks of sharp losses, rug pulls, and whale manipulation. Investors must balance short-term gains against unpredictable market corrections.</p>



 Why Use Herond Browser for Crypto Trading? 



 Ad-Blocker and Tracker Protection to Avoid Phishing Scams 



<p>Ad-blockers and tracker protection tools are essential for safe crypto trading. Malicious ads and trackers can lead to phishing scams, stealing sensitive data like wallet keys. Tools like uBlock Origin and NordVPN Threat Protection block intrusive ads, trackers, and phishing links, ensuring a secure browsing experience. By filtering out dangerous content, these tools safeguard your investments from fraud and cyber threats.</p>









 Herond Browser for a Safe Trading Experience 



<p>Herond Browser enhances secure crypto trading with built-in ad-blocking and anti-phishing features. Designed for Web3, it protects against scams targeting Solana meme coin traders, ensuring safe transactions on platforms like Raydium. Visit herond.org to download Herond Browser and trade with confidence, minimizing risks in the volatile 2025 crypto market.</p>

By diversifying across stable large-caps and high-growth small-caps like MLG, and using secure tools like Herond Browser (herond.org), you can unlock select which crypto to buy now.

</h3>

<div class='item-snippet'>
<!-- use 'smarter' algorithm for cutoff snippet text
   note: summary goes first; than try content -->

  Community banks face rising AML expectations worldwide. This guide explains how to simplify compliance and scale operations using iComply’s integrated platform.

<div class='item-content item-summary'>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>As AML enforcement expands globally, community banks must modernize their compliance operations to remain efficient, accurate, and audit-ready. This article outlines KYB, KYC, KYT, and AML expectations in key jurisdictions—and shows how iComply helps automate up to 90% of the compliance workload.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Community banks play a crucial role in local economies, offering relationship-based financial services that foster small business growth and household stability. But in 2025, global AML regulators are raising the bar—and community banks, no matter how small, are expected to meet the same compliance standards as national institutions.</p>
<p>Whether you operate in the U.S., UK, Canada, or Australia, your bank must now prove it can detect, deter, and report financial crime with the same rigour as the biggest players.</p>
 Global AML Standards for Community Banks 
 United States 
 
 Regulators: OCC, FDIC, Federal Reserve, FinCEN 
 Requirements: CDD Rule, BOI reporting (Corporate Transparency Act), SARs, sanctions screening (OFAC), and ongoing AML program testing 
 
 United Kingdom 
 
 Regulators: FCA, PRA 
 Requirements: Customer due diligence (CDD), enhanced due diligence (EDD) for high-risk clients, transaction monitoring, suspicious activity reporting, and PEP/sanctions screening 
 
 Canada 
 
 Regulator: FINTRAC 
 Requirements: Identity verification, beneficial ownership discovery, recordkeeping, and mandatory STR reporting. Provincial oversight may add regional layers. 
 
 Australia 
 
 Regulator: AUSTRAC 
 Requirements: AML/CTF program, member verification, source of funds checks, transaction monitoring, and ongoing risk assessments 
 
 
 What Community Banks Must Implement 
 
 KYB for Business Accounts: Verify legal status, beneficial owners, and operating legitimacy 
 KYC for Individuals: Confirm identity, address, and biometric match if applicable 
 KYT: Monitor transactions for structuring, velocity, or sanctioned entities 
 AML: Risk-based programs, SAR/STR filing, audit trails, staff training 
 
 
 The Pain Points

 The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has long been a leader in setting cybersecurity standards for the financial services and insurance sectors. Under 23 NYCRR Part 500, regulated entities are required to implement a comprehensive cybersecurity program that addresses governance, access controls, incident response, and ongoing risk management.

<p>The New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) has long been a leader in setting cybersecurity standards for the financial services and insurance sectors. Under 23 NYCRR Part 500, regulated entities are required to implement a comprehensive cybersecurity program that addresses governance, access controls, incident response, and ongoing risk management.</p>  
<p>As we move through 2025, NYDFS has signaled that enforcement is accelerating. The recent $2 million settlement with Healthplex, Inc., announced on August 14, 2025, underscores the steep cost of falling short. This case serves as a timely reminder for all covered entities: compliance is not a once-a-year paperwork exercise; it is a continuous obligation with real financial stakes.</p> 
 What you need to know about NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulations  
<p>Part 500 applies to most banks, insurers, and financial service providers operating in New York. At its core, the regulation mandates that each covered entity maintain a written cybersecurity policy approved by the board, conduct periodic risk assessments, limit access to sensitive systems and data, and implement robust security measures such as phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA).</p> 
<p>Equally important is the incident reporting requirement, which mandates that breaches meeting certain criteria must be reported to NYDFS within 72 hours of determination. In addition, every covered entity must file an annual certification of compliance, or acknowledgment of noncompliance, by April 15 each year.</p> 
 What are the Key Requirements &amp; Upcoming Deadlines?  
<p>In 2025, several deadlines and requirements should be top-of-mind for compliance teams. The annual compliance certification for the 2024 calendar year must be submitted by April 15, 2025. Before that filing, organizations must ensure their risk assessment is current and documented.</p> 
<p>MFA enforcement is also a major focus for NYDFS this year. Covered entities are expected to have phishing-resistant MFA in place not only for remote network access but also for certain internal systems that handle sensitive information. The expectation is clear: email-only MFA or weaker second factors like SMS one-time codes no longer meet the standard.</p> 
<p>Finally, the 72-hour breach reporting requirement remains one of the most critical obligations. Delays in reporting can lead to enforcement actions - even if the breach itself could not have been prevented.<br><br></p> 
 Healthplex Case Study - A $2 Million Lesson  
<p>The Healthplex enforcement action provides a clear example of what can happen when these requirements are not met. In this case, a service representative at Healthplex clicked on a phishing email, giving an attacker access to sensitive consumer data stored in the employee’s Outlook 365 account.</p> 
<p>Several compliance failures compounded the incident. First, Healthplex had not deployed MFA for its email system, leaving it vulnerable to credential-based attacks. Second, the company lacked an email retention policy, meaning that sensitive data remained in mailboxes far longer than necessary, increasing exposure. Finally, Healthplex failed to notify NYDFS of the breach until more than four months after discovery – well beyond the mandated 72-hour reporting window.</p> 
<p>The result was a $2 million penalty, mandatory remediation measures, and a requirement for independent cybersecurity audits focused on MFA deployment. The costs extended far beyond the fine itself, including reputational damage and the operational burden of implementing corrective actions under regulatory scrutiny.</p> 
 The True Cost of Noncompliance  
<p>While the $2 million fine is headline-grabbing, the broader impact of NYDFS noncompliance is often far greater. Legal costs, remediation expenses, internal resource strain, and lost customer trust can quickly escalate. Regulatory investigations can also distract leadership and IT teams from strategic priorities, creating a sustained operational drag.</p> 
<p>For regulated entities, noncompliance can also lead to increased cyber liability insurance premiums - or difficulty obtaining coverage at all. And reputational harm, especially in the financial and insurance sectors, can have lasting effects on customer acquisition and retention.</p> 
 How to Stay Ahead of NYDFS  
<p>Proactive compliance requires more than simply meeting the bare minimum. Covered entities should:</p> 
  
  Implement phishing-resistant MFA such as FIDO2 hardware keys or device-bound passkeys across all systems that store or process sensitive information.  
  Automate breach detection and reporting to ensure the 72-hour notification rule is met without exception.  
  Establish clear data retention policies to limit the amount of information that could be exposed in the event of a breach.  
  Conduct annual independent audits to validate that cybersecurity controls meet or exceed NYDFS expectations.  
  
<p>By integrating these measures into their cybersecurity programs, organizations not only reduce enforcement risk but also strengthen overall resilience against evolving threats.</p> 
 Conclusion  
<p>NYDFS has made one thing clear in 2025: compliance with 23 NYCRR Part 500 is not optional, and the cost of failure is steep. The Healthplex settlement illustrates how a single phishing email, combined with gaps in MFA, data retention, and reporting, can spiral into a multi-million-dollar regulatory penalty.</p> 
<p>For financial and insurance organizations, the message is simple – treat NYDFS compliance as an ongoing operational imperative. Investing in phishing-resistant authentication, robust governance, and disciplined reporting processes can save millions and protect hard-earned reputations.</p> 
<p>Learn how HYPR helps financial and insurance organizations exceed NYDFS requirements with passwordless, phishing-resistant MFA.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
 Key Takeaways  
  
  NYDFS is aggressively enforcing 23 NYCRR Part 500, and penalties are climbing.  
  Annual compliance certification is due April 15, 2025; phishing-resistant MFA and timely breach reporting are top priorities.  
  Healthplex’s $2 million fine shows the financial and reputational risks of noncompliance.  
  Proactive, continuous compliance strengthens both security posture and business trust.

<p>For university leaders, registrars, student services, IT/security, and anyone who wants fewer emails, faster checks, and clearer truth—backed by cryptographic credentials.</p>


 


 TL;DR: What do you actually get—and how does it run on campus? 



 
 Issuance that’s controlled and auditable: Admins authenticate, prepare credential templates, and issue individually or in bulk from CSV, with a two-person approval policy you define. The portal logs who did what and when, so corrections are clean and traceable. 



 A single verification page you can host or embed: Verifiers scan a QR or use a public URL and get a clear result (Valid / Revoked / Incorrect/Unknown), with the option to copy/embed verifier HTML in your own site. 



 Admin UX that matches real registrar work: Backoffice lists admins and entities with statuses (Sent, Active, Revoked), invitation resend, disable/revoke with reason, and a guided “Alta de Administrador y Entidad” flow that emails the invite with wallet links, QR, and deep link. 



 Extrimian AI-First company: Even if AI agent Micelya is internal-only this help us to build and deliver a more accurate product for our clients and final users; it improves our delivery speed and consistency (knowledge hub, handoffs, SOPs), which you feel as better support and final product experience. 
 


 


 How can a university stop fake diplomas and identity theft 



 What problem are we solving—right now, in your inbox? 




Stop fake diplomas with crypto tamper-proof digital credentials and a one-page verifier. Students scan a QR; employers get answers in seconds.




<p>PDFs and screenshots look official but aren’t proof. Every week, employers and partner schools ask for confirmations; staff forward attachments; someone “just checks quickly,” and doubt lingers. Extrimian moves trust from appearance to cryptographic proof: students share a link/QR; your public verifier (hosted or embedded) returns Valid / Revoked / Unknown issuer in seconds—no inbox ping-pong, no guesswork.</p>


 


 What’s the solution in plain words (no acronym soup)? 



<p>Give each important proof a tamper-proof, shareable version—and give the world one official place to check it.</p>



 1) Issue credentials with control and clarity 



 
 Backoffice setup for admins &amp; entities: list admins with status (Sent, Active, Revoked), resend invites, revoke/disable with reason. This keeps who-can-issue under tight control. 



 Admin invites by email: your portal sends a welcome email with wallet links (iOS/Android), a QR to issue the admin credential, and a deep link for mobile. This is the clean onramp to wallet-based admin auth. 



 ID Wallet sign-in for admins (Login con credential): admins authenticate by presenting the admin credential’s QR, then land in their Home. 



 Projects and points: the Admin Home shows your default Project and two panels: Issuing Points, and Verification Points, with quick actions to create/edit each. This mirrors how registrars think about “where we issue” and “where we verify.” 
 



 2) Design and issue the right credential (one-off or at scale) 



 
 Types &amp; templates: for each Point of Emission, you manage Credential Types with editable name, description, hero, icon, background, plus attributes you can enable/disable or add. You also get a live preview before saving, which reduces surprises at graduation time. 



 Individual issuance: pick a template, fill recipient name/email, complete the dynamic attributes required by that template, preview, and Issuewhen everything’s correct. 



 Bulk issuance (CSV): select a template, upload .CSV, preview, and Issue Credentials when all fields validate. This is designed for large cohorts and reduces manual entry risk. 



 Safe edit/copy flows: you can only edit a type before issuing; you can also duplicate a type to iterate safely without touching live cohorts. 
 



 3) Give the world a one-page verifier (hosted or embedded) 



 
 Create aVerification Point: name it, choose the credential type, optionally set the issuer DID, add a webhook for events, and generate it. 



 Publish &amp; embed: copy the verifier HTML for your site and/or copy the public verifier URL hosted by Extrimian—both are provided at creation. 



 What verifiers see: your public verifier shows your university name, verifier name, and QR; when a presentation arrives, it updates the status to Successful Verification or Incorrect Verification—plain language for third parties. 
 



<p>Important clarity: Verification uses digital signatures and status (cryptography). We don’t run AI to “guess” authenticity. Your result is deterministic and transparent.</p>


 


 How does this look in real university life (concrete, day-to-day use)? 



 
 Diplomas without drama: students receive a digitally signed diploma they can share as link/QR. Employers use your verifier once and get a clear result, not a long thread. If a typo slips through, registrar follows revoke → re-issue → notify; the public link always shows the latest truth. (Flows supported by individual/bulk issuance, revocation controls, and public verifier.) 



 Enrollment status that respects privacy: most checks just need “enrolled this term.” You issue a minimal credential and point verifiers to your page. If status changes, the old one is Revoked, the new one is Valid, and external parties naturally see the right answer at the right time. (Backed by verifier status and revocation model.) 



 Transfers &amp; course recognition without email chains: shareable course completion credentials replace scans that go stale. The link stays constant while the truth stays current. (Template attributes + preview reduce errors before they happen.) 



 Career fairs &amp; outreach with momentum: students show a QR; recruiters scan at your public verifier URL and see Successful verification right there. (Easy to host or embed.) 



 Alumni support that actually helps: years later, alumni can request a re-issue; you revoke the old and issue the new. Anyone using the old link sees Incorrect/Reversed verification and requests the updated proof. (Admin list and actions maintain control.) 
 


 


 Who does what so this runs smoothly (roles mapped to the portal) 



 
 Registry &amp; Academic Records: Designs templates (name/description/hero/icon/background), sets attributes (on/off or new), and previews before saving; runs individual or bulk issuance; performs revocations and re-issues when needed; documents reasons for changes. 



 IT &amp; Security: Controls admin authentication (credential-based login via QR), configures/verifies Verification Points (webhook, optional issuer DID), and embeds verifier HTML or publishes the public verifier URL; ensures backups and uptime. 



 Student Services &amp; Comms: Educates students to share link/QR using the digital wallet on their mobiles, instead of PDFs and guides employers/partners to the official verifier URL; keeps a short FAQ aligned with the page’s Valid/Revoked/Incorrect outcomes. 



 Leadership (Provost, CIO/CTO, Risk &amp; Compliance): Endorses the one-page policy: “Verify here; PDFs aren’t official proof,” and monitors adoption (usage of the public verifier vs. email requests). (Policy and messaging are supported by the portal’s embed/public URL model.) 
 



<p>See a real live demo here from UAGRO, one of our succesfull cae studies: <a title="" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kdeaJqsRFbe4mE32_hoZ81HVC4-2Km0C/view?usp=sharing">UAGRO – Students Credentials &amp; Digital ID Wallet Demo</a></p>


 


 How do we handle privacy, consent, and accessibility—without slowing anyone down? 



<p>Minimum disclosure by design: verifiers see exactly what’s needed to trust a result—no more. The public verifier returns a status and human-readable guidance, not full records. (This is inherent to the verifier’s status model.)</p>



<p>Consent that makes sense: students control when to present their credential (via link/QR). Because the verification lives on your official page, the experience is consistent and auditable across departments and partners.</p>



<p>Clear language and supportability: outcomes are stated plainly (e.g., Successful verification), and you can embed the verifier into familiar web contexts to reduce friction for external parties.</p>


 


 Where does “AI-first” fit—and why should you care if it isn’t inside verification? 



<p>We keep AI out of the verification path. Your truth is based on cryptography and status, not AI guesses. Where AI helps is inside Extrimian, through our agent Micelya:</p>



 
 Shared Knowledge Hub: policies, templates, integration notes, and client context live in a role-based, searchable space so our teams respond with consistent, up-to-date answers. 



 Faster handoffs and fewer do-overs: Micelya suggests next steps for our internal tasks (who approves, which template, what changed), so corrections move faster and communication is aligned. 



 Continuous improvement that sticks: when we learn a better placement for the verifier link or a clearer outcome message, it enters our playbook and stays there—even as teams change. 
 



<p>You feel Micelya in response times, consistency, and smoother rollouts—not in your verifier stack.</p>


 


 FAQs about Extrimian Identity Verification Solution for Universities 



<p>Do you use AI to verify credentials?<br> No. Verification uses digital signatures and status checks only. The public verifier returns a deterministic result (Successful/unsuccessful verification) that doesn’t depend on AI.</p>



<p>Can we embed the verifier into our website?<br> Yes. When you create a Verification Point, the portal gives you HTML to embed and the public verifier URL. You can copy either—or both—depending on your deployment.</p>



<p>How do admins authenticate?<br>Through credential presentation (QR) on the Admin Login, which takes them to their Home. The initial admin credential is issued via the invitation email with wallet links, QR, and deep link.</p>



<p>How do we issue a whole cohort?<br> Use Mass Issuance: pick a template, upload CSV, preview, and Emitir when checks pass. For single cases, use Individual Issue with dynamic attributes and preview.</p>



<p>How do partners verify?<br>They scan your QR or open your public verifier URL. The page shows university name, verifier name, and a status (Successful/unsuccessful verification) when a presentation arrives.</p>


 


 Contact us to avoid diploma and data fraud 



<p>Let’s map your flow and harden it—without slowing anyone down.<br>In one session, we’ll share a demo on how you can issue diplomas, and how the verification process works, identify quick wins, and hand you a short, clear plan: which credentials to start with, how your verification page should look, the approval steps to lock in, and the four KPIs you’ll track.</p>

				  Portable Authenticated Biometrics are the future of Biometric Authentication, one where you can use your biometric information across platforms and services. Learn how this powerful new technology allows users to hold their sensitive biometric information securely on their mobile device and what benefits it can offer your organization.  
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By: Tim Spring</p>
 What are Portable Authenticated Biometrics? 
<p>Many people are familiar with the term Biometric Authentication. It refers to the use of unique physical characteristics to verify a person’s identity, such as their fingerprint, voice, or face scan, and many people use it daily to access their phones or other technologies.</p>
<p>Portable Authenticated Biometrics take these characteristics out of a siloed database, and store them inside of a Verifiable Credentials on the user’s smart phone.</p>
 The problem they solve 
<p>Current methods of biometric authentication rely on databases of authenticated biometrics that have been proven to be able to be tied to their users. The main benefits being that biometrics are harder to impersonate than traditional passwords, offer more convenience for the user, and cannot be forgotten.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as technology has advanced, we have realized a few major problems with this system:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Large databases will always represent a lucrative target for bad actors. There is no amount of security that can guarantee that these large collections of personal information stay safe.</p>
<p>Current systems rely on a connection to the database to function. No internet or service means that you cannot share your biometric data or prove your identity, representing another point of failure.</p>
<p>Storing your biometrics with a third party means that they have control over that information and use it as they see fit, including using it to track your digital or physical actions or sharing it without your consent.&nbsp;</p>
 How do Portable Authenticated Biometrics work? 
<p>Every time a new person is added to a biometric authentication system a template of that person’s biometric data is created, and the system learns what you look like. This is what the system compares your new scan to when you are trying to access your phone or documents. In the system these authenticated biometrics are tied to you, and enable you alone to be granted access.</p>
<p>Portable Authenticated Biometrics are a method Indicio has created of allowing users to hold their biometric data securely on their mobile device. Because of the way it is stored (inside a <a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/what-are-verifiable-credentials-with-pictures/">Verifiable Credential</a>) the data inside cannot be manipulated once the credential is created.&nbsp;</p> 
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			  
				
				
				
				
				
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				  The Benefits 
<p>The biggest benefit of this system is that a large database is no longer required to use biometric authentication. This reduces costs and liability for the organization, and offers a huge increase in security for the user’s data.</p>
<p>The second advantage is that by having each user submit their biometric template alongside the new scan, we achieve multifactor authentication built in without any additional effort from the user. All the increased security without the need to check your email or text messages for a one-time code.</p>
<p>The third, and maybe most game-changing feature is the portability inherent in this system. If an organization that you trust — for example the government — issues someone a biometric credential, you can set your systems to accept that biometric information without needing the user to create a new biometric template with your organization. Think of the ease of “login with Google” but even more secure, and backed by any organization that you trust.</p>
 Benefits in Context: A Banking Call Center 
<p>Let’s walk through a quick example.</p>
<p>When calling your bank to fix an issue — such as a declined payment — you will need to prove your identity. Currently, most banks will ask you for information like your name, account number, social security number, or security questions to try to positively identify you before sharing any personal information. This process is not typically particularly long, but it is also not particularly secure. Any bad actor can also collect this information from a data breach and pretend to be you, increasing the risk of fraud and being dependent on the bank representative to catch it.</p>
<p>With Portable Authenticated Biometrics, the bank representative can digitally request your biometric scan and authenticated biometric to identify you instantly, in a way that cannot be impersonated. Once identification has been achieved, you can move on with the purpose of the call, without having to jump through any additional hoops, saving both the user and the call center time while reducing the chance of fraud.</p>
 Getting Started 
<p>The technology behind Portable Authenticated Biometrics is built to easily integrate into existing systems to create a faster, more secure experience for users.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We recently hosted what will be the first of many livestream events for everyone in our community, a series we’re calling Holochain Horizon (for those who want to go to the primary source, here’s a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/VZZWCSzhYxA?si=5-W9QdGMY3JDhl03&amp;ref=blog.holochain.org"> link</a> to that conversation). </p><p>Here, I want to do three things:</p>  Provide both context for, and a summary of, this first conversation – especially as it gave an opportunity for many of you to hear directly from Madelynn Martiniere for the first time, who recently joined our board and is providing direct support to the leadership team and broad community as we move forward and build out our ecosystem  Identify where we are right now as an organization – we’ve been working hard, for years, on an incredibly ambitious project: finding a path to building out open-source tech in a way that's actually viable in the world. While significant challenges remain, we benefit from having a clear picture of the often hard choices we have to make in order to make good on the promises we’ve made to both our community, and ourselves  And finally, having first written directly about the organizational shifts needed to provide our developers and community with the time, and space, necessary to deliver on our commitments (<a href="https://blog.holochain.org/the-holochain-foundation-is-coming-of-age/#:~:text=As%2520part%2520of%2520the%2520reorganization,'t%2520get%2520through%2520before%255D.">here</a>) in November 2024, I want to offer some specifics about what lies ahead – which, while I am admittedly biased, I am genuinely excited about  <p></p><p>ONE: Foundation Forward&nbsp;</p><p>I began the call by characterizing myself – accurately – as a little nervous, partially because it was our first such event as the Foundation, and partially because I was and remain genuinely excited about the direction these key decisions have led us to. </p><p>At the highest level, as I’ve said, it means operationalizing the Holochain Foundation itself – a shift from IP stewardship to active and direct involvement and management. &nbsp; This allows the Foundation to hold coherence for all our stakeholders, internal and external, to benefit from a strategic allocation of resources so that we can accelerate toward appropriately phased delivery.</p><p>Back in November I wrote that “part of our coming of age is realizing that we can’t do everything we might like. Focus matters.” From a technology infrastructure perspective, that means strategically advancing the capability, and durability, of Holochain.&nbsp;</p><p>As Madelynn and I discussed on the call, we clearly recognize the need to engage with our community and like-minded partners via formalized processes that will migrate one-off engagements to defined projects that benefit everyone by advancing the infrastructure itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Madelynn has a lifetime of experience in building healthy and robust technology ecosystems, and practically speaking, that means much of her role is to continuously iterate on improving surface-areas of engagement for all types of folks adopting Holochain, from individual developers, to enterprises and organizations looking for robust decentralized solutions to tough problems. A big part of that is engagement and communication, and as Madelyn herself said, her role is to ask, “how do we create processes and pathways for the community to be in deeper dialogue with us about what it is that they're building? How can we best support that? How do we engage them in actual development?”</p><p>So far, the concrete steps we’ve taken in bringing the Foundation forward include strengthening the technical team, along with a corresponding improvement in release structure and quality, and enhanced transparency, as embodied by our operational roadmap (which you can see<a href="https://blog.holochain.org/introducing-the-new-holochain-roadmap/"> here</a>) to provide the community with a clearly delineated roadmap showing the scoping, planning, and evolution of our ongoing work.</p><p>For our community, the takeaway should be clear: the Foundation’s leadership, and the organization itself, are orienting around proactive engagement to move us – all of us – from the strategic to the tactical.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>TWO: Where Are We Now?</p><p>On the call, I made a plain but accurate observation: “to build out open-source tech in a way</p><p>that's actually viable in the world… is a hard problem.”&nbsp;</p><p>From an organizational perspective, we’re evolving to meet the world as it is becoming. As I previously wrote, this means operationalizing the Foundation to ensure that while we’re always mindful of our ambitions, we remain connected and committed to action. In turn, that means constant and deliberate self-interrogation, making sure we have the right resources delivered to solve for the most important problems.</p><p>We talked about it at length in the livestream, but a clear example and core initiative for us is the continued build-out of our “Wind Tunnel” performance testing framework. One of the conundrums of technology is that while it sometimes appears there is unlimited capital to build out certain ideas (it is hard to observe without jealousy the trillions of dollars that have been dumped into AI), there is proportionately much less patience. Distributed technologies, by their nature, demand economic patience as they’re a half step slower to commercialize as the very decentralization creates different economic incentive structures.&nbsp; From a performance perspective, decentralized systems also have a different profile due to their architecture.&nbsp;</p><p>This is what makes Wind Tunnel so important: we want (and developers need) to be able to verify that Holochain’s operating envelope will meet the demands of Holochain applications. And that's what Wind Tunnel can do. It allows developers to create a scenario to drive a network of Holochain nodes, see what happens, record the rates at which data is synchronized (or any other parameter they want to measure, like DHT synchronization speeds, CPU usage, bandwidth usage across different nodes, etc.) and have the metrics reported.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>THREE: Where We’re Going</p><p>Having shifted the structure of our organization, and as we continue to evolve and direct our resources at our highest-priority opportunities, you can expect to see some exciting developments in the near term.&nbsp;</p><p>In particular, in our past configuration we spent a significant amount of time working on developing the Holochain app and infrastructure necessary to support HoloFuel. Effecting the conversion of HOT into HoloFuel – a mutual credit currency anchored in the value created by Holo hosting - has, from the beginning, <a href="https://holo.host/files/Holo-Green-Paper.pdf?ref=blog.holochain.org">been a stated goal</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Though we already knew the concept of HoloFuel had a much broader application as a pattern, we also realized that we could implement a generalized version for mutual credit currencies that other decentralized infrastructure projects could use, while also creating more value for current HOT holders.&nbsp;</p><p>Accounting for value flow and creating a fabric for establishing rules and systems to support and govern these flows, enables networks, communities, economies and cultures to grow and thrive. Recognizing this opportunity led to our strategic decision to create Unyt, a separate subsidiary organization designed to implement a generalized version for mutual credit currencies that decentralized infrastructure projects could use, while also creating more value for current HOT holders.&nbsp;</p><p>While Unyt is in its early days, they’re getting close to being able to launch beta versions of their multi-unit accounting framework and open them to our community for testing via a scavenger hunt. I won’t say too much more here about Unyt, but expect to hear more from them soon.&nbsp;</p><p>More broadly, we’re working hard on supporting this and other key initiatives at the Foundation that we believe will not only represent significant milestones, but genuinely put us on a path to delivering on the vision we’ve had, and shared, since Holochain’s inception.</p><p>Thanks to everyone for your continued support, and confidence.</p><p>Eric&nbsp;</p><p></p>

In the AI economy, that bridge is native off-chain computation and verifiable inference, directly linking AI workloads to blockchain trust. HPP’s Noosphere delivers this at the protocol level, unlocking scalable, trustworthy AI integration.</blockquote><p>Today, many of Korea’s largest companies, including Naver, Toss, and Kakao are preparing to launch their own stablecoins.</p><p>Why? Because stablecoins are the essential entry point for entering and expanding into the crypto-native ecosystem.</p><p>In traditional finance, value transfer is limited by banking rails, operating hours, and jurisdictional boundaries. Stablecoins remove those barriers, enabling:</p>  Frictionless on/off-ramps between fiat and&nbsp;crypto  24/7, borderless settlement for payments, remittances, and&nbsp;commerce  Direct integration into DeFi, GameFi, NFT, and RWA markets without requiring volatile&nbsp;assets  Programmable money that can be embedded into smart contracts, loyalty programs, and digital marketplaces  <p>Beyond domestic use, these tokens also position Korean tech giants for global Web3 expansion, enabling them to directly integrate into international crypto liquidity, DeFi protocols, and cross-chain payment networks.</p><p>In short, stablecoins are not just a payment tool; they serve as a strategic bridge from Web2 scale to Web3 opportunities.</p> If so, what is the essential gateway to the AI&nbsp;economy? <p>In the same sense, off-chain computation and inference are a must for AI-native infrastructures. Just as stablecoins serve as a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto-native ecosystem, off-chain computing acts as a bridge between AI workloads and blockchain trust.</p><p>If a blockchain project claims to be “AI-powered” but lacks AI-native infrastructure, such as native off-chain computation, verifiable inference, governance over AI agents, and protocol-level integration, it is merely a marketing label and not a genuine AI platform.</p><p>On-chain environments are excellent for verification, consensus, and transparency, but they are not optimized for heavy computation or real-time AI inference. That’s why it must be natively implemented at the protocol level, not added later through an&nbsp;oracle.</p><p>This is the design principle behind HPP’s Noosphere:</p>  Protocol-native off-chain AI execution for inference, data aggregation, and simulation  On-chain verification to ensure results are correct and tamper-proof  Scalability for enterprise-grade and consumer-facing applications without congesting the main&nbsp;chain  <p>Potential Use&nbsp;Cases:</p>  Enterprise: Fraud detection in financial services, medical diagnostics in healthcare, real-time logistics optimization in supply chain&nbsp;networks  DeFi: AI-driven trading strategies, dynamic risk assessment, predictive yield optimization  Identity &amp; Security: Instant biometric verification, decentralized KYC/AML&nbsp;checks  RWA &amp; NFTs: Dynamic NFTs that change with market or environmental data, real-time asset valuation for tokenized real-world assets  <p>By embedding Noosphere directly into HPP, developers gain a built-in, verifiable AI execution layer, not a fragile add-on dependent on external services.</p><p>Just as stablecoins open the door to Web3 adoption, Noosphere unlocks scalable, trustworthy AI integration for blockchain ecosystems.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/stablecoins-built-the-bridge-for-money-noosphere-builds-the-bridge-for-ai-2a2d0a25d002">Stablecoins built the bridge for money.

<p>Since launching Bluesky two years ago, we’ve grown tremendously. As our community has expanded, feedback on our terms of service, community guidelines, copyright, and privacy policies has surfaced opportunities to improve clarity. With more experience under our belt and an evolving regulatory landscape, we’re updating the language in our terms and policies to better explain our approach and provide more detail.</p>
<p>For our Community Guidelines, we’re asking for input from the community. The proposed guidelines enhance clarity, add user safety details, and provide more transparency around moderation. You’ll have until August 28th to submit comments, and then they’ll go into effect on October 15th. You can view our updated <a>Community Guidelines</a> on our <a>Support Page</a>.</p>
<p>Our Terms of Service have been updated to reflect new legal requirements and give users more control in case of disagreements. Changes include clarifying eligibility and age assurance to comply with new regional regulations, as well as introducing a formal appeals process. We’ve also expanded our dispute resolution section to prioritize informal resolution.</p>
<p>The new Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and Copyright Policy will go into effect on September 15th. You can view these updated policies on our <a>Support Page</a>.</p>
<p>Below is an overview of what’s being updated:</p>
 1. Community Guidelines 
<p>We believe the best policies are created in partnership with the people they serve. Our draft Guidelines incorporate lessons from our community's growth and feedback, and your input will help us ensure they're ready to support Bluesky's future. We started by creating a draft that we think improves on our current Guidelines. Below are some of the updates we’ve proposed; <a href="https://forms.gle/mfgZGnhDMaKeq61p7">here is the form to use for feedback</a>.</p>
 
 Clearer Structure: Organized around four key principles—Safety First, Respect Others, Be Authentic, and Follow the Rules—with specific examples of allowed and prohibited content under each. 
 Harm Categories Clarified: Updated with more examples, to align with the UK Online Safety Act (OSA), the EU Digital Services Act (DSA), and the US TAKE IT DOWN Act. 
 Enforcement Procedures: Introduced progressive enforcement model and clarified content moderation logic as required by the OSA and DSA. 
 Appeals &amp; Redress: Aligned with the DSA and now includes out-of-court and judicial remedy guidance for EEA users. 
 
 2. Terms of Service (ToS) 
 
 Eligibility and Age Assurance Section: Updated to clarify compliance with online safety laws and regulations (e.g., US Children's Online Privacy Protection Act [COPPA], OSA, DSA) and to require age assurance where necessary. 
 Moderation and Illegal Content: Added detail on proactive moderation and illegal content responses to comply with the DSA. 
 Complaints and Appeals: Introduced detailed appeals process to comply with the DSA. 
 Dispute process: We have provided users with greater control in the event that we have a disagreement.
 
 We’ve added details about using the informal dispute resolution process, including an agreement that we will talk on the phone before proceeding to any formal dispute process. This is because we think most disputes can be resolved informally. 
 We’ve added a specific detail around liability: if a user makes a claim that we did something wrong that caused certain types of harm, they can choose to resolve that claim in court rather than through arbitration. 
 We are giving users a choice when it comes to any dispute we must resolve through arbitration. That means users choose one arbitrator, Bluesky chooses one arbitrator, and those two arbitrators choose a third. 
 
 
 
 3. Privacy Policy 
 
 User Rights: Enhanced transparency around data subject rights under the EU and UK General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other global privacy laws. 
 International Data Transfers: Updated to explain safeguards used for transfers outside EU and UK. 
 Retention and Deletion: Strengthened clarity on deletion limitations due to decentralized architecture; consistent with DSA and data minimization requirements. 
 Jurisdiction-Specific Sections: Added information that applies to some of our users based on the jurisdiction where they live. 
 
 4. Copyright Policy 
 
 Streamlined Takedown Procedure: Ensures compliance with US Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), DSA, and similar laws. 
 Abusive Reporting Clause: Added mechanisms to deter fraudulent takedown misuse, compliant with the DSA. 
 Transparency Reporting: Aligned with the DSA by clarifying that we will include required information in transparency reports.

<p>On the cusp of our<a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/press-releases/1kosmos-secures-57m-in-series-b-funding/"> series B funding</a>, and as I look ahead to many big and bright developments for our company and for Identity and Access Management at large, I can’t help but look back at the vision and design intent behind the 1Kosmos platform and how it became reality.</p>
<p>Eight years ago, we had a simple but audacious goal: fix digital identity once and for all. Not with incremental improvements, but by rebuilding the entire foundation from scratch. Looking back now, our early design decisions have become the blueprint that the entire industry follows.</p>
<p>The vision was clear. People were drowning in passwords, companies were struggling with ransomware and breaches, and personal data was being treated as a corporate asset rather than a fundamental right. We knew that any real solution would need to solve identity verification and passwordless authentication simultaneously, not as separate problems but as two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>What we didn’t anticipate was how quickly our architectural approach would become the standard. Today, when industry analysts discuss “best practices” in digital identity, they’re describing the principles we built into 1Kosmos from day one.</p>
 Identity Verification: Inclusion Was Always the Goal 
<p>When we designed our verification system, we made a controversial decision. While everyone else bet everything on smartphone-first experiences, we insisted on building multiple pathways that would work for everyone. The mobile experience had to be exceptional, but it couldn’t be the only option.</p>
<p>That decision proved prescient. Organizations discovered that when you make identity verification truly accessible, adoption rates soar. Our verification architecture combines real document authentication with live biometric matching across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, this foundation is proving essential for the digital wallet revolution. As governments and enterprises begin issuing verified credentials, the ability to verify identity anytime, anywhere and with or without a mobile phone proves to be a core requirement, not just a nice-to-have feature.</p>
 Authentication: The Distributed Biometric Breakthrough 
<p>The breakthrough that really set us apart came from our approach to <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/insights/whitepapers/biometric-authentication-vss-threat-of-deepfakes/">biometric authentication</a>. Everyone else was building bigger central databases. We asked a fundamental question: what if we could authenticate users without ever storing their biometric data centrally?</p>
<p>The answer was distributed biometric verification across a <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/blockchain/blockchain-identity-management-a-complete-guide-2/">private blockchain</a>. Your face or fingerprint gets distributed and encrypted in ways that neutralize threats from centralized breaches. You can authenticate anywhere in our network, but your biometric data never leaves your control.</p>
<p>This architecture has become what security experts call the gold standard for biometric authentication. The user experience is seamless—your face becomes your password—but there’s simply no central target for attackers because there’s no central database to breach.</p>
 Privacy: Building What We Couldn’t See 
<p>Perhaps our most important early decision was to architect the entire platform around data we couldn’t access ourselves. This wasn’t just about compliance—it was a fundamental design constraint that shaped every technical choice we made.</p>
<p>We built zero-knowledge proof capabilities into the core platform. We could verify that someone was over 21 without knowing their exact birthdate or confirm employment status without accessing salary information.</p>
<p>This privacy-first architecture seemed radical when we first deployed it. Now it’s becoming a requirement. As verified credentials become mainstream, the ability to selectively disclose information through zero-knowledge proofs will transform everything from border crossings to loan applications.</p>
 Verified Credentials: The Network Effect We Envisioned 
<p>When we started building support for verified credentials, we were betting on something that didn’t quite exist yet. The standards were emerging, use cases were theoretical, and most organizations had never heard the term. But we could see where things were heading.</p>
<p>Today, verified credentials are transforming how organizations think about identity and access. The employee badge, professional license, customer verification—all can now exist as cryptographically signed digital credentials that work across platforms and organizations.</p>
<p>Our early investment is paying dividends! Organizations using 1Kosmos can issue credentials to employees that work seamlessly with partners’ systems. Customers get verified once and use that verification across multiple services. The network effects we envisioned are becoming reality.</p>
 Decentralized Identity: The Vision Realized 
<p>The most ambitious part of our original vision was true decentralized identity—putting users in complete control while maintaining the security that organizations require. Users own their identity information completely. Organizations get stronger security and easier compliance. The system becomes more resilient as it grows.</p>
<p>The decentralized approach has proven essential as digital wallets evolve from concept to reality. When your identity isn’t locked in corporate databases, you can present it anywhere, anytime, for any purpose you authorize. The wallet becomes truly portable because the identity itself is truly yours.</p>
<p>As we look ahead, this foundation supports use cases we’re only beginning to explore. International travel with digital passports. Seamless access across different countries. Professional credentials that work globally. Age verification that protects privacy completely.</p>
 The Reference Platform: Looking Forward 
<p>What started as our vision for fixing digital identity has become the reference architecture that defines how modern identity platforms should work. When analysts evaluate new solutions, they measure them against capabilities we pioneered. When enterprises set requirements, they’re describing features we built years ago.</p>
<p>Looking forward, the most exciting applications are just beginning. Digital wallets that work across borders and platforms. Verified credentials that enable instant, private verification of any attribute. Zero-knowledge proofs that let you prove exactly what you need without revealing anything else.</p>
<p>The next chapter is already being written. Your digital wallet will soon hold not just payment cards but professional licenses, educational credentials, government documents, and membership cards—all cryptographically verified and completely under your control.</p>
<p>The 1Kosmos architecture is ready for this future because we built it into the foundation from the beginning.</p>
<p>The infrastructure is built. The standards are emerging. The future of digital identity isn’t coming—it’s here, working, and ready to transform how we interact with the digital world.</p>

<p>Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the subject of intense speculation and analysis. As the first and largest cryptocurrency, its price movements send ripples throughout the entire crypto market. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a curious newcomer, understanding the potential future of BTC prices is essential. What factors drive its value? Where do experts see it heading next? In this article, we’ll dive deep into the latest Bitcoin predictions, exploring key insights, market trends, and expert opinions to help you navigate the ever-changing landscape of crypto investing.</p>



 Current State of Bitcoin Prices 



 Recent Bitcoin Price Trends 



<p>Over the last quarter, <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/">Bitcoin (BTC) prices</a> have experienced significant volatility, with a notable upward trend. According to data from sources like TradingView and CoinMarketCap, BTC recently spiked to a high of over $122,000, nearing its all-time high of approximately $123,236 set in July 2025. This surge followed a period of consolidation in June and July. Despite some fluctuations, the overall momentum has been positive, with Bitcoin’s price rising by over 100% in the last year alone, demonstrating strong long-term growth.</p>



 Key Market Influences Shaping BTC 



<p>Several key factors are currently influencing the price of Bitcoin. Regulatory news continues to be a major driver, with positive developments like the approval of U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs attracting significant inflows, as seen with the $260 million in capital that flowed into Bitcoin-based funds last week. This indicates growing institutional adoption and a higher level of mainstream acceptance. Additionally, macroeconomic events, such as potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and new government regulations, are closely watched by traders. As a decentralized asset, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a hedge against traditional economic uncertainty, solidifying its role as “digital gold” in the eyes of many investors.</p>

 Factors Influencing Bitcoin Prices 



 Key Factors Influencing Bitcoin Prices 



<p>The future of <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">Bitcoin prices</a> is influenced by key factors like macroeconomic trends (e.g., central bank policies), regulatory developments (e.g., ETF approvals), and technological advancements (e.g., Bitcoin halving). These factors, along with market sentiment, drive price movements and are crucial for understanding future predictions.</p>









 Recent Trends and Expert Sentiment 



<p>In 2025, the success of spot Bitcoin ETFs has driven unprecedented institutional demand. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) alone holds over 742,000 BTC, signaling a major shift toward mainstream adoption. This, combined with a positive macroeconomic outlook, has pushed prices to a recent high of over $122,000.</p>



<p>Expert sentiment from prominent figures like Michael Saylor and analysts at CryptoQuant remains bullish. They note that the market is maturing, with on-chain data and technical indicators suggesting a strong foundation for continued growth, despite ongoing volatility.</p>



 Expert Bitcoin Predictions for 2025 and Beyond 



<p>Analysts present a range of Bitcoin predictions for the short and long term. On the bullish side, Peter Brandt and Bernstein analysts project BTC to hit between $150,000 to $200,000 by year-end, while Chamath Palihapitiya’s prediction reaches an ambitious $500,000 by October 2025.</p>



<p>For a more neutral outlook, analysts suggest an average price of $110,000 to $130,000, accounting for steady institutional inflows.</p>









<p>Conversely, a bearish scenario could see a price correction, with technical analysis identifying a key support level around $90,000 to $100,000 in case of an unexpected market downturn.</p>



 Short-Term vs. Long-Term Outlook for Bitcoin Predictions 



 Discuss short-term volatility 



<p>Short-term Bitcoin volatility is a constant, and recent trends are no different. In early August 2025, BTC saw a notable push toward the $116,848 mark, with some analysts forecasting a path to the $125,000 to $150,000 range. However, the market has also experienced minor pullbacks, with traders watching key support levels and potential CME futures gaps. These rapid fluctuations highlight the importance of staying informed and agile in the ever-changing <a href="https://blog.herond.org/what-can-you-buy-with-bitcoins/">crypto market</a>.</p>









 The Long-Term Potential of Bitcoin 



<p>Beyond short-term trends, Bitcoin Predictions long-term potential is gaining significant momentum. Many experts, including seasoned trader Peter Brandt, view BTC as a superior store of value to gold, citing its fixed supply and decentralized nature. This makes it an ideal hedge against inflation. The successful launch of U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have been a major catalyst for institutional adoption, bringing unprecedented capital into the market and paving the way for wider acceptance. These factors, combined with historical post-halving patterns, suggest a strong foundation for sustained growth in the years to come.</p>



 Learning from Historical Halving Cycles 



<p>To understand what might be next for Bitcoin, it’s helpful to look at its historical halving cycles. The most recent halving in April 2024, which reduced the supply of new BTC, has historically been a major catalyst for price rallies. In previous cycles, prices saw significant increases in the 12-18 months following a halving event. While the market has matured, these post-halving periods have consistently marked the beginning of new bull runs, suggesting a strong foundation for long-term growth is in place despite short-term volatility.</p>



 How to Stay Informed and Act on Bitcoin Predictions 



 Essential Tools for Tracking Bitcoin Prices 



<p>To stay ahead of the volatile crypto market, having the right tools is essential. Platforms like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko are industry standards for tracking real-time BTC prices, market capitalization, and historical data. For more advanced analysis, TradingView offers powerful charting tools and technical indicators that help you visualize trends and make informed decisions. Using a privacy-focused browser like Herond ensures a seamless and secure experience on these platforms, blocking trackers and pop-up ads while you monitor the market.</p>



 Credible Sources for Crypto Updates 



<p>Staying informed is crucial, but so is knowing where to get your information. For reliable news and analysis, follow reputable news outlets such as CoinDesk and Cointelegraph. On social media, particularly X (formerly Twitter), consider following well-respected figures in crypto space. Influencers like Michael Saylor provide a bullish institutional perspective, while analysts like Peter Brandt offer insightful technical analysis. Remember, these voices can influence market sentiment, so a balanced approach is key.</p>









 A Cautious Approach to Investing 



<p>Before making any investment, it’s vital to prioritize safety. Always conduct your own research (DYOR) and only invest an amount you can afford to lose. The crypto market is volatile, and prices can fluctuate dramatically. A smart strategy is dollar-cost averaging, where you invest a fixed amount regularly to mitigate the impact of short-term price swings. As you begin your crypto journey, Herond Browser’s secure Web3 environment helps protect your assets and personal data from potential scams, giving you greater peace of mind.</p>



 Conclusion 



<p>In a market driven by both technical signals and unpredictable global events, the future of Bitcoin prices remains a topic of intense debate. While many analysts are bullish on BTC’s long-term potential, citing its scarcity and growing institutional adoption, the journey to new highs will likely be characterized by its signature volatility. As we’ve seen with recent market movements, factors like regulatory news, major economic shifts, and even geopolitical events can all dramatically influence short-term price action. Ultimately, staying informed and understanding the interplay of these forces is key for anyone looking to navigate the dynamic world of cryptocurrency.</p>

With <a href="https://www.aba.com/about-us/press-room/press-releases/consumer-survey-banking-methods-2024">55% of customers preferring mobile banking</a>, adaptation to a world of seamless digital interaction isn’t a choice. Many customers — but especially those who have grown up digitally native — don’t see the point of going into a brick and mortar building any more; they want to open an account, manage their finances, and access services as they do everything else — through their phones.</p>
<p>Here’s the problem. The scale of this opportunity to reinvent banking is anchored to a pre-digital, show up in person, world. And its a drag.</p>
<p>“We’re working with the biggest and best bank in the world,” said Elijah Levine, CEO of Black Mountain at the Indicio Meetup,&nbsp; “and for them to verify our identity, we need to bring two physical forms of identity into an in-person branch for a physical person to do a touch and feel test… using their banker’s best judgement for if this paper document is real.”</p>
<p>How, then, do you onboard and authenticate a new customer remotely —&nbsp;especially when paper documents and pictures can be easily forged with ubiquitous AI tools?</p> 
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
					
					
				 
				
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
					
					
				 
				
			 
			  
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				  Verifiable Credentials with biometrics: A revolution in&nbsp; identity verification 
<p>A Verifiable Credential makes information tamper proof and cryptographically verifiable — meaning you don’t have to check the data in a credential against the same data stored somewhere in a database.</p>
<p>For a customer logging into an account this means no more passwords or usernames —&nbsp;by presenting an account credential from a digital wallet, they gain seamless access to their account. What this means for both the bank and the customer is that a key vulnerability —&nbsp;stolen login credentials — is removed as a security risk. You can’t phish for data that doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>The process of verifying the credential also doesn’t just include verifying the customer, it also means verifying the identity of the bank so the customer can be certain it is their bank. Again, the shuts down a common phishing tactic of luring customers with emails or sms messages that purport to be from their bank.</p>
<p>But Verifiable Credentials reach peak usability when they combine verified biometrics with biographical data. By using Indicio software, a bank can enable a customer to turn the data in their passport into a credential, a process that includes taking the embedded image in the passport and performing a real-time face map of the passport holder to ensure both match.</p>
<p>“The beauty of combining a verifiable credential with a biometric,” said Ken Ebert, CTO of Indicio, “is that it can bind the data in the credential to the person who is presenting it and in a way that’s stronger than just having a set of data in a file… If you’ve bound the biometrics to opening the wallet as well, you can tell that the person is not only present, but they’re the one that the credential was issued to. And you can match that data to the data in the credential for purposes of ascertaining that you’re dealing with the right person”</p> 
			 
			 
				
				
				
				
			  
				 
				
				
				
				
				 
				
				
				
				
				 <p>This functionality allows us to not only verify the data presented, but that the correct user is there at the time of data submission, making presenting someone else’s credentials without their consent essentially impossible.</p>
<p>It also provides a simple way to dodge a deepfake: simply ask the person to present an authenticated biometric. The verifying software will compare the live image to the biometric in the credential to see if it matches.</p>
<p>All this allows customers to verify their identity information from anywhere without the need to bring their paper documents to a building. And there’s no need for a bank or a relying party to have to store a person’s biometrics to verify them, simplifying the stringent privacy compliance around biometric data too.</p>
 What does this mean for KYC? 
<p>This technology is poised to change KYC, but it doesn’t need to be an all or nothing replacement of current infrastructure. “Although this is a new and cool technology,” said Ebert, “it doesn’t have to immediately supplant everything that’s already going on in KYC. It’s an add-on. It’s an enhancement. It’s a boost of confidence or a higher assurance level. It’s an immediate benefit, but it doesn’t have to be a rip and replace. It can integrate with existing systems. That’s part of the beauty of it —we’re not reinventing KYC”</p>
<p>But KYC will be reinvented. Gradually, the collection of physical documents will become unnecessary, as everything can be turned into a Verifiable Credential and leverage portable digital trust.</p>

<p>In this episode of The Future of Identity Podcast, I’m joined by Thomas Mayfield, Head of Decentralized Trust &amp; Identity Solutions at the Cardano Foundation. Thomas leads the development of the Veridian Wallet, an open-source digital identity platform built on the KERI (Key Event Receipt Infrastructure) protocol and funded by the Foundation.</p><p>Our conversation explores the rapidly evolving Web3 digital identity ecosystem—and how Veridian aims to bridge Web2 and Web3 with universal interoperable identifiers that cut through today’s fragmented identity landscape. We also dig into the growing urgency to rebuild digital trust as data breaches, ransomware, and AI-powered threats escalate.</p><p>In this episode we explore:</p>  Why interoperability—across Web2, Web3, and beyond—is essential to breaking down identity “walled gardens.”  How the KERI protocol enables quantum-proof, tamper-evident, and recoverable identifiers for individuals, organizations, and AI agents.  Real-world adoption: how the United Nations is using Veridian for organizational identity and passwordless authentication.  The potential for verifiable IoT and AI agent identities to transform trust in machine-to-machine and human-to-machine interactions.  How developers can leverage Veridian’s open-source infrastructure, sandbox environments, and tooling to build secure, compliant identity solutions faster.  The role of regulation in driving adoption—and why future-proofing identity systems now could save billions in breach-related costs.  <p>This episode is essential listening for anyone working on decentralized identity—whether you’re building infrastructure, integrating identity into products, or shaping policy. Thomas offers a rare, in-depth look at how to design for both future-proof security and real-world interoperability.</p><p>Enjoy the episode, and don’t forget to share it with others who are passionate about the future of identity!</p><p>Learn more about the <a href="https://cardanofoundation.org/">Cardano Foundation</a>.</p><p>Reach out to Riley (<a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">@rileyphughes</a>) and Trinsic (<a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id">@trinsic_id</a>) on Twitter.

<p>“If you want to follow what’s happening in AI, it helps to know where the conversations are happening.” </p>



<p>That doesn’t just mean the headlines and white papers; it means the standards bodies, working groups, and protocol discussions shaping the infrastructure AI systems will have to live with (and live inside). Some of these efforts put “AI” right in the name. Others are quietly solving problems that have been around for a while, which AI has now made urgent.</p>



<p>At IETF 123 in Madrid, AI topics were everywhere, sometimes explicitly, sometimes not. Just like every other event I’ve been to this year, it’s clear that AI is no longer a side topic. But it’s also not one big monolith. A working group with “AI” in the title might be useful, or it might be entirely orthogonal to the problems you’re facing. And meanwhile, some of the most critical technical work is happening in groups that never mention AI at all.</p>



<p>This post is a snapshot of both: a look at where the “AI conversations” are happening in the standards world, and where the deeper technical groundwork is being laid, whether or not anyone’s calling it AI.</p>

 Where AI is the elephant in the room 



<p>Some of the most relevant work wasn’t framed as AI-specific at all… at least, not when it started.</p>



<p>Delegation chaining, for example, is a topic that’s been simmering in OAuth land for a while. The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-identity-chaining/">identity chaining draft</a> defines a way to preserve identity and authorization information across trust domains. Useful for distributed architectures in general and now getting a lot more attention thanks to agentic AI models that need to act across domains, on behalf of users, and maybe other agents.</p>



<p>If you’re designing systems that involve third-party APIs, partner orchestration, or AI-driven workflows, this isn’t theoretical. It’s the difference between “this agent can complete a task” and “this agent just leaked PII across environments you can’t audit.” (This is often what’s happening right now; it’s a terrifying prospect, but I digress.)</p>



<p>Same story for WIMSE (Workload Identity in Multisystem Environments). AI doesn’t appear in the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/wimse/about/">charter</a>, but the group is wrestling with exactly the kinds of problems that show up when AI agents act like software workloads, make API calls, and need identity and trust across services.</p>



<p>These efforts weren’t built for AI, but they are shaping the environment in which AI agents will operate.</p>



 Where AI is the headline 



<p>There’s also a growing set of efforts waving the AI banner from the start. Here are a few places to watch if you want to keep a product roadmap aligned with emerging standards and activities.</p>



 AI Preferences (IETF AIPREF) 



<p>This working group is focused on standardizing how people (and systems acting on their behalf) express preferences about how their data is used in AI systems. Think training, inference, and deployment. <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/aipref/about/">Their charter</a> is about giving users the power to say “yes,” “no,” or “only under these conditions.”</p>



<p>Why this matters: Consent banners and privacy policies are blunt instruments. If your app collects user content, you might soon need a finer-grained way to handle “don’t train on this” or “only use for personalization.” Product teams working on personalization, LLM features, or customer data ingestion should keep this on their radar.</p>



 Web Bot Authentication (BoF) 



<p>Born out of a hallway conversation, the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/webbotauth/about/">Web Bot Authentication</a> group is asking what it means to authenticate bots—especially AI-powered ones—when they interact with websites meant for humans.</p>



<p>Why this matters: If your web properties are being used (or abused) by AI scrapers, this work could define how to tell the difference between legitimate agents and free-riders. This could impact content licensing models, rate-limiting strategies, and even customer support bots.</p>



 AI Agent Protocol (side meeting) 



<p>This one hasn’t formalized into a working group yet, but a side meeting at IETF 123 kicked off discussions about protocols for AI agents to act autonomously online by invoking APIs, collaborating with each other, making decisions, etc.</p>



<p>Why this matters: If you’re building or integrating with AI agents—anything from internal copilots to customer-facing assistants—expect questions soon about how they authenticate, how their actions are logged, and what delegation looks like at runtime.</p>



<p>(Also, please don’t schedule the next AI Agent meeting opposite WIMSE again. Some of us have to clone ourselves as-is.)</p>



 Beyond the IETF 



<p>Other standards bodies are also entering the fray. Here’s a quick tour of where else things are heating up:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/agentprotocol/">W3C AI Agent Protocol Community Group (CG)</a><a href="https://www.w3.org/community/agentprotocol/"> </a>is developing protocols for AI agents to find each other, identify themselves, and collaborate across the web. It’s early days, but think of it as DNS and HTTP for agentic AI. 



 <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/aikr/">W3C AI K</a>R CG is focused on knowledge representation, i.e., how to structure information so AI systems (and people) can reason over it consistently. It is relevant to anyone dealing with search, ontologies, or explainability. 



 <a href="https://openid.net/cg/artificial-intelligence-identity-management-community-group/">OpenID Foundation AI Identity Management CG</a> is mapping out how identity systems need to adapt to agentic AI. It’s not creating protocols (yet), but its members are watching government regulation closely.

 Signals to watch 



<p>Standards are slow… until they’re not. You don’t need to read every draft, but here are some signs that these efforts are going mainstream:</p>



 
 MCP (Model Context Protocol), which lets AI agents act autonomously by invoking APIs or services, is <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/06/17/the-mcp-bandwagon/">not a standard</a>, but it’s being adopted or piloted by major platforms like cloud providers and browsers. To function securely, it depends on underlying standards for identity chaining, authentication, and authorization—things like OAuth, delegation models, and token handling. 



 Vendor AI agent SDKs start referencing delegation models or bot authentication best practices. 



 Your compliance team starts asking about AI consent and model provenance. 
 



<p>When that happens, product managers will need to have answers or at least know where to look for them.</p>



 If you’re building anything touched by AI 



<p>This is just one slice of what’s happening in the standards space. No one—myself included—can keep up with it all. And if I try to AI-clone myself, who knows what hallucinations might creep in! But hopefully there’s enough cross-pollination between these (and other) efforts that we won’t be reinventing wheels or missing blind spots entirely.</p>



<p>If you’re an architect, engineer, or product leader, now’s a good time to:</p>



 
 Start mapping where AI agents (or their proxies) may interact with your system 



 Review your assumptions about trust, delegation, and human intent 



 Assign someone to monitor the relevant working groups or participate, if you can 
 



<p>Standards work isn’t glamorous, but it’s how the internet keeps functioning. And right now, the decisions being made will shape how agentic AI interacts with everything from your login flows to your support tools.</p>



<p>With luck—and a little planning—the next wave of automation won’t break the web. Or your roadmap.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>00:00:26 Welcome back to the Digital Identity Digest.</p>



<p>Today we’re diving into the latest round of AI buzz — but from the standards world. Specifically, we’ll unpack what happened at IETF123 in Madrid and how it connects to a much bigger, messier, and louder story: the infrastructure needed to support AI.</p>



<p>00:00:51 If you feel like there’s way too much going on in AI and standards right now to keep track of, you’re absolutely correct.</p>



<p>00:01:00 One of my goals in this episode is to give you a map — not of every working group or proposal, but of the most relevant conversations shaping the AI systems your teams will build on, run into, or be regulated by.</p>



 



 Agentic AI and Why It Matters 



 



<p>00:01:22 Let’s talk about agentic AI, because it’s especially interesting.</p>



<p>00:01:28 The term refers to AI systems that can take autonomous action.</p>



 
 Large language models integrated into agents that can invoke APIs 



 Systems that make decisions and complete multi-step tasks 



 Agents that interact across systems — for a user, or even for another agent 
 



<p>00:01:53 This is a big shift. Like most computing shifts, it won’t work unless the plumbing underneath is solid — identity delegation, authentication, policy enforcement.</p>



<p>00:02:18 So where is that plumbing discussed? Some of it happens in AI-specific groups, but much of the critical work is in mature standards groups that don’t even mention AI in their charters.</p>



 



 Delegation Chaining 



 



<p>00:02:51 One example is delegation chaining in OAuth/authorization.</p>



<p>00:03:01 This draft defines a way to preserve identity and authorization across multiple trust domains.</p>



<p>Why it matters:</p>



 
 AI agents often act on behalf of users across multiple systems 



 Without it, product teams end up “duct taping” credentials to every interaction — not scalable 



 A scheduling agent booking travel crosses multiple trust boundaries 
 



<p>00:03:44 This work began before AI hype took off — but agentic AI makes it urgent.</p>



 



 Workload Identity in Multisystem Environments (WHIMSY) 



 



<p>00:04:05 Another crucial effort is WHIMSY — short for Workload Identity in Multisystem Environments.</p>



<p>00:04:21 It tackles how services, bots, APIs, and AI agents assert identity across environments.</p>



 
 Relevant for agentic AI because these identities aren’t tied to human sessions 



 Helps establish runtime identity for autonomous systems 
 



<p>00:04:52 Takeaway: If it doesn’t say AI, it can still be vital to AI infrastructure.</p>



 



 AI-Focused Standards Groups at IETF 



 



<p>00:05:01 Of course, there are groups with AI in their name and charter.</p>



 AI Preferences Working Group (AI-Pref) 



<p>00:05:08 This group is creating a standard way for users (or systems) to express data-use preferences for AI:</p>



 
 Training 



 Inference 



 Deployment 
 



<p>The aim is to move beyond vague privacy policies toward technical mechanisms for enforcing user preferences.</p>



 Web Bot Authentication (BoF) 



<p>00:05:58 A discussion about how bots — especially AI-powered ones — should identify themselves when accessing human-oriented websites.</p>



<p>Questions under debate:</p>



 
 Are bots allowed? 



 How should they authenticate? 



 How do we distinguish helpful agents from malicious scrapers? 



 Who’s accountable when things go wrong? 
 



 AI Agent Protocol (Side Meeting) 



<p>00:07:02 This informal discussion explored whether the IETF should standardize protocols for AI agents to discover, invoke, and communicate.</p>



<p>Connections to existing work:</p>



 
 MCP (Model Context Protocol) is emerging in pilots 



 Secure use depends on OAuth delegation chaining and other identity models 
 



 



 Beyond IETF: W3C and OpenID Foundation 



 



<p>00:08:14 Standards work isn’t just at the IETF.</p>



<p>W3C Community Groups:</p>



 
 AI Agent Protocol CG – protocols for how agents identify, collaborate, and operate on the web 



 AI Knowledge Representation CG – structuring domain knowledge so AI systems can reason and explain themselves 
 



<p>OpenID Foundation:</p>



 
 AI Identity Management CG – mapping use cases, identifying gaps, tracking regulations 



 Not building protocols, but providing a regulatory and technical landscape view 
 



 



 What Product Teams Should Do 



 



<p>00:09:27 For product managers and executives, here are the practical takeaways:</p>



 
 Understand where delegation fits in your systems 



 Define identity for non-human actors — avoid relying on user credentials 



 Implement technical enforcement of consent for AI agent actions 



 Track compliance triggers early to avoid future architectural rework 
 



<p>00:10:44 Watch for signals:</p>



 
 MCP or delegation models adopted by major vendors 



 New authentication guidance for bots and agents 



 Increased compliance chatter about AI-related access 
 



 



 Final Thoughts 



 



<p>00:11:10 This is just one slice of a fast-moving standards space.</p>



<p>If the right people connect across groups, we can avoid duplication, fill gaps, and lay the groundwork for agentic AI that’s safe, scalable, and standards-aligned.</p>



<p>00:11:39 Keep your eye on the standards — even if your platform isn’t “AI-first,” its infrastructure is being shaped right now.</p>

<p>When a company’s own founders and team members dig deeper into their pockets to invest more of their personal money, you know something big is happening. That’s exactly what just occurred at 1Kosmos—and it’s sending ripples through the digital identity world.</p>
<p>Today we announced $57M in Series B funding, bringing our total funding to $72M. But here’s what makes this round extraordinary: it was led by Forgepoint Capital and Origami Capital’s Oquirrh Ventures, with every prior investor participating, and included new funding from some of our own team members.</p>
<p>This blows past the typical $38M Series B, but the real story isn’t the size—it’s who’s writing the checks.</p>
 Momentum Building to a Crescendo 
<p>This funding caps off a remarkable year of wins. We’ve achieved <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/press-releases/1kosmos-reports-record-breaking-growth-for-2024/">3x revenue growth</a> while becoming the only full-service Credential Service Provider with both FedRAMP High authorization and NIST 800-63-3 certification. KuppingerCole named us a leader across Product, Innovation, and Overall categories in their <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/leadership-compass-identity-verification/">2025 Leadership Compass</a> for Identity Verification and passwordless authentication, and we scored “perfect” marks in Presentation Attack Detection level 2 (PAD 2) certification.</p>
<p>Our new Microsoft partnership for External Authentication Methods to Entra ID and the Carahsoft-awarded <a href="https://www.1kosmos.com/press-releases/1kosmos-partnership-with-carahsoft-awarded-login-gov-next-generation-identity-proofing-blanket-purchase-agreement-bpa-worth-up-to-194-5m/">Login.gov blanket purchase agreement</a> worth up to $194.5M prove the market is ready for what we’re building. Add our 1Kosmos biometric security key (aka1Key) for frontline workers with LiveID (real biometrics), and it’s clear why everyone—including us—wanted in on this round.</p>
 Riding the Digital Identity Wave 
<p>Digital identity has become one of tech’s hottest sectors, and for good reason. On the heels of warnings from none other than Sam Altman about the coming “fraud crisis” powered by artificial intelligence to enable bad actors to impersonate other people, major breaches and rising identity fraud have exposed fatal flaws in passwords and fragmented ID checks.</p>
<p>Recent news of Palo Alto Network acquiring CyberArk provides further evidence of a turning point in Identity. Cybersecurity stalwarts that traditionally considered identity verification peripheral to their mission now recognize it as the new security perimeter. It’s clear organizations worldwide are scrambling for solutions that deliver both security and user-friendly identity verification experiences.</p>
<p>The shift to zero trust security models puts verified digital identity at the center of access control. Cybersecurity investors are flocking to identity-focused startups because these solutions tackle the most pressing issues in our digital-first world.</p>
 What’s Next: Putting $57M to Work 
<p>This funding enables us to accelerate on three fronts: expanding our engineering team to push product innovation faster, scaling our go-to-market efforts globally, and building partnerships that bring passwordless multi-factor authentication to more organizations.</p>
<p>Our Engineering team is already using powerful AI tools in areas such as prototyping UI / UX designs to reduce cycle times and recommending microservices to update, data models to use, and APIs to build for speeding implementation planning. We have site reliability engineering in our target, using AI to handle complex operational functions independently, moving beyond simple automation to true autonomous decision-making. We’ll continue to work harder and smarter in engineering.</p>
<p>With the injection of fresh capital, Marketing and Sales will move beyond regional focus, tapping into global demand for improved identity and authentication services. Partnering will also benefit from the cash infusion. We plan to engage large global systems integrators, regional systems integrators, and various government entities to expand the 1Kosmos footprint into ready industries including Healthcare, FED/SLED and Manufacturing,</p>
<p>The included $10M credit line also gives us financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities without immediate dilution—letting us move fast when the right deals or talent emerge.</p>
<p>Our platform uniquely addresses both identity proofing and authentication, providing comprehensive protection against identity fraud and account takeover. Organizations need to stop bad actors without creating obstacles for legitimate users, and that’s exactly what 1Kosmos delivers.</p>
 The Bottom Line 
<p>When founders and executives invest their own money alongside institutional investors, it sends an unmistakable signal: we’re not just confident in our pitch deck—we’re betting our personal wealth on our vision.</p>
<p>With $57M in the bank and our team doubling down with their own money, we’re not just riding the digital identity wave—we’re creating it. The mission we founded 1Kosmos on—secure digital identity under user control, enabling ubiquitous access that can’t be stolen, borrowed or shared—is no longer just a vision.</p>
<p>It’s happening. And we’re just getting started.</p>

 Behind every digital interaction is a technical standard working quietly in the background. Here, we explore some of the most important in the digital identity space and explain how they’ll affect how you verify customers very soon. 



 



<p>Over the past few years, the European Union (EU) has garnered much attention in its goal to transform how people interact with governments, businesses, and each other online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Central to its mission is the rollout of the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/eudi-wallets-privacy-usability/">European Digital Identity EUDI) Wallet</a>, a secure, portable digital identity solution set to become the foundation for cross-border services, e-government, and AML-compliant onboarding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two regulations in particular, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas-2-0/">eIDAS 2.0</a> and the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/amlr-explained-financial-services-need-know/">Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR)</a>, are redefining how identity and trust are managed across the EU.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the core of the transformation lie technical standards developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). These are legally binding through Commission Implementing Regulations (CIRs), which lay the groundwork for secure, interoperable, and compliant digital identity services.</p>



<p>For example, earlier this year, IDnow became <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/europes-identity-verification-providers-eidas/">one of the first companies in Europe </a>to receive certification under the latest ETSI standard for remote identity proofing, signifying a crucial step toward meeting eIDAS 2.0 and AMLD 6 requirements. One of the most important technical standards we achieved was the ETSI 119 461 v2.1.1 certification, which is widely considered the ‘compliance benchmark’ for remote identity verification in Europe.</p>



<p>Technical standards ensure interoperability across borders, promote security by design, and create the certainty businesses need to scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At IDnow, we’ve championed the EU’s vision for a more harmonized approach to digital identity from the start. Our priority has always been to promote open, secure standards that allow technical innovation to thrive. In a regulatory environment that began shifting from voluntary best practices to mandatory rules, we welcome the clarity and opportunity that harmonized standards bring to the market, to institutions, and above all, to users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For IDnow’s regulatory and standards department it is important to keep looking ahead to what comes next and how it will affect the everyday lives of people. Standards play a crucial role in ensuring that impact is not only manageable, but truly beneficial. This remains the bedrock of our mission.</p>



 
   
     
                     The Trust Playbook. 
                     Discover how top teams from your industry are turning digital identity and trust into growth strategies.​

 Why standards matter. 



<p>Behind every digital interaction, such as verifying your identity for bank account opening or digitally signing a contract, there are technical standards working quietly in the background. These standards ensure that systems speak the same language, that data remains secure, and that services can be trusted no matter where in the EU (or beyond) they are used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organizations like ETSI, CEN, and ISO play a critical role in setting these benchmarks. They bring together experts from governments, tech companies, and the public sector to define how trust services, digital identity, and secure onboarding should work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the EUDI Wallet and new trust services move from concept to implementation, these standards are not just technical specifications or guidelines; they are becoming the legal foundation for the way digital identity is handled across Europe.</p>



 Laying the foundation for trust. 



<p>The shift toward standards-driven digital identity and trust services offers better technology and builds a harmonized, secure, and legally enforceable ecosystem across borders. With the EUDI Wallet and the upcoming AMLR, Europe is setting a global precedent in how identity, privacy, and trust should be handled in the digital age.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Standards from ETSI and CEN are already embedded in the first wave of EU’s CIRs and will directly guide how identities are verified, wallets are certified, and trust services are recognized. These aren’t abstract technical documents anymore; they’re becoming the blueprint for how millions of people will access digital services, from banking to healthcare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What often goes unseen is the deep, ongoing work that makes this possible. At IDnow, our regulatory and standards team has been deeply engaged behind the scenes as we work alongside our colleagues at ETSI, CEN and ISO to shape these standards in a way that balances security, innovation, and practical deployment. It’s this kind of collaboration that enables digital services to scale with confidence and compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>More specifically, IDnow has recently contributed to the following standards and technical reports:</p>



  ETSI TR 119 476-1. A feasibility study of how selective disclosure and zero-knowledge proofs can be implemented in the EUDI Wallet. IDnow was one of the main contributors to this technical report.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  ETSI TS 119 461: Requirements that define how identity proofing must be performed when enrolling for a Qualified Certificate or a Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes. The standard can also be applied to Personal Identification Data (PID) enrollment to the EUDI Wallet and AMLR guidelines. IDnow has been co-editors and contributors to both versions of this standard.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  ETSI TS 119 431: Specifies how remote signing with Qualified Certificates should be deployed in a remote Qualified Signature Creation Device. IDnow designed the new approach to only rely upon identification for one-time Qualified Electronic Signatures, which streamlines the remote signing process.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;  



  CEN TS 18098: Outlines how to onboard PID to EUDI Wallets. IDnow has been co-editors of the chapters related to identity proofing during the on-boarding process.  



<p>Regardless of whether you’re a wallet provider, financial institution, or public sector authority, now is the time to take a close look at how your internal systems align with these evolving standards. After all, these specifications are not optional; they are rapidly becoming the rulebook for trust in Europe.</p>

<p>Munich, August 12, 2025 – IDnow, a leading identity verification platform provider in Europe, today announced that several of its flagship products had achieved ETSI 119 461 v2.1.1 certification, the technical standard widely considered the ‘compliance benchmark’ for remote identity verification in Europe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), ETSI 119 461 v2.1.1 was selected by the European Commission as the standard for AML-compliant identity verification for qualified trust services and the upcoming Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR).</p>



<p>The certification was awarded following rigorous testing by the accredited conformity assessment body, QSCert.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Obtaining certification in ETSI 119 461 v2.1.1 establishes IDnow as one of the first providers in Europe to fulfill the stringent biometric and security standards necessary for compliant identity verification in line with evolving European regulations, such as eIDAS 2.0 and AMLD6.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Why this matters for European businesses&nbsp; 



<p>With rising threats from deepfakes and increasingly sophisticated types of online fraud, especially in the finance, mobility, and telecom sectors, the ETSI 119 461 v2.1.1 standard outlines a comprehensive European framework for compliant identity verification services, including requirements for presentation attack detection, injection attack detection, and biometric-integrity assurance.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>This milestone is not only a technical and security achievement; it is a practical commitment to advancing digital onboarding in the most regulated industries. We’re proud to lead the way in enabling compliant, secure, and user-friendly identity verification across all major digital channels.</p>Armin Berghaus, Founder and Managing Director at IDnow.&nbsp;</blockquote>



 What comes next&nbsp; 



<p>As one of the first identity verification providers to be certified under the latest eIDAS 2.0 requirements, and the Extended Level of Identity Proofing (LoIP) security standards, IDnow enables customers to adopt a variety of compliant identity verification solutions, each of which fulfill existing and upcoming European regulatory expectations and trust service requirements:&nbsp;</p>



  Expert-led video identity verification&nbsp;

<p>Credit unions worldwide are facing increasing AML scrutiny, especially in Canada, the U.S., UK, and Australia. This article explores KYB, KYC, KYT, and AML expectations in these jurisdictions, and shows how iComply helps automate up to 90% of compliance tasks—while preserving member privacy and trust.</p>
 
 Credit unions are the lifeblood of community banking across many of the world’s leading economies. From rural Canada to urban Australia, they offer cooperative financial services rooted in trust, mutual benefit, and member care. But in 2025, those same institutions are being held to banking-grade compliance standards—particularly when it comes to anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF). 
<p>With national regulators ramping up inspections and issuing new guidance, credit unions must modernize their approach to KYB, KYC, AML, and even KYT – without alienating members or overwhelming staff.</p>
 Global AML Expectations for Credit Unions 
 Canada 
 
 Regulator: FINTRAC (federal), BCFSA or FSRA (provincial) 
 Requirements: Identity verification for members and beneficial owners, ongoing PEP/sanctions screening, transaction monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting 
 
 United States 
 
 Regulator: NCUA, FinCEN 
 Requirements: CDD rule compliance, beneficial ownership verification for legal entity accounts, SAR filing, and compliance with the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) 
 
 United Kingdom 
 
 Regulator: FCA and PRA 
 Requirements: Customer due diligence, screening against the UK Sanctions List, ongoing monitoring, and robust AML/CTF controls under MLR 2017 
 
 Australia 
 
 Regulator: AUSTRAC 
 Requirements: Member identification, source of funds checks, transaction monitoring, suspicious matter reporting (SMRs), and annual AML program reviews 
 
 What Credit Unions Must Do 
<p>To comply across jurisdictions, credit unions typically must:</p>
 
 Verify identities of natural persons and business account holders 
 Conduct beneficial ownership checks for corporate members 
 Screen members and transactions for PEPs, sanctions, and suspicious patterns 
 Maintain audit-ready documentation and report to regulators 
 
 Why Compliance Is Especially Challenging for Credit Unions 
 
 Lean compliance teams and manual review processes 
 Multiple disconnected systems for ID, screening, and reporting 
 Tight budgets with little room for complex vendor integration 
 Member-first culture that resists high-friction onboarding

 2. Automated Beneficial Ownership Checks 
 
 Visual mapping and verification of UBOs 
 Screening for nominees and shell structures 
 Risk-based logic for escalation or enhanced due diligence 
 
 3. Continuous AML Monitoring 
 
 Sanctions, PEP, and adverse media screening 
 Configurable triggers for transaction behaviour or geographic risk 
 Integrated case management with audit trail 
 
 4. Simplified Workflows for Staff and Members

 Comply confidently across Canada, the U.S., UK, and Australia 
 Protect member trust with private, secure onboarding 
 Automate 90% of compliance tasks while scaling membership

<p>Consumer expectations have reached an all-time high, and they’re demanding more than just personalized marketing. They expect every interaction to reflect who they are, what they want, and where they are in their journey. For digital leaders and marketing teams alike, this creates both urgency and opportunity: how to deliver unified, real-time experiences across channels while ensuring data privacy and trust.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Historically, this has been a complex and manual effort. Integrating identity provider (IdP) data with customer relationship management (CRM) systems often required custom development, while building user flows demanded coordination across multiple siloed teams. The result was disjointed customer journeys, delayed launches, and limited visibility into the customer identity lifecycle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately, today’s modern customer identity and access management (CIAM) systems have changed the game. Digital leaders now achieve true end-to-end integration far beyond just <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/capability/single-sign-on.html">single sign-on (SSO)</a>, using out-of-the-box (OOTB) connectors and <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/capability/identity-orchestration.html">no-code orchestration tools</a>. Identity data can flow directly into marketing, analytics, and customer experience (CX) platforms, unlocking seamless omnichannel engagement with speed, accuracy, and confidence.</p>

 The Supply Chain Transparency Crisis <p>Global supply chains are under more pressure than ever. Delays in verifying suppliers, counterfeit goods slipping through the cracks, and unproven ethical sourcing claims have left retailers and manufacturers scrambling to protect trust. Traditional verification systems (slow, manual, and vulnerable to manipulation) can’t keep up.</p><p>Without instant proof of business registration, certifications, or compliance status, production stalls. Counterfeit goods remain a multi-billion-dollar problem, undermining brand reputations and putting consumers at risk. Ethical sourcing claims often rely on unverified labels, leaving “fair trade” or “sustainably sourced” promises open to doubt.</p> How VDCs Transform Supply Chain Operations <p>Verifiable digital credentials (VDCs) are cryptographically signed records that can be instantly checked for authenticity. In supply chains, they replace the patchwork of PDFs, phone calls, and manual forms with secure, real-time verification.</p><p>They work across global trade systems, integrating with logistics software, ERP platforms, and customs processes. Whether it’s confirming a supplier overseas or verifying a product’s compliance with safety regulations, VDCs allow companies to act in seconds instead of weeks.</p> Real-World Examples of VDC Impact  Walmart <p>Faced with delays, counterfeits, and unverifiable ethical claims, <a href="https://tech.walmart.com/content/walmart-global-tech/en_us/blog/post/blockchain-in-the-food-supply-chain.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Walmart implemented VDCs</a> to:</p>  Verify suppliers in seconds with cryptographic certainty.  Authenticate products from source to shelf.  Prove ethical sourcing through tamper-proof records.The result: faster time to market, stronger consumer trust, and reduced risk.   Amazon <p><a href="https://www.dock.io/post/amazons-plan-for-digital-ids?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Amazon is exploring VDCs</a> to streamline marketplace seller onboarding, reducing the time from application to listing, while keeping counterfeit goods out of its ecosystem. This protects both customers and legitimate sellers.</p> Target <p><a href="https://corporate.target.com/sustainability-governance/responsible-supply-chains?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Target</a> safeguards its quality standards by verifying supplier credentials and tracking product origins. VDCs provide data-backed proof that meets consumer expectations for safety and integrity.</p> Tesla <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/biserdimitrov/2020/04/14/how-tesla-and-bmw-are-leading-a-supply-chain-renaissance-with-blockchain/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Tesla is testing VDC-based tracking</a> for raw materials, ensuring that minerals like cobalt meet strict sustainability and human rights criteria before they enter the supply chain.</p><p>Across industries, VDC adoption is building supply chains that are faster, more resilient, and more transparent.</p> The Business Case for VDC Adoption in Supply Chain <p>Companies are embracing VDCs for three main reasons:</p>  Speed: Supplier verification shrinks from months to days, accelerating launches.  Fraud prevention: Cryptographic verification blocks fake credentials and counterfeit products.  Transparency: Real-time, verifiable records meet regulator and consumer demands for proof.  <p>In competitive markets, proving your supply chain story isn’t just compliance, it’s a differentiator.</p> What’s Next for Supply Chain Credentials <p>Emerging trends promise to make VDCs even more powerful:</p>  Blockchain integration for immutable supply chain records.  IoT tracking to connect physical goods to digital credentials in real time.  AI-driven verification for smarter fraud detection.  <p>With regulators moving toward requiring verifiable transparency, adoption will soon shift from competitive advantage to a baseline requirement.</p> The Bottom Line <p>Verifiable digital credentials are no longer futuristic, they’re here and already transforming global commerce. From Walmart’s operational gains to Tesla’s sustainability tracking, the results show that verification delays can be eliminated, counterfeits shut out, and ethical sourcing backed by proof.</p><p>If your organization is ready to explore VDCs for supplier verification, product authentication, and ethical sourcing, SpruceID can help design and deploy systems that meet global standards and build consumer trust.</p> <a href="https://spruceid.com/contact-us?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Contact Us</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

 Everything You Need to Know About Facial Recognition Search in 2025 
<p>Facial recognition search has quickly shifted from science fiction to everyday reality. Whether it’s tracking down an online impostor, securing access to a building, or reconnecting with an old classmate, the technology is becoming a go-to tool for both professionals and curious individuals. The magic lies in matching a human face to an image in a database or on the internet. The process is fast, accurate, and surprisingly accessible to anyone who knows where to look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Understanding Facial Recognition Search and Its Process 
<p><a href="https://recognito.vision/face-biometric-playground/">Facial recognition search</a> works by analyzing a photo or video to find and match an individual’s face in a database or on the internet. Unlike traditional image search, which focuses on colors, shapes, or objects, this method analyzes unique facial features. Think of it as the digital equivalent of recognizing a friend in a crowd only faster, and without the need to squint.</p>
<p>The process involves three main steps:</p>
 
 Detection – AI locates a human face in an image or video frame. 
 Mapping – The software pinpoints facial landmarks such as the eyes, nose, and jawline. 
 Matching – These mapped points are then compared with saved facial data to identify a possible match.
<p></p> 
 
<p>Facial recognition online services often combine large-scale public image databases with advanced AI. Tools like a facial recognition finder make it possible to track down a person from a single uploaded photo. Below is a simplified workflow example:</p>



Step
Action
Technology Used


1
Detect the face in the photo
AI + Computer Vision


2
Map facial landmarks
Face recognition SDK


3
Compare with database
Neural networks


4
Return match results
Search engine integration



<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Key Technologies Behind Facial Recognition Search 
<p>The engine that drives facial recognition search is built from a combination of AI, deep learning, and specialized software. At the core, a face recognition SDK allows developers to integrate recognition capabilities into apps or websites.</p>
<p>But accuracy alone isn’t enough. To ensure the search result is from a real, live person and not a printed photo or screen replay, security layers like a face liveness detection SDK or liveness detection SDK are used. These tools can detect blinking, slight movements, and even texture differences in skin to confirm authenticity.</p>
<p>Here’s a quick comparison between traditional image search and facial recognition search:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Popular Uses of Facial Recognition Search 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 1. Security and Law Enforcement 
<p>Security agencies use internet facial recognition search tools to identify suspects, missing persons, or unauthorized access attempts. A facial recognition lookup can pull records from vast criminal and public databases within seconds.</p>
 2. Social Media and Online Networking 
<p>Ever spotted someone in a photo but couldn’t recall their name? Facial recognition online services help identify people from public social media images. A good facial recognition finder can track old friends or even verify profiles.</p>
 3. Business Applications 
<p>Banks and e-commerce platforms now use a face <a href="https://recognito.vision/face-liveness-detection-sdk/">liveness detection SDK</a> to confirm the identity of customers during transactions. This prevents fraud and speeds up onboarding for new accounts.</p>
<p></p>
 Free and Paid Facial Recognition Search Options 
<p>Many are tempted to try a free facial recognition search for quick results. While free tools can be useful for casual searches, they often come with limited accuracy and smaller databases. Paid services usually provide:</p>
 
 Larger and more up-to-date databases 
 Stronger privacy protections

  The Fall 2025 iComply release takes aim at the new AI fraud threat with on-device randomized liveness and biometric checks, protecting both identity verification integrity and national data sovereignty.

<p>Artificial intelligence is advancing at breakneck speed, and biometric authentication with liveness detection—once considered the gold standard in digital identity verification—is now under siege. Deepfakes, synthetic media, and AI-generated spoofing tools are more accessible and convincing than ever. Traditional systems relying on cloud-based analysis or static liveness checks are dangerously outdated.</p>
<p>Deepfakes, synthetic media, and AI-generated spoofing tools are more accessible and convincing than ever. Traditional facial recognition systems, especially those relying solely on cloud-based analysis or passive liveness checks, are completely obsolete, despite their prevalence in fintech, DeFi, and digital banking worldwide. At the same time, threat actors no longer need sophisticated tools to bypass standard facial recognition systems. A free, anonymous email account, some AI video gen software off the internet, and a still image or two from any social media account are now enough to fool most identity verification platforms – this is because they do not process the data locally.</p>
<p>The Threat</p>
 
 
<p>AI-powered fraud now makes it possible to bypass many KYC onboarding processes with nothing more than a still image, a free email account, and widely available deepfake software.</p>
 
 
<p>Cloud-based verification platforms introduce additional risk—sending sensitive biometric data offshore, often to vendors with questionable ownership, opaque data handling, or ties to jurisdictions that undermine privacy and sovereignty.</p>
 
 
<p>Fintechs and DeFi companies face heightened exposure, especially when relying on providers in the UK, US, Canada, and EU that use offshore subprocessors or outdated verification models.</p>
 
 
<p>Most systems labeled as “liveness detection” perform only surface-level checks before sending the image to the cloud for advanced processing. This forces them to rely on outdated 2D image processing often provided by questionable offshore data processors, making them easy targets for presentation attacks using photos, deepfake videos, or even AI-generated avatars. Biometric systems that were once built to stop fraud are now frequently bypassed by it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“AI-driven fraud is exploding across legal, real estate, and financial services. This is a technology arms race. The only way to win is to meet AI with better AI, backed by privacy-first architecture. With our edge-computing biometrics, your users’ most sensitive data never leaves their device, and fraud attempts never reach your systems.” said Matthew Unger, CEO at iComply</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The iComply Platform: Built for the Next Era of Threats</p>
<p>We’ve spent the last five years engineering and refining a better Live Face Match biometric authentication system that can perform any type of check directly on the user’s device. This not only addresses these modern threats, it is a game changer for personal data privacy and national data sovereignty.&nbsp;Our latest release of the iComply platform delivers randomized, concurrent liveness and biometric testing. Performed entirely on-device via our proprietary edge computing architecture to detect and neutralize generative AI spoofing before it can infiltrate your onboarding process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Fall 2025 Release Highlights 
<p>1. Advanced Multi-Expression Live Face Match Testing: Enhancements to performance and concurrent processing of both biometric face matches and liveness detection algorithms. Our platform doesn’t just check for motion and a face match; it challenges users to perform randomized facial expressions and micro-movements in 3D, making it nearly impossible for pre-recorded or deepfaked media to replicate. Each expression is evaluated independently alongside biometric confidence scores and device metadata to create your confidence threshold, which can be customized based on your risk tolerance.</p>
 
 
<p>Real-time 3D facial recognition combined with randomized micro-expression prompts.</p>
 
 
<p>Concurrent biometric and liveness analysis makes pre-recorded or AI-generated forgeries virtually impossible to pass.</p>
 
 
<p>Independent scoring for each challenge, combined with device metadata, allows for fully configurable pass/fail thresholds.</p>
 
 
<p>2. Edge Computing for Real-Time AI Fraud Detection: Unlike API driven KYC or identity verification systems, our identity and biometric checks are performed directly on the user’s device through edge computing. Edge-computing ensures your customer data is always processed locally, in the country where they are at that moment, and validated before you touch it. This reduces exposure, accelerates processing time, and ensures biometric data never leaves the device, drastically improving both privacy and security. With this release, Pro and Enterprise accounts can now leverage enhanced configurability and data localization control for emerging regulations covering data privacy, security, and sovereignty.</p>
 
 
<p>All biometric processing happens locally, on the user’s device. This ensures that data never leaves the country of origin. Zero data leakage. Zero third-party processing.</p>
 
 
<p>No reliance on offshore cloud processors means significantly reduced attack surface, zero transmission risk, and compliance with emerging data sovereignty laws.</p>
 
 
<p>Enhanced configurability for Pro and Enterprise clients to meet national and sector-specific privacy mandates.</p>
 
 
<p>3. Enhanced Threshold Controls for Precision Matching: Manage thresholds for biometric confidence score, adjust pass criteria, and the number of facial expressions required to be completed successfully.</p>
 
 
<p>Dynamically set biometric confidence thresholds (e.g., 70%, 85%, 95%) based on your risk profile.</p>
 
 
<p>Adjust requirements based on the risk and use case of the biometric verification event.</p>
 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>AI Isn’t Going Away, But Neither Are We<br>
Organizations can no longer rely on “good enough” systems from five years ago to stop the threats of today. AI-generated fraud is evolving faster than most compliance teams can adapt. Without advanced, on-device defences, organizations risk onboarding bad actors, breaching data protection laws, and undermining user trust. By engaging iComply as their AML compliance technology partner, our clients reduce cost, manual operations, and fragmented systems while gaining clarity, consistency, and confidence in their AML compliance program. A program that is built not just for today’s threats but also for the upcoming threats posed by generative AI and offshore data processing.</p>

<p>The rise of AI agents is one of the most significant shifts unfolding across the internet today. From booking travel to managing work tasks, agents are quickly becoming powerful tools that act on behalf of users. In fact, by next year, there may be more non-human agents online than human users. The promise is clear: automate the drudge work and reclaim your time.</p><p>But as the excitement grows, a critical piece of the conversation is being overlooked—identity. How do we know which agent is acting? Who authorized it? What is it allowed to do? And how do we prevent misuse when these agents gain access to sensitive systems or personal data?</p><p>In our latest live session,&nbsp;<a href="https://dock.io/?ref=blog.dock.io">Dock Labs</a>&nbsp;CEO Nick Lambert sat down with Peter Horadan, CEO of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vouched.id/?ref=blog.dock.io">Vouched</a>, to explore these questions in depth.

<p>With the UAE’s Executive Office for AML/CFT ramping up inspections in 2025, licensed entities must demonstrate stronger KYC and AML controls. This article explores how regulated firms can implement privacy-first onboarding, continuous screening, and full audit-ability using iComply.</p>
 
 The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has made major strides in aligning with global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) frameworks. Since being grey-listed by the FATF in 2022 and then removed in 2024, the UAE has doubled down on enforcement – particularly through the Executive Office for AML/CTF (EMLO). 
<p>In 2025, firms regulated by the UAE Central Bank, Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), and Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) should expect heightened inspections and cross-agency coordination.</p>
 Who This Applies To 
<p>The UAE’s AML/CFT regime applies to a wide range of Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs), including:</p>
 
 Real estate brokers 
 Auditors and accountants 
 Law firms 
 Dealers in precious metals/stones 
 Trust and company service providers (TCSPs) 
 Crypto and virtual asset service providers (VASPs) 
 
<p>Licensed financial institutions – including payment firms, forex dealers, investment managers, and private banks – are also under close watch.</p>
 What Regulators Expect in 2025 
<p>Under the updated AML/CFT laws and EMLO directives, licensed firms are expected to:</p>
 
 Perform customer due diligence (CDD) and enhanced due diligence (EDD) 
 Identify and verify beneficial ownership (UBO) 
 Monitor for suspicious transactions and PEPs 
 Conduct sanctions screening aligned with the UAE National Sanctions List 
 Maintain audit-ready compliance records and risk assessments 
 
 Challenges Facing UAE Firms 
<p>1. Fragmented AML Systems<br>
Many firms rely on disconnected tools that lack unified case management, increasing audit risk.</p>
<p>2. Manual and Offshore Data Processing<br>
Non-local cloud providers may expose firms to data residency violations or delays in response time.</p>
<p>3. Regulatory Complexity<br>
Multiple regulators with overlapping mandates mean firms must build systems that satisfy a range of agency expectations.</p>
 How iComply Supports UAE AML Compliance 
<p>iComply offers a unified KYC and AML platform built for global and local compliance—including full support for UAE-specific requirements.</p>
 1. Real-Time Identity and Entity Verification 
 
 Edge-based KYC verifies natural persons and legal entities locally on the device 
 No raw PII is transmitted unencrypted or stored offshore 
 Supports Arabic documents and character sets 
 
 2. Continuous AML Screening and PEP Monitoring 
 
 Screen clients and transactions against UAE and global sanctions lists 
 Detect politically exposed persons and adverse media in real time 
 Configure frequency and thresholds by client type and jurisdiction 
 
 3. UBO Discovery and Documentation 
 
 Map complex corporate structures and nominee owners 
 Collect and validate supporting documents with automated triggers 
 Maintain evidence of CDD and EDD per risk category 
 
 4. Centralized Case Management 
 
 Document onboarding, screening, investigations, and decisions in one secure portal 
 Export audit logs for inspections by EMLO, SCA, DFSA, or ADGM 
 
 5. UAE-Compliant Deployment Options 
 
 Host data within the UAE to meet local data sovereignty laws 
 Full multilingual support, including Arabic 
 Consent management and document retention controls included 
 
 Case Insight: Payment Processor in Dubai 
<p>A DIFC-licensed payments firm adopted iComply for KYC and AML compliance. Results in 90 days:</p>
 
 Automated verification for 100% of onboarding cases 
 Reduced average review time from 2 days to under 30 minutes 
 Received positive feedback during DFSA audit with no findings 
 
 2025 Regulatory Outlook 
 
 EMLO Inspections: Random and risk-based audits will intensify across sectors 
 UAE Sanctions Enforcement: New alignment with international partners will expand list coverage 
 Risk-Based Program Mandates: Regulators will expect documented risk assessments and justifications for CDD scope 
 
 Take Action 
<p>Whether you’re a VASP, DNFBP, or financial institution, the bar for AML compliance in the UAE has never been higher. Leading firms are already investing in scalable, privacy-first solutions.</p>
<p>Contact iComply to learn how our platform helps UAE-regulated entities stay compliant, secure, and audit-ready in 2025 and beyond.</p>

 Q1: What is&nbsp;DeFAI?   A term describing projects that merge Decentralized Finance (DeFi) with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Currently used to label this emerging segment in Web3. Similar to “DeSci” (Decentralized Science).  Naming: Similar to “DeSci” (Decentralized Science).   Q2: When will the HPP website and mainnet go&nbsp;live?   Mainnet Launch: Originally planned for Q4, now targeted for Q3 2025 (ahead of schedule). Progress is on track; nearing the end of the planned&nbsp;window.  Website Launch: Advanced stage — wireframes complete, style guide implemented, interactive elements reviewed. Branding draws from CRT distortion and terminal-style visuals, reflecting the “early era” feel of AI. Likely to launch before the&nbsp;mainnet.  <p>Note: The <a href="https://www.hpp.io/">hpp.io</a> site is already live with content for testnets and the private&nbsp;mainnet.</p> Q3: When will AIP-21 rewards be distributed?   Airdrop Start: After mainnet&nbsp;launch.  Vesting: Rewards have a long vesting&nbsp;period.  Expected Timing: Likely this quarter, soon after mainnet goes&nbsp;live.   Q4: Are the AIP-21 swap ratios still accurate?   Yes. Ratios were set at the time of the AIP-21 vote based on agreed project valuations. These remain locked and will not&nbsp;change.   Q5: Do holders need to take action for the&nbsp;swap?   If on Exchanges: Swaps may be automatic if the exchange supports&nbsp;it.  If Off-Exchange: May require using a bridge or manual&nbsp;process.  <p>General Guidance: Follow official channels for detailed instructions.</p>  Expect a generous grace period for swapping.  Token migrations are becoming more common — always track official updates for your holdings.   Q6: How is HPP an upgrade to the existing Layer&nbsp;1?   AI Integration: Aergo L1 (current mainnet) will gain the AI technologies being developed for HPP (e.g., off-chain computation, verifiable AI interaction).  Enterprise Use: Aergo remains the enterprise/private chain option, with forks for specific deployments (e.g., public&nbsp;sector).  Dual-Layer Advantage: HPP Mainnet enables easier integration with exchanges, AI-native dApps, and multiple blockchains without L1 modifications.   Q7: Community concern about low trading volume and price movement only on&nbsp;news   Price changes are not always tied to news; many announcements have no lasting effect, and derivatives can even push prices&nbsp;down.  Volume is important as a sign of utility, but isolated charts can mislead; always compare them with broader market&nbsp;trends.   Q7: Will HPP mainnet launch in late Q3 or early&nbsp;Q4?   Confirmed: Target remains end of Q3&nbsp;2025.  Airdrop: Will start after mainnet launch, following the vesting schedule.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-talks-20-recap-defai-airdrop-and-more-660999a40fa2">[Aergo Talks #20] DeFAI, airdrop, and more</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Choosing the right identity verification (IDV) partner is one of the most critical security decisions you'll make. As organizations fortify their defenses, it’s clear that verifying the identity of your workforce requires a fundamentally different approach than verifying customers.<br><br>The stakes are simply higher. For customer verification, the primary goal is often a smooth, low-friction sign-up process. For your workforce, the goal is ironclad security to prevent a breach. The reality is that many IDV solutions on the market are repurposed customer onboarding tools, not purpose-built platforms designed to stop a skilled attacker from impersonating an employee.<br><br>This guide is designed to help you look beyond the surface-level features and assess whether a vendor can truly meet the security demands of a modern enterprise. Use these questions to find a genuine partner and a solution that is truly workforce-grade.</p> 
 Core Capabilities and Security  
<p>The foundation of any IDV solution is its ability to accurately verify an identity while defending against advanced, modern attacks.</p> 
 1. How do you protect against deepfakes and other advanced impersonation attacks?  
<p>To protect against modern threats, your first question should focus on a vendor's strategy for tackling sophisticated fraud. Threat actors now use AI to create deepfakes for both presentation attacks (showing a fake image to a camera) and injection attacks (bypassing the camera to feed a fake video stream directly into the system).</p> 
<p>A workforce-grade solution should deliver:</p> 
  
  Advanced Liveness Detection: The best solutions employ sophisticated liveness checks to distinguish between a live person and a spoof like a mask or recording.&nbsp;  
  Injection Attack Prevention: A vendor should offer technology that prevents attackers from bypassing on-device cameras, making it nearly impossible to inject a deepfake into the verification stream.  
  
 2. What verification methods do you offer beyond a simple document check?  
<p>While document verification is essential, a resilient IDV platform must offer a wide array of options to create a multi-layered defense and ensure all employees can be verified successfully.</p> 
<p>A top-tier vendor should provide a flexible framework that includes:</p> 
  
  Geolocation and IP Intelligence: A modern IDV solution should analyze passive risk signals like the user's IP address and device location.  
  Biometric Matching: Comparing a user's live selfie to the portrait on their government ID is a necessary feature for modern verification.  
  Workforce-Specific Workflows: The most innovative solutions provide methods uniquely suited for an enterprise environment. One such powerful, context-aware method is manager attestation, where a supervisor can digitally vouch for an employee's identity through secure chat or video call.  
  
 Deployment and Integration  
<p>A solution's value is directly tied to how well it integrates with your existing technology stack without causing major disruptions.</p> 
 3. How does your solution integrate with our key workforce workflows and technology stack?  
<p>To avoid creating information silos and clunky workarounds, an IDV solution's value multiplies when it is deeply embedded into the systems where identity is most critical. For maximum efficiency and security, a vendor should offer:</p> 
  
  IAM and IdP Integration: Out-of-the-box connectors for major Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Identity Provider (IdP) platforms like Okta, Microsoft Azure AD, and Ping are crucial for managing employee access and credential resets.  
  Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS): To combat candidate fraud early in the hiring process, integrations with ATS platforms to verify an applicant's identity, ensuring the person you interview is the person you hire are important.  
  Help Desk and Ticketing Systems: The ability to integrate into your existing help desk or ticketing platform is essential for securely handling high-risk workflows like password and MFA resets.  
  SIEM Integration: A vendor should be able to seamlessly integrate with your SIEM systems. This allows your security team to feed identity event logs into a centralized platform for auditing, threat analysis, and compliance monitoring.  
  Standards-Based Integration: Look for solutions built on open standards like OIDC and SAML, as this ensures broad compatibility and future-proofs your investment.&nbsp;  
  
 4. What is the deployment process like, and what resources are required from my team?  
<p>The deployment model should align with your organization's infrastructure and technical capabilities. A cloud-native platform offers superior scalability and easier integration. For organizations looking to address urgent threats, it's best to prioritize vendors that offer ready-to-use solutions rather than a lengthy, resource-intensive implementation project.</p> 
 The User Experience  
<p>Security measures should empower productivity, not hinder it. The employee experience is paramount for adoption and success.</p> 
 5. What is the end-user journey like for initial verification and future re-verifications?  
<p>The process should be fast, intuitive, and require minimal effort from the employee. The best user experience is achieved through:</p> 
  
  App-less Workflows: Forcing users to download a separate application creates unnecessary friction. A vendor should offer app-less web experiences that allow users to complete verification on any device with a browser.  
  Seamless Re-verification: It is critical that a solution is designed to handle re-verification and the re-binding of an identity to a new device. Products that treat every verification as a one-time event are poorly suited for managing the employee lifecycle, where device changes are common.  
  
 6. Do you support flexible workflows for different risk levels and use cases, like help desk support?  
<p>A one-size-fits-all approach to identity verification is inefficient. A modern IDV platform must allow for fully customizable and configurable workflows that can be tailored to specific use cases and risk levels. For example, a vendor should be able to integrate with your call center operations. This allows help desk agents to securely trigger a verification flow before performing high-risk actions like a password reset, which is a common vector for attack.</p> 
 Security, Compliance, and Data Privacy  
<p>Handling sensitive employee data requires the highest, non-negotiable standards of security and certified compliance.</p> 
 7. What are your security certifications and how do you ensure compliance with data privacy regulations?  
<p>A reputable vendor must demonstrate its commitment to security through widely recognized, independent certifications. You should require proof of:</p> 
  
  Security and Trust Certifications: SOC 2, ISO, and FIDO2 certifications are essential benchmarks.  
  Regulatory Compliance: The solution must support compliance with data privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA, as well as regulations like HIPAA.  
  Identity Standards Adherence: The platform should be compliant with identity standards from NIST, ideally up to Identity Assurance Level 3 (IAL3) for the highest-risk environments.  
  
 8. How do you store and protect our employees' personally identifiable information (PII)?  
<p>A vendor's data handling policies are a direct reflection of its security posture. The ideal approach is one that minimizes your organization's data exposure. You should look for a vendor that:</p> 
  
  Employs Strong Encryption: All data, both at-rest and in-transit, must be encrypted using strong standards like AES-256.  
  Minimizes Data Retention: The best practice is to hold Personally Identifiable Information (PII) for the shortest time necessary. An attestation-only model, where the raw data is destroyed after a short period, significantly reduces your risk and is superior to models that store PII indefinitely.  
  
 Finding Your Workforce Identity Verification Partner  
<p>Choosing an IDV vendor is about more than buying a tool; it's about establishing a partnership to navigate evolving threats. By asking these questions, you can identify a provider who understands the unique challenges of workforce security and is committed to your long-term success.</p> 
<p>At HYPR, we built our HYPR Affirm solution on these foundational principles. We believe that true workforce security demands purpose-built technology that is both highly secure and easy to use. It’s why leading global organizations, like two of the four largest U.S. banks, trust HYPR to protect their employees and data.<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.hypr.com/request-a-demo"></a></p>

<p>Every digital interaction is a chance to build trust or break it. Today’s customers are more privacy-conscious, security-aware, and experience-driven than ever, and they’ve never had more options. One broken login flow, one unnecessary verification step, one untrustworthy interface, and they’re gone—often for good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, why do some customers remain loyal to certain brands, while others abandon their carts, apps, or accounts with a single frustrating click?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The answer is trust. And increasingly, trust is powered by modern identity.</p>

This guide will uncover the best ways to earn free NFT in 2025, from participating in community airdrops and play-to-earn games to exploring free minting opportunities.</p>

 What Are NFTs? 



<p><a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-an-nft">NFTs are unique digital assets</a> recorded on blockchains like Solana or Ethereum.

You can acquire digital assets without any financial investment, reducing the barrier to entry and giving you a chance to explore the ecosystem with high reward potential if the <a href="https://opensea.io/">NFT’s value</a> grows.</p>



 Why Use Herond Browser for Web3? 



<p>Enhanced Security Against Scams</p>



<p>When exploring the Web3 ecosystem, security is paramount. Herond Browser features a powerful, built-in ad-blocker and advanced tracker protection.

 Upgrading Legacy Blockchain Systems with AI-Native Infrastructure  Case Study: NHIS and Aergo. A Blueprint for Public Sector Blockchain Adoption  Background <p>The National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) of Korea pioneered blockchain adoption in the public sector by launching a high-throughput Timestamping Authority (TSA) system built on the Aergo Enterprise platform. This system verifies and records the issuance of key documents, including insurance contracts, care applications, and official certifications, with over 400,000 transactions processed daily. The system is projected to handle over 1.8 million transactions per day once the upcoming services are fully deployed.</p> Key Features of the Aergo-Based TSA   Immutable Timestamping: Each document issuance is timestamped and anchored to the Aergo blockchain.  System Integration: Deployed with zero downtime, fully integrated into NHIS’s legacy&nbsp;systems.  Environmental Efficiency: Reduced reliance on paper documentation and physical verification processes.  Security &amp; Auditability: Enhanced traceability and document verification for public trust and regulatory compliance.  <p>This Aergo-powered system is widely recognized as one of the most successful enterprise blockchain deployments in the public&nbsp;sector.</p> How HPP Could Evolve the NHIS TSA: From Timestamping to Intelligence <p>Although HPP is not currently implemented by NHIS, future upgrades of similar public systems could benefit significantly from integration with HPP’s AI-native infrastructure. The House Party Protocol is designed to enhance legacy blockchain systems by combining verifiable AI execution, decentralized governance, and modular scalability.</p><p>Here’s how HPP could enhance a use case like NHIS’s TSA&nbsp;system:</p> 1. Real-Time Fraud Detection Using AI&nbsp;Agents <p>Current Limitation<br> Fraud detection in the current TSA is largely external or manual, relying on human audits or external tools to identify document forgery, duplicate claims, or anomalous patterns.</p><p>HPP Advantage<br> HPP integrates a Fraud Detection System (FDS) that uses intelligent agents to flag suspicious behaviors in real-time. For&nbsp;example:</p>  Detecting attempts to submit forged care applications or duplicate insurance claims.  Flagging statistically abnormal combinations (e.g., elderly care requests submitted by unusually young applicants).  <p>These agents run on ArenAI, HPP’s AI execution layer, and automatically initiate fraud reviews, reducing risk while accelerating operational trust.</p> 2. Document Intelligence Through Noösphere +&nbsp;SLM <p>Current Limitation<br> The Aergo TSA verifies the timestamp and issuance of documents, but not the content of documents. There’s no native understanding or validation of what is inside each&nbsp;form.</p><p>HPP Advantage<br> HPP’s Noösphere infrastructure powers off-chain SLM (Small Language Model) inference, enabling systems&nbsp;to:</p>  Analyze document contents for consistency (e.g., checking for contradicting information across multiple submissions).  Classify and tag public documents automatically.  Feed results into smart contracts that enforce policy (e.g., deny requests that don’t meet minimum medical criteria).  <p>This creates a hybrid system where off-chain AI logic is made on-chain verifiable through Proof-of-Inference, increasing transparency and auditability for automated decisions.</p> Final Thought <p>As public institutions pursue digital transformation, the NHIS case offers a proven foundation. However, the next generation of infrastructure will require more than just timestamping. HPP demonstrates how AI-native Layer 2 blockchain architecture can enhance public systems into intelligent, verifiable, and programmable digital services — transitioning beyond record-keeping to real-time decision-making and automation.</p><p>Note: The HPP enhancements described are exploratory and not affiliated with NHIS at the time of&nbsp;writing.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/how-hpp-could-transform-public-blockchain-use-b0a4191db725">How HPP Could Transform Public Blockchain Use</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Helpdesks are critical support hubs, but their central role makes them prime targets for sophisticated social engineering attacks. These attacks exploit human psychology, tricking helpdesk personnel into divulging sensitive information or compromising security, often by targeting credential resets. When attackers convince an agent to reset a legitimate user's password, they bypass security, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data. The devastating impact was demonstrated by the 2023 MGM attack, reportedly initiated via a helpdesk social engineering tactic, causing significant disruptions and financial losses. Understanding and preventing these threats is crucial for organizational strength.</p> 
 Defining Helpdesk Social Engineering Attacks  
<p>Helpdesk social engineering attacks are sophisticated tactics where cybercriminals manipulate helpdesk personnel through deception. The core objective is unauthorized access, often via credential resets. Attackers impersonate legitimate users, perhaps an executive needing urgent access, using publicly available information to sound convincing. This circumvents technical defenses, allowing free movement within networks for data exfiltration, ransomware deployment, or further attacks. The 2023 MGM breach, costing over $100 million in reported damages, exemplifies the profound financial and reputational harm from such a successful helpdesk social engineering attack.</p> 
 How Common Social Engineering Attacks Are Performed on Helpdesks  
<p>A typical helpdesk social engineering attack is a carefully orchestrated sequence:</p> 
  
  Reconnaissance: Attackers gather employee details from public sources (social media, company websites, data breaches) to create a believable persona.  
  Impersonation: They contact the helpdesk, posing as a legitimate employee, often a high-authority figure or a distressed user, sometimes using caller ID spoofing or deepfake voice technology.  
  Exploiting Weak Verification: Attackers exploit flaws like knowledge-based authentication (KBA), finding answers through research or dark web data to bypass security questions.  
  Building Trust and Pressure: They use psychological tactics: 
    
    Urgency: Creating immediate crises to rush the agent.  
    Authority: Impersonating executives to imply repercussions for delays.  
    Insider Knowledge: Using researched details to sound credible.  
      
  Credential Reset/Modification: Trust established, they convince the agent to reset a password or enroll a new MFA device.  
  Exploitation: With new credentials, they gain unauthorized access for data exfiltration, malware installation, or fraud.  
  
<p>These attacks are prevalent; reports from 2023 indicated that a significant percentage of organizations experienced credential compromises linked to social engineering, with an increasing shift to voice and video-based tactics.</p> 
   
<p>Train your helpdesk staff to adopt a mindset of "verify, don't trust." This means questioning every request for credential changes or sensitive access, regardless of how urgent or authoritative the request seems. Always use established, out-of-band verification methods, such as calling the user back on a pre-registered, known phone number, rather than relying solely on information provided during the current interaction.</p> 
 The Weakest Link: Flaws in Traditional Identity Verification  
<p>Traditional helpdesk identity verification methods often present critical vulnerabilities:</p> 
  
  Reliance on Knowledge-Based Authentication (KBA): Easily compromised as answers to security questions are often publicly available or found in data breaches.  
  Static Credentials (e.g., Passwords): Vulnerable to phishing and brute-force attacks; a compromised password grants persistent access.  
  Lack of Multi-Factor Verification Enforcement: Helpdesks may have weak processes allowing MFA bypass or re-enrollment without stringent identity proofing.  
  Human Error and Pressure: Agents, under pressure and manipulation (urgency, authority), may overlook red flags or deviate from protocols.  
  Inconsistent Procedures: Lack of standardized verification protocols allows attackers to "shop around" for a less vigilant agent.  
  
<p>The inherent limitations of static credentials, once compromised, give attackers sustained access, enabling extensive network exploration and damage before detection.&nbsp;</p> 
 Implementing Low-Friction Authentication<br>  
<p>Low-friction authentication is crucial to combating helpdesk social engineering by making authentication seamless without compromising security. Complex, slow processes can inadvertently lead staff to bypass protocols or fall prey to quick-fix social engineering.</p> 
<p>Passwordless authentication eliminates the primary target for phishing—passwords—and offers numerous benefits:<br></p> 
  
  Enhanced Security: FIDO-based solutions use phishing-resistant public-key cryptography, making compromise significantly harder.  
  Superior Usability: Eliminates password memory burdens, frequent resets, and lockouts, providing a faster, intuitive login for users and reducing password-related helpdesk calls.  
  Reduced Attack Surface: No passwords to steal, crack, or breach, drastically shrinking potential attack vectors.  
  Cost Savings: Directly reduces helpdesk call volumes related to password issues, translating into significant operational savings.<br>  
  
<p>Biometrics, for example, transforms login into a natural, quick action while providing a higher level of security assurance.</p> 
 The Role of Generative AI in Helpdesk Social Engineering Attacks  
<p>Generative AI, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and deepfake technology, is rapidly enhancing the sophistication and scale of helpdesk social engineering attacks, making them harder to detect. For a deeper dive, read our blog on <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/preventing-generative-ai-attacks">preventing generative AI attacks</a>.&nbsp;<br></p> 
<p>AI's role includes:<br></p> 
  
  Advanced Pretexting: LLMs generate highly plausible, contextually aware scripts for calls, emails, or chats, mimicking corporate language and adapting tone for credibility.  
  Deepfake Voice Cloning: AI clones target voices from audio samples, enabling convincing "vishing" attacks where helpdesk agents believe they're speaking with the legitimate person. This was a key concern highlighted in HHS alerts.  
  Deepfake Video: While still evolving for real-time helpdesk use, deepfake video could enable visual impersonation during video calls, adding another layer of authenticity.  
  Automated and Scalable Attacks: AI automates reconnaissance, personalized message generation, and simultaneous social engineering attempts, allowing large-scale, targeted campaigns with less manual effort.  
  Adaptive Strategies: AI systems can learn and refine their deceptive approaches based on responses, increasing their agility and making them harder to defend against with static security measures.<br>  
  
   
<p>As generative AI makes impersonation easier, organizations must move beyond knowledge-based authentication. Implement identity verification methods that are inherently resistant to AI-generated fakes, such as live liveness detection for biometrics or multi-factor verification that relies on device-bound cryptographic keys rather than shared secrets.<br></p> 
 Real-World Examples of Helpdesk Social Engineering  
<p>The threat of helpdesk social engineering is not theoretical; it's a proven and ongoing attack vector. Here are some notable instances and warnings:</p> 
 HHS Sector Alert  
<p>Helpdesk social engineering is a persistent threat. The Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center (HC3) within the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS) has issued alerts detailing sophisticated tactics.</p> 
<p>HHS Sector Alert: HC3 highlighted threat actors (e.g., "Scattered Spider") using advanced social engineering. These attackers call helpdesks, impersonating employees (often in financial roles), using sensitive, likely breached, information (e.g., last four SSN digits) to pass initial verification. They then claim a broken phone, persuading helpdesk staff to enroll a new, attacker-controlled MFA device. This grants access to corporate resources, exploited for payment fraud or ransomware. HHS specifically noted the potential for AI voice impersonation, making remote identity verification increasingly challenging.<br></p> 
 How to Prevent the Helpdesk from Social Engineering  
<p>Preventing helpdesk social engineering requires a multi-faceted approach combining strong technology, comprehensive training, and robust policies.<br></p> 
 Using Deterministic Controls to Stop Social Engineering Attacks  
<p>Stopping AI-fueled social engineering and deepfake attacks means adopting deterministic controls over probabilistic methods like passwords. Deterministic controls offer higher certainty about user identity, often involving multi-factor verification (MFV) that uses inherently secure and hard-to-spoof methods.<br></p> 
<p>Recommended steps to harden the credential reset process:<br></p> 
  
  Implement Phishing-Resistant MFA: Prioritize FIDO2-based authentication (e.g., hardware security keys, biometrics with device-bound keys) which uses public-key cryptography, making it resistant to phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks. This should be a baseline for sensitive access and helpdesk-initiated changes.  
  Introduce Dynamic Verification: 
    
    Identity Proofing: Require strong identity proofing for account creation and high-risk operations like resets. This includes live liveness detection during video calls or leveraging trusted third-party services.  
    Out-of-Band Verification: Always verify identity via a channel not controlled by the attacker, such as calling a pre-registered phone number or sending a code to a secure, verified email.  
      
  Limit Resets via Secure Channels &amp; Enforce Stringent Escalation: Define strict protocols for resets. Require multi-layer approvals for high-risk requests and implement "cooling-off" periods for new device enrollments from unusual locations. Exceptions should involve supervisory review and additional robust identity proofing.  
  Emphasize Automation and Self-Service: Empower users with secure self-service password reset and account recovery using strong, phishing-resistant MFA. This reduces helpdesk burden and minimizes the attack surface.<br>  
  
 Strengthening Workplace Security with Robust Identity Proofing  
<p>Effective identity proofing is paramount for preventing unauthorized access. While authentication confirms credential possession, identity proofing confirms the claimant's true identity, crucial against social engineering where attackers have valid information but aren't the legitimate user.</p> 
 
  
   
   
   
  
  
<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Robust identity proofing practices are essential throughout the employee lifecycle:</p> 
  
  Onboarding: Ensures only legitimate employees gain initial access through verified IDs, background checks, and biometric enrollment.  
  High-Risk Transactions/Requests: For actions like helpdesk password resets or sensitive data access, identity proofing should be re-applied or elevated. This includes biometric verification with liveness detection, document verification, or live video verification with a trained agent.  
  Continuous Monitoring: Integrating identity proofing with continuous monitoring detects anomalous behavior, triggering strong proofing protocols if a user attempts unusual actions (e.g., new device enrollment from a foreign IP).  
  
<p>Strengthening identity proofing builds a more resilient defense against social engineering, significantly hindering impersonation attempts.</p>

HYPR Affirm offers essential tools for AI-resistant identity assurance, enabling organizations to prevent attacks and achieve comprehensive passwordless security.</p> 
 FAQs  
<p>Q: Why Is Social Engineering Effective? A: Social engineering works by exploiting human psychology (trust, urgency, fear) to manipulate individuals into making mistakes or divulging information, often through convincing fabricated scenarios or impersonation.</p> 
<p>Q: How are Helpdesks Targeted in AI Voice Cloning Attacks? A: Attackers use AI to mimic an employee's voice from audio samples, then call the helpdesk, posing as that individual. They request sensitive actions like password resets or new device enrollments, often claiming urgency or a broken device to bypass MFA.</p> 
<p>Q: What is an Example of a Social Engineering Attack? A: A vishing attack where an attacker calls a helpdesk, impersonating an executive who "forgot" their password. Using publicly available details, they pressure the agent to bypass verification and reset credentials for a "critical project."</p>

<p>A second phone number is&nbsp;an additional phone number that you can use on your existing device, separate from your primary number.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You use a second phone number to shield your personal phone number in situations where you don’t want to give out your private line.</p>



<p>Second phone numbers (or secondary phone numbers, as they’re sometimes called) can be either tied to a traditional SIM or operate on an internet connection (VoIP numbers). VoIP or “voice over IP” phone numbers are assigned to a user and not to a physical location. A VoIP second phone number is often called a virtual phone number.</p>



<p>Second phone numbers are usually kept permanently or long-term for things like separating work and personal life, signing up for services, travelling, shopping online, and interacting with people and organizations you don’t know or trust. They can help you organize your communications, manage and secure accounts and services, reduce the risk of scams to your private line, and protect against unwanted contact.</p>



<p>Considering a person’s personal phone number is the <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/shocking-privacy-facts-our-ceo-told-naomi-brockwell-about-cell-phones/">most valuable piece of data</a> to <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-privacy-pitfalls-of-personalized-advertising/">advertisers</a>, <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/how-data-brokers-find-and-sell-your-personal-information/">data brokers</a> and <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/the-top-10-ways-bad-actors-use-your-stolen-personal-information/">criminals</a>, shielding it with a second phone number is a smart privacy move. But what can be even smarter is protecting your personal phone number with a bunch of secondary phone numbers and using them for <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/why-compartmentalizing-your-private-data-is-simple-with-mysudo/">different purposes in your work and personal life</a>.</p>

             What if machines could think fast - but humans still made the call? 
<p>Human-Machine Teaming (HMT) is transforming the tempo and effectiveness of military operations. As AI and autonomous systems proliferate, HMT provides a pathway to harness these technologies while preserving human judgement, accountability, and ethical oversight. This article explores the components, challenges and strategic implications of HMT - and why it matters now more than ever.</p>
 Why HMT is a Defence Imperative 
<p>As warfare becomes more data-rich and multi-domain, decision-making must keep pace. AI and autonomy offer an edge - faster analysis, predictive insights, and operational agility - but only if integrated in a way that upholds trust, legality, and clarity over decision making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Human-Machine Teaming blends human intuition with machine efficiency. In doing so, it enables better decisions under pressure, enhances resilience across domains, and aligns with the UK's strategic defence objectives.</p>
 What Human-Machine Teaming Really Means 
<p>HMT is not about replacing people. It’s about integrating AI into workflows in a way that enhances, rather than overrides, human oversight. Depending on the operational scenario, different interaction models apply:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Human-in-the-Loop (HITL): Humans retain full control, using AI for suggestions or data processing.<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Human-on-the-Loop (HOTL): AI executes tasks with human supervision and veto rights.<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Human-out-of-the-Loop (HOOTL): AI operates autonomously in pre-defined, bounded scenarios.</p>
<p>Designing the right level of autonomy for each mission type is key. Trust and transparency are not optional - they are foundational.</p>
 Designing for Human Needs – Not Just Tech Specs 
<p>Sociotechnical system design recognises that technology and its users are deeply interconnected. A User-Centred Design (UCD) approach helps ensure that AI tools are not just technically capable but operationally usable - understanding not only what the system does, but how, when and why humans interact with it.<br>
Effective HMT depends on this holistic understanding: the tasks, contexts, cognitive loads, and decision paths of real-world operators.</p>
 The Role - and Limits - of AI in Decision-Making 
<p>AI excels at processing high volumes of data - from sensor feeds to open-source intelligence - and can surface critical insights at speed. But without explainability, even the most sophisticated AI may be unusable in high-stakes environments.</p>
<p>Mission-ready AI systems must be:<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Explainable: Able to show how and why a recommendation was made.<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Reliable: Consistently accurate under variable conditions.<br>
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Aligned: Reflective of commander intent and mission objectives.</p>
<p>Importantly, AI isn’t always the right answer. Sometimes simpler solutions such as conventional deterministic algorithms may be more suitable.</p>
 Addressing Human Factors: Cognitive Load and Trust 
<p>Operators face immense cognitive demands, especially in ambiguous or fast-moving scenarios. The best HMT systems reduce complexity, offering clear, intuitive interfaces and enabling confident, accountable decision-making.</p>
<p>But trust must be earned. Trust is the cornerstone of Human-Machine Teaming. Operators need to feel in control, even when machines act autonomously</p>
<p>Over-reliance on automation can lead to skill fade; lack of trust can result in underuse. Striking the right balance - and training operators to understand both the strengths and limits of AI - is critical.</p>
<p>Ethical and Legal Responsibility: Why Human Oversight Matters</p>
<p>The UK’s Ministry of Defence is clear: the integration of AI must uphold International Humanitarian Law and moral accountability. The principle of Meaningful Human Control ensures humans remain responsible - even in the use of lethal force.</p>
<p>JSP 936: Dependable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in defence is the policy framework governing the safe and responsible adoption of AI in MoD. It requires:</p>
 
 Transparent AI design 
 Clear chains of command 
 Robust validation and testing 
 Guardrails to prevent bias or adversarial exploitation 
 
<p>These aren’t checkboxes. They’re essential to operational legitimacy and public trust.</p>
 Barriers to Adoption - and How to Overcome Them 
<p>Despite the benefits, barriers to seamless HMT adoption remain:</p>
 
 Data Interoperability: Legacy systems and siloed data hinder integration. 
 Infrastructure Constraints: AI capabilities may outpace existing platforms. 
 Training Gaps: Operators must be equipped to interpret AI outputs - not just act on them. 
 
<p>Solutions include test environments (‘sandboxes’), joint human-AI training, and inclusive design processes that involve end users from day one.</p>
 Strategic Alignment and Future Roadmap 
<p>HMT aligns directly with the UK’s Strategic Defence Review, which prioritises AI, data exploitation and multi-domain integration. As a key enabler of faster, decentralised operations, HMT supports defence ambitions for greater agility and resilience.</p>
<p>Thales UK, with partners, is actively:</p>
 
 Developing common frameworks to support HMT evaluation 
 Embedding human sciences into system design 
 Collaborating with users to ensure real-world relevance 
 Supporting ethical standards for autonomy in defence 
 
 What Comes Next? 
<p>To realise the full potential of HMT, the defence community must commit to sustained investment in:</p>
 
 Human-centred AI R&amp;D 
 Training and skills development 
 Transparent procurement processes 
 Cross-sector collaboration with industry and academia 
 
<p>Human-Machine Teaming isn’t a future vision - it’s today’s operational need. As the pace and complexity of operations increase, defence forces must adopt technologies that support faster, more informed decision-making. This should be done with an ethical-AI by design approach, that preserves moral and legal accountability, but retains the pace of relevance.</p>

 Introduction <p>The convergence of AI and blockchain technology is no longer a futuristic concept — it’s happening now. Imagine large language models (LLMs) like Claude or ChatGPT directly interacting with blockchain networks. Developers could build decentralized applications in a far more intuitive and efficient manner.</p><p>We’ve developed the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the Metadium blockchain to make this vision a reality. This server empowers AI models to interact with the Metadium network using natural language, enabling seamless accessTJ to core blockchain functions.</p><p>(This technology is already integrated into MChat, which was recently launched.)</p> Metadium + MCP: A Perfect&nbsp;Match <p>Metadium is a next-generation blockchain platform optimized for decentralized identity (DID) management. It supports DID protocols, smart contracts, and token standards such as MRC20 and MRC721, allowing users to retain complete control over their digital identities.</p><p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP), developed by Anthropic, enables AI models to interact with external systems in a structured way. With MCP, AI can go beyond text generation and execute real-world tasks through direct system integration.</p> Key Features  1. Comprehensive Account Management <p>The Metadium MCP server supports a wide range of blockchain account operations:</p>  Balance Check: Retrieve METADIUM token balances for up to 20 addresses simultaneously  Transaction History: Access both external and internal transaction logs  Token Tracking: View MRC20 and MRC721 token holdings and transfer&nbsp;activity  Mining Records: Trace mined blocks by a specific&nbsp;address   @mcp.tool()<br>async def get_metadium_balance(addresses: List[str]) -&gt; Dict[str, Any]:<br>"""Get METADIUM Balance for one or more addresses (max 20)"""<br>if len(addresses) == 0 or len(addresses) &gt; 20:<br>raise ValueError("addresses must contain 1–20 items")<br># … implementation details  2. Smart Contract Integration <p>Developers can seamlessly interact with smart contracts:</p>  ABI Retrieval: Access verified contracts’ Application Binary Interface  Source Code: View the source code of verified contracts  Contract Verification: Automate source code verification for new contracts   3. DID&nbsp;Support <p>Specialized tools for managing Metadium’s decentralized identity&nbsp;system:</p>  DID Stats: Track issuance by hour, day, or&nbsp;month  Total Issuance: Retrieve the real-time total number of issued&nbsp;DIDs   async def get_total_issued_dids() -&gt; Dict[str, Any]:<br>"""Get total number of issued DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers)"""<br>function_selector = "0xa1707e7b" # Call the nextEIN() function<br>call_data = {"to": MAINNET_DID_REGISTRY, "data": function_selector}<br># … Contract call via JSON-RPC  4. Full Ethereum JSON-RPC Compatibility <p>As an Ethereum-compatible blockchain, Metadium supports all standard JSON-RPC API functions:</p>  Block Info: Retrieve detailed block data by hash or&nbsp;number  Transaction Handling: Send transactions, track status, and fetch&nbsp;receipts  Gas Estimation: Predict gas requirements for transactions  Event Logs: Filter and view smart contract event&nbsp;logs   Technical Architecture  Modular Design <p>The MCP server is organized into clearly separated modules:</p> ├── api_client.py # HTTP/JSON-RPC client<br>├── accounts/ # Account-related features<br>├── contracts/ # Smart contract features<br>├── eth_namespace/ # Ethereum-compatible API<br>├── statistics/ # Network statistics<br>└── others.py # Utility functions  Asynchronous Processing <p>All blockchain interactions use Python’s async/await to ensure high performance and responsiveness through concurrent requests:</p> async def make_jsonrpc_request(<br>method: str, params: List[Any] = None, request_id: int = 1<br>) -&gt; Dict[str, Any]:<br>async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:<br>response = await client.post(JSONRPC_API_BASE, headers=headers, json=payload)<br>return response.json()  Human-Friendly Data Transformation <p>Hexadecimal blockchain data is automatically converted into readable decimal format for both AI models and end&nbsp;users:</p> def add_decimal_fields_to_block(block_data: Dict[str, Any]) -&gt; Dict[str, Any]:<br>hex_fields = ["baseFeePerGas", "difficulty", "gasLimit", "gasUsed", …]<br>for field in hex_fields:<br>if field in result and result[field].startswith("0x"):<br>decimal_value = hex_to_decimal(result[field])<br>modified_result[f"{field}_decimal"] = decimal_value  Real-World Use&nbsp;Cases  1. AI-Powered Blockchain Analytics <p>Developers can ask Claude natural-language queries&nbsp;like:</p><p>“Analyze DID issuance patterns over the past 7 days and list all MRC20 token transfers from this contract in chronological order.”</p> 2. Smart Contract Development Support <p>Smart contract developers can speed up their workflows:</p><p>“Fetch the ABI of this contract, estimate gas costs for each function, and suggest optimization strategies.”</p> 3. DeFi Application Monitoring <p>DeFi operators can monitor systems in real-time:</p><p>“Calculate the total value locked (TVL) in our protocol and summarize key events over the past 24&nbsp;hours.”</p> Closing Thoughts <p>The Metadium MCP server is an innovative tool that bridges the gap between AI and blockchain. By enabling developers to interact with decentralized systems using natural language instead of complex APIs, it lowers the barrier to entry for building powerful Web3 applications.</p><p>The integration of Metadium — pioneering in decentralized identity — with cutting-edge AI capabilities opens up new possibilities across the blockchain ecosystem. We hope this tool empowers more developers to explore the world of Web3 and build truly transformative applications for the next digital&nbsp;era.</p><p>The Metadium&nbsp;Team</p> Metadium 블록체인을 위한 MCP 서버: AI와 디지털 신원 관리의 새로운&nbsp;만남  들어가며 <p>인공지능과 블록체인 기술의 융합은 더 이상 먼 미래의 이야기가 아닙니다. 특히 Claude, ChatGPT와 같은 대규모 언어 모델(LLM)이 블록체인 네트워크와 직접 상호작용할 수 있다면, 개발자들은 훨씬 더 직관적이고 효율적인 방식으로 탈중앙화 애플리케이션을 구축할 수 있을&nbsp;것입니다.</p><p>이러한 비전을 실현하기 위해, 우리는 Metadium 블록체인을 위한 Model Context Protocol(MCP) 서버를 개발했습니다. 이 서버는 AI 모델이 Metadium 네트워크의 다양한 기능들을 자연어로 쉽게 활용할 수 있도록 도와주는 혁신적인&nbsp;도구입니다.</p><p>(이 기술은 최근에 서비스를 시작한 MChat에 적용되었습니다.)</p> Metadium과 MCP: 완벽한&nbsp;조합 <p>Metadium은 디지털 신원 관리에 특화된 차세대 블록체인 플랫폼입니다. 분산 신원 증명(DID), 스마트 컨트랙트, 그리고 다양한 토큰 표준(MRC20, MRC721)을 지원하며, 사용자들이 자신의 디지털 신원을 완전히 통제할 수 있는 환경을&nbsp;제공합니다.</p><p>Model Context Protocol(MCP)은 Anthropic에서 개발한 프로토콜로, AI 모델이 외부 시스템과 구조화된 방식으로 상호작용할 수 있게 해줍니다. 이를 통해 AI는 단순한 텍스트 생성을 넘어서 실제 시스템과의 통합된 작업을 수행할 수&nbsp;있습니다.</p> 핵심 기능&nbsp;살펴보기  1. 포괄적인 계정&nbsp;관리 <p>Metadium MCP 서버는 블록체인 계정과 관련된 모든 작업을&nbsp;지원합니다:</p>  잔액 조회: 최대 20개 주소의 METADIUM 토큰 잔액을 한 번에&nbsp;확인  트랜잭션 내역: 일반 트랜잭션부터 내부 트랜잭션까지 상세한 이력&nbsp;추적  토큰 관리: MRC20과 MRC721 토큰의 전송 내역 및 보유 현황&nbsp;조회  채굴 이력: 특정 주소가 채굴한 블록 목록&nbsp;확인   @mcp.tool()<br>async def get_metadium_balance(addresses: List[str]) -&gt; Dict[str, Any]:<br>"""Get METADIUM Balance for one or more addresses (max 20)"""<br>if len(addresses) == 0 or len(addresses) &gt; 20:<br>raise ValueError("addresses must contain 1–20 items")<br># … 구현 세부사항  2. 스마트 컨트랙트&nbsp;통합 <p>개발자들이 가장 관심을 가질 만한 기능 중 하나는 스마트 컨트랙트와의 완벽한&nbsp;통합입니다:</p>  ABI 조회: 검증된 컨트랙트의 Application Binary Interface 정보&nbsp;추출  소스 코드 확인: 검증된 컨트랙트의 원본 소스 코드&nbsp;조회  컨트랙트 검증: 새로운 컨트랙트의 소스 코드 검증 프로세스&nbsp;자동화   3. DID(Decentralized Identifiers) 지원 <p>Metadium의 핵심 기능인 분산 신원 관리를 위한 특별한 도구들을&nbsp;제공합니다:</p>  DID 통계: 시간별, 일별, 월별 DID 발급 현황&nbsp;추적  총 발급량 조회: 현재까지 발급된 전체 DID 수량 실시간&nbsp;확인   async def get_total_issued_dids() -&gt; Dict[str, Any]:<br>"""Get total number of issued DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers)"""<br>function_selector = "0xa1707e7b" # nextEIN() 함수 호출<br>call_data = {"to": MAINNET_DID_REGISTRY, "data": function_selector}<br># … JSON-RPC를 통한 컨트랙트 호출  4. 완전한 Ethereum JSON-RPC&nbsp;호환성 <p>Metadium은 Ethereum과 호환되는 블록체인이므로, 표준 Ethereum JSON-RPC API를 모두&nbsp;지원합니다:</p>  블록 정보: 블록 해시나 번호로 상세한 블록 정보&nbsp;조회  트랜잭션 처리: 트랜잭션 전송, 상태 확인, 영수증&nbsp;조회  가스 추정: 트랜잭션 실행 전 필요한 가스량 정확한&nbsp;예측  이벤트 로그: 스마트 컨트랙트 이벤트 필터링 및&nbsp;조회   기술적 아키텍처  모듈형 설계 <p>이 MCP 서버는 기능별로 명확하게 분리된 모듈형 아키텍처를&nbsp;채택했습니다:</p> ├── api_client.py # HTTP/JSON-RPC 클라이언트<br>├── accounts/ # 계정 관련 기능<br>├── contracts/ # 스마트 컨트랙트 기능<br>├── eth_namespace/ # Ethereum 호환 API<br>├── statistics/ # 네트워크 통계<br>└── others.py # 유틸리티 함수들  비동기 처리 <p>모든 블록체인 호출은 Python의 async/await를 사용하여 비동기적으로 처리됩니다. 이를 통해 여러 요청을 동시에 처리할 수 있어 성능과 응답성이 크게&nbsp;향상됩니다:</p> async def make_jsonrpc_request(<br>method: str, params: List[Any] = None, request_id: int = 1<br>) -&gt; Dict[str, Any]:<br>async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:<br>response = await client.post(JSONRPC_API_BASE, headers=headers, json=payload)<br>return response.json()  데이터 변환 및 사용자&nbsp;친화성 <p>블록체인의 16진수 데이터를 자동으로 10진수로 변환하여 AI 모델과 사용자가 더 쉽게 이해할 수 있도록&nbsp;도와줍니다:</p> def add_decimal_fields_to_block(block_data: Dict[str, Any]) -&gt; Dict[str, Any]:<br>hex_fields = ["baseFeePerGas", "difficulty", "gasLimit", "gasUsed", …]<br>for field in hex_fields:<br>if field in result and result[field].startswith("0x"):<br>decimal_value = hex_to_decimal(result[field])<br>modified_result[f"{field}_decimal"] = decimal_value  실제 사용&nbsp;사례  1. AI 기반 블록체인 분석&nbsp;도구 <p>개발자들은 이제 Claude에게 자연어로 복잡한 블록체인 분석을 요청할 수&nbsp;있습니다:</p><p>“지난 7일간 가장 활발한 DID 발급 패턴을 분석하고, 특정 컨트랙트 주소의 모든 MRC20 토큰 전송 내역을 시간순으로&nbsp;정리해줘.”</p> 2. 스마트 컨트랙트 개발&nbsp;지원 <p>컨트랙트 개발자들은 AI의 도움을 받아 더 효율적으로 작업할 수&nbsp;있습니다:</p><p>“이 컨트랙트 주소의 ABI를 가져와서 모든 함수의 가스 사용량을 추정하고, 최적화 방안을&nbsp;제안해줘.”</p> 3. DeFi 애플리케이션&nbsp;모니터링 <p>DeFi 프로토콜 운영자들은 실시간으로 자신들의 애플리케이션을 모니터링할 수&nbsp;있습니다:</p><p>“우리 프로토콜의 총 예치량(TVL)을 계산하고, 지난 24시간 동안의 주요 이벤트들을&nbsp;요약해줘.”</p> 마치며 <p>Metadium MCP 서버는 AI와 블록체인의 경계를 허무는 혁신적인 도구입니다. 개발자들이 복잡한 블록체인 API를 직접 다루지 않고도 자연어를 통해 강력한 탈중앙화 애플리케이션을 구축할 수 있게&nbsp;해줍니다.</p><p>디지털 신원 관리의 미래를 선도하는 Metadium과 최첨단 AI 기술의 만남은 블록체인 생태계에 새로운 가능성을 열어줄 것입니다. 이 도구를 통해 더 많은 개발자들이 Web3의 세계에 쉽게 접근하고, 혁신적인 애플리케이션을 만들어나갈 수 있기를&nbsp;기대합니다.</p><p>메타디움 팀</p>  Website | <a href="https://metadium.com/">https://metadium.com</a>  Discord | <a href="https://discord.gg/ZnaCfYbXw2">https://discord.gg/ZnaCfYbXw2</a>  Telegram(KR) | <a href="https://t.me/metadiumofficialkor">https://t.me/metadiumofficialkor</a>  Twitter | <a href="https://twitter.com/MetadiumK">https://twitter.com/MetadiumK</a>  Medium | <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">https://medium.com/metadium</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/mcp-server-for-the-metadium-blockchain-bridging-ai-and-decentralized-identity-7bcb3857fdf1">MCP Server for the Metadium Blockchain: Bridging AI and Decentralized Identity</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Metadium</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Identity assurance is the goal 

<p>When we think about authentication, we think of gaining access to sensitive resources. We want some level of barrier so the data isn’t publicly available. It’s not enough to merely add a barrier, though. Wouldn’t it be more useful to have assurances that the user’s credentials are uniquely theirs and that no one can impersonate them? It’s more than a fence around the data; we also have assurances that the user accessing the data is who they say they are. It sounds great in theory.</p>

<p>We want to balance security requirements with our users’ comfort in an ideal world. Increased security requirements may increase user friction points. The more friction points a user encounters, the lower their satisfaction, engagement, and app usage – the balance point changes depending on the app user and the data sensitivity. For example, requirements may differ for public applications catering to consumers (B2C) versus internal applications used within an organization’s workforce.</p>

<p>Let’s navigate this balancing act together so you can find the right path for your needs.</p>

 Demystifying authentication factors 

<p>Before we dive into possible solutions, let’s review the three authentication factor categories:</p>



    
    
      Something you know <br>
      Knowledge factors include passwords and PINs
    


    
    
    Something you have<br>
    Possession factors include devices such as smart cards, security keys, phones, and tablets
    


    
    
    Something you are<br>
    Inference factors include biometrics such as fingerprints and facial recognition
    



<p>Authentication relies on one or more factor categories to establish identity assurances before granting users access to applications.</p>

 Embrace phishing-resistant authentication 

<p>The best-in-class, more secure, and recommended authentication methods are phishing-resistant. Phishing-resistant authentication is more difficult to hack and mitigates unauthorized access due to intercepting PINs and sign-in links.<br>
Phishing-resistant authentication relies on biometrics and specialized devices or equipment to prevent an attacker from accessing your application.</p>

<p>Phishing-resistant factors include the following forms.</p>

 Smart cards and PIV cards 

<p>Large enterprises, regulated industries, and government entities widely use smart cards and PIV cards. These organizations may issue smart cards for attaching personal profiles to shared workstation access, as seen in banks or hospitals. Organizations may issue cards to their workforce even when the employee uses an issued laptop as an extra security measure.</p>

<p>Pros: Secure, can be uniquely tied to the user, and well utilized in industries</p>

<p>Cons: Requires a physical device that can be lost or stolen, not scalable to use for public and consumer security due to hardware requirements and convenience</p>

 Security keys and hardware devices 

<p>Hardware security keys are another elevated security mechanism organizations use for their workforce. Security keys can have differing levels of security, from the older and less secure Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) keys, Near Field Communication (NFC) keys that require a secondary device such as a phone, and keys requiring biometrics. For the highest level of security, you’ll want to use keys and hardware with biometric capabilities. Security keys work by storing the credentials on hardware, which requires registering the key on each device you use. While keys that plug into computers may be familiar, biometric-capable hardware, such as a laptop, and capable software can also be a phishing-resistant authentication factor. Okta FastPass on a biometric-capable computer is an example of a phishing-resistant hardware device.</p>

<p>Pros: Biometric-based hardware devices are highly secure.</p>

<p>Cons: It may require a physical device, you need to register the key on each device you use, and it isn’t scalable for public and consumer security due to hardware requirements and convenience. Device manufacturers can make them small and lightweight for convenience, alleviating concerns about relying on bulky equipment. But what happens if the user loses or damages this device? How long would it take before they have access to the system again?</p>

 FIDO2 with WebAuthn and Passkeys 

<p>FIDO2 and WebAuthn combined are a strong authentication factor that utilizes biometrics on capable devices and new capabilities in web frameworks to increase user security reliably. This factor requires a biometric-capable device meeting FIDO standards, such as a phone or a laptop, and capable software. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/">World Wide Web Consortium spec for web authentication</a> (WebAuthn) means JavaScript-based web apps can support phishing-resistant authentication right in the browser. The difference between phishing-resistant hardware factors, such as security keys or Okta FastPass on biometric devices and Passkeys, is discoverability and the ability to port credentials. Instead of storing credentials on the hardware, discoverable FIDO authentication stores credentials outside software, such as in the iCloud Keychain or Android Keystore. The credential storage makes authenticating on the same site across different devices within the same ecosystem possible without re-registering.</p>

<p>Pros: Biometric-based FIDO authentication is secure, scales for public and consumer users, and there is no need to carry a security key or card</p>

<p>Cons: Each app must support this authentication method, and consumers must own capable devices</p>

<p>For the highest levels of identity security, use phishing-resistant factors.</p>

 Phishing-resistant factors decision tree 

<p>We recommend phishing-resistant factors at Okta as they offer the best application protection. You have identity assurances built in, along with authentication security. Consider this decision tree for your authentication needs:</p>

<p></p>

 Avoid weak authentication methods 

<p>We no longer live in a world where passwords alone are good enough to secure sensitive resources. Studies have shown that over <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/">80% of data breaches result from compromised credentials</a>. We must elevate authentication methods by avoiding weak credentials and preferring more substantial forms. Look towards industry leaders in cybersecurity, including companies such as Okta, nonprofit foundations such as OWASP, and government standards such as <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/">NIST</a> and <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/10-steps/identity-and-access-management">NCSC</a>, to guide you towards strong factors and away from weak ones. In particular, be wary of legacy factors.</p>

 Avoid security questions as a factor 

<p>Cybersecurity organizations do not recommend security questions, as they are neither secure nor reliable. Security questions are vulnerable to social engineering attacks. It’s best to avoid this method.</p>

 SMS one-time codes are unsafe 

<p>Attackers can access those messages through SIM-swapping and interception attacks. NIST proposes deprecating SMS as an authentication factor, so consider alternate authentication methods.</p>

 Email Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) have similar security issues as SMS 

<p>Using email for TOTP presents similar security issues as SMS codes. Attackers can intercept email. Emails may mistakenly get flagged as spam. Email delivery delays can result in configuring longer time validity periods, causing lower security.</p>

 Avoid password antipatterns 

<p>Passwords must evolve by allowing longer character lengths and character variety. Avoid antipatterns such as complexity requirements and forced password resets. Enforce strong passwords by checking them against compromised password databases. Password managers can offset user risks by recommending unique, strong passwords for each site and applying the stored passwords. Still, password managers aren’t failproof, and users may use insecure passwords for the password manager themselves.</p>

<p>These factors do offer a weak barrier to sensitive resources, but a key element is missing: identity assurance. The weak authentication factors lack the safeguards to ensure the users making the authentication challenge are who they say they are.</p>

 Elevate authentication security with Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) 

<p>Passwords alone require caution, but a combination of passwords and other factors elevates identity security. A single legacy authentication factor is rarely secure enough to protect any resource; it isn’t safe enough to access your users and Okta configuration.</p>

<p>Adding factors such as authenticator apps supporting TOTP and push authentication increases the barriers to sensitive data. Raising the barriers helps protect your application by requiring more effort for impersonators trying to hack accounts. However, using the weakest authentication factors combined isn’t as strong as phishing-resistant.</p>

 Combine strong authentication factors 

<p>The best way to ensure authentication security and reasonable identity assurances is to combine moderate to high authentication factors. Doing so supports good security with secure fallback systems. For example, if you can’t use phishing-resistant authentication in a consumer scenario, layer a password with push authentication. Allow the consumer to opt into Passkeys while supporting MFA. For workforce scenarios, issue hardware keys as a backup factor in addition to Okta FastPass.</p>

<p>Okta’s authentication policy builder can help you create strong authentication requirements to access Okta services and applications protected by Okta’s sign-in while tailoring session lifetimes to your needs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s time we evolve our application’s authentication security and favor phishing-resistant factors.</p>
</blockquote>

 Customize authentication requirements dynamically 

<p>Identity security isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. FIDO2 with WebAuthn factors such as Okta FastPass for workforce use cases and Passkeys for consumer use cases can be the standard methodology.</p>

 Consider Adaptive MFA for conditional authentication requirements 

<p>Complex use cases call for more tailoring. Your needs may change depending on use factors such as geographic location, IP addresses, device attributes, and threat detection. Identity Providers offer solutions that help you tailor authentication security. For example, Okta supports features such as <a href="https://www.okta.com/identity-101/adaptive-authentication/">Adaptive MFA</a>, which adjusts authentication requirements depending on context, and <a href="https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/itp/overview.htm">Identity Threat Protection</a>, which continuously monitors threats and can react by terminating authenticated sessions. If your industry requires the highest levels of identity security or your application contains highly sensitive resources, look to these options.</p>

 Revalidate identity for sensitive resource requests 

<p>Identity assurances don’t have to happen only at application entry. When sensitive actions and data require elevated authentication, consider using the <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/what-is-step-up-authentication-when-to-use-it/">Step Up Authentication Challenge</a> to protect resources. The Step Up Authentication Challenge is an OAuth standard for requiring secure factors or recent authentication when performing actions within the application.</p>

<p>Third-party interactions may require identity assurances. While we primarily think about authenticating as a solo activity, think about the case where someone calls into a help center for support. The help center agent needs to verify identity remotely, and we don’t want to rely only on weak methods such as passwords or pins. Consider using <a>Client-Initiated Back-channel Authentication (CIBA)</a> for your application in cases like this.</p>

<p>What do all these recommendations mean for developers working on these applications? How can we take advantage of identity security best practices?</p>

 Build secure apps by applying identity security concepts 

<p>We developers have a tough job. We must ensure our applications meet compliance requirements and guard against security threats, all while delivering product features. Authentication is foundational, but not your entire product line. It’s an expectation that doesn’t drive product innovations for your app, but detrimental when implemented incorrectly.</p>

 Use an Identity Provider (IDP) that supports OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) 

<p>To best protect your application and free yourself from getting into the weeds of implementing authentication, delegate it to your Identity Provider (IdP) whenever possible. When you delegate authentication to an IdP like Okta, you can access industry-recognized best practices, such as using OAuth 2.1 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) standards with user redirect for the authentication challenge. Redirecting the user to the Okta-hosted Sign-in Widget frees you from managing authentication methods manually. It allows you to leverage the Sign-in Widget user challenge with the Okta Identity Engine (OIE) for phishing-resistant authentication factors. Using the Okta Identity Engine means your app accesses the latest and greatest features for secure identity management.</p>

 Delegate authentication to your Identity Provider (IDP) 

<p>When you redirect the user to Okta for sign-in, you make authentication Okta’s problem. And that’s great because it provides you with the most security and the least amount of work. Your Okta administrator can configure authentication policies and add business rules to those authentication user challenges. You don’t have to worry about how to implement WebAuthn in your app, ensuring you have all the user controls to handle push notifications, or track sign-in context to adapt authentication factors. It’s all handled. All you need to know is whether the user completed authentication challenges, and then you can return to delivering features.</p>

<p>If you’re concerned a browser redirect for sign in degrades user experience or if your application’s use case demands a custom look and feel, you can customize the Okta-hosted Sign-In Widget’s styles. When you combine a custom-branded Sign-In Widget with a custom domain, your users may never know they leave your site. We’re continuing to build out capabilities in this area so you can deliver both secure identity and branding requirements. Be on the lookout for content about customizing sign in.</p>

 Use a vetted and well-maintained OIDC client library 

<p>A vetted, well-maintained OIDC client library increases implementation speed, lowers developer effort, and, most importantly, is crucial for authentication security. Because OAuth 2.1 and OIDC are open standards, writing your code to handle the required transactions is tempting. Resist the temptation for the sake of your application security and the efforts for the continued maintenance that good authentication libraries require. It’s too easy to introduce developer error in something like the Proof-Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) verification steps or to miss something in the token verification, for example. <a href="https://salt.security/blog/traveling-with-oauth-account-takeover-on-booking-com">Many more subtle errors can adversely affect your application</a>. Resist the temptation.</p>

<p>The standards can also change over time, such as adding new protection mechanisms or introducing breaking changes. Writing custom implementation means changes and maintenance become your responsibility, and you <a href="https://darutk.medium.com/oauth-oidc-mistakes-7f3bb909518b">can’t presume prior spec knowledge is good enough, as specs can change</a>. Resist the temptation and take this responsibility off your plate.</p>

<p>Ideally, use a vetted, well-maintained OIDC client library that is <a href="https://openid.net/developers/certified-openid-connect-implementations/">OIDC-certified</a> or the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/code/">Okta SDKs</a>. Okta’s SDKs not only securely handle the OAuth handshake and token storage for you, but you’ll also get built-in support for the latest advancements in OAuth specs, such as Step Up Authentication Challenge, CIBA, and more.</p>

 Join the identity security evolution 

<p>Protect your workforce and customers by elevating authentication factors using phishing-resistant factors. Allow Okta to work for you by configuring strong authentication policies. Enable dynamic authentication factors and threat detection in your Okta org to mitigate data breaches and strengthen your reputation.</p>

<p>In your software applications, leverage Okta SDKs to redirect users to the Okta-hosted Sign-in Widget to quickly gain access to the more secure authentication factors efficiently and seamlessly. Then, build more safety in your apps by adding the Step Up Authentication Challenge to maintain identity security. Staying updated with the latest security best practices and thoughtfully integrating OAuth specs are essential to secure identity management.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apply these key takeaways</p>
   
     Use phishing-resistant factors for authentication wherever possible, preferring Passkeys and Okta FastPass depending on use case and target audience 
     Offer strong MFA options as a backup authentication methods 
     Delegate identity management and authentication to an Identity Provider (IDP) supporting OAuth 2.1 and OIDC 
     Use an OIDC client library to redirect users to sign in through an Okta-hosted sign in page 
     Consider using OAuth extension specs to elevate identity assurances continuously throughout the lifetime of a user session

Noosphere introduces a verifiable off-chain intelligence layer, enabling smart contracts to securely delegate off-chain inference and computation.</blockquote> Limitations of Smart Contracts <p>Smart contracts revolutionized the game by introducing decentralized, deterministic, and transparent automation. But as the use cases for Web3 evolve, touching AI, real-world assets, and scientific modeling, those same design principles begin to feel limiting.</p><p>Smart contracts were never meant to think. They can’t infer, predict, adapt, or process complexity the way humans (or AI) can. This bottleneck has become one of the biggest blockers to building intelligent dApps.</p><p>While this design ensures security and transparency, it severely limits the capabilities of Web3 applications. Smart contracts cannot:</p>  Perform AI inference (e.g., LLM-based responses)  Aggregate multi-source or time-sensitive data  Execute heavy off-chain computations  Dynamically interact with complex, uncertain real-world conditions  <p>This forces developers to&nbsp;either:</p>  Build oversimplified logic directly on-chain, or  Depend on centralized APIs or external scripts, undermining decentralization and verifiability.  <p>Without off-chain computation, smart contracts can’t process large datasets, verify model outputs, or manage economic incentives related to data generation and verification. Worse, the absence of verifiability creates a black box. As a result, decentralized applications across DeFi, DeSci, and RWA are often stuck between being too limited to be useful or too centralized to be&nbsp;trusted.</p><p>What we need is not just more data. We need a programmable, auditable, and privacy-preserving delegation layer that brings intelligent logic to on-chain while preserving decentralization.</p><p>That’s where Noosphere comes in. It enables smart contracts to securely delegate off-chain computation to verifiable agents, bridging the gap between on-chain determinism and off-chain intelligence. With Noosphere, decentralized applications can reason, adapt, and act intelligently without sacrificing decentralization, privacy, or auditability.</p> What Noosphere Enables <p>With Noosphere, developers can:</p>  Request off-chain computation directly from smart contracts, including LLM inference, risk assessments, or simulations.  Receive verifiable responses and integrate them securely into on-chain workflows.  Build privacy-preserving, intelligent dApps using a unified framework that combines compute infrastructure, oracles, and verification layers.  Orchestrate AI agents that are programmable, auditable, and trustless.  <p>By serving as a decentralized coordination and verification layer for off-chain logic, Noosphere upgrades the capabilities of smart contracts across all major&nbsp;sectors.</p> Real-World Applications   DeFAI Agents (via ArenAI): Agents powered by off-chain AI models that autonomously allocate assets, hedge risks, or rebalance portfolios across chains, integrated directly into&nbsp;DeFi.  DeSci Protocols: Scientific research platforms can outsource high-performance modeling (e.g. protein folding, climate simulation) to Noosphere agents.  On-Chain RWA Intelligence: Tokenized real-world assets (real estate, receivables) gain real-time valuations, credit scores, or logistics tracking via AI models verified through Noosphere.  Decentralized Compliance &amp; KYC (with Booost): AI agents trained on regulatory data assess AML risk or compliance patterns and return auditable scores. When paired with Booost’s proof-of-humanity, it enables dynamic, compliant onboarding across ecosystems.  Inference Markets for Synthetic Datasets: Researchers can generate and verify AI-based interpretations in medical, legal, or financial contexts. Tokens are staked to incentivize validation, with outputs coordinated and verified through Noosphere.  <p>As decentralized applications evolve beyond static logic and into intelligent, adaptive systems, the need for verifiable off-chain computation becomes urgent. Noosphere fills this gap, not by replacing smart contracts, but by extending their capabilities with off-chain AI reasoning, data coordination, and secure delegation. Whether you’re building in DeFi, DeSci, RWA, or beyond, Noosphere unlocks the infrastructure to make your dApps not just programmable, but truly intelligent.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/noosphere-a-gateway-to-verifiable-off-chain-intelligence-9eb6a4523fb5">Noosphere: A Gateway to Verifiable Off-Chain Intelligence</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  A mobile driver’s license (mDL) is a type of cryptographically verifiable digital credential that you hold in a digital wallet on a mobile device. You can now issue and verify mDLs in Indicio Proven — along with other popular credential formats and communications protocols.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 By Helen Garneau<p></p>
<p><a href="https://indicio.tech/blog/mdoc-mdl-and-choosing-the-right-digital-credential-for-the-job/">A mobile driver’s license (mDL)</a> is a digital credential built on the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/69084.html">ISO/IEC 18013-5</a> standard. It is stored directly on a user’s device, can be verified cryptographically, and works in both online and offline settings using Bluetooth or NFC.</p>
<p>This means you can digitally verify someone’s identity without relying on real-time access to a central database or system. This also means you can carry a government-issued credential in your mobile wallet and present only the specific data needed for a given interaction, such as confirming your age or license status. These credentials are self-contained, shared with consent, and designed to protect privacy.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven is the easiest way for organizations to issue and verify mDLs with minimal friction and helps you establish a foundation for portable digital identity while reducing fraud and supporting regulatory compliance while allowing individuals to manage their own identity information.</p>

<p>“Disinformation. Misinformation. Malinformation. These terms get used interchangeably, but they’re not the same thing.” </p>



<p>That distinction matters when designing resilient infrastructure that supports trust.</p>



 
 Misinformation is false or misleading information shared without intent to deceive. 



 Disinformation is deliberately deceptive content, often politically or financially motivated. 



 Malinformation is factual information used out of context to cause harm. 
 



<p>Most of our efforts to address these problems focus on content, activities like fact-checking, moderation, and takedown requests. And those are important. But after sitting through multiple sessions at <a href="https://www.itu.int/net4/wsis/forum/2025/">WSIS+20</a> last month, I came away thinking about the architectures that enable or undermine digital trust in the first place. (Did you see my post <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/07/29/wsis20-and-identity-governance/">last week</a> on learnings from WSIS+20?)</p>



<p>Remember, trust doesn’t start with content. It actually starts with infrastructure.</p>



<p>The people in those WSIS+20 rooms weren’t talking about disinformation in the abstract. They were talking about humanitarian workers in the field, where timely, accurate, and secure information can be a matter of life and death. They talked about public health campaigns, peacekeeping missions, and journalists trying to survive in an environment where lies move faster than truth. And in almost every session, it became clear that the technical underpinnings of the Internet—especially in crisis and conflict settings—are being overlooked.</p>

 Identity is part of the equation 



<p>While identity wasn’t explicitly discussed in these sessions, it’s a critical part of establishing authenticity, which in turn helps build trust. IAM systems can’t prevent disinformation, but they can help validate source integrity and support accountability.</p>



 
 Verified senders can be identified without compromising privacy. 



 Digital credentials can establish provenance for content or data. (Shout out to the <a href="https://c2pa.org/">C2PA</a> work here!) 



 Attribute-based access can help ensure information reaches the right people in the right roles. 
 



<p>I’m not promoting centralized control or surveillance. What I want is to build confidence in the systems we rely on to make decisions, especially in high-stakes environments.</p>



 Disinformation and infrastructure resilience 



<p>Something I thought about as I settled down with my notes after the event, though it wasn’t phrased this way quite like this during any of the sessions: When infrastructure fails, it doesn’t just disrupt services; it disrupts the foundation of trust that identity and information systems rely on. Several sessions at WSIS+20 focused on resilient digital infrastructure, especially in the context of sustainability and the UN’s 2030 Agenda. Speakers from IEEE, CERN, and disaster risk reduction agencies reminded us that resilience is more than just a technical property; it’s what enables everything. Disinformation thrives when infrastructure fails. That includes failures of availability, integrity, and interoperability. When identity systems falter, the ability to authenticate sources, validate messages, and maintain digital trust during crisis response suffers, too.</p>



 
 Digital infrastructure often isn’t designed to serve people in remote or underserved areas. 



 Technical standards don’t always account for multilingual or multi-platform accessibility. 



 Short-term, market-driven decisions prioritize scalability over long-term resilience. 
 



<p>Standards developers and IAM professionals know this at a technical level. Heck, I wrote about this a few weeks ago in a post on <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/07/01/resilience-in-standards/">resilience in standards.</a> But what’s often missed is how infrastructure failure becomes a governance issue. When people lose trust in digital systems, they distrust more than just the failed platform. They also start to distrust institutions and even each other.</p>



 Resilience isn’t for other people 



<p>IAM systems face similar challenges: do we build for edge cases, or optimize for the majority? Whose threat model are we prioritizing? How do we balance user experience with verifiability?</p>



<p>Just to make it more complicated, there is the fact that technology designed to protect can also exclude.</p>



 
 Overly strict verification requirements can lock out vulnerable populations. 



 Misapplied protections can be used to suppress journalism or advocacy. 



 “Safety” features can become surveillance tools in the wrong hands. 
 



<p>Even well-intentioned systems can marginalize people when their design doesn’t include a wide range of needs and experiences.</p>



<p>If we want to fight disinformation at scale, we need to stop thinking of it as just a content problem. It’s an infrastructure problem. And digital identity experts and standards architects have a role to play.</p>



 Closing the loop: From resilience back to disinformation 



<p>The sections above touched on how resilient, inclusive infrastructure supports digital trust. But let’s not lose sight of the central theme: disinformation. It spreads most easily where infrastructure is brittle, trust is low, and identity signals are weak or absent. That’s why the work of IAM professionals and standards developers matters—not just for security or compliance, but for defending the conditions in which truth can survive.</p>



 So, what can identity professionals do? 



<p>I love it when a plan comes together, and the plan here is to think about fighting disinformation and improving the resilience of our systems.</p>



 
 Treat resilience as a design goal: Build IAM systems that account for low-connectivity, low-trust environments. 



 Make authenticity an architectural concern: Support verifiable claims, provenance metadata, and strong-but-private identifiers. 



 Engage in governance conversations: Push for feedback loops between standards bodies, policymakers, and civil society. Ask who is being served and who isn’t. 
 



 And what can standards architects do? 



 
 Define and document trust assumptions: Clearly state what the system assumes about message integrity, source authenticity, and the broader infrastructure. Make those assumptions visible and testable. 



 Design for degraded conditions: Create standards that support verifiability even when connectivity is intermittent, metadata is partial, or infrastructure is compromised. 



 Include threat models beyond fraud: Consider disinformation campaigns, information suppression, and adversarial use of identity signals in your threat models. 



 Build consultation into the process: Include journalists, humanitarian responders, civil society groups, and policy experts in standards development. Their use cases will expand your view of what “interoperable” and “resilient” really mean. 
 



 Building for trust means building for everyone 



<p>Trust isn’t just about whether users believe your system is secure. It’s about whether they believe the Internet is still a place where truth can be found and relied upon. That belief erodes when digital systems exclude marginalized, underserved, and underrepresented users, whose experiences and threat models are often left out of design decisions. And that erosion creates fertile ground for disinformation, misinformation, and malinformation to take root.</p>



<p>This connection wasn’t made explicitly in the WSIS+20 sessions, but it became clear to me: trust in digital systems isn’t separate from trust in public discourse. If we want to defend the truth, we have to build systems that serve the whole public, not just the easy parts of it.</p>



<p>If we want to fight disinformation at scale, we need to stop thinking of it as just a content problem. It’s an infrastructure problem, and identity has a role to play.</p>



<p>This work is messy. It spans disciplines, sectors, and priorities. But if we want trustworthy systems, we have to build them with and for the people who rely on them most. That starts with looking beyond our immediate use cases and asking harder questions about who benefits, who’s left out, and what it means to build for trust in a world where truth itself is contested.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest<br>[00:00:04]</p>



<p>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity — from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists.</p>



<p>If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>Let’s get into it.</p>



 



 What Is Disinformation, Really? 



<p>[00:00:29]</p>



<p>Disinformation. Misinformation. Malinformation.</p>



<p>They may sound similar, but these terms have crucial differences. And if we want to design digital systems that truly support trust and accountability, those differences matter.</p>



<p>This week, I’m sharing an unexpected takeaway from my time at WSIS+20 in Geneva. I left that event with a strong belief that disinformation isn’t just a content problem — it’s an infrastructure problem.</p>



<p>And that infrastructure includes identity.</p>



 



 Defining the Terms 



<p>[00:01:05]</p>



<p>Let’s start with some clear definitions — because words matter.</p>



 
 Misinformation is false or misleading information shared without intent to deceive. Think: hearing a rumor and passing it along without realizing it’s untrue. 



 Disinformation is intentionally deceptive, crafted and spread to influence behavior or opinion, often politically or financially. 



 Malinformation is true, but used maliciously — like doxing someone or leaking sensitive context to cause harm. 
 



<p>Most efforts to combat these focus on content — fact-checking, takedowns, moderation policies. And that work is vital.</p>



<p>But what I heard in the WSIS sessions wasn’t just about policies. It was about digital infrastructure.</p>



 



 Real-World Impact: Why Infrastructure Matters 



<p>[00:02:00]</p>



<p>Here are a few stories that helped this hit home:</p>



 
 Humanitarian workers struggling to communicate securely in conflict zones. 



 Journalists fighting to survive and tell the truth amid algorithmic lies. 



 Peacekeeping missions and public health campaigns racing to get accurate information out before disinformation spreads faster. 
 



<p>In all these cases, trust didn’t hinge on whether someone flagged a tweet. It depended on whether the underlying systems could support or sabotage the truth.</p>



 



 Technical Failures Become Governance Failures 



<p>[00:03:02]</p>



<p>If your network goes down, people will turn to unofficial channels.<br>If your logs are incomplete or timestamps unverifiable, message integrity falls apart.<br>If your system can’t authenticate a sender, how do you know whether or not to act?</p>



<p>That’s not just a technical failure — it’s a governance failure.</p>



<p>And when people lose trust in digital systems, the consequences ripple outward:</p>



 
 Trust in platforms erodes 



 Trust in institutions falters 



 Trust in each other breaks down 
 



 



 Where Identity Comes Into Play 



<p>[00:03:45]</p>



<p>Interestingly, identity wasn’t a primary topic in most disinformation sessions. But it kept showing up — just at the edges.</p>



<p>Because when you ask:</p>



 
 Who sent this message? 



 Has it been tampered with? 



 Is this authentic? 
 



<p>You’re really asking identity questions.</p>



<p>Identity systems can help us answer those questions without sacrificing privacy, by:</p>



 
 Establishing provenance 



 Enabling verified senders to be trusted faster 



 Supporting credentials that show who said what, and when 



 Ensuring information flows to the right people at the right time 
 



<p>While identity and access management alone can’t solve the disinformation crisis, they’re essential tools in restoring trust in the systems where that information travels.</p>



 



 Designing for True Resilience 



<p>[00:04:50]</p>



<p>Another recurring theme at WSIS+20 was resilience. Not just uptime and backups — real resilience.</p>



<p>How systems perform in messy, unpredictable, even dangerous environments.</p>



<p>Sessions on sustainability, infrastructure, and disaster response included speakers from IEEE, CERN, physicists, and others who manage risk daily.</p>



<p>One takeaway stuck with me:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Resilience isn’t just technical — it’s a social contract.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When resilience breaks down, we’re breaking that contract. We’re designing for the well-connected, the resourced, the mainstream — not for:</p>



 
 Remote communities 



 Multilingual populations 



 Low-trust or high-risk environments 
 



<p>And identity systems? They struggle with this all the time.</p>



 



 Exclusion Creates Fertile Ground for Disinformation 



<p>[00:06:02]</p>



<p>Strict verification protects against fraud. But what if you’re a displaced person without documents?</p>



<p>In trying to protect, we often exclude. And where people are excluded, disinformation grows.</p>



<p>Because people turn to what’s available. If trustworthy systems aren’t available — or don’t work for them — they’ll turn to anything that is.</p>



<p>So bringing this back full circle, disinformation thrives where:</p>



 
 Systems can’t verify sources 



 Users don’t trust what they see 



 Infrastructure fails or excludes 
 



<p>If your digital trust infrastructure — identity included — only works in ideal conditions, then you’ve built perfect conditions for disinformation.</p>



 



 Why Identity Standards Matter 



<p>[00:07:01]</p>



<p>Identity and access management (IAM) standards matter because they define the defaults.</p>



<p>They determine:</p>



 
 What’s interoperable 



 What can be verified 



 Whether truth can be seen, heard, and trusted 
 



<p>So if you’re an identity professional, what can you actually do?</p>



 



 What Identity Professionals Can Do 



<p>[00:07:25]</p>



<p>Here are some tangible steps to start with:</p>



 
 Treat resilience as a design goal<br>Consider low-connectivity and low-trust environments. Build for those, too. 



 Make authenticity an architectural concern<br>Support verifiable claims, embed provenance, and use privacy-preserving identifiers. 



 Engage in governance conversations<br>Don’t outsource this to policymakers. Collaborate with:
 
 Standards groups 



 Civil society 



 Policymakers 



 Employers 
 
 
 



<p>Ask hard questions:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Who’s being served? Who’s being left out?</p>
</blockquote>



 



 For Standards Architects: You Are My People 



<p>[00:08:20]</p>



<p>If you work on protocols, specs, or standards, here’s your to-do list:</p>



 
 Define layout and trust assumptions<br>Spell out what the system presumes about message integrity and infrastructure. 



 Design for degraded conditions<br>Don’t assume perfect metadata or nonstop uptime. 



 Think beyond fraud<br>Include disinformation, suppression, and misuse in your threat models. 



 Build consultation into the process<br>Bring in:
 
 Journalists 



 Emergency responders 



 Civil society leaders 
 
 
 



<p>Their use cases will expand your understanding and improve your solutions.</p>



 



 Closing Thoughts: Trust as a Design Mandate 



<p>[00:09:30]</p>



<p>Trust isn’t just about security. It’s about whether people believe in digital systems at all.</p>



<p>When systems exclude people — by design or by neglect — trust erodes.<br>And in that erosion, disinformation thrives.</p>



<p>That’s what stood out to me most at WSIS+20.</p>



<p>If we want to fight mis-, dis-, and malinformation, we can’t just treat it as a content problem.</p>



<p>We must treat it as an infrastructure problem.</p>



<p>And identity professionals and standards architects?<br>We’re part of the solution.</p>



<p>It’s messy work. Cross-disciplinary. Politically thorny. Often frustrating.<br>But if we want trustworthy systems, we must build them for everyone — not just the easy users.</p>



<p>So keep asking:</p>



 
 Who’s benefiting? 



 Who’s being left out? 
 



<p>Make it explicit. Even if it’s uncomfortable.</p>



<p>What does it really mean to build for trust, in a world where truth itself is constantly contested?</p>



<p>Food for thought. And thank you for listening.</p>

<p>Real estate professionals in Canada are under increasing pressure to detect financial crime risks, verify source of funds, and document transactions with greater accuracy. This article explores how firms can modernize AML compliance and implement seamless ID and fund verification to align with new FINTRAC expectations in 2025.</p>
 
 In recent years, Canada’s real estate market has become a focal point in the country’s fight against money laundering. From the Cullen Commission in British Columbia to new enforcement guidance from FINTRAC, regulators are calling for stronger controls on source of funds (SoF) verification, politically exposed person (PEP) screening, and recordkeeping across all phases of real estate transactions. 
<p>Whether you’re a broker, law firm, developer, or mortgage specialist, the message is clear: AML in real estate is no longer optional or reactive – it must be continuous, defensible, and digitally enabled.</p>
 AML Risk in Canadian Real Estate 
<p>According to the Cullen Commission’s findings, real estate has been used extensively to launder proceeds of crime through:</p>
 
 Anonymous corporate ownership structures 
 All-cash or mortgage-free purchases 
 Layered legal or nominee arrangements 
 Limited scrutiny on source of wealth and funds 
 
<p>As a result, FINTRAC and provincial regulators now expect:</p>
 
 Identity verification of buyers, sellers, and intermediaries 
 Screening for PEPs and sanctions lists 
 Verification of source of funds for high-risk transactions 
 Retention of detailed records for compliance audits

<p>Imagine I got a FaceTime call from my daughter right now, tears streaming down her face, desperately pleading for help. “Dada, I’m stuck somewhere. I need some money right now. I lost my wallet. Could you just send me an Apple gift card?” The voice is unmistakably hers. The face looks exactly right. My parental instincts would kick in, and the probability of me actually getting taken by it and sending her money would be very, very high. Except my daughter is safely at home, completely unaware of what just happened. I would have just become the latest victim of an AI voice cloning attack that required nothing more than a 15-second voice sample to execute.</p>
<p>These kinds of attacks are happening every day, and cybersecurity experts are warning that we’re on the brink of an epidemic that will make traditional phone scams look like child’s play.</p>
 From Comedy Central to Criminal Enterprise: The Evolution of Voice Mimicry 
<p>Voice attacks aren’t new. For decades, skilled impressionists have made careers out of mimicking celebrities on Comedy Central and late-night television. Turn on your TV, go watch any stand-up comedy where people mimic the voice of somebody else. Not everybody is good at mimicry, there are a few people who are really good at it, and that’s their skill set, and they make a living out of it.</p>
<p>So, what’s the difference? What once required rare talent and years of practice can now be accomplished by anyone with a smartphone and access to AI tools.</p>
<p>You can literally take a voice sample of 20 seconds, 15 seconds, and trust me, getting a voice sample of any user is a piece of cake. You can record them in a meeting, in webinars, at conferences. Taking a voice sample of a person, feeding it into an AI engine, and having AI generate paragraphs of text in your voice couldn’t be easier.</p>
<p>The technology combines voice cloning with face swapping capabilities, creating what security professionals call “deepfakes”, AI-generated content that can make anyone appear to say or do anything. Unlike the obvious robotic voices of yesterday’s scam calls, these new attacks are virtually indistinguishable from the real thing.</p>
 The Perfect Storm: Why Voice Cloning Attacks Are About to Explode 
<p>Currently, sophisticated voice cloning technology requires some technical expertise to deploy effectively. But that barrier is rapidly disappearing. But before you snap your fingers, trust me, this is going to be in the palms of every individual on this planet because they are building AI agents, voice bots, chatbots, and all of them are available as apps on your phone.</p>
<p>The democratization of AI tools means that what once required specialized knowledge will soon be as simple as downloading an app. Combined with the wealth of voice samples available through social media, video calls, and public speaking engagements, attackers will have unprecedented access to the raw materials needed for convincing impersonations.</p>
<p>Consider the attack surface: every Zoom meeting, every Instagram story, every TikTok video, every voicemail message becomes potential ammunition for cybercriminals. For public figures, executives, or anyone with an online presence, avoiding voice sample collection is virtually impossible.</p>
 From Spam Calls to Family Emergencies: The Human Cost of AI Deception 
<p>The implications extend far beyond individual financial losses. Traditional text-based scams already trick thousands of people daily with messages claiming, “I’m stuck at an airport. I need an Apple ID or gift card.” Now imagine those same scenarios playing out with the actual voice and face of a loved one making the plea.</p>
<p>Imagine what’s going to happen to all these spam calls that people have been receiving over time. Those text messages that you get, saying, “I’m stuck at an airport. I need an Apple ID or an Apple Card or a gift card,” and people fall for it. Imagine that happening in the age of AI. It’s going to be rampant.</p>
<p>The psychological impact cannot be overstated. When a scammer can perfectly replicate your child’s voice expressing genuine distress, the emotional manipulation becomes exponentially more powerful. Traditional security awareness training that teaches people to “verify before you trust” becomes significantly more challenging when the verification methods themselves can be compromised.</p>
<p>For organizations, the threat is equally severe. Help desk calls from “employees” requesting password resets, IT support requests from “executives” demanding immediate access, and vendor communications requesting urgent payment changes all become potential attack vectors when voice authentication can be spoofed with AI precision.</p>
 The $4.4 Million Question: Counting the Cost of Deepfake Breaches 
<p>While comprehensive data on AI voice cloning losses is still emerging, the broader cybersecurity landscape provides sobering context.<a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach"> According to IBM’s 2025 Cost of a Data Breach Report</a>, the average cost of a data breach has reached a record high of <a href="https://cyberscoop.com/ibm-cost-data-breach-2025/">$10.22 million for US companies</a>, while the global average was $4.44 million.</p>
<p>The reputational damage may prove even more costly. Consumer trust, once lost, can take years to rebuild. According to recent research, <a href="https://vercara.digicert.com/news/vercara-research-75-of-u-s-consumers-would-stop-purchasing-from-a-brand-if-it-suffered-a-cyber-incident">75% of consumers would stop shopping with a brand that suffered a security incident</a>. For organizations that handle sensitive customer data or financial transactions, a successful deepfake-enabled breach could trigger regulatory investigations, class-action lawsuits, and permanent customer defection.</p>
<p>Beyond direct financial losses, there’s the operational disruption. Companies targeted by sophisticated social engineering attacks often must shut down systems, reset credentials enterprise-wide, and implement emergency security protocols that can paralyze operations for days or weeks.</p>
 Beyond Traditional Defenses: The Rise of Liveness-Based Authentication 
<p>Traditional security measures are proving inadequate against AI-powered impersonation attacks. Standard multifactor authentication, password policies, and even basic biometric systems can be circumvented when attackers can convincingly impersonate authorized users during help desk interactions.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, we’re addressing this challenge head-on. If somebody is using biometrics to authenticate into a system, be it face, be it voice, be it anything, if we have the ability to identify that it’s crossed a certain threshold of risk with relationship to it being a deepfake or fake or AI-generated content, we can raise those signals. Our systems then have the ability to determine the kind of access they need to provide or even prevent access altogether based on those signals.</p>
<p>The solution lies in what we call “liveness detection”, technology that can distinguish between live human interaction and AI-generated content. We’ve developed systems that combine multiple authentication factors, including live facial scanning compared against government-issued credentials, to create what I call a “risk threshold” that determines whether access should be granted.</p>
<p>We look at all the fraud signals from various factors to generate what we call a risk threshold that could tell our systems what that system should or should not do with that access request or authentication attempt. The way we have designed our platform is to ensure that all the signals that we get when a user authenticates into the system, be it video, be it live ID, be it selfie, be it a document scan, or be it voice, we analyze these signals comprehensively.</p>
<p>This marks a shift away from reactive security measures that only respond after a breach has occurred. Instead, we focus on proactive security that works to stop threats before they happen.</p>
<p>Being proactive means putting systems in place that can detect voice attacks, deepfakes, and other forms of AI-generated impersonation early in the process. That kind of prevention is becoming essential as these attacks grow more advanced.</p>
<p>At 1Kosmos, we believe it’s our responsibility to help users and organizations recognize and block these threats before any damage is done. Our biometric authentication platform is built to detect signs of manipulation in real time and prevent unauthorized access based on those signals.</p>
 Building Deepfake-Resistant Organizations: The Path Forward 
<p>The window for preparation is rapidly closing. As AI voice cloning tools become more accessible and sophisticated, organizations must implement robust detection and prevention measures before they become targets.</p>
<p>The most effective defense combines technological solutions with updated security protocols. This includes implementing liveness-based biometric authentication for all system access, training staff to recognize potential deepfake scenarios, and establishing verification procedures that don’t rely solely on voice or video confirmation.</p>
<p>For individual protection, the advice is equally urgent: establish out-of-band verification methods with family members, be skeptical of urgent financial requests regardless of apparent source, and understand that if something seems emotionally manipulative, it very well might be.</p>
<p>The threat of AI voice cloning isn’t a distant future concern, it’s a present-day reality that’s about to become exponentially more dangerous. Organizations and individuals who take proactive steps now will be far better positioned to defend against the inevitable wave of sophisticated impersonation attacks heading our way.</p>
<p>We still have a long way to go, but companies are recognizing that threats like this are no longer a fairytale. They are very real. We believe that identity is the entry into any organization or into any IT assets. We need to be 100 times more careful and stringent about how we do deepfake checks.</p>

 The European Union passes major regulation to allow the private sector to read eIDs via Near Field Communication. 



<p>In a significant milestone in the evolution of Europe’s digital identity framework, the European Commission has adopted <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2025/1208/oj/eng">Regulation (EU) 2025/1208</a>, which authorizes private sector companies to access key data stored in the chips of electronic identity documents (eIDs), most notably the bearer’s portrait (DG2) via <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/nfc/">Near Field Communication (NFC)</a> technology.</p>



<p>The regulation, which amends the original Commission Decision 2025/1218, came into force on July 10, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With NFC, identity verification moves from passive image capture to active chip-based validation, fundamentally transforming how businesses can confirm identities across onboarding journeys.</p>



 What’s changed and why it matters. 



<p>Until recently, access to the chip on EU member states’ national ID cards and biometric passports was largely restricted to border authorities. With Regulation 2025/1208 now adopted, private entities can legally read the facial image stored in DG2, provided the holder consents, using NFC technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This opens the door to more accurate, secure, fast, and automated identity proofing across industries like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/traditional-banking/">financial services</a>, insurance, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">gaming</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/telecommunication/">telecom</a>, and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/nfc-based-id-verification-shared-mobility/">mobility</a>, without compromising on privacy or regulatory integrity.</p>



 Let’s break it down: What’s in the chip? 



<p>eMRTDs (electronic Machine-Readable Travel Documents), such as biometric passports and eID cards, store personal data in a secure chip embedded in the document. This structure follows the globally recognized <a href="https://elibrary.icao.int/product/421430">ICAO 9303 standard,</a> developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which ensures interoperability and security across international borders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The chip’s contents are organized into Data Groups (DGs), each designed to hold specific types of information:</p>


 
 
 
 DG1: Machine-readable zone (MRZ) data (e.g. name, date of birth, document number)&nbsp; 
 

<p>Private sector access? Yes.<br>Use case: Retrieve electronic data from ID holder in secure way.</p>

 
 
 
 DG2: Biometric facial image (high-resolution portrait of the bearer) 
 

<p>Private sector access? Yes.<br>Use case: Biometric match to selfie.</p>

 
 
 
 DG3: Fingerprint data (accessible only to border and police authorities) 
 

<p>Private sector access? No.<br>Use case: Reserved for border and police use only.</p>

 
 
 
 


<p>By reading the encrypted data directly from the chip, IDnow’s NFC-enabled verification confirms the authenticity and integrity of the document and the portrait photo, ensuring the person presenting it is its rightful holder.</p>

 Meet strict regulatory frameworks with confidence. 



<p>With NFC-enabled verification, businesses can:&nbsp;</p>



  Validate ID authenticity through cryptographic signatures&nbsp;  



  Verify the portrait from the chip (DG2) against a selfie or video for liveness detection&nbsp;  



  Read DG1 and DG2 simultaneously for cross-checking document and biometric consistency&nbsp;  



  Reduce false positives and manual review, accelerating onboarding&nbsp;  



<p>NFC-based identity verification isn’t just technically superior, it’s also compliant with both existing and emerging regulations:&nbsp;</p>



  National frameworks: Compliant with current schemes such as <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/gwvideoidentv-german-financial-sector/">GWG (Germany</a>), <a href="https://www.fma.gv.at/en/financial-market-supervision-in-austria/">FMA (Austria)</a>, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/pvid-baseline-and-challenges/">ANSSI (France)</a>, and others across the EU.&nbsp;  



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/eidas-2-0/">eIDAS 2.0</a>: The EU’s revised digital identity regulation, requiring high-assurance identity proofing methods for Qualified Trust Service Providers (QTSPs), banks, and government services&nbsp;  



  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/future-of-amlr-identification-2027/">Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (AMLR)</a>: Recently approved and set to replace national laws by mid-2027. NFC supports fully automated, risk-based identity proofing in line with <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/customer-due-diligence/">Customer Due Diligence (CDD)</a> expectations.&nbsp;  



<p>So, whether you’re serving regulated industries or managing onboarding at scale, NFC verification gives you a future-proof foundation.</p>



 The IDnow NFC advantage. 



<p>IDnow’s NFC identity verification is already live and battle-tested across Europe, with tens of thousands of verifications processed every month.&nbsp;</p>



  Available globally: All new passports, residence permits, and national ID cards in the EU include NFC chips. Globally, most passports include this chip by default. In some regions, driving licences and other documents are also adopting chip-based formats.&nbsp;  



  Available for mobile app and mobile SDK integrations: Developer-friendly SDKs and APIs make it simple to integrate NFC into existing onboarding flows across platforms.&nbsp;  



  UX / speed: Onboarding can be completed in under one minute. Just tap the document. No manual data entry needed.&nbsp;  



  Conversion Rate: NFC onboarding shows higher success rates compared to optical scanning, thanks to improved read accuracy and fewer drop-offs.&nbsp;  



  Automation Rate: NFC verifications are fully automated, with no need for manual agent review. This accelerates onboarding and scales efficiently.&nbsp;  



  Security and data integrity: Cryptographic signature checks detect cloned or forged chips. Data is read with 100% accuracy, straight from the issuing authority.  



 NFC = No barriers to implementation. 



<p>IDnow’s NFC-enabled identity verification is available and fully compliant today. With Regulation (EU)&nbsp;2025/1208&nbsp;adopted, the private sector now has a clear legal foundation to access biometric data, such as the facial image stored on the chip of eID documents, with the user’s consent. This enables immediate integration of NFC verification into onboarding journeys.</p>



<p>Forward-thinking organizations that move early can gain a competitive edge by offering faster, more secure, and regulation-ready identity verification. Don’t wait for market-wide adoption, now is the time to optimize your onboarding flows and lead the way.</p>



 How it works: NFC-powered identity proofing, step by step. 



<p>So, what happens when a user taps their ID document with their phone? NFC-based identity verification transforms onboarding from a manual, error-prone process into a fast, secure, and fully automated journey. By reading encrypted data directly from the chip, rather than relying on photos or scans, IDnow ensures every verification is accurate, fraud-resistant, and compliant with the latest regulations.&nbsp;</p>



  Static capture: Capture the document’s MRZ to generate the key and decrypt the chip.&nbsp;  



  NFC readout: Instantly read secure data from the chip.&nbsp;

<p>Let’s imagine you’re checking into a hotel after a long flight. You’re tired, hungry, and just want your key. But instead of fumbling with paperwork, the receptionist simply scans your passport and boom, your details are verified, and you’re all set. No typing. No waiting. No drama.</p>
<p>That seamless experience? It’s powered by passport recognition, a rapidly evolving technology that’s rewriting how we verify identity in real time.</p>
<p>So what’s under the hood of passport recognition, and why does it matter for businesses, governments, and consumers alike? Let’s explore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What Is Passport Recognition? 
<p>Passport recognition refers to the automated process of scanning and extracting information from a passport’s data page using computer vision and AI. It’s often part of a broader ID document recognition SDK, which can process various identity documents beyond passports, such as driver’s licenses or national IDs. It allows machines to identify and authenticate passports with high accuracy and often in seconds.</p>
<p>The core components include:</p>
 
 <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ocr/">Optical Character Recognition</a> (OCR) to extract name, passport number, expiry date, etc.
<p></p> 
 Machine-Readable Zone (MRZ) decoding, where standardized passport data is stored.
<p></p> 
 Document validation using holograms, microprint, and UV patterns.
<p></p> 
 Face matching, comparing the passport photo to a live image or selfie.
<p></p> 
 
<p>Think of it like giving computers the ability to read and verify your passport like a border officer, only faster and with fewer errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Why Traditional Passport Checks Don’t Cut It Anymore 
<p>Manual passport checks are vulnerable to:</p>
 
 Human error (typos, missed fakes)
<p></p> 
 Delays at airports, hotels, or secure facilities
<p></p> 
 Fraud through forged or tampered documents
<p></p> 
 
<p>In a world where speed and security matter equally, automated passport recognition offers a compelling alternative.</p>
<p>Quick stat: According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), 73% of travelers prefer to use biometrics instead of passports for identity verification. That number is growing fast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How Passport Recognition Technology Works 
<p>Let’s lift the hood and see how the magic happens.</p>
 Step-by-Step Passport Recognition Process: 



Step
Description


1. Image Capture
A camera or mobile device captures the passport’s data page.


2. MRZ Detection
The system locates and isolates the machine-readable zone.


3. OCR Extraction
Characters from the MRZ and other fields are read via OCR.


4. Data Validation
The system checks for authenticity: font, format, expiry date, etc.


5. Face Match (Optional)
Compares the passport photo with a live selfie or stored biometric.



<p>With today’s advanced AI, the whole recognition flow wraps up in under three seconds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Passport Recognition vs Traditional OCR: What’s the Difference? 



Feature

Passport Recognition


Accuracy
85–90%
97–99%


Security Features

<p>Passport recognition is not just OCR on steroids it’s an entirely smarter approach built for identity assurance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Industries Benefiting from Passport Recognition 
<p>From airports to Airbnb, industries across the board are embedding this technology into their platforms. Here’s where it’s making waves:</p>
  Travel &amp; Border Control 
 
 Automated border gates (e-gates)
<p></p> 
 Self-check-in kiosks
<p></p> 
 Immigration pre-screening
<p></p> 
 
<p>“With passport recognition, airports can reduce processing time by up to 40% during peak hours.” SITA Air Transport IT Insights</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  Healthcare &amp; Insurance 
 
 ID verification during telehealth appointments
<p></p> 
 Onboarding for digital health insurance
<p></p> 
 Prescription fraud prevention
<p></p> 
 
  Banking &amp; Fintech 
 
 KYC during account registration
<p></p> 
 Cross-border remittance validation
<p></p> 
 Preventing identity fraud in loan applications
<p></p> 
 
  Hospitality &amp; Rentals 
 
 Faster hotel check-ins
<p></p> 
 ID verification for short-term rental platforms (e.g., Airbnb)
<p></p> 
 VIP loyalty programs linked to passport data
<p></p> 
 
  Education &amp; Exams 
 
 Verifying student ID for international admissions
<p></p> 
 Securing online proctoring systems
<p></p> 
 
<p>The bottom line? If you deal with real humans and legal identity documents, passport recognition can tighten your security and smooth your UX.</p>
<p></p>
 The Power of Passport Recognition + Face Verification 
<p>On its own, passport recognition is impressive. But pair it with face verification, and the security multiplies.</p>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
 
 User scans their passport using a smartphone or webcam.
<p></p> 
 System extracts data and photo from the passport.
<p></p> 
 User takes a selfie or a live video.
<p></p> 
 The system uses AI to verify the passport photo against a real-time selfie.
<p></p> 
 Verification result is returned within seconds.
<p></p> 
 
<p>This combo stops impostors in their tracks, including those armed with stolen documents or digital fakes.</p>
<p> Bonus Tip: Want higher fraud resistance? Add <a href="https://recognito.vision/id-document-liveness-detection-sdk/">id document liveness detection SDK</a> capabilities to confirm the person behind the document is physically present not a still image or a video spoof.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Advantages of Using Passport Recognition in 2025 
<p>Let’s get specific about the benefits:</p>
  Speed 
<p>Verifies documents in under 3 seconds. Perfect for high-traffic systems and instant KYC.</p>
  Accuracy 
<p>Uses deep learning and AI to extract data with up to 99% accuracy even from worn or wrinkled documents.</p>
  Compliance 
<p>Helps meet global identity regulations like:</p>
 
 <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">GDPR</a> (Europe)
<p></p> 
 eIDAS (EU)
<p></p> 
 KYC/AML (Global finance)
<p></p> 
 HIPAA (U.S. Healthcare)
<p></p> 
 
  User Experience 
<p>No long forms. No typos. No delays.</p>
<p>Just scan, verify, done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Real-World Case Study: How Banks Use Passport Recognition 
<p>A leading European neobank integrated passport recognition into its digital onboarding.</p>
<p>Before:</p>
 
 Manual ID verification took 6–12 hours
<p></p> 
 20% drop-off due to long wait times
<p></p> 
 
<p>After:</p>
 
 Verification in under 60 seconds
<p></p> 
 Conversion rate improved by 37%
<p></p> 
 Fraud attempts decreased by 45%
<p></p> 
 
<p>Talk about ROI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Challenges to Watch Out For 
<p>While powerful, passport recognition isn’t without its hurdles.</p>
  Low-Quality Images 
<p>Crinkled pages, bad lighting, or glare can cause recognition failures. Always guide users to scan in good light.</p>
  Document Forgery 
<p>Some fake passports can bypass simple OCR-only systems. That’s why layered security with AI, facial matching, and liveness detection is a must.</p>
  Device Limitations 
<p>Older mobile devices may struggle with camera quality. Make sure your SDK supports fallback options or minimum device specs.</p>
<p></p>
 Choosing the Right Passport Recognition SDK 
<p>Not all tools are created equal. Here’s what to look for in a solid passport recognition solution:</p>
 
  MRZ extraction &amp; validation
<p></p> 
  Face matching capability
<p></p> 
  Cross-platform support (iOS, Android, Web)
<p></p> 
  Real-time results (&lt; 3 seconds)
<p></p> 
  Built-in compliance (GDPR, KYC, AML)
<p></p> 
  Developer documentation &amp; SDK support
<p></p> 
 
<p>Some top players also include open-source demo tools, sample UIs, and REST APIs to make integration smooth.</p>

<p>At 1Kosmos, we believe that technology, when put to good use, has the power to transform lives and communities. That’s why, when <a href="https://www.bell.ca/">Bell Canada</a>, one of our valued customers and a longstanding champion of youth mental health, invited us to join their annual fundraising golf tournament for <a href="https://kidshelpphone.ca/">Kids Help Phone</a>, we enthusiastically accepted.</p>
 More Than a Game: An Event with Impact 
<p>Every year, Bell Canada brings together the brightest minds from across IT, InfoSec, Fraud, and business leadership for an event that’s about so much more than golf.

			 Apex Digital 3.0 is Live – The Future of Finance Starts Now 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>To truly scale tokenisation, we need a global force at the heart of capital markets. A player with the reach, trust, and operational strength to be able to bring all stakeholders out of fragmented and manual systems into the future of on-chain finance.</p>
<p>That player is Apex Group.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Apex Group launched Apex Digital 3.0, the digital infrastructure that seamlessly bridges traditional finance with on-chain finance at scale.</p>
<p>This is a turning point for our industry. Apex Digital 3.0 is not a product, it’s a movement to transform global finance, redefine distribution, and unlock liquidity. For the first time, a global asset servicer now offers blockchain-powered infrastructure for tokenisation and stablecoins, covering everything from regulatory setup, structuring to issuance, compliance, servicing, and global distribution.</p>
<p>In today’s market, launching a tokenised product is slow and fragmented. Issuers must juggle multiple providers, face regulatory complexity, and often wait months, only to end up with limited liquidity and poor distribution. It’s impossible to scale that way.</p>
<p>With Apex Digital 3.0, we’ve changed the game. Everything is integrated. Tokenising existing assets or natively issuing ones on-chain can be done within a few weeks. What’s more, Apex Group clients, who already entrust them to operate over $3.5 trillion in assets, can now move on-chain seamlessly, without changing the tools or workflows they know.</p>
<p>To them, it simply feels like an upgrade, and they will gain new capabilities. It includes 24/7 subscriptions, redemptions, and transfers; access to multiple secondary trading venues and borrowing or lending in a real-time DeFi application. No disruption. Just a next-generation investor experience.</p>
<p>What truly sets Apex Digital 3.0 apart is its ability to bring all stakeholders together, including issuers, investors, allocators, and distributors. Tokenised assets can connect directly with existing investor pools, including through multiple distribution channels and physical events like Apex Invest. This dramatically enhances both liquidity and distribution, solving one of the most critical and long-missing pieces in the industry.</p>
<p>Tokenisation finally works, at scale. Tokeny’s technology is the foundation of this transformation. We’re delivering blockchain capability that integrates across the entire value chain and fund lifecycle, enhancing the experience and value for all of Apex Group’s clients.</p>
<p>Daniel and Luc are proud to be appointed to lead Apex Digital 3.0, powered by the full strength of the Tokeny team. Our mission becomes bigger: To transform financial markets and unlock access for all. Just as Microsoft put a computer on every desk, we’re building the digital infrastructure to put private assets in every portfolio, bringing the future of finance to everyone.</p>
<p>This marks a brand new chapter, and we’re proud to be writing it with you!</p>

 1. Can I have confidence to hold&nbsp;Aergo?   Confidence should be grounded in understanding the current direction and internal activity of the&nbsp;project.  Aergo has undergone major changes and is now transitioning into HPP (House Party Protocol), a more modern and AI-aligned infrastructure.  A Living Roadmap is actively maintained, offering transparent updates about progress, team deliverables, and launch timelines.  Investors are encouraged to review the roadmap and evaluate their belief in the foundation’s vision.   2. Why migrate from Aergo to&nbsp;HPP?   A major community governance vote in March 2025 (AIP-21) resulted in overwhelming support for migrating Aergo into HPP, representing a new direction.  The goal of HPP is to modernize the infrastructure, introduce AI-native functionality, and align with current market needs, particularly in areas such as modular architecture, agent-based execution, and scalability.  HPP maintains the legacy of Aergo while positioning the ecosystem for growth in the next 3–5&nbsp;years.  The community vote saw near-unanimous support and had higher participation than many larger market-cap projects.   3. How will the token migration from Aergo to HPP work on exchanges?   The migration process is exchange-dependent. Each exchange may handle the conversion differently (e.g., automatic swap, opt-in, withdrawal only).  The team is working closely with major partners and will provide detailed guidance as each exchange finalizes its&nbsp;plan.  Community members should stay tuned on official channels (Telegram, X) for updates related to their preferred platforms.   4. When is HPP mainnet launching?   The public mainnet is targeted for Q3 2025, which is ~3 months earlier than initially projected in the March&nbsp;AIP.  The testnet has already been completed, and the private mainnet is now live, with developer tools being actively rolled&nbsp;out.  The team is deliberately not announcing an exact date to maintain flexibility and ensure&nbsp;quality.  Rushed deadlines can cause avoidable bugs and quality&nbsp;issues.  Precise dates can lead to price manipulation through derivatives trading or “sell-the-news” behavior.   5. Why keep the launch date&nbsp;private?   HPP is a digital product, not constrained by logistics like physical goods or theater releases.  A flexible launch date allows for rigorous QA and performance testing before going&nbsp;live.  Avoiding a public date also prevents speculative volatility, as many traders use fixed timelines for leverage and price&nbsp;swings.  The team prioritizes quality and stability over&nbsp;hype.   6. When is Booost launching on&nbsp;HPP?   Booost is already deployed on testnet and is currently running on the private&nbsp;mainnet.  While technically live, its public launch is imminent, pending final readiness checks.  Booost’s integration is a key milestone in showcasing HPP’s support for identity verification and anti-deepfake primitives.   7. What is VaasBlock building on&nbsp;HPP?   VaasBlock is building W3DB.io, a Web3-native intelligence and verification platform.  Think of it as a cross between IMDB, Crunchbase, and CoinMarketCap, focusing on projects and individuals.  Community members can contribute by: verifying project and team data, training AI models, and tagging and labeling datasets.  In return, they can earn token&nbsp;rewards.  HPP was selected as the base layer due to its multi-chain design, existing exchange access, and built-in support for AI-integrated workflows   8. What’s the “next big news” that could make Aergo&nbsp;pop?   The community member’s question assumes a correlation between announcements and price, but this is rare unless connected to major macro headlines or&nbsp;figures.  That said, the HPP mainnet launch is arguably the most significant upcoming milestone in terms of long-term fundamentals.  However, no one can guarantee whether it will result in a price “pop” — and speculation shouldn’t drive strategic decisions.   9. Why is engagement low? What about marketing?   A community member voiced concerns about low social media engagement and marketing visibility.  The team responded with the following key points:<br>1) HPP does not engage in artificial engagement tactics like bots or paid shill armies.<br>2) Most projects with unusually high engagement have manipulated metrics, which don’t reflect real community or product traction.<br>3) VaasBlock uses a marketing effectiveness score that evaluates campaigns based on their actual impact (price, volume, etc.) rather than vanity&nbsp;metrics.  According to that model, Aergo/HPP ranks in the top 20% of current Web3 projects.  The team is focused on building lasting value, not temporary hype.   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-talks-19-token-roadmap-and-exchange-fb4486211a7d">[Aergo Talks #19] Token, Roadmap, and Exchange</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>U.S. nonprofits must now comply with AML regulations that require verifying partner organizations, grantees, and key stakeholders. This article explores how NGOs can implement efficient KYB workflows that support transparency and risk management – without compromising mission alignment or donor confidence.</p>
 
 Nonprofits and NGOs operating in the United States are increasingly being drawn into the regulatory spotlight. While historically exempt from many financial compliance requirements, today’s nonprofits – especially those with international operations, grant-making activities, or large donation flows—must now consider how to comply with know-your-business (KYB) and AML standards. 
<p>The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury have flagged the misuse of charitable organizations as a financial crime risk, prompting increased expectations for due diligence and transparency.</p>
 AML Expectations for U.S. NGOs in 2025 
<p>Although not all nonprofits fall under Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) obligations, those that:</p>
 
 Partner with foreign NGOs 
 Disburse grants or funds abroad 
 Receive high-risk donations or funding 
 Operate in or near sanctioned jurisdictions 
 
<p>…are expected to implement stronger controls for:</p>
 
 Beneficial ownership checks of partners and grantees 
 Screening for PEPs, sanctions, and adverse media 
 Documentation of financial flows and governance structures 
 
<p>Many large donors and financial institutions now require NGOs to demonstrate AML and KYB compliance as part of their funding eligibility or banking relationships.</p>
 Key Challenges for Nonprofits 
<p>1. Mission vs. Compliance Tension<br>
Nonprofits often fear that intrusive checks could alienate partners or deter grassroots engagement.</p>
<p>2. Resource Constraints<br>
Lean teams and limited budgets make enterprise-grade compliance tools impractical.</p>
<p>3. Complex Partnership Networks<br>
Sub-grantees and foreign affiliates may operate with different legal, cultural, or documentation norms.</p>
<p>4. Donor and Reputational Risk<br>
Failure to vet grantees properly could result in diverted funds, scandal, or funding suspension.</p>
 How iComply Supports KYB for Nonprofits 
<p>iComply offers a configurable KYB solution tailored to the needs of donor-driven and mission-aligned organizations.</p>
 1. Entity Verification for Partners and Grantees 
 
 Validate EINs, incorporation status, and legal representatives 
 Confirm banking and operational legitimacy 
 Request and review key documentation (bylaws, governance structures, etc.) 
 
 2. UBO Discovery and Risk Screening 
 
 Identify the real owners or controllers of partner organizations 
 Screen individuals and entities against OFAC and international sanctions lists 
 Flag politically exposed persons and adverse media links 
 
 3. Low-Friction Onboarding 
 
 Send white-labeled onboarding requests to partners and affiliates 
 Guide users through structured KYB flows without requiring technical expertise 
 Preserve relationship integrity with customizable language and guidance 
 
 4. Risk-Based Review and Recordkeeping 
 
 Automate risk scoring and escalation rules 
 Maintain audit-ready logs of verification outcomes and partner engagements 
 Export data for funders, auditors, or internal governance reviews 
 
 Case Insight: Global Health NGO Based in DC 
<p>A U.S.-based nonprofit distributing grants in Latin America implemented iComply’s KYB workflows for vetting sub-recipients. In less than 8 weeks:</p>
 
 Verified over 40 active partners 
 Flagged 2 entities with incomplete governance disclosure 
 Met due diligence standards required by a new multilateral funder 
 
 What to Expect in 2025 
 
 Funder-Led KYB Standards: Multilaterals and private foundations will increasingly expect NGOs to vet grantees with audit-ready procedures 
 BSA and IRS Alignment: Expanded clarity on nonprofit AML responsibilities may emerge from the U.S. Treasury or IRS 
 Reputation Risk Enforcement: Media and donor scrutiny will intensify around due diligence failures 
 
 Take Action 
<p>Nonprofits must build AML resilience without compromising their mission. KYB automation offers a path to greater transparency, donor confidence, and regulatory alignment.</p>
<p>Connect with iComply to learn how we help NGOs and nonprofits build trust through streamlined, values-aligned compliance.</p>

				  Indicio’s flagship product supports the issuance, holding, and verification of SD-JWT VCs, Europe’s choice of Verifiable Credential for privacy-preserving digital identity in the European Union Digital Wallet (EUDI).  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By: Trevor Butterworth</p>
<p>By 2026, the European Union has mandated that every member country provide its citizens, residents, and businesses with a secure, interoperable digital wallet so that they can use Verifiable Credentials to prove who they are and share information across borders, platforms, and services, online and offline, across all EU member states.</p>
<p>For its Verifiable Credential format, the EU will use SD-JWT VCs.</p>
 What is&nbsp; SD-JWT VC? 
<p>The acronym stands for Selective Disclosure JSON Web Token Verifiable Credential. </p>
<p>A JSON Web Token is a standardized way to share digitally-signed information between parties. Selective disclosure means that this information can be shared selectively, thereby enabling a party to restrict the data they share to the specifics needed for a given purpose. Verifiable credential means the JWT includes the specific data formats as well as validation and processing rules required to express Verifiable Credentials.</p>
 Why is this important? 
<p>Simply put, it enables data privacy and increases security.</p>
<p>The easiest way to understand this is by looking at how we share information to access resources using physical credentials, like a driver’s license.</p>
<p>To verify age for purchasing an age-restricted item, a person would present a physical ID that contained their date of birth, typically a driver’s license, passport, or national ID card. But in presenting that ID, the person verifying it would be able to see all the personal data on the ID. </p>
<p>In an age of identity theft, this is no longer tenable. But it is also unacceptable in terms of data privacy. Selective disclosure is non-negotiable for the European Union. EU data privacy law —&nbsp;GDPR —&nbsp;requires organizations minimize the data they collect, process, and store to fulfill a specific purpose; selective disclosure makes minimization easy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to issue and verify SD-JWT Verifiable Credentials with Indicio Proven</p>
<p>Access Indicio Proven, either using its interface or its API, and connect your existing IAM, CRM, HR software, identity provider, API, or database. Select the SD-JWT VC from the menu and start issuing credentials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio Proven’s verifier software automatically accepts SD-JWT VCs, so you have&nbsp; immediate interoperability with all EU digital wallets..&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 Why go with Indicio Proven for your EU credential solution? 
<p>Indicio was the first to demonstrate interoperability between SD-JWT VC and AnonCreds credentials in a single workflow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ll shortly enable similar interoperability with mdoc/mDL and W3C VC credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simply put, if you want to interoperate globally, Proven has proved itself in the real world.</p>
<p>There are two other important reasons for choosing Indicio Proven.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It enables you to scale rapidly to any level of issuance or verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has the most powerful governance solution in the marketplace, allowing you to easily orchestrate credential roles, trust lists, and workflows in hierarchical ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And because governance is cached as a machine-readable file for each credential issuer, holder, and verifier, offline verification is possible using BLE, NFC, or Wifi Aware.</p>

 The Rising Threat of Candidate Fraud  
<p>Remote work has drastically changed hiring, unintentionally creating new opportunities for fraud. Reports indicate a significant jump in fraudulent activity, with some analyses suggesting one in six applicants for remote roles show signs of fraud. Experts project that by 2028, AI-generated job applicant profiles could account for one in four candidates globally. This surge in remote onboarding fraud poses serious threats, including financial losses, security risks, and legal issues. To combat this, strong identity verification is now essential for modern fraud prevention.</p> 
<p></p> 
<br> 
  
 Types of Candidate Fraud: Breaking Down the Tactics  
<p>Fraudsters use various clever methods to get into organizations. Understanding these tactics is key to building effective defenses.</p> 
  
  Fake Qualifications Fraud: This involves candidates fabricating resumes, exaggerating qualifications, or providing false references to secure a job they're not fit for. This can include inventing work histories or boosting grades.  
  Synthetic Identity Fraud: A more advanced technique, where fraudsters combine real and made-up personal information to create a new, seemingly legitimate identity. This makes detection harder for standard background checks.  
  Deepfake-based Impersonation: Leveraging AI, fraudsters generate realistic video and voice simulations to impersonate real people during video interviews, making it very difficult to tell if the person is genuine.  
  Stolen Identity: Criminals steal legitimate job seekers' personal data and use it to apply for jobs and pass checks. This victimizes the individual whose identity is stolen and risks the hiring company onboarding a malicious person.  
  
<p></p> 
 Understanding the Business Implications of Candidate Fraud  
<p>The fallout from candidate fraud goes far beyond just a bad hire, affecting many different parts of a business.</p> 
  
  Financial Losses: Bringing on unqualified individuals can lead to lower productivity, mistakes, and potential financial liabilities due to misconduct or poor performance, directly hitting your company's bottom line.  
  Reputational Damage: If it comes out that your company hired people with fake credentials or if fraudulent activity becomes public, it can severely damage trust among clients, partners, and the general public, harming your brand's reputation.  
  Legal and Regulatory Noncompliance: Failing to properly check candidates can lead to not following industry-specific rules and data protection laws, resulting in significant legal penalties and hefty fines.  
  Security Breaches: Fraudulent employees, especially those with bad intentions, pose a direct risk of data theft, loss of intellectual property, or other critical security breaches that can have devastating effects on your organization.  
  Operational Disruption: Having unqualified or fraudulent staff can disrupt workflows, require expensive extra training, and lead to higher employee turnover, all of which hinder efficient business operations and how you use your resources.  
  
 Hiring Fraud Prevention Tactics for Human Resources  
<p>To effectively fight the growing problem of candidate fraud, HR departments need to adopt proactive and strong prevention strategies.</p> 
 Implement a Top-Notch Identity Verification Solution That Follows Best Practices  
<p>Putting a comprehensive identity verification solution in place is absolutely crucial. Such a solution should simplify and automate identity-proofing processes, offer additional re-verification steps at important moments, and accurately verify identities while balancing strict security with ease of use for candidates. This includes verifying candidates during onboarding.</p> 
 Stronger Interviewing Techniques  
<p>Go beyond basic interviews and add more advanced methods:</p> 
  
  Conduct live technical assessments to truly verify claimed skills.  
  Make video interviews mandatory and use technology to check for deepfakes and AI-generated voice simulations.  
  Cross-check social media profiles for anything odd or inconsistent with the information provided.  
  
 Background Screening Enhancements  
<p>Boost your background screening processes:</p> 
  
  Use reputable third-party background check providers that employ advanced fraud detection techniques.  
  Consider continuous employee monitoring even after the initial onboarding to spot any suspicious behavior or changes.  
  
 Use Zero Trust &amp; Identity Security During Hiring<br>  
  
  It's time to team up with your security crew and embed cutting-edge zero trust and identity security into your entire hiring pipeline. This powerful partnership creates a proactive defense against fraud right from the start.  
  Ditch those old-school passwords. They're a major weak spot for phishing and brute-force attacks. By embracing passwordless methods like biometrics or FIDO passkeys, you slam the door on fraudsters trying to steal credentials to access your systems.  
  Then, supercharge your verification with zero trust principles and FIDO passkeys. The core idea is simple but revolutionary: "never trust, always verify". Every single access request is questioned until it's proven legitimate. This enables continuous authentication, so even if a bad actor slips through the cracks initially, their movements are instantly flagged and restricted. FIDO passkeys are the perfect tool for this, providing a highly secure and slick way to ensure only the verified individual can advance at every step of the hiring journey.&nbsp;  
  
<p></p> 
 Candidate Fraud Real-World Cases  
<p>The threat of candidate fraud isn't just theoretical; it has real, tangible consequences for businesses worldwide. These aren't isolated incidents but a growing trend that highlights the critical need for advanced identity verification and constant vigilance.</p> 
<p>The HYPR blog post, "<a href="https://blog.hypr.com/hypr-unmasks-fake-it-worker">HYPR Unmasks a Fake IT Worker: North Korea Isn't the Only Threat</a>," shares a firsthand account of how HYPR successfully stopped a potential fraud attempt involving a highly sophisticated impersonator. This incident clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of robust identity verification in a real-world situation. The fraudster presented a convincing resume and tried to mimic legitimate behavior, but HYPR's system was able to detect the deception, preventing a potentially damaging security breach.</p> 
<p>Beyond individual cases, broader patterns of hiring fraud illustrate the severity of the problem:</p> 
 The North Korean IT Worker Scheme  
<p>Reports detail how fraudulent IT workers, sometimes linked to state-sponsored activities, infiltrate companies using fake identities. They pose as remote software engineers, using fake profiles and stolen identities to gain employment. These schemes often aim to steal data or funnel illicit wages back to their countries, posing both financial and national security risks.</p> 
 Financial Sector Impersonation  
<p>The financial sector has seen cases where individuals with false credentials or stolen identities gained access to critical systems. Such incidents lead to significant financial losses, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage. Impersonators might use fake certifications to get roles in sensitive departments, then exploit their access for fraud or data theft.</p> 
 The Rise of AI-Generated Resumes  
<p>With generative AI tools, companies now regularly encounter applicants submitting entirely computer-generated resumes and cover letters that are hard to distinguish from genuine ones. Additionally, deepfake technology enables interview fraud where candidates use AI to create convincing video and voice simulations for remote interviews, making it difficult to identify genuine candidates.</p> 
 Protect Your Business Against Hiring Fraud with HYPR Affirm  
<p>Strong authentication and verification processes are no longer just an option; they’re an absolute necessity. Hiring fraud is constantly evolving, with new and more sophisticated tactics emerging daily. Traditional background checks and manual verification methods simply aren’t enough to keep pace with the cleverness of modern fraudsters.</p> 
<p>This is precisely where a dedicated, robust identity verification solution like HYPR Affirm becomes indispensable. HYPR Affirm is specifically designed to prevent candidate fraud by confirming the true identity of every applicant, right from the initial application stage through to onboarding.

  Document Verification: Authenticating government-issued IDs, passports, and other official documents for signs of tampering or forgery, ensuring their legitimacy.  
  Liveness Detection: Ensuring that the person presenting the identity is a real, live individual and not a spoof, a photograph, or a sophisticated deepfake.  
  Location: Verifying the candidate's physical location against expected or declared information to detect inconsistencies that may signal fraud.  
  Manager Attestation: Enabling a step-up escalation for complex cases by allowing a manager or help desk agent to conduct a live chat and video call for final verification.  
  
<p>HYPR Affirm verifies candidates at critical touchpoints throughout the hiring journey, creating a formidable barrier against deception. This multi-layered approach significantly reduces the risks associated with various types of fraud, including:</p> 
  
  Synthetic identities: By cross-referencing multiple data points and using advanced algorithms to detect fabricated personal details.  
  Deepfake impersonations: By employing sophisticated liveness detection and forensic analysis during video interactions to ensure the person on screen is genuinely real.  
  Stolen credentials: By verifying that the individual applying is indeed the legitimate holder of the presented identity documents.  
  
<p>This comprehensive approach safeguards your entire hiring process, shielding your business from the profound consequences of financial loss, potentially devastating security breaches, and irreparable damage to your reputation. With HYPR Affirm, you can confidently build your team, knowing that you're bringing on genuine talent, not an elaborate deception.</p> 
 Key Takeaways  
  
  Candidate fraud is a growing danger, made worse by remote hiring, leading to significant financial losses and security vulnerabilities.  
  Fraudsters use many different methods, including fake qualifications, synthetic identities, deepfake technology, and stolen personal data.  
  The business implications are severe, covering financial losses, harm to reputation, legal non-compliance, and security breaches.  
  Implementing a comprehensive identity verification solution, improving interviewing techniques, enhancing background checks, and adopting zero trust principles are all crucial for effective prevention.  
  
 Conclusion  
<p>Candidate fraud, increasingly fueled by remote hiring and sophisticated tactics like deepfakes, poses significant financial, reputational, and security risks to businesses. Combating this evolving threat requires a multi-faceted approach, including robust identity verification, improved interviewing techniques, enhanced background checks, and a strong zero-trust security posture.</p>

  ‘STEM for ALL’ : Thales Joins the Singapore-Industry Scholarship (SgIS) Programme 
prezly

Thu, 07/31/2025 - 14:52


             
 As a Sponsoring Organisation with SgIS, Thales will provide Singaporean undergraduate students scholarships in a comprehensive programme that includes internship, mentoring and a starting career with Thales.  
 With this initiative, Thales is extending its ‘STEM for ALL’ programme to Singapore, the first launch outside Europe, with its dedicated mission to advance STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education amongst youth. 
 In its inaugural intake, four nominated scholars will undertake engineering or research roles in strategic sectors including air traffic management, public security, cybersecurity and digital identity, working within Thales businesses and research labs like the Thales Digital Factory. 
 

             <br>
 
 
 
©&nbsp;Thales

<p>With engineers comprising one-third of Thales Singapore’s 2000+ employees, the Group has a strong interest in promoting STEM education and growing the next generation of engineering talent. On 29th July, Thales was proud to join SgIS as a Sponsorship Organisation at its launch event and to present awards to the scholars, aligning with the government’s mandate to develop young talent in Singapore’s strategic sectors. </p>
<p>Established in 2012, SgIS is an initiative which partners government and industries to nurture a strong core of Singaporean talent in 16 strategic industries which include Aerospace &amp; Aviation and Engineering. It is the only government-led, multi-industry scholarship under the Ministry of Education which provides talented Singaporean students access to close to 150 Sponsoring Organisations, giving them development opportunities as they further their studies and begin their professional careers. </p>
<p>Throughout May and June, over 100 potential candidates with diverse skillsets were introduced to Thales by SgIS and invited to an Open Day to get to know Thales’ businesses. From this, over 40 were taken through rigorous technical assessments, following which 12 were further shortlisted for panel interviews with Thales experts and business leaders to further assess their technical expertise and leadership attributes. </p>
<p>Four talented candidates from the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) were the final recipients of the Thales award. Currently at different stages in their university education, the four students will progressively join the cybersecurity and digital identity, public security, air traffic management and Thales Digital Factory teams over the next 2 years.</p>
<p>Expanding the Thales Group’s STEM for ALL Programme to Singapore</p>
<p>In early 2025, Thales, through its endowment fund Thales Solidarity, launched its STEM for ALL programme in France and Belgium to foster vocation in scientific fields to remarkable young students. </p>
<p>By partnering the SgIS programme, Thales is extending the Group’s ambition in endorsing STEM education worldwide by reinforcing academic excellence. Singapore is the first country outside of Europe to have a STEM scholarship programme under the STEM for ALL umbrella.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Thales recognises the&nbsp;essential role that science and technology&nbsp;play in furthering human progress and creating a world that is safer, greener and more sustainable. Many of the younger generation are passionate about making an impact and we are constantly looking for talented individuals, skilled in STEM, to help bring this ambition to life.” said Emily TAN, Country Director &amp; Chief Executive, Thales in Singapore. “The scholars we selected have strong technical skills which we hope to nurture when they join the Thales family. I believe that their enthusiasm to learn, coupled with the mentorship opportunities and experiences within Thales, will provide a good starting point for their careers.”</p></blockquote>

  <p>Digital applications constantly deal with identities. It’s important to verify identity at the application’s front door through authentication. Several mature and sophisticated techniques and standards for user authentication, such as <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/openid-connect-protocol">OpenID Connect (OIDC)</a> and <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/saml/">Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)</a>, allow a trusted identity provider (IDP) to securely authenticate the user before allowing access to an application.</p>

<p>However, front door authentication is not the only context in which identities must be verified.</p>

<p>Consider the following scenarios:</p>
 
   Update your email address through a bank’s customer service 
   Recover the userID/password through HelpDesk 
   Securely perform a transaction at a retail Point of Sale (POS) system 
   Authenticate with browser-constrained devices, such as smart speakers 
   Authenticate from a shared kiosk 
 

<p>In each of the above cases, though the identities need to be verified, it might not be possible or appropriate to have the user perform authentication through an interactive login interface such as a web browser.</p>

 How applications handle identity verification today 

<p>While it’s popular to leverage secure IDP and standards to provide initial authentication through a login interface, identity verification in places such as above is built in an ad hoc manner. Depending on design, some applications do this inefficiently with a terrible customer experience, while others are less secure and vulnerable.</p>

 Let’s step through identity verification scenarios 

<p>Consider identity verification needs where you can’t rely on a traditional user authentication process, such as when multiple parties or browser-constrained systems are involved. Let’s examine those cases and identify identity security pitfalls.</p>

 Update email address for bank accounts 

<p>Consider a user calls customer service to update the email address associated with their bank account. Often, the helpline personnel ask the user for certain personally identifiable information ( PII) answers such as last name, date of birth, and last 4 digits of social security number. Upon verification, the helpline personnel updates the email address through the customer care application, which performs privileged operations on the bank’s identity database to change the user record.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There are problems with the approach.</p>

<p>First, the customer experience is not great. The customer also needs to provide PII information for verification, which an attacker can guess or obtain using <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/social_engineering">social engineering</a>. This can easily lead to an account takeover, where a fraudulent actor can successfully pass the verifications and infiltrate the account with a new email ID.
The second issue is that the customer care application needs to change the user profile from the backend without authentication. The application would typically use powerful credentials to perform such a privileged operation. For example, an application can obtain and use a token with user management privileges to call the user update API. Such a token allows updating user accounts in the banking system directory, but it can be misused if the token leaks.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be nice to get some form of token that provides the application with just enough privilege to update only the calling user profile? That way, it could adhere to the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/least_privilege">least privilege</a> principle of security.</p>

 Point of Sale (POS) payment 

<p>This is another interesting scenario. When a user tries to pay in the retail Point of Sale (POS) system with a bank account, they won’t be comfortable signing in to their bank account on a shared device and providing their credentials.</p>

<p>Instead, it would be ideal if the POS system allowed secure payments with an alternative form of verification, where the user does not need to provide their credentials in a public system!</p>

<p>Can we do something to decouple user authentication from the application?</p>

 Use CIBA to verify identity transactions securely and consistently 

<p>The idea is to decouple authentication from the application so that it can be initiated on one device and verified on another. Client-Initiated Backchannel Authentication (CIBA) allows exactly that separation.</p>

<p>CIBA is a relatively new authentication flow based on <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">OAuth 2.0</a> in which the client can initiate an interaction flow to authenticate the users without having end-user interaction from the consumption device. The flow involves back-channel communication from the client to the OAuth 2.0 authorization provider without redirecting through the user’s browser (consumption device). The authentication would be verified independently from a separate authentication device, such as a phone or smartwatch, in possession of the user and securely enrolled with the provider.</p>

 CIBA enables a smooth authentication experience 

<p>Consider the following flow for our banking email address use case.</p>

<p></p>

 
   The customer care application initiates an authentication event for the user. It sends a direct CIBA request to the authorization server. 
   Unlike a regular login page, the user is redirected to, the authorization server sends a push notification to the user’s phone. 
   The authorization server is notified when the user accepts the notification on her phone/smartwatch. 
   The authorization server then issues a user token to the application. The application uses the user-scoped token to complete the target operation, which is updating the email address. 
 

<p>A few benefits of this approach are:</p>
 
   The user experience becomes smoother during verification. It also can instill confidence in users that the system operates securely. 
   Push notification offers higher security than other out-of-band user authentication methods, such as SMS one-time code (OTP). 
   The application token can be narrowly scoped to the user, providing the least privileged access. 
 

<p>Here is a simplified flow of a transaction using CIBA.</p>

<p></p>

 CIBA builds upon OAuth 2.0 and OIDC 

<p>CIBA is an extension on top of OIDC, which itself is based on the OAuth 2.0 framework. It brings in a new OAuth 2.0 grant type in the family: <code>urn:openid:params:grant-type:ciba</code>. As customary with the OIDC discovery endpoint, CIBA introduces additional metadata parameters, such as <code>backchannel_token_delivery_modes_supported</code> and <code>backchannel_authentication_endpoint</code>. The discovery document payload looks like this:</p>

   <code>{
    "issuer": "...",
    "authorization_endpoint": ".../authorize",
    "token_endpoint": ".../token",
    "userinfo_endpoint": ".../userinfo",
    "jwks_uri": "...",
    "grant_types_supported":[
      "authorization_code",
      "refresh_token",
      "password",
      "urn:openid:params:grant-type:ciba"
    ],
    "backchannel_token_delivery_modes_supported":["poll", "ping", "push"],
    "backchannel_authentication_endpoint": "",
    ....
}

</code>   

<p>The <code>backchannel_token_delivery_modes_supported</code> parameter needs some additional commentary. The specification defines three different modes of notifying the client about the completion of authentication.</p>
 
   Poll: In this mode, the client keeps polling the authorization server until the authentication is complete or the event times out. In case of successful authentication, the final poll returns the tokens to the application. This mode is the simplest and easiest to implement. 
   Ping: When the authentication is complete, it will call back to a registered URL of the client, notifying the status. The client makes a request to the authorization server for tokens. 
   Push: When the authentication is complete, it will call back to the client’s registered URL with the tokens. 
 

<p>Ping and Push modes are more complex to implement and need additional metadata and implementation steps on the client side. However, it saves network trips caused by the polling cycle.</p>

<p>Since the CIBA request uses a back-channel, it must contain a parameter that the authorization server can use to identify the user. Typically, the parameter is supplied using the <code>login_hint</code> or <code>id_token_hint parameter</code> of the request.</p>

<p>The authentication device performs out-of-band authentication instead of the traditional authentication flow, where the client interacts with the authorization server sequentially. In practical implementations, it would be a push notification to a device such as a phone or smartwatch. The device needs to be securely registered to the authorization server for the user so that it knows where to send the authorization request. The push notification can be delivered by embedding the mechanism in the application’s mobile application or using a companion authenticator application.</p>

 Security considerations when using CIBA 

<p>CIBA is vulnerable to attacks akin to an <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mfa-fatigue-hackers-new-favorite-tactic-in-high-profile-breaches/#google_vignette">MFA fatigue attack</a>. Consider the case where an attacker guesses a user ID or infiltrates a user account and repeatedly attempts to carry out a sensitive transaction implemented using CIBA authorization. The real user might get overwhelmed by repeated push notifications and accept one.</p>

<p>A related scenario is when the attacker has a list of user IDs and initiates transactions for each. While most users would ignore the push prompt, a small percentage could approve the request.</p>

<p>In summary, CIBA suffers from a weakness where an attacker can force-initiate an authorization event. In certain scenarios, a more secure alternative is the <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8628">device code flow</a>, where a user can actively initiate authorization on their device using a QR code or one-time code.</p>

<p>Also, CIBA should not be used in a same-device scenario where the consumption and authentication devices are the same.</p>

 CIBA support in Okta 

<p>CIBA is not yet widely implemented. Okta has been an early adopter of the CIBA standard.</p>

<p>CIBA is rapidly gaining traction in the banking industry. <a href="https://openid.net/wg/fapi">FAPI</a> specifications, developed based on the OAuth 2.0 token model, include the <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-ciba.html">CIBA profile</a>. CIBA, along with complementary product offerings such as <a>Demonstrating Proof of Possession (DPoP)</a>, make up the key components required for highly regulated identity.</p>

<p>In Europe, CIBA can help implement the decoupled authentication flows outlined by <a href="https://www.okta.com/resources/whitepaper/implications-around-psd2-and-open-banking/">PSD2 and UK Open Banking</a>. <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/by-industry/banking-and-finance/the-consumer-data-right">Consumer Data Right (CDR)</a> in Australia is expected to include the specification soon.
Beyond the banking industry, CIBA is promising to provide enhanced security and user experience for the Helpdesk, customer service, retail Point of Sale (POS), Interactive Voice Response (<a href="https://www.ttec.com/glossary/interactive-voice-response">IVR</a>), and shared kiosk-based applications.</p>

<p>Okta supports CIBA in poll mode, a feature called <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/configure-ciba/main/">Transactional Verification</a>. The <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-servers/">Okta authorization server</a> includes the CIBA grant as part of the support.</p>

<p>The authentication process is supported by allowing the creation of a mobile push authenticator using <a href="https://www.okta.com/blog/2020/10/showcase20-introducing-the-okta-devices-sdk-and-api-a-better-way-to-secure-and-delight-mobile-users/">the Okta device SDK</a>. This SDK can be easily embedded in the organization’s mobile application or as a separate companion application. Check out the iOS and Android guides on how to implement a branded push authenticator using the SDK. The guides include sample applications to get you quickly started building the experience.</p>

 Use CIBA for secure identity verification in your apps 

<p>Digital applications are crucial for every business, and securing them is paramount. It’s not enough to protect just the front door with authentications. Applications must always be vigilant during their operations and operate on a <a href="https://www.nist.gov/publications/zero-trust-architecture">zero-trust</a> model. CIBA is an important tool to ensure that applications enforce continuous and secure authorization in appropriate contexts without compromising the user experience.</p>

<p>A masked email address is a unique, automatically generated email address that you can use to shield your primary email from spam and email scams like <a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-recognize-and-avoid-phishing-scams">phishing attacks</a>.</p>



<p>Email masking adds a layer of protection between you and your inbox—and with data breaches and fraud at <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/5-shock-stats-prove-most-people-have-had-their-personal-data-stolen/">record highs</a>, masked email, as well as email aliases, temporary email, and disposable email, are now popular privacy tools.</p>



<p>But if you’re searching for truly private and secure email, you can do much better than masked email. MySudo has loads of benefits over other email options and we’ll cover them all here—but first, let’s do the 101 on masked email.</p>



 Is a masked email the same as an email alias? 



<p>Email masking is sometimes confused with email aliasing, but they’re not the same.</p>



<p>An email alias is a secondary email address (usually a variation of your primary email address) that sits in your primary inbox—whereas a masked email is an entirely separate email account that gets forwarded to your primary email inbox.</p>



<p>But a masked email is not a temporary email or a disposable email, either.</p>



<p>A temporary email address is usually set up to receive one-off messages, has no sending capability, and will auto-expire after a set time or set number of uses.</p>



<p>A disposable email is like a temporary email but typically lasts longer. It may have limited sending capability for replies. You can throw away your disposable email whenever you’re done with it.</p>



 How does email masking work? 



<p>While your primary email provider can handle your email aliases, you’ll need a third-party provider to run your masked email service. Here’s what happens:&nbsp;</p>



 
 You create a masked email address through a service like Apple’s iCloud Private Relay, Firefox Relay, or a custom domain. 



 When someone sends an email to your masked address, the service forwards the email to your real inbox. 



 You read the email in your real inbox without the sender ever knowing your real email address. 
 



<p></p>



<p>Depending on the service you choose, replies will go either:</p>



 
 Via the service: Some masked email services let you send email from the masked address, so the recipient sees the masked email address, not your real email address, or 



 From your real inbox: If you reply to an email that’s been forwarded from the masked email service, the service will rewrite the “From” address to keep your real email hidden. 
 



<p></p>



<p>You can disable or delete your masked email at any time.</p>



 What type of email is MySudo email? 



<p>MySudo email is a popular secure email service with full send and receive support. It’s entirely separate from your personal email account and intentionally protects your personal email from spam and email-based scams.</p>



<p>MySudo email is better than masked email in at least 4 ways:</p>



<p></p>



 <br>1. MySudo is more than email; it’s a complete private identity management solution 



<p>Your MySudo email sits within a secure <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-is-a-sudo/#:~:text=You%20assign%20each%20of%20your,goods%2C%20or%20booking%20local%20services.">Sudo digital identity</a> which you set up, manage and retain until you decide to delete it. While email is a popular feature of a Sudo, each Sudo contains so much more, to make it a complete private identity management solution. Here’s what’s in each Sudo:</p>



 
 1 email address – for end-to-end encrypted emails between app users, and standard email with everyone else 



 1 handle – for end-to-end encrypted messages and video, voice and group calls between app users 



 1 private browser – for searching the internet without ads and tracking 



 1 phone number (optional)* – for end-to-end encrypted messaging and video, voice and group calls between app users, and standard connections with everyone else; customizable and mutable 



 1 virtual card (optional)* – for protecting your personal info and your money, like a proxy for your credit or debit card or bank account 
 



<p></p>



<p>*Phone numbers and virtual cards only available on a paid plan. Phone numbers available for US, CA and UK only. Virtual cards for US only.</p>



<p>Masked email services usually provide only disposable or relay email addresses, not full identity separation like MySudo does.</p>



<p></p>



 <br>2. You can have up to 9 separate email accounts with MySudo 



<p>The <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo-plans/">top plan</a> on MySudo entitles you to up to 9 separate Sudo digital identities, which means you can actually maintain up to 9 separate email accounts at any one time (plus 9 secondary phone numbers, private browsers, handles, and optional virtual cards).</p>



<p>The real power comes when you apply those 9 separate Sudos to different purposes in your busy life: shopping, dating, classified selling, travel, social media accounts, and more. Anywhere you don’t want to use your personal email, phone, and credit card, use your Sudo details instead. You stay private, safe and organized.

<p></p>



 <br>3. MySudo email is end-to-end encrypted between MySudo users 



<p>MySudo email is end-to-end encrypted between MySudo users. This gives you much greater privacy and control, especially for sensitive communications. You can easily <a href="https://anonyome.com/resources/blog/easy-invite-a-friend-function-is-now-in-mysudo/">invite friends and colleagues to the app</a>, so you can email, call, and message each other securely.</p>



<p>Most masked email services only forward email and don’t secure or end-to-end encrypt it beyond basic TLS during transmission.</p>



<p></p>



 <br>4. You can sign up to MySudo without giving away your personal email or any other info 



<p>Many masked email services tie the masked address to your real identity behind the scenes, but MySudo doesn’t. In fact, we can’t. That’s because MySudo won’t ask for any of your&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/">personally identifiable information</a>, like primary email address or phone number, when you set up and log in to your account. Instead, your account is protected by an authentication and encryption&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/resources/blog/encyrption-in-mysudo/">key</a>&nbsp;that never leaves your device.</p>



<p>We’ll only ask for personal information if you opt-in to use the optional MySudo&nbsp;<a href="http://anonyome.com/?s=virtual+cards">virtual cards</a> feature and for UK phone numbers, because for these services we must do a one-time verification of your identity by law.</p>



<p>So, don’t waste your time setting up masked email or email aliases for privacy. Instead, go straight to <a href="https://anonyome.com/individuals/mysudo/">MySudo</a>, where you can have up to 9 secure email addresses that shield and protect your personal email—and loads of other privacy and security features besides.</p>



<p>Download MySudo for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mysudo-protect-your-identity/id1237892621">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anonyome.mysudo">Android</a>.</p>

					 Signal to Sale: How Ultrasonic Tech is Solving Retail’s Attribution Problem 				 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>For all retailers, the physical store remains crucial for customer conversion, but the rapid expansion of digital channels has created a non-linear path from awareness to purchase. The exponential increase in consumer touchpoints makes it nearly impossible for industry leaders to draw a clear line across the whole customer journey. This disruption in the funnel universally impacts big box stores, CPGs, and small brick-and-mortar merchants alike.</p>								 
				 
				 
				 
					 How are companies supposed to invest resources into promotion campaigns when conversion metrics are basically a shot in the dark? 				 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>The Problem: In today’s retail ecosystem, merchants only truly know their customers at checkout, but by then, it’s too late. If businesses could identify their consumers throughout the entire shopping journey, they could present personalized offerings at critical stages of the buying process and understand full attribution of which promotions worked and which didn’t.</p><p>The Game Plan:</p>  Recognize which customers viewed certain TV promotions at-home  Identify customers when they enter the store  Present customers with personalized offerings during their shopping experience to increase spend or highlight higher margin items  Cultivate unique shopping experiences that increase word of mouth marketing  Gamify the checkout experience to make consumers excited for their next visit.  <p>With this equation, your retail store doesn’t become an option; it becomes the destination.</p><p>The Solution:&nbsp;LISNR’s Radius, an ultrasonic SDK capable of sending data over inaudible sound using standard speakers and microphones. Radius transmits data using frequencies higher than what humans can hear allowing these “tones” to be layered over TV broadcasts and in-store music/announcements. Our Zone66 tone profile can send data over 30 feet from standard speakers and can be used to identify a consumer and their relative location within the physical store. Once identified, merchants can send personalized offerings directly to the consumer’s device as they are in front of specific products.</p><p>Furthermore, LISNR offers Quest, a loyalty management platform that enables tracking of consumers’ purchase history and incentivizes future purchases. Utilizing the gamified nature of Quest at checkout, consumers can track their progress toward rewards and redemption, keeping the store top of mind.</p>

					</a>
				 
								 
				 
				 
				 
																														 
				 
				 
				 
									 The Proliferation of LISNR-Enabled Digital Touchpoints <p>LISNR capitalizes on digital touchpoints by enabling the delivery of valuable and personalized offers directly to consumers at various touchpoints found in everyday shopping experiences. By integrating with LISNR, retailers can enable attribution within their existing infrastructure.</p> At-Home Television <p><br>Retail media, CTV, and linear TV ad spend is projected to be around $5 billion in 2025, according to MediaPost. Retailers clearly understand the value in advertising through television; however, realizing the ROI is much more difficult. How can businesses confidently attribute an advertisement to an uptick in purchases at checkout? The answer is Radius.</p>								 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
		 
				 
				 
									<p>Radius’ ultrasonic tones can be played simultaneously with a normal TV audio broadcast. Image 1 shows an example of a Radius tone at a frequency far above standard broadcast audio being played at the human audible level. Retailers can utilize any audio stream to encourage their consumers to open their app and engage or receive a promotion. What better way to embrace the ever-present second screen?</p>

									See a TV broadcast advertisement delivery in action
					
					</a>
				 
								 
				 
				 
				 
									<p>Retailers can either broadcast a single offer to all consumers or offer a personalized coupon based on their previous shopping behavior.</p>								 
				 
				 
		 
				 
				 
												
																					Image 1: Radius tone being broadcast at a frequency higher than human hearing
										
									 
				 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
		 
				 
				 
									 In-Store Audio <p>In-store audio, whether music or PA announcements, is commonplace in retailers and is often drowned out as white noise. As a result, in-store audible advertisements often fall short, with retailers relying on consumers to be actively listening. Again, Radius can break this paradigm.</p><p>By operating simultaneously with in-store audio, consumers are seamlessly presented with personalized offers via their device. The Radius SDK even allows data to be transmitted over three distinct audio frequencies or “channels” to prevent overlapping messages. Image 2 demonstrates how three distinct data streams can be played simultaneously over audio.</p><p>For this use case, retailers can broadcast “Zone IDs” in-store to locate consumers and present relevant messaging. Once the consumer’s device receives the Zone ID for the store, the retailer’s backend app logic is able to present the consumer with a personalized offering. App logic can also be set up to limit the amount of promotions a consumer receives in a given timeframe.</p>								 
				 
				 
		 
				 
				 
							 
			 
		 
						 
				 
				 
				 
												
																					Image 2: Radius tones being broadcast over 3 different channels
										
									 
				 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
		 
				 
				 
									 At-Checkout <p>Many of today’s shopper cards or loyalty programs are either a black box for consumers, or a percentage discount disguised as loyalty points. This does nothing to create loyal or engaged customers. LISNR instead offers Quest, a gamified loyalty platform.</p><p>By creating gamified experiences, Quest taps into a different mindset of the consumer, building a connection to merchants while increasing transaction size and volume. Quest is not just about dollars spent; it empowers retailers to incentivize any customer action (visits, specific item purchases, referrals) that they deem impactful. Consumers can interact with time-based criteria (quests) or lifetime progression (achievements) to track their loyalty and redeem rewards.</p><p>Quest’s data builds a positive feedback loop for consumer preferences. As consumers shop more frequently, their preferences become more defined allowing retailers to present more relevant offers. These offers in turn incentivize consumers to come back, spend more in-store, and look forward to their next visit.</p>								 
				 
				 
		 
				 
				 
												
																					Quest allows consumers to earn and collect achievement badges modeled after video games
										
									 
				 
				 
					 
				 
		 
					 
				 
				 
									 Conclusion <p>By establishing a channel from awareness to conversion, retailers can capitalize on the power of targeted marketing and attribution. Retailers no longer need to guess at their ROI vs cost per impression, LISNR leads to insights of cost per conversion. Add personalized loyalty into the mix and you begin to see the LISNR flywheel for retailers.</p>

 Evolution from 800-63-2 to 800-63-3  
<p>The NIST SP 800-63 guidelines are dynamic, constantly adapting to evolving technological advancements and threats. The latest iteration, NIST SP 800-63-3, represents a crucial evolution from its predecessor, 800-63-2, incorporating significant improvements to address emerging vulnerabilities and provide stronger security measures.</p> 
<p>A key update resides within NIST 800-63B, a core component of the 800-63-3 guidelines, which focuses intently on authentication methods. Notably, email one-time passwords (OTPs) have been explicitly placed in a limited scope. This decision directly acknowledges their inherent susceptibility to widespread phishing at the workplace, where email is easily compromised.</p> 
<p>Similarly, SMS-based authentication has been formally downgraded as a viable authenticator for high-assurance scenarios. While SMS was initially considered a significant step forward for two-factor authentication, we found through the years, mobile providers and even the SS7 network itself was compromised.</p> 
<p>These pivotal revisions in NIST 800-63-3 unequivocally signal a strategic shift towards prioritizing stronger, more phishing-resistant authentication protocols. NIST actively encourages organizations to adopt resilient authentication mechanisms that genuinely protect against unauthorized access and prevent identity fraud.</p> 
 Key Concepts and Processes of Identity Proofing and Authentication  
<p>The guidelines introduce a significant shift by retiring the concept of a "level of assurance (LOA)" as a single, all-encompassing ordinal that dictates implementation-specific requirements. Instead, NIST 800-63-3 emphasizes that agencies (and by extension, organizations) should select.</p> 
<p>IAL (Identity Assurance Level), AAL (Authenticator Assurance Level), and FAL (Federated Assurance Level) as distinct, independent options. This selection process is driven by appropriate business and privacy risk management considerations, alongside specific mission needs. While many systems might coincidentally have the same numerical level for each of IAL, AAL, and FAL, this is not a mandatory requirement, and agencies should avoid assuming they will always be identical within any given system.</p> 
<p>The distinct components of identity assurance detailed in these guidelines are as follows:</p> 
  
  IAL refers to the identity proofing process, which validates the real-world identity of the applicant.  
  AAL refers to the authentication process, which verifies the user's claimed identity during a transaction.  
  FAL refers to the strength of an assertion in a federated environment, specifically used to communicate authentication and attribute information (if applicable) to a relying party (RP).  
  
<p>This explicit separation of categories provides organizations with greater flexibility in choosing identity solutions and significantly enhances the ability to embed privacy-enhancing techniques as fundamental elements of identity systems, regardless of the chosen assurance level.</p> 
<p>Beyond these foundational assurance concepts, the guidelines meticulously elaborate on the crucial roles played by various key actors within the sophisticated digital identity ecosystem:</p> 
  
  Credential Service Providers (CSPs): These entities bear the significant responsibility for issuing and meticulously managing authenticators (digital credentials) for users.Their role ensures the secure storage of the unique digital representation of the individual and its secure use for authentication. Their meticulous handling of these credentials is vital for the entire chain of trust.  
  Relying Parties (Verifiers): These are the diverse services, applications, or systems that judiciously consume the authenticated identity to grant appropriate access to specific resources or services. They inherently rely on the assertions provided by the CSPs to verify the user's identity before extending trust or access. The important parts of their role involve verifying identity, often by confirming the user's authentication complies with specified Authentication Assurance Levels (AALs).  
  
 The Digital Identity Model: NIST's Vision for Online Presence  
<p>NIST defines a sophisticated and nuanced concept of digital identity that extends far beyond the simplistic notion of a username and password. This comprehensive model fundamentally emphasizes the unique and verifiable nature of an individual's digital representation and its pivotal role in facilitating secure online transactions and interactions across diverse platforms.</p> 
<p>The Digital Identity Model, as conceptualized by NIST, illustrates a clear and sequential flow for establishing and utilizing a secure digital identity, moving from an applicant's initial request to their engagement in online transactions. This model involves several interconnected key stages:</p> 
  
  Applicant: This initial stage represents the individual requesting access or registration for a digital service. At this point, the applicant may submit personal data such as their name, email, or an ID photo to initiate the process.  
  Enrollment: Here, the identity is rigorously verified using various identity proofing methods. Once verification is successful, credentials or authenticators are issued to the individual for future use.  
  Digital Identity: Once the enrollment process is complete and verified, a unique digital representation of the individual is created. This digital identity is then stored securely and subsequently used for authentication purposes in various online contexts.  
  Online Transaction: In the final stage of the model, the user leverages their established digital identity to authenticate and gain access to a service. During this process, the system actively verifies the user's identity, ensuring compliance with predefined Authentication Assurance Levels (AALs) to secure the transaction.  
  
<p>This model provides a clear visual and conceptual framework for understanding the lifecycle of a digital identity within the NIST guidelines, emphasizing the progression from initial proofing to ongoing authentication.</p> 
 Key Processes in Digital Identity Management  
<p>NIST SP 800-63-3 breaks down digital identity management into three key, interconnected processes:</p> 
  
  Identity Proofing: The foundational step of verifying an individual's identity, ensuring it exists and belongs to the claimant. This prevents fraudulent account creation and initial unauthorized access.  
  Digital Authentication: The ongoing process of verifying a user's claimed identity each time they attempt an online transaction or access a resource. It ensures the legitimate holder is performing the action.  
  Federated Identity Management: A mechanism for linking identities across different organizations, allowing users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple relying parties without repeated authentication.  
  
 Understanding NIST Assurance Levels (IALs, AALs, FALs)  
<p>NIST defines Identity Assurance Levels (IALs), indicating the certainty that a claimed identity corresponds to a real-world identity. These are part of NIST 800-63-3 and provide a tiered approach to evaluating identity proofing strength.</p> 
  
  IAL1 (Low Assurance): No requirement to link the individual to a real-world identity; information is self-asserted.  
  IAL2 (Medium Assurance): Uses digital documents as evidence to support the claimed identity's real-world existence and verifies the person's association.  
  IAL3 (High Assurance): Requires an authorized and trained representative to verify the individual in person, often with biometrics, for the highest certainty.  
  
<p>IALs primarily measure assurance at a single point in time, during enrollment or initial identity proofing, and do not cover ongoing authentication.</p> 
<p>Authentication Assurance Levels (AALs) quantify authentication mechanism strength during login:</p> 
  
  AAL1: Typically single-factor (e.g., username/password), generally discouraged for sensitive data.  
  AAL2: Requires at least two distinct authentication factors, designed to resist replay attacks, though SMS OTPs are now less secure.  
  AAL3: The highest level, requiring strong cryptographic device-based authentication (e.g., FIDO security key, device-bound passkeys), highly resistant to phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks.  
  
<p></p> 
 Enrollment and Identity Proofing (SP 800-63-A)  
<p>NIST 800-63-A provides practical and prescriptive examples of proofing methods that can be judiciously utilized to meet these varying assurance levels. These methods are designed to collectively minimize the risk of fraudulent identity creation and unauthorized access:</p> 
  
  Document Verification: This involves examining official documents (e.g., passport, driver’s license) either in person or digitally, with technology capable of detecting forgeries or alterations.  
  Facial Recognition with Liveness Detection: This cutting-edge method uses facial biometrics to confirm the person matches the claimed identity. Crucially, liveness detection is integrated to detect and thwart spoofing attempts using photos, videos, or masks.  
  Live Video Verification: This adds a significant layer of human-centric security by facilitating a face-to-face verification session over a secure video conference. An authorized agent engages directly with the individual to confirm liveness and detect signs of coercion.  
  Chat Verification: For lower-risk scenarios or as a preliminary step, chat verification can be employed, often combining AI and human interaction.  
  Location Detection: Verifying the geographical location of the individual during the proofing process can be important, though it must strictly adhere to all privacy regulations.  
  Attestation: A critical component providing an auditable trail, attestation involves a responsible party formally confirming and documenting the results of the identity proofing process, retaining results but not sensitive PII.  
  
<p>The strategic integration of these diverse methods, as meticulously outlined in NIST 800-63-A, culminates in a comprehensive, multi-layered identity proofing ecosystem.</p> 
 Authentication and Lifecycle Management (SP 800-63-B)  
<p>NIST Special Publication 800-63-B delves into the critical area of Authentication and Lifecycle Management, placing significant emphasis on "verifier impersonation resistance," directly acknowledging the widespread and persistent threat of phishing attacks. This mandate means that authentication methods must be meticulously designed to prevent attackers from successfully impersonating legitimate relying parties (e.g., websites, applications) in order to trick unsuspecting users into revealing their credentials or authentication factors.</p> 
<p>The decisive move to deprecate email OTP and significantly downgrade SMS-based authentication in NIST 800-63B directly reflects the understanding that these methods, while once considered helpful, are no longer sufficient to provide adequate assurance against modern, targeted threats.</p> 
 Federation and Assertions (SP 800-63-C)  
<p>The core concept elaborated in 800-63-C is the precise definition of Federated Assurance Levels (FALs). FALs are designed to quantify the confidence that can be placed in the assertions or claims made by one identity provider (often acting as a Credential Service Provider or CSP) to a distinct relying party (or verifier) about a user's identity and their authentication event.</p> 
  
  FAL1 (Low Assurance): Corresponds to the lowest level of confidence in the assertion, often linked to an AAL1 authentication event.  
  FAL2 (Medium Assurance): Reflects a moderate level of confidence, typically corresponding to an AAL2 authentication event.  
  FAL3 (High Assurance): Denotes the highest level of confidence in the assertion, corresponding to an AAL3 authentication event.  
  
<p>These levels are crucial because they enable a relying party to understand and trust the level of rigor and security that was applied by the identity provider in establishing and authenticating that user's identity. This allows for informed risk decisions when granting access based on a federated assertion.</p> 
<p>The process of conveying authentication and attribute information in a federated environment typically involves several key elements:</p> 
  
  Assertions: Cryptographically signed digital statements made by a trusted identity provider about a user's identity or authentication event.  
  Protocols: Standardized technical protocols (e.g., SAML, OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect) used to securely exchange these assertions.  
  Trust Frameworks: Established frameworks defining policies, procedures, and technical agreements between participating entities to ensure interoperability and security.  
  
<p>Federated identity management significantly improves user experience via single sign-on (SSO) and enhances security by centralizing identity management with trusted providers.</p> 
 Implementation Guidelines for Identity and Authentication Assurance Levels  
<p>Implementing NIST 800-63-3 involves selecting suitable assurance levels and addressing challenges. A common error is only verifying identity at hire; a robust strategy must cover the entire employee lifecycle.</p> 
<p>Critical scenarios requiring secure identity proofing and strong authentication include:</p> 
  
  Employee Onboarding: Ensuring new hires are legitimate before granting system access, preventing interview fraud.  
  Credential Resets: Protecting against social engineering that exploits reset processes, as seen in the MGM Resorts attack.  
  Changing Roles or Elevated Privileges: Re-verifying identity before granting new access levels.  
  Elevated Detected Risk: Prompting re-proofing when monitoring systems detect suspicious activity (e.g., unusual login locations).

<p>“I went to Geneva to understand what, if anything, people were saying regarding digital identity and standards in a governance-focused forum. My brain is now full.”</p>



<p>I’m an identity and standards geek. I adore the topic of identity and the standards development process; everything from the brilliant minds, the challenges, and the intense edge cases. (Well, some of the challenges. I could do without a few.)</p>



<p>But I also recognize that both the identity industry and the standards process have serious issues, especially when it comes to the diversity of representation and issues of governance. Too often, we hear from the same people in the same rooms, solving the same problems.</p>



<p>So, when I knew I’d be in Geneva for the first <a href="https://globaldigitalcollaboration.org/">Global Digital Collaboration Conference</a> (which, by the way, exceeded my expectations), I applied for accreditation to attend the <a href="https://www.itu.int/net4/wsis/forum/2025/">WSIS+20 High-Level Event</a>, hosted by the ITU. The WSIS+20 is, according to their website, “an existing multistakeholder United Nations (UN) process on digital governance and cooperation with a vision of fostering people-centered, inclusive, and development-oriented information and knowledge societies.” My goal was pretty simple: listen to people I don’t usually get to hear from. Try to understand why the worlds of digital identity, governance, and Internet policy remain so siloed, despite everyone’s insistence that this is all interconnected.</p>



<p>I’ve learned a lot. I’m not sure what to do with all of it yet, but I’m glad I came.</p>

 Defending Our Voice: Participation ≠ Power 



<p>Let’s start with the first session I attended: “<a href="https://www.itu.int/net4/wsis/forum/2025/Agenda/Session/309">Defending Our Voice: Global South Participation in Digital Governance</a>.” Kemly Camacho (Association for Progressive Communications) moderated the session, which included speakers from IT for Change, Derechos Digitales, the UN Human Rights Office, and the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee.</p>



<p>They were primarily discussing governance, not technical standards, but a lot of what they said seemed relevant for the standards world, too. Right out of the gate, the first speaker, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nandini-chami-03807669/">Nandini Chamim</a>, laid out a set of points I think everyone in identity and standards work should hear:</p>



 
 Presence ≠ Participation: Just being in the room doesn’t mean having influence. Real participation means being able to shape agendas and priorities. 



 Multistakeholder ≠ Public Policy: Equal status in dialogue doesn’t automatically create legitimate public policy. What matters is how different interests are mediated to reach consensus. 



 The Mundial 2014 process raised this issue: Legitimacy in Internet governance must be earned, not assumed through default institutional formats. 



 Trust deficit: Historical data shows ongoing public skepticism. Governance spaces are often dominated by powerful countries and corporations, sidelining the issues important to less-represented groups. 



 Technical ≠ Apolitical: Since WSIS, we’ve seen how technical standards often embed political values. They shape not only systems, but also societal norms. 



 Openness must be questioned: When we talk about openness, we should ask: Openness towards what (i.e., open to what kind of issues?), and for whom? 
 



<p>Even when civil society groups are invited, it’s often tokenistic; visa issues, language barriers, and lack of funding limit meaningful engagement. And when they do show up, there’s often no follow-up, no feedback loops, and no real seat at the agenda-setting table.</p>



 IAM Is a Multi-Tool. We’re Not the Whole Toolbox. 



<p>Another thing that became clear throughout the event was that many of the people here are tackling big problems, and digital identity isn’t exactly one of them.</p>



<p>This reminded me of a conversation I had with Andrew Hindle and Richard Bird at the bar during Identiverse 2025. (All the best conversations seem to happen at the bar.) We talked about how siloed the identity team is within most organizations, even though IAM touches every part of the business.</p>



<p>That conversation led me to understand that identity people often think in systems, but the rest of the organization thinks in functions. HR, finance, compliance, marketing—they’ve all got their own language and priorities. And understanding IAM isn’t in their job description.</p>



<p>WSIS+20 made me realize that the same kind of disconnect exists at the global level, too.</p>



<p>The people in these rooms work on global human rights, economic justice, equity, ethics, and environmental resilience. To them, identity is just one tool in a thousand-piece toolbox. Standards are just one governance process among many. Most of them have never heard of SAML, FIDO, or the W3C Digital Credential API, and don’t need to. They don’t use the terms CIAM, workforce identity, or even authentication and authorization. They have use cases that require things like identity verification, but it’s not on their radar.</p>



<p>What they do understand is that technology is not neutral. Technologists and policymakers must shape it around a platform of human rights. Where I’ve <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/05/27/governance-decides-if-decentralization-works/">previously written</a> that “the technology is ready, the governance is not,” what I saw here is that the governance work is happening, but it’s happening in a different room, with a very different vocabulary.</p>



 So what do we do about the gap? 



<p>It’s tempting to say we need to get technologists into policy rooms and policymakers into technical working groups. But I don’t think that’s the answer, at least not by itself. This isn’t a matter of “getting in the room.” It’s about figuring out how to share power, information, and influence across two very different systems.</p>



<p>The only halfway-satisfying idea I have right now is this: mandated consultation, in both directions.</p>



 
 Policy decisions should be reviewed by expert technical groups. 



 Technical standards should be reviewed by policymakers and civil society. 
 



<p>Even that solution frustrates me. It’ll slow processes down further in a time when everything else is speeding up. It may leave even more room for de facto standards to take root via market dominance. But I can’t think of another way to bridge the growing legitimacy gap between how we make standards and how people expect governance to work. Consultation also won’t be enough if there’s no way to track what feedback was given, what was included, and, critically, what was left out and why. That’s not just a process problem. That’s a legitimacy problem.</p>



<p>If you have other suggestions, I’m listening.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00:04]<br>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com">Spherical Cow Consulting</a>. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists.</p>



<p>If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>Let’s get into it.</p>



 



 Defining the Governance Gap 



 



<p>[00:00:30]<br>So I went to Geneva for the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) meeting. It’s a multistakeholder United Nations process, organized by the ITU, that focuses on digital governance and cooperation.</p>



<p>My goal? To understand what, if anything, people were saying about digital identity and standards in a governance-focused forum.</p>



<p>And it was… really interesting. I’m very glad I went.</p>



<p>Now, if you know me, you know I’m an identity and standards geek. I love the process—well, most of it. The brilliant minds, the weird edge cases, the moments where it feels like we’re collectively inching the Internet forward? I live for that.</p>



<p>But I also recognize the industry’s flaws:</p>



 
 Representation gaps 



 Governance issues 



 Repetition of the same voices and perspectives 
 



<p>And that’s not how progress works.</p>



 



 Finding WSIS and Listening Beyond the Norm 



 



<p>When I found out I’d already be in Geneva for the Global Digital Collaboration Conference (which far exceeded expectations), I applied for accreditation to attend the WSIS+20 High-Level Event.</p>



<p>According to its official description, WSIS is about:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Fostering people-centered, inclusive, and development-oriented information and knowledge societies.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In real terms? It’s the room where governments, civil society, and international organizations gather to talk about the future of digital governance on a global scale.</p>



<p>My objective was simple:<br>Listen to people I don’t normally hear from.<br>And try to understand why identity, governance, and Internet policy feel like separate worlds, even though they’re clearly interconnected.</p>



 



 The Session That Set the Tone 



 



<p>[00:02:43]<br>The first session I attended was titled:<br>Defending Our Global South Participation in Digital Governance.</p>



<p>It was moderated by Kemli Camacho from the Association for Progressive Communications, with panelists from:</p>



 
 IT for Change 



 Derechos Digitales 



 UN Human Rights Office 



 Brazilian Internet Steering Committee 
 



<p>They weren’t there to talk about standards, but what they said resonated powerfully.</p>



<p>A speaker named Nadini Chowni offered some compelling truths:</p>



 
 Presence ≠ Participation<br>Just being in the room doesn’t mean influencing the agenda. Real participation means shaping the priorities—not just reacting to them. 



 Multistakeholder ≠ Public Policy<br>Equal footing in a discussion doesn’t guarantee fair policy outcomes. What really matters is how interests are mediated and resolved. 



 Legitimacy Must Be Earned<br>She referenced the Mundial 2014 process, which emphasized that governance legitimacy is earned—not assumed—just because a structure looks inclusive on paper. 



 There’s a Public Trust Deficit<br>Long-standing skepticism exists due to powerful countries and corporations dominating governance spaces, often sidelining less-represented voices. 
 



<p>And perhaps most importantly:<br>Being technical is not apolitical.<br>The design of standards reflects values. It shapes systems. It sets social norms.</p>



 



 Tokenism, Risk, and Real Costs 



 



<p>[00:04:39]<br>Even when civil society is invited, participation is often tokenistic:</p>



 
 Visa problems 



 Language barriers 



 No travel funding 



 No translation or agenda 



 No follow-up mechanism 
 



<p>As one speaker said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Participation is costly. And it’s risky.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sometimes, just showing up carries political risk. And even then, there’s no guarantee your voice will shape the outcome.</p>



<p>As a working group chair in a standards organization, this hit hard. I try to be inclusive—but I often rely on those who are willing to speak up.</p>



<p>Clearly, I need to do better.</p>



 



 Identity Isn’t the Toolbox—It’s Just a Tool 



 



<p>[00:06:01]<br>Here’s the realization:<br>Identity and access management (IAM) is like a multi-tool—it’s handy, flexible, and powerful.<br>But it’s not the whole toolbox.</p>



<p>At the WSIS event, most people weren’t even thinking about digital identity.</p>



<p>Instead, they were focused on:</p>



 
 Human rights 



 Economic justice 



 Environmental resilience 
 



<p>Digital identity was just one small piece of their broader challenges.</p>



<p>This reminded me of a conversation I had at Identiverse earlier this year—with Andrew Hindle and Richard Bird—about how siloed IAM projects tend to be inside organizations.</p>



<p>Even though identity touches everything (HR, finance, compliance, security), it often goes unacknowledged across domains.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



 
 IAM folks think in systems 



 Others think in functions 
 



<p>Different language. Different priorities. Different goals.</p>



<p>And at a global level, it’s the same. The WSIS crowd? They’ve never heard of SAML or FIDO. They’re not discussing consumer or workforce identity.</p>



<p>They’re talking about:</p>



 
 Data sovereignty 



 Rights 



 Accountability 
 



<p>They expect technologists to embed human rights into the systems they build.</p>



 



 Governance Is Happening… Somewhere Else 



 



<p>[00:07:42]<br>I used to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Technology is ready; governance is not.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Now, I’m not so sure. Governance is happening—just in other rooms, with very different vocabulary.</p>



<p>And that’s overwhelming.</p>



<p>We’ve got:</p>



 
 WSIS 



 IGF 



 Global Digital Collaboration 



 National frameworks 



 Regional strategies 
 



<p>Even experts struggle to keep up.<br>For civil society groups, trying to monitor all that—on tight budgets, in multiple languages—it’s nearly impossible.</p>



<p>That’s not just a risk. It’s already causing:</p>



 
 Fragmentation 



 Incompatibility 



 Conflicting outcomes 
 



<p>And no one wins.</p>



 



 The Gap Isn’t Just Presence—It’s Power 



 



<p>[00:08:45]<br>So how do we bridge that gap?</p>



<p>It’s tempting to say:<br>“Just bring technologists into policy rooms and policymakers into technical working groups.”</p>



<p>But that’s not enough.</p>



<p>Why?</p>



<p>Because it’s not about presence. It’s about power—and how to share it across two very different systems.</p>



<p>One half-formed idea:<br>Create mandated consultations in both directions.</p>



 
 Policy decisions get reviewed by expert technical groups 



 Technical standards get reviewed by policymakers and civil society 
 



<p>That should be baseline practice.</p>



<p>But even that frustrates me—because it’s going to slow us down. And we’re already struggling to keep up.</p>



<p>And the slower we go, the more room there is for de facto standards—those not built on consensus, but on market dominance.</p>



<p>Still, I can’t see another way to address the legitimacy gap.</p>



<p>And consultation alone isn’t enough without accountability.</p>



 



 What Happens Next? 



 



<p>[00:09:53]<br>One of the speakers noted that the WSIS Elements Paper—the framework guiding these discussions—barely included strong human rights language.</p>



<p>It was, in their words, “legally timid.”</p>



<p>So we need more than just listening.</p>



<p>We need:</p>



 
 Traceability 



 Transparency 



 Accountability 
 



<p>We need to track:</p>



 
 What feedback was given 



 What was included 



 What was excluded—and why 
 



<p>This isn’t just a process gap.<br>It’s a legitimacy problem.</p>



<p>If you’ve been in one of these policy rooms, or tried to bring identity work into broader governance conversations, I would truly love to hear from you.</p>



<p>Because honestly? I don’t see how we get from two parallel worlds to one where we can truly collaborate.</p>



<p>But I’m listening.</p>



 



 Final Thoughts

            <p>Thales is proud to have partnered with the first edition of the International Physics Olympiad held in France. From the STEM for ALL prize giving to a visit of our Palaiseau laboratory, relive a week dedicated to excellence and diversity among tomorrow's young scientific talents.</p>
<p>First held in 1967, the International Physics Olympiad is the world’s most prestigious physics competition for young people under twenty. It brings together over a thousand participants from nearly 90 countries to celebrate physics and support the students who will shape the science of tomorrow.</p>
<p>At Thales, encouraging science, technology, and vocations in STEM fields is one of our priorities. That is why we are proud of having been a partner of the first edition of this competition held in France, which took place from July 18 to 24 in the Paris region.</p>
<p>During the closing ceremony, Marko Erman, Chief Scientific Officer of Thales, awarded a grant as part of the STEM for ALL programme to five students who showed great motivation for STEM fields despite the social challenges they face.</p>
<blockquote><p>The International Physics Olympiad is a testament to the scientific excellence of young people from around the world. Through the STEM for ALL grants, we aim to encourage the commitment and diversity of these future talents by giving them the means to pursue their passion for science and to take on tomorrow’s challenges.<br>
Marko Erman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The five recipients are part of delegations from Nigeria, Pakistan, Spain, Turkmenistan, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>As a sponsor, Thales also welcomed more than 60 students from 17 countries to the Thales Research &amp; Technology laboratory in Palaiseau. They were able to discover the Group’s latest innovations in physics: next-generation quantum sensors, superhydrophobic materials, and high-power lasers. They also had a special opportunity to interact with our scientific experts about their recent work and learn about the many possible career paths available to them.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is essential to spark curiosity and foster the desire to innovate among young generations. Supporting them and helping them discover the diversity of scientific and technological professions is an investment in our collective future.<br>
Amélie Ravier,&nbsp;Executive Director, Thales Solidarity<br>
&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

 Money service businesses (MSBs) in the UK—including remittance providers, currency exchanges, and payment platforms—operate in a high-risk environment. With financial crime threats rising and regulatory expectations tightening, these firms must now demonstrate proactive, real-time anti-money laundering (AML) compliance. 
<p>In 2025, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is sharpening its focus on MSBs. Failures to screen transactions, monitor for suspicious behaviour, or implement effective controls can result in serious penalties, deauthorisation, or reputational harm.</p>
 FCA Priorities for MSBs 
<p>The FCA expects all MSBs to implement a robust AML framework that includes:</p>
 
 Customer due diligence (CDD) for both individuals and business clients 
 Ongoing sanctions screening and politically exposed person (PEP) checks 
 Transaction monitoring and alert escalation 
 Clear audit trails for all risk-based decisions 
 Timely suspicious activity reporting (SARs) 
 
<p>Additionally, firms must ensure compliance with the UK Sanctions List maintained by the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI).</p>
 Key Challenges Facing UK MSBs 
<p>1. High Transaction Volume and Velocity<br>
Remittance firms and currency exchanges often process thousands of transactions per day, making manual screening impractical.</p>
<p>2. False Positives and Alert Fatigue<br>
Outdated screening systems may generate excessive alerts, slowing reviews and leading to oversight risks.</p>
<p>3. Staff Capacity and Consistency<br>
Small compliance teams may struggle to maintain consistent review standards across geographies or service lines.</p>
<p>4. Fragmented Data and Documentation<br>
Disconnected onboarding, transaction, and case management systems make it difficult to build an audit-ready record of compliance.</p>
 How iComply Helps UK MSBs Stay Compliant 
<p>iComply offers a scalable compliance platform tailored to the needs of fast-moving, high-volume money service providers.</p>
 1. Real-Time AML and Sanctions Screening 
 
 Integrate with UK and global watchlists (OFSI, UN, EU, etc.) 
 Screen natural persons and entities at onboarding and continuously 
 Flag PEPs, sanctioned individuals, and adverse media hits 
 
 2. Automated Risk Scoring and Alerts 
 
 Customize risk thresholds by geography, transaction size, or client type 
 Trigger alerts for review, escalation, or SAR filing 
 Reduce false positives using contextual data and identity matching 
 
 3. Centralized Case Management 
 
 Document findings, decisions, and next steps in a single dashboard 
 Assign team roles and track case resolution timelines 
 Export reports for internal audits or FCA inspections 
 
 4. Audit-Ready Logs and Compliance Reporting 
 
 Maintain immutable logs of all screening actions 
 Generate structured SARs and compliance reports on demand 
 Support full FCA audit traceability 
 
 5. Data Privacy and Localization Controls 
 
 Comply with UK GDPR and OFSI disclosure requirements 
 Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted and stored in the UK 
 
 Case Insight: Money Services Business in London 
<p>A multi-jurisdictional money services business integrated iComply to consolidate onboarding and screening across five countries. In less than three months:</p>
 
 Reduced false positives by 42% 
 Cut review time from 2 hours to 20 minutes per flagged case 
 Passed an FCA spot check with zero findings 
 
 What to Expect in 2025 
 
 FCA Enforcement Surge: More on-site inspections and thematic reviews of AML controls 
 Sanctions Expansion: Increased OFSI updates related to geopolitical instability 
 Tech Adoption Mandates: Growing regulatory expectation to adopt RegTech and eliminate manual-only workflows 
 
 Take Action 
<p>MSBs that fail to modernize AML compliance are at risk of enforcement actions, fines, and loss of authorisation. But those who invest in scalable, intelligent tools can turn compliance into a competitive edge.</p>
<p>Schedule a consultation with iComply to see how we help UK MSBs screen smarter, stay compliant, and scale with confidence.</p>

<p>Hello from the Metadium&nbsp;team.</p><p>Recently, the Cambodian government officially recognized Verywords for achieving a 680,000-ton reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, marking Korea’s first successful case of an “Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcome (ITMO).” This is more than a milestone in climate action — it demonstrates the real-world application of Metadium’s technology in a global climate cooperation initiative.</p><p>Why is this project significant?<br>Under the Paris Agreement, South Korea must reduce 291 million tons of carbon emissions by 2030, including 37.5 million tons through international reduction efforts.<br>Until now, no ITMO project had received formal approval, but Verywords broke new ground by earning recognition through the distribution of electric motorcycles in partnership with Cambodia.</p><p>What role did Metadium play in this project?<br>Metadium served as the technical backbone connecting climate action and data by implementing a system that uses Decentralized Identifiers (DID) and NFT technology to verify participation and emission reduction activities.</p>  Public sector officials and private citizens who received electric motorcycles were issued Metadium DIDs. These DIDs enabled them to be reliably identified as participants in the reduction effort, and their activity history could be securely tracked and verified.  The reduction data from each motorcycle was integrated with Metadium’s carbon-neutral eco platform and issued in the form of points, linking data with the participant’s history.  NFT technology was used to verify each participant’s activity records uniquely.  <p>Metadium’s contribution to a trusted data-driven ecosystem<br>For international reduction outcomes to be officially recognized, the key is to clearly and verifiably answer: Who reduced what, and how?<br>Metadium’s DID and NFT technologies enabled a secure and transparent connection between participants and their activity data, providing an infrastructure that made verification possible on the blockchain.This solidified the legitimacy and traceability necessary for international carbon credit transactions.</p><p>Beyond climate cooperation: Unlocking global ecosystem potential<br>The Verywords project goes beyond distributing electric motorcycles. It’s evolving into a sustainable ecosystem involving real-time driving data collection via IoT modules, a membership-based energy usage model, and a battery reuse system.<br>Within this structure, Metadium’s DID and NFT-based verification infrastructure demonstrated strong potential for expansion in Southeast Asia and other developing markets where climate technology is in&nbsp;demand.</p><p>Conclusion: Metadium as a foundation for the global ESG ecosystem<br>The Verywords project is a meaningful first step in proving that the international carbon reduction model can work in practice. Metadium played a core role by providing trust-based technology that connects participants and data.<br>Moving forward, Metadium will continue to contribute to the global ESG ecosystem by offering a scalable infrastructure rooted in DID and blockchain technology — supporting carbon reduction and sustainable development goals worldwide.</p><p>The Metadium&nbsp;Team</p> 캄보디아 온실가스 68만 톤 감축, 메타디움 기술&nbsp;기여 <p>안녕하세요, 메타디움&nbsp;팀입니다.</p><p>최근 베리워즈가 캄보디아 정부로부터 68만 톤 규모의 온실가스 감축 실적을 공식 인정받으며, 한국의 첫 ‘국제 감축(ITMO)’ 성공 사례로 주목받고 있습니다. 이는 단순한 기후 사업의 성공을 넘어, 메타디움 기술이 실질적인 글로벌 기후 협력 사업에 적용된 중요한&nbsp;이정표입니다.</p><p>왜 이 프로젝트가&nbsp;중요한가?</p><p>한국은 파리기후협정에 따라 2030년까지 총 2.91억 톤의 탄소를 감축해야 하며, 그 중 3,750만 톤을 해외에서 ‘국제 감축’ 방식으로 달성해야&nbsp;합니다.</p><p>그동안 어떤 ITMO 사업도 정부 승인에 이르지 못했지만, 베리워즈는 캄보디아와 협력해 전기 오토바이 보급을 통해 공식 감축 실적을&nbsp;인정받았습니다.</p><p>이 프로젝트에서 메타디움은 어떤 역할을&nbsp;했나?</p><p>메타디움은 전기 오토바이 보급 대상자의 디지털 신원(DID) 등록과 NFT 기술을 기반으로 한 참여 증빙 시스템을 통해, 감축 활동과 데이터를 연결하는 인프라 역할을&nbsp;수행했습니다.</p><p>• 전기 오토바이를 수령한 공공기관 공무원과 민간 사용자에게 메타디움 DID가 발급되었으며, 각 참여자는 이 DID를 통해 감축 활동의 참여자로 식별되고, 그 활동 이력이 안전하게 추적·증명될 수 있도록 설계되었습니다.<br> • 각 오토바이의 감축 실적은 메타디움의 탄소중립 에코 플랫폼과 연동되어 포인트 형태로 발행되었으며, 참여자의 활동 이력과 연계되었습니다.<br> • NFT 기술은 각 참여자의 활동 내역을 고유하게 증명하는 수단으로&nbsp;사용되었습니다.</p><p>데이터 기반 생태계 신뢰성, 메타디움이 기여한&nbsp;부분</p><p>국제 감축 실적이 공식적으로 인정되기 위해서는, ‘누가’, ‘무엇을’, ‘어떻게 감축했는가’를 명확하게 기록하고 검증할 수 있어야&nbsp;합니다.</p><p>메타디움의 DID 및 NFT 기술은 감축 활동 주체의 신원과 활동 데이터를 안전하게 연결하며, 블록체인을 통해 그 과정을 투명하게 증명할 수 있는 기반 인프라로 기능했습니다. 이는 감축 실적의 국가 간 거래 시, 명확한 정당성과 추적 가능성을 동시에 확보할 수 있도록&nbsp;도왔습니다.</p><p>기후 협력을 넘어, 글로벌 생태계 확장을 위한&nbsp;가능성</p><p>베리워즈 프로젝트는 단순한 전기 오토바이 보급에 그치지 않고, IoT 모듈 기반의 실시간 데이터 수집, 멤버십형 에너지 사용 모델, 배터리 재활용 시스템 등 지속가능한 탄소 감축 생태계 구축으로 이어지고&nbsp;있습니다.</p><p>이러한 구조 안에서 메타디움은 DID 및 NFT 기반의 감축 증빙 인프라를 제공함으로써, 기후 기술을 필요로 하는 동남아 및 개발도상국 시장에서 높은 활용성과 확장성을&nbsp;입증했습니다.</p><p>결론: 메타디움, 글로벌 ESG 생태계의 신뢰&nbsp;기반</p><p>베리워즈 프로젝트는 ‘국제 감축’이라는 새로운 협력 모델이 실제로 작동할 수 있음을 보여준 의미 있는 첫걸음이며, 메타디움은 이 과정에서 참여 주체와 데이터를 연결하는 신뢰 기반 기술로 핵심 역할을&nbsp;수행했습니다.</p><p>앞으로도 메타디움은 DID와 블록체인 기술을 통해, 탄소 감축과 지속 가능한 개발 목표를 지원하는 글로벌 ESG 생태계의 핵심 인프라로 자리매김해&nbsp;나가겠습니다.</p><p>메타디움 팀</p>  Website | <a href="https://metadium.com/">https://metadium.com</a>  Discord | <a href="https://discord.gg/ZnaCfYbXw2">https://discord.gg/ZnaCfYbXw2</a>  Telegram(EN) | <a href="http://t.me/metadiumofficial?fbclid=IwAR3MeXsYSQbBpKEuxTMdtNKMBDGnBpniwKrmLAoNCvGL80qVdXjpS65O0t0">http://t.me/metadiumofficial</a>  Twitter | <a href="https://twitter.com/MetadiumK">https://twitter.com/MetadiumK</a>  Medium | <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">https://medium.com/metadium</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/metadium/68-million-tons-of-greenhouse-gas-reduction-in-cambodia-powered-by-metadium-technology-1620119c1f52">68 Million Tons of Greenhouse Gas Reduction in Cambodia, Powered by Metadium Technology</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/metadium">Metadium</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/1-hpps-role-in-the-ai-driven-crypto-future-from-wallets-to-agents-e61b0397238b">previous article</a>, we explored how HPP unlocks intelligent, agent-driven finance through AI-powered DeFi (DeFAI). In this second installment, we shift the focus to infrastructure — specifically, how HPP is building the coordination layer for a decentralized, SLM-powered AI&nbsp;economy.</p><blockquote>TL;DR:<br>HPP is building the blockchain infrastructure for the post-LLM era, where AI is powered by lightweight, modular Small Language Models (SLMs) instead of monolithic LLMs. Unlike LLMs, SLMs are efficient, fine-tunable, and privacy-preserving, making them ideal for enterprises such as banks and healthcare providers. HPP provides the coordination, payment, and verification layers necessary for these models and agents to collaborate in real-time. Through AI-native tools like Noösphere, developers and users can deploy agent-based services, conduct off-chain AI reasoning, and enable micro-payments between&nbsp;models.</blockquote><p>In the era of artificial intelligence, it’s easy to assume that bigger means better. Large Language Models (LLMs) have dazzled the public, but for enterprises, their size is often a liability rather than an asset. HPP is being built from the ground up to support a different future — one where AI is modular, composable, and deployed with real-world constraints in&nbsp;mind.</p><p>This is the future of SLMs (Small Language Models), and HPP is the infrastructure designed to support&nbsp;it.</p> Why SLMs Will Matter More Than&nbsp;LLMs <p>While LLMs dominate headlines, their use in enterprise and government environments is limited by fundamental issues. These include massive compute requirements, opaque data processing, and a lack of enterprise-level support and maintenance.</p><p>In sectors like finance, healthcare, and public infrastructure, where Aergo has already built strong credibility, such instability is a non-starter. These institutions prioritize predictability, data sovereignty, and ease of maintenance. LLMs typically fall short in all three&nbsp;areas.</p><p>SLMs, on the other hand, offer a practical path forward. They run efficiently on existing hardware, can be fine-tuned for specific tasks, and keep sensitive data local without relying on public inference APIs. For enterprise-grade AI to scale effectively, it must be tailored to its specific environment. That’s what SLMs&nbsp;enable.</p> So Why Is HPP Launching Now? <p>HPP didn’t appear out of nowhere. It was created in response to a growing need. As enterprises began adopting specialized AI models, a critical bottleneck emerged — the lack of a secure and verifiable coordination layer between models, agents, and humans. Smart contracts alone couldn’t handle this&nbsp;need.</p><p>HPP is being launched to fill that gap. It is designed not only to process transactions but also to orchestrate distributed intelligence in a trusted and scalable&nbsp;manner.</p> What Makes HPP Different? <p>HPP (House Party Protocol) is Aergo’s next-generation evolution. It is a Layer 2 AI-native network designed to facilitate real-time, verifiable coordination among agents, models, and&nbsp;humans.</p><p>Here’s how we are aligning with the rise of the SLM&nbsp;economy:</p>  SLM-Oriented Architecture: HPP’s infrastructure supports lightweight inference, agent execution, and off-chain verification. This is optimized for high-frequency, low-latency decision-making.  Agent-to-Agent Payments: With tokenized microtransactions, HPP enables autonomous systems to transact with each other. These include sensor-to-sensor, bot-to-bot, and model-to-model interactions.  Programmable Coordination Layer: HPP is not just a smart contract platform. It is a coordination layer that allows distributed teams of agents to operate, cooperate, and resolve logic through programmable protocols.  Off-Chain Intelligence with Noösphere: Developers can offload computation-heavy tasks to trusted off-chain environments, then bring back proofs or results on-chain for transparency and auditability.  Plus-and-Play AI Services: Users can subscribe to or deploy specialized SLMs into their wallets. At the same time, developers can compose multiple agents into dApps or workflows, enabling projects to offer AI-as-a-Service directly on top of&nbsp;HPP.   A Financial Layer for the Machine&nbsp;Economy <p>The agent economy demands a new kind of currency. SLMs and agents execute countless micro-transactions, often worth fractions of a cent, in real-time. Traditional finance cannot keep up with this scale or speed. Transaction fees, processing times, and centralized gatekeeping all become fatal bottlenecks.</p><p>HPP’s tokenomics are being designed with this future in&nbsp;mind:</p>  Frictionless, programmable payments  Support for microvalue and high-frequency transactions  Decentralized fee models for agent-native services   From Enterprise to Intelligence <p>Aergo has long served as a reliable enterprise-grade platform for governments, corporations, and infrastructure providers. With HPP, we are taking that experience and pointing it toward the next wave: AI-powered coordination.</p><p>This is not a pivot. It is an expansion. We are not abandoning what we have built. We are extending it into a new domain where intelligent systems can operate transparently, securely, and autonomously across decentralized networks.</p> The Road&nbsp;Ahead <p>As LLMs give way to networks of SLMs, the question becomes: who is building the infrastructure for them to run, transact, and coordinate on-chain?</p><p>HPP is becoming the coordination fabric of the SLM economy. A world where models collaborate, agents negotiate, and decentralized intelligence becomes self-sustaining. In the next phase of the internet, not everything needs to be on-chain. But everything must be verifiable and interoperable. That’s what HPP is delivering.</p><p>A new infrastructure layer is emerging. In a world where AI models are no longer passive tools but active market participants, we need more than just smart contracts. We need coordination, autonomy, and verifiability at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>This is where HPP is&nbsp;heading.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/2-hpp-and-the-post-llm-future-building-the-infrastructure-for-the-next-chatgpt-5ad72255bbf5">[2] HPP and the Post-LLM Future: Building the Infrastructure for the next ChatGPT</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo (HPP)</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Why use Okta for authentication 

<p>Building an authentication system and handling credentials, sessions, and tokens is highly insecure and exposes your application to serious vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Okta provides a secure, scalable, and standards-based solution using OpenID Connect (OIDC) and OAuth 2.0. It also integrates seamlessly with OIDC client libraries for your favorite tech stack and allows you to fetch tokens.</p>

 Why use PKCE in OAuth 2.0 

<p>To further strengthen security, this project uses PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange), defined in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7636">RFC 7636</a>. PKCE is a security extension to the Authorization Code flow. Developers initially designed PKCE for mobile apps, but experts now recommend it for all OAuth clients, including web apps. It helps prevent CSRF and authorization code injection attacks and makes it useful for every type of OAuth client, even confidential clients such as web apps that use client secrets. As OAuth 2.0 has steadily evolved, security best practices have also advanced. <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9700.html">RFC 9700: Best Current Practice for OAuth 2.0 Security</a> captures the consensus on the most effective and secure implementation strategies. Additionally, the upcoming OAuth 2.1 draft requires PKCE for all authorization code flows, reinforcing it as a baseline security standard.</p>

<p>With Okta, you can implement modern authentication features and focus on your application logic without worrying about authentication infrastructure.</p>

 A secure web app using Express, OAuth 2.0, and PKCE 

<p>Let’s build an expense dashboard where users log in with Okta and view spending data based on their role. Whether they work in Finance, Marketing, or HR, each team views only its own expenses. To keep things minimal in this demo project, we’ll define roles and users directly in the app.</p>

<p>You’ll also use OpenID Connect (OIDC) through the openid-client library for authentication. Then, you’ll map each user’s email from the ID token to a team. The dashboard applies principles of least privilege and displays expenses by team, so each user sees only their department’s spending.</p>

<p>Prerequisites</p>

 
   
    <p>Node.js installed (v22+ recommended)</p>
   
   
    <p><a href="https://developer.okta.com/signup/">Okta Integrator Free Plan org</a></p>
   
 

 Create your Express project and install dependencies 

<p>Create a new project folder named <code>express-project-okta</code>, and open a terminal window in the project folder.</p>

<p>Initialize a new Node.js project:</p>

   <code>npm init -y
</code>   

<p>Install the required packages:</p>

   <code>npm install express@5.1 passport@0.7 openid-client@6.6 express-session@1.18 ejs@3.1 express-ejs-layouts@2.5 dotenv
</code>   

<p>Now, install the development dependencies:</p>

   <code>npm install --save-dev nodemon
</code>   

<p>In the package.json file, update the scripts property with the following:</p>

   <code>  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon index.js"
  }
</code>   

<p>What do these dependencies do?</p>

<p>These installed packages become your Express project’s dependencies.</p>

 
   
    <p><code>express</code>: Handles routing and HTTP middleware for your web app</p>
   
   
    <p><code>passport</code>: Sets up and maintains server-side sessions</p>
   
   
    <p><code>openid-client</code>: Node.js OIDC library with PKCE support; handles the OAuth handshake and token exchange.</p>
   
   
    <p><code>express-session</code>: Manages user sessions on the server</p>
   
   
    <p><code>dotenv</code>: Loads environment variables from a <code>.env</code> file</p>
   
   
    <p><code>ejs</code>: Enables dynamic HTML rendering using embedded JavaScript templates</p>
   
   
    <p><code>express-ejs-layouts</code>: Adds layout support to EJS, helping manage common layout structures across views</p>
   
 

 Configure environment variables for OIDC authentication 

<p>Create a <code>.env</code> file in the root directory with placeholders for your Okta configuration.</p>

   <code>OKTA_ISSUER=
OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourClientId}
OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET={clientSecret}
APP_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
POST_LOGOUT_URL=http://localhost:3000
</code>   

<p>In the next step, you’ll get these values from your Okta Admin Console.</p>

 Create the Okta OIDC web application 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need an Okta Integrator Free Plan account. To get one, sign up for an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login">Integrator account</a>. Once you have an account, sign in to your <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login">Integrator account</a>. Next, in the Admin Console:</p>

 
   Go to Applications &gt; Applications 
   Click Create App Integration 
   Select OIDC - OpenID Connect as the sign-in method 
   Select Web Application as the application type, then click Next 
   
    <p>Enter an app integration name</p>
   
   Configure the redirect URIs:
     
       Sign-in redirect URIs: <code>http://localhost:3000/authorization-code/callback</code> 
       Sign-out redirect URIs: <code>http://localhost:3000</code> 
     
   
   In the Controlled access section, select the appropriate access level 
   Click Save 
 


  Where are my new app's credentials?

<p>Creating an OIDC Web App manually in the Admin Console configures your Okta Org with the application settings.</p>

<p>After creating the app, you can find the configuration details on the app’s General tab:</p>

 
   Client ID: Found in the Client Credentials section 
   Client Secret: Click Show in the Client Credentials section to reveal 
   Issuer: Found in the Issuer URI field for the authorization server that appears by selecting Security &gt; API from the navigation pane. 
 

<p>You’ll need these values for your application configuration:</p>

   <code>OKTA_OAUTH2_ISSUER="https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default"
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID="0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6"
OKTA_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET="NEVER-SHOW-SECRETS"
</code>   

<p>Your Okta domain is the first part of your issuer, before <code>/oauth2/default</code>.</p>

<p>NOTE: You can also use the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli-client">Okta CLI Client</a> or <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-powershell-cli">Okta PowerShell Module</a> to automate this process. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-web-app/-/create-okta-application/">this guide</a> for more information about setting up your app.</p>



 Build the Express app 

<p>Create an <code>index.js</code> file in your project root. It serves as the main entry point for your application. Use it to initialize the Express app, set up the routes, and configure <a href="https://www.passportjs.org/">Passport</a> to manage user sessions by serializing and deserializing users on each request.</p>

   <code>import express from 'express';
import session from 'express-session';
import passport from 'passport'; 
import routes from './routes.js';
import expressLayouts from 'express-ejs-layouts';

const app = express();

app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
app.use(expressLayouts); 
app.set('layout', 'layout');
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.use(session({
  secret: "your-hardcoded-secret",
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: true,
}));

app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session());

passport.serializeUser(function (user, done) {
  done(null, user);
});

passport.deserializeUser(function (obj, done) {
  done(null, obj);
});

app.use('/', routes);

app.listen(3000, () =&gt; {
  console.log('Server listening on http://localhost:3000');
});
</code>   

 Define team mapping and sample expenses 

<p>Create a <code>utils.js</code> file to serve as a data module for your project. This file includes a user-to-team mapping and has dummy expense data for each team, covering all teams configured for testing in your web app.</p>

<p>The application determines the user’s team context from the email claim in the ID token and filters the expense list accordingly, so the dashboard displays only that team’s data.</p>

<p>To customize the data, open <code>utils.js</code> and update the following objects:</p>

 
   
    <p><code>ALL_TEAMS_NAME</code> - an array listing all teams in your organization</p>
   
   
    <p><code>userTeamMap</code> - maps each user’s email (or “admin” for full access) to a specific team</p>
   
   
    <p><code>dummyExpenseData</code> - contains sample expense data for each team</p>
   
 

   <code>export const ALL_TEAMS_NAME = ["finance", "hr", "legal", "marketing", "dev advocacy"];

export const userTeamMap = {
  "hannah.smith@task-vantage.com": "admin",
  "grace.li@task-vantage.com": "legal",

export function getModifiedTeam(team) {
  if (!team?.trim()) return [];

  const toPascalCase = (str) =&gt;
    str
      .trim()
      .split(/\s+/)
      .map((word) =&gt; word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1).toLowerCase())

  const toKebabCase = (str) =&gt; str.trim().toLowerCase().split(' ').join('-');

  }

  return [
    {
      id: toKebabCase(team),
      label: toPascalCase(team),
    },
  ];
}
</code>   

<p>The file also defines <code>getModifiedTeam</code>, a helper that converts a team name into an array of objects. Each object has an id and a label. If the team is admin, the function returns an object for every entry in <code>ALL_TEAMS_NAME</code>; otherwise, it returns a single object for the specified team. Later in the project, the app calls this function to transform the user’s team information.</p>

 Create a file to handle authentication 

<p>Create an <code>auth.js</code> file for this step. This file uses the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/openid-client">openid-client</a> library to handle the OIDC flow: it logs users in, exchanges the authorization code for tokens, and logs them out. It also defines a middleware that guards protected routes.</p>

<p>In the auth.js file, add the following code:</p>

   <code>import * as client from "openid-client";
import "dotenv/config";

import { getModifiedTeam, userTeamMap } from './utils.js';

async function getClientConfig() {
  return await client.discovery(new URL(process.env.OKTA_ISSUER), process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_ID, process.env.OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET);
}

export async function login(req, res) {
  try {
    const openIdClientConfig = await getClientConfig();

    const code_verifier = client.randomPKCECodeVerifier();
    const code_challenge = await client.calculatePKCECodeChallenge(code_verifier);
    const state = client.randomState();

    req.session.pkce = { code_verifier, state };
    req.session.save(); 

    const authUrl = client.buildAuthorizationUrl(openIdClientConfig, {
      scope: "openid profile email offline_access",
      state,
      code_challenge,
      code_challenge_method: "S256",
      redirect_uri: `${process.env.APP_BASE_URL}/authorization-code/callback`,
    });

    res.redirect(authUrl);
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send("Something failed during the authorization request");
  }
}

function getCallbackUrlWithParams(req) {
  const host = req.headers["x-forwarded-host"] || req.headers.host || "localhost";
  const protocol = req.headers["x-forwarded-proto"] || req.protocol;
  const currentUrl = new URL(`${protocol}://${host}${req.originalUrl}`);
  return currentUrl;
}

export async function authCallback(req, res, next) {
  try {
    const openIdClientConfig = await getClientConfig();

    const { pkce } = req.session;

    if (!pkce || !pkce.code_verifier || !pkce.state) {
      throw new Error("Login session expired or invalid. Please try logging in again.");
    }

    const tokenSet = await client.authorizationCodeGrant(openIdClientConfig, getCallbackUrlWithParams(req), {
      pkceCodeVerifier: pkce.code_verifier,
      expectedState: pkce.state,
    });

    const { name, email } = tokenSet.claims();
    const teams = getModifiedTeam(userTeamMap[email]);

    const userProfile = {
      name,
      email,
      teams,
      idToken: tokenSet.id_token,
    };

    delete req.session.pkce;

    req.logIn(userProfile, (err) =&gt; {
      if (err) {
        return next(err);
      }

      return res.redirect("/dashboard");
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Authentication error:", error.message);
    return res.status(500).send(`Authentication failed: ${error.message}`);
  }
}

export async function logout(req, res) {
  try {
    const openIdClientConfig = await getClientConfig();

    const id_token_hint = req.user?.idToken;

    const logoutUrl = client.buildEndSessionUrl(openIdClientConfig, {
      id_token_hint,
      post_logout_redirect_uri: process.env.POST_LOGOUT_URL,
    });

    req.logout((err) =&gt; {
      if (err) return next(err);

      req.session.destroy((err) =&gt; {
        if (err) return next(err);
        res.redirect(logoutUrl);
      });
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send('Something went wrong during logout.');
  }
}

export function ensureAuthenticated(req, res, next) {
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
    return next();
  }
  res.redirect("/login");
}
</code>   

<p>This file includes the following functions:</p>

 
   <code>getClientConfig</code> - Retrieves the authorization server’s metadata using the discovery endpoint. 
   <code>login</code> - This function starts the Authorization Code + PKCE flow. It generates the required values to enable PKCE: the code_verifier and code_challenge. These values, along with the <code>state</code> value protect the user sign in process from attack vectors. <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636">PKCE</a> protects against auth code interception attacks, and the state parameter protects against <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf">Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)</a>. The openid-client builds the user sign in URL with these values and redirects the user to Okta to complete the authentication challenge. 
   <code>getCallbackUrlWithParams</code> - Reconstructs the complete callback URL, including protocol, host, path, and query. 
   <code>authCallback</code> - This function runs when the user redirects back to the app after the authentication challenge succeeds. At this point, the redirect URL back into the application includes the auth code. The OIDC client verifies the auth code by checking that the state value matches the parameter in the first redirect. Once verified, the openid-client library uses the auth code for the token exchange by adding the code_verifier to the token request. The authorization server validates the auth code and the code_verifier value to ensure the request comes from the client making the original authentication request, mitigating attacks using stolen auth codes.
Once we get back valid tokens, we handle the app’s business logic, such as mapping the user to a team and storing the profile details and ID token in the session. If everything succeeds, it redirects the user to the dashboard. 
   <code>logout</code> - Logs the user out of the app and redirects to the post-logout URL. 
   <code>ensureAuthenticated</code> - Middleware that allows authenticated users to proceed and redirects others to the login page. 
 

 Set up routing in Express 

<p>Now things start to come together and feel like a real app. The <code>routes.js</code> file defines all the essential routes, from login and logout to viewing your profile, the expense dashboard, and individual team expense pages. The app handles each endpoint’s core logic and checks a user’s authentication status before granting access to protected pages.</p>

 Add EJS views in Express 

<p>Now it’s time to give the app a user interface. You’ll use EJS templates to build pages that respond dynamically to who’s logged in and what data they see. The app uses <code>ejs</code> templates to render the pages, plus <code>express-ejs-layouts</code> for common layout structures.</p>

<p>Create a folder named <code>views</code>, then add the following EJS files:</p>

<p>home.ejs</p>

   <code>&lt;% if (user) { %&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Welcome, &lt;%= user.name || 'User' %&gt;!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;% } else { %&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Welcome&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;% } %&gt;

&lt;p class="lead"&gt;Log your expenses and manage your team's spending on the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;% if (user) { %&gt;
&lt;a href="/dashboard" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;Go to Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;% } else { %&gt;
&lt;a href="/login" class="btn btn-success"&gt;Login&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;% } %&gt;

</code>   

<p>profile.ejs</p>

   <code>&lt;h1&gt;Profile&lt;/h1&gt;

 Run the Express app with authentication 

<p>In your terminal, start the server:</p>

<p><code>npm start</code></p>

<p>Open your browser and navigate to <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>.</p>

<p>Click Login and authenticate with your Okta account. The app then displays your Expense Dashboard, Profile, and a Log out option.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: When you’re signed in to the Developer Console as an admin, Okta keeps your org session active and automatically logs you into the app. To test other user accounts, use an incognito tab to test the login flow.</p>
</blockquote>

 Admin view: 

<p></p>

 User view: 

<p></p>

 Expenses view: 

<p></p>

<p>And that’s it! You’ve built a secure Expense Dashboard and connected your Express application to Okta using OIDC and OAuth.</p>

 Learn more about OAuth 2.0, OIDC, and PKCE 

<p>Here’s a quick rundown of the features I used in this project to build a secure expense dashboard:</p>

 
   
    <p>OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an identity and authentication layer built on OAuth 2.0.</p>
   
   
    <p>Authorization Code Flow with PKCE is the most secure flow for server-side and browser-based web apps.</p>

            <p>With its aim of ‘digitising’ the North Atlantic via an Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) barrier comprising networked ships, uncrewed vehicles (UVs) and AI-enabled acoustic sensors, Project CABOT is reshaping how undersea threats are detected and deterred.</p>
<p>On 16th July, representatives from thirty SMEs gathered at the National Museum of the Royal Navy to rally around Project CABOT’s problem statement.&nbsp;<br>
Hosted by Thales, the day was one of collaboration, curiosity and shared intent, with each organisation communicating how their current, evolving and future capabilities might contribute to the programme’s success. Collaborative workshops troubleshooted the sorts of challenges that might stall or scupper what the Royal Navy is trying to get done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the sun set over Portsmouth, so too did the energy in the room become increasingly invigorated and infectious. After all, CABOT presents an enticing, extraordinary opportunity for industry - one in which it’s not simply delivering solutions but, instead, solving problems and defining an approach with knowledge sharing, trust and accountability at the helm - with an ecosystem of partners working together to deliver.</p>
 Unpacking CABOT’s complexity 
<p>CABOT is not a standalone initiative. It’s grounded firmly within the broader strategic imperative for persistent, integrated and decisive ASW capability across the North Atlantic. The stakes are high: as undersea threats proliferate and adversaries grow more agile and emboldened, so too must the UK’s ability to detect, track, and respond with equal speed and accuracy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, the programme’s challenges range from sensor fusion and data latency to the orchestration of autonomous systems at scale, each buffeted by environmental factors (temperatures, salinity, currents and seabed topography) which will affect the ongoing effectiveness of the ASW barrier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Power supply and sustainability remains a constraint for long-duration, real-world deployments, especially when many current autonomous platforms can only stay on task for a few days.</p>
<p>Then there are the more bureaucratic, institutional barriers to greater industry collaboration and SME engagement with programmes like CABOT. Where SMEs face time-intensive, costly compliance requirements and bidding processes that divert resources away from core business activities. There may also be difficulty connecting with - and differentiating themselves from - larger organisations, and limited access to funding (to name but a few).</p>
<p>But the mood in the room was far from daunted. Instead, optimism and urgency coexisted. Participants weren't there to admire the problem; they were there to dismantle it.</p>
 Strength in numbers: the enterprise approach to subsea defence 
<p>Agile, inventive and unburdened by bureaucracy, the SME ecosystem is both a critical enabler of CABOT and a catalyst for the future of ASW more widely. It’s one that Thales has been curating deliberately over time - connecting capabilities, nurturing relationships and creating the conditions for trust to flourish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A useful example is the collective effort of SMEs in supporting the Royal Navy’s Dreadnought submarines with Sonar 2076, one of the most advanced systems of its kind. Spearhead (rapid capability, development and deployment in ASW) and CUES&nbsp;(Complex Underwater Environmental Sensor)&nbsp;are also demonstrations of how bringing innovation to the front line relies on the ability to integrate and iterate quickly, backed by the flexibility and specialist knowledge that smaller suppliers bring.</p>
<p>The benefits are mutual. Where SMEs help larger, slower, bureaucracy-bound organisations stay sharp and responsive, these same organisations can bring scale, insight and access to elevate the efforts of SMEs and prospective partners. Decades of close customer engagement and minds full of institutional knowledge mean companies like Thales can ground the aspirations and innovations of SMEs in the current operational context, helping whole ecosystems understand not just what the problem is, but how it plays out on the front line.&nbsp;</p>
 From North Atlantic to global stage: CABOT’s strategic ripple 
<p>Project CABOT may be focused on a specific challenge in a specific theatre, but it’s reflective of a much broader strategic need: shoring up the UK’s defence and industrial resilience at sea, on land and in the skies - and creating and sustaining SQEP’s (Suitably Qualified and Experienced People) against the backdrop of emerging technologies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And of course there is a defence dividend that comes along with the SME ecosystem approach - investment in jobs and communities, localised prosperity and the associated economic benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where plans like Readiness 2030 (previously ReArm Europe) signal demand and intent to fortify the West’s competitive edge against rising geopolitical instability, Project CABOT serves as a testbed for how the UK and its partners can deliver capability at pace and with purpose, underscored by an enterprise approach with SME mission partners deeply embedded from the outset.</p>
<p>Because Thales knows as well as its current and potential partners: when it comes to making sure the UK and its allies are ready, resilient and perpetually prepared, it’ll be all hands on deck.<br>

<p>Retailers Confront Growing Return Fraud as Casual Dishonesty Escalates in E-Commerce Era</p>



<p>Return fraud is surging in the U.S., costing businesses an estimated $103B annually. While some schemes involve scams like empty box returns, much of the fraud comes from everyday consumers abusing generous return policies to “rent” or misuse items. E-commerce has worsened the issue, as online returns are harder to verify. Retailers—especially small businesses—are tightening policies and using data to flag repeat offenders. Still, many shoppers view these actions as harmless, fueling a culture of casual dishonesty in retail.. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/return-fraud-amazon-shipping-retail-theft-wardrobing-online-shopping-2025-7?&amp;utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9wcWy4R0Ch_IF199TmSWwp1lJ3P89MPCGL9GOzDuQc2rmITFEbRVNI4xLACUKI92y-Hcix">(Source)</a></p>

 Identity Fraud: A $50 billion opportunity in disguise for insurance companies&nbsp; 



<p>Identity fraud isn’t slowing down. In fact, it’s accelerating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to recent projections, global identity fraud losses will pass $50 billion by 2025, driven by phishing, synthetic identities, and data breaches across digital ecosystems. For insurance providers, this growing crisis is not just a threat. It’s a massive opportunity to offer high-value, proactive solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Enter identity fraud solutions for insurance: bundled tools and services that go beyond claims and coverage to actively protect customers in their everyday digital lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What’s driving the surge in identity fraud?&nbsp; 



<p>As more of life moves online, and with generative AI and dark web data trading on the rise, identity theft has become faster, smarter, and far more widespread.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Key trends include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Synthetic identity fraud, where fake personas are created using real and fabricated data. 



 Phishing and account takeovers, primarily through mobile apps and SMS.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Credential stuffing, using leaked passwords to access personal accounts. 



 Digital impersonation, aided by AI-generated photos, voices, and documents.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>Traditional insurance offerings aren’t built to handle these threats, but privacy and identity protection bundles are.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 A new layer of protection: Digital identity bundles 



<p>Leading insurers are now bundling digital identity protection with their offerings, helping policyholders stay ahead of fraud and bounce back faster when it strikes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bundled identity fraud tools may include:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Virtual cards for safer online purchases&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Masked phone numbers and emails to protect personal contact info 



 Dark web monitoring and breach alerts&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Credit and identity theft monitoring&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Wallet-based credentials for secure authentication and claims access&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>By embedding these tools into policies, insurers add measurable value to customers’ lives while opening up entirely new lines of business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Why identity protection is a smart revenue play&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Here’s what makes identity fraud solutions so attractive for insurers:</p>



 
 Recurring revenue potential from subscription-based privacy tools&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Cross-sell and upsell opportunities during digital onboarding and renewals 



 Improved retention through proactive risk reduction and service stickiness&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Lower fraud-related claims through early detection and secure communication&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Differentiation in a market where most offerings feel commoditized&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>Plus, identity protection is a need that transcends age and demographics. Whether you’re protecting a retiree from phishing or a young family from account takeover, the value is straightforward to communicate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Leading with privacy builds trust&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Consumer surveys show growing demand for brands that prioritize privacy:</p>



 
 <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/cisco-consumer-privacy-report-2023.pdf">81% of consumers</a> say a company’s data practices influence their buying decisions&nbsp; 



 72% are more likely to stay loyal to brands that give them control over personal data&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>Offering embedded identity protection doesn’t just reduce fraud, it sends a powerful signal. You’re not just selling policies. You’re safeguarding your customers’ digital lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Getting started: Partnering for success&nbsp;&nbsp; 



<p>Insurers don’t need to build these tools in-house.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Partnering with privacy and identity technology providers allows you to:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Launch fast with white-labeled apps or SDKs&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Customize offerings for different policyholder segments&nbsp; 



 Integrate into existing claims, onboarding, and renewal flows&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p></p>



<p>From virtual communications to secure claims access, everything can be built into the policy experience, no heavy development is required.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2025 and beyond, identity fraud solutions for insurance won’t just be nice to have, they’ll be expected. Consumers are looking for comprehensive protection, and insurers that deliver it will earn more than just premiums. They’ll earn long-term loyalty, new revenue, and a strong position in a digital-first world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Site plan showing the study area and the expected tram line development Valuing the Ecosystem Services of street trees in Berlin to inform the strategic development of the extension of the M10 tram&nbsp;line <p>This blog article provides an overview of the joint efforts undertaken in partnership with the District Office Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf of Berlin, The Nature Conservancy in Europe gGmbH, DorfwerkStadt e.V., and Politics for Tomorrow / nextlearning e.V.</p><p>Nature often has to pave the way for the expansion of the city’s urban infrastructure. But what if we could more accurately understand the value tree, so we can make a stronger case for decisions that reduce tree&nbsp;removal?</p>Map showing two tram route options in the urban area, overlaid with baseline canopy cover&nbsp;data<p>Tram route options and baseline canopy&nbsp;cover</p><p>This map shows two tram route options in the urban area, overlaid with baseline canopy cover&nbsp;data:</p>  A red dotted line represents planned Tram Line M10 (New Tram Extension). It spans from Kaiserin-Augusta-Allee through Mierendorffplatz, Osnabrücker Straße, and ends at Tegeler&nbsp;Weg.  The alternative tram route is shown as a magenta dashed line, running through Gaußstraße and Obersstraße.  <p>As Berlin advances its commitment to sustainable mobility, the <a href="https://www.berlin.de/sen/uvk/mobilitaet-und-verkehr/verkehrsplanung/oeffentlicher-personennahverkehr/projekte-in-umsetzung/turmstrasse/">planned extension</a> of tram line M10 between Turmstraße and S+U Jungfernheide illustrates a familiar urban dilemma: progress at the cost of nature, the tram extension risks removing over a hundred mature street trees. Trees constantly provide a variety of benefits to the citizens around them. As built infrastructure expands, it’s easy to forget the invisible nature systems already at work: cooling our streets, cleaning our air, managing stormwater, and supporting our mental and physical&nbsp;health.</p><p>This is where ecosystem services valuation comes in, by quantifying the benefits trees provide, we can integrate ecological assets into infrastructure planning, allowing decision-makers to balance new infrastructure with the natural capital we already&nbsp;have.</p> A tool to value urban&nbsp;nature <p>To address this gap, the district council of <a href="https://www.berlin.de/ba-charlottenburg-wilmersdorf/">Berlin Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf</a> and <a href="https://de.linkedin.com/showcase/the-nature-conservancy-europe/">The Nature Conservancy in Europe</a> commissioned our Trees as Infrastructure team to develop and deploy an Ecosystem Services Valuation Tool for the affected Mierendorff Island sites in Berlin. This tool translates ecological functions into benefits and, consequently, into economic metrics, thereby assigning a value to nature within financial and planning&nbsp;systems.</p><p>The model assessed ecosystem services within a 50-meter buffer along the tram route, focusing on quantifiable benefits in three key&nbsp;areas:</p>  Climate Adaptation &amp; Mitigation: shelter from wind, temperature moderation and carbon sequestration  Water Management &amp; Flood Alleviation: rainfall interception and stormwater reduction  Health &amp; Well-being: stress reduction, air quality improvements, and support for active lifestyles  <p>To calculate these values, our model leveraged a combination of diverse local data, including high-resolution tree canopy data, detailed meteorological information, and socioeconomic demographics for Berlin. The economic value was derived by applying established valuation methods such as avoided damages (e.g. quantifying the benefits of climate regulation and flood mitigation), market prices (e.g. for carbon credits), and replacement costs (e.g. for water quality improvements). To support these calculations, we use established tools and frameworks, including <a href="https://merseyforest.org.uk/green-infrastructure-valuation-toolkit/">GI-VAL</a>, <a href="https://www.susdrain.org/resources/best.html">B£ST</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://naturalcapitalproject.stanford.edu/software/invest">InVEST</a>.</p><p>We also developed a <a href="https://ecosystem-services.treesai.org/">web interface</a> for this tool so that the results could be easily shareable and accessible to a broad audience. Designed to reflect the transparency of traditional financial asset dashboards, the Ecosystem Services Dashboard enables users to explore the data in depth: they can adjust scenarios, compare outcomes, and zoom in or out on the map, encouraging a hands-on, investigative approach.</p>Web interface data tables and visualisationsWeb interface for scenario&nbsp;analysis Risks and model limitations <p>Our model offers valuable insights into the economic contributions of urban trees and their ecosystem services. Like any innovative tool, it has boundaries, best understood as invitations for further exploration rather than&nbsp;flaws.</p><p>Its accuracy depends on data quality; incomplete inputs can lead to misestimations, underscoring the need for robust local data. As with many valuation tools, our model simplifies complex natural systems to yield actionable insights, though it may not capture site-specific nuances such as microclimates or tree placement. It currently assumes a linear relationship between services and benefits, while real ecosystems often exhibit non-linear dynamics and tipping points — areas for future refinement.</p><p>Then there’s the challenge of putting a price tag on nature. Valuing public commons like clean air or carbon storage remains challenging without standard market prices. Even so, indicative estimates help make the benefits of healthy ecosystems visible in policy and planning. While individual trees generate limited carbon credits, their collective impact and co-benefits are significant at&nbsp;scale.</p><p>Systemic shifts such as climate change, policy changes, or technological disruption, are not yet modeled but represent critical frontiers. While we focus on economic benefits, the model does not yet capture social and cultural values that communities attribute to urban green spaces or account for social vulnerability, such as how the loss of trees might disproportionately affect low-income or elderly residents.</p><p>In this light, the model is best used as one valuable piece in a broader puzzle — most powerful when combined with local expertise and qualitative insights to establish a more responsible, evidence-informed decision-making approach for urban resilience.</p> Our key&nbsp;findings <p>When considering the three benefit groups on climate regulation, water management and health, the main findings for the baseline situation of the standing trees as they are today&nbsp;were:</p>  Baseline value: At the baseline scenario site, the total value of ecosystem services provided by all currently standing trees located within 50 metres of the road over a 10-year period is estimated at €10.5 million. This equates to an average economic value of €29,440 from ecosystem services per tree over the same&nbsp;period.  <p>Our model was then used to explore three distinct scenarios to compare the potential impact of tree&nbsp;removal:</p>  ‘Optimistic’ scenario: Relates to the removal of the 35 trees identified in a technical survey commissioned by the BVG (Berlin’s public transport agency) were removed, the projected ecosystem services loss would be approximately €1 million over a&nbsp;decade.  ‘Realistic’ scenario: Relates to the removal of 131 trees, which are those at risk of being felled as their crown diameter overlaps a certain buffer distance from the future tram line, leading to an estimated loss of approximately €4.2 million in value over a&nbsp;decade.  ‘Alternative’ route scenario: Relates to the removal of 45 trees if the tramline was built along an alternative route, resulting in a projected loss of approximately €300,000.  <p>Although the alternative route maintains a canopy cover similar to the optimistic scenario, its economic impact on ecosystem services is notably lower. This difference largely comes down to a few important factors. The trees along the alternative path tend to be smaller, so they naturally provide fewer benefits like carbon capture, cooling, and air purification. Secondly, this route passes through an area with much fewer residents, meaning trees contribute less to direct health benefits such as stress relief, improved air quality and encouraging outdoor activity. Also, with fewer buildings and residents exposed to wind currents, the climate regulation benefits per tree are less relevant.</p><p>This highlights a key insight for planning: the impact of a tree in a city is highly dependent on its specific context, what surrounds it, how many people it benefits, the local environmental risks, and how much the urban system relies on it to cope with those risks. Not all trees have the same value, and understanding their place within the urban fabric is key to making decisions around preserving urban nature and maximising ecosystem services.</p>This map displays the elderly residential distribution along the tram line route&nbsp;options. What does this mean for city stakeholders? <p>The numbers in this study reveal a critical opportunity: urban trees are not just passive greenery but invaluable infrastructure delivering vital ecosystem services — carbon capture, air purification, cooling, stormwater management, and community well-being — that currently go unpriced and underleveraged. This structural blind spot means cities miss a chance to unlock new financing pathways that could transform how living ecosystems are maintained and expanded.</p><p>Imagine innovative financing frameworks that monetise the ecosystem value of existing trees to directly funnel resources into city households. The beneficiaries of these ecosystem services include municipal enterprises managing energy and rainwater systems, municipal housing associations, and private companies seeking to improve their sustainability profiles and creditworthiness with banks. These stakeholders could contribute to a new funding mechanism, reflecting the shared value trees provide across urban sectors. These funds could then be allocated to enhance tree maintenance, ensuring the health and longevity of the urban canopy, while simultaneously financing targeted climate adaptation measures in vulnerable areas of the district.</p><p>To support this vision, city policies must&nbsp;evolve:</p>  Empower subsidiarity and support local initiatives by formally recognising the community’s active stewardship role in caring for and maintaining urban&nbsp;nature.  Strengthen tree protection ordinances by setting stricter tree replanting ratios (e.g. 1:5 or 1:10) and fines proportional to the projected ecosystem service losses over 10–20 years, using our study — which translates these services into monetary value — as the foundation for accurately accounting the time lag and diminished benefits between a felled mature tree and its young replacement.  Redesign compensation frameworks to go beyond tree replacement, enabling funds to be channeled into additional appropriate interventions (e.g. unsealing, rain gardens) that respond to site-specific adaptation needs.  <p>This case in Berlin reinforces a critical insight on the need for coordinated urban planning: housing and urban development, climate adaptation, and transport transitions must be designed as interconnected systems. Without such integration, we risk implementing climate solutions that deliberately undermine the very resilience we aim to&nbsp;build.</p><p>On March 22 2025, our findings were formally presented by one of our team member Sebastian Klemm, to a broad audience, including the public, political representatives, and notably, district council leads from civil engineering, green space and climate adaptation. As a result of this engagement, our tree ecosystem valuation study is being used by the district councillor to support the renegotiation of all elements of the project, including the tram line extension, its planning alternatives, proposed route, the calculation basis for compensation measures, and their intended&nbsp;purpose.</p>Sebastian Klemm presented our TreesAI findings on March 22 2025 to an audience including public attendees, political representatives, and district council leaders from civil engineering, green space, and climate adaptation. Looking ahead <p>The results of this study reveals the significant, long-term societal losses that would result from removing these mature trees to extend the M10 tram line. This local tension of transport infrastructure developing versus the protection of nature that regulates our microclimate, mirrors a wider urban planning dilemma faced by cities across Europe and beyond on how to align societal development with ecological and societal resilience.</p><p>This case points to a larger strategic question:</p><p>How can infrastructure planning be reoriented to systematically reflect public health, climate resilience, and the long-term well-being of communities in legal and fiscal decisions?</p><p>This question shaped the expert dialogue on June 20th 2025, curated and convened by Politics for Tomorrow / nextlearning.eu in collaboration with the Trees as Infrastructure team, DorfwerkStadt e.V., and the Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf district office. The working session marked a critical step in turning the study’s findings into actionable governance frameworks. Building on the earlier public presentation, this closed session provided a platform for cross-sector reflection and collaborative policy design. By integrating ecological, health, and economic insights with legal and administrative expertise, the session enabled a shared understanding of trees as living infrastructure, emphasizing their value not just in compensation terms but within proactive planning and investment strategies.</p><p>Most importantly, this dialogue laid the foundation for systemic change, shifting from fragmented responsibilities to cooperative governance, and from isolated environmental mitigation to integrated, health-oriented resilience policies. Ideas for a coordinated collaboration strategy emerged, including piloting new planning and financing models on Mierendorff Island, embedding the valuation approach into Berlin’s compensation guidelines, and developing governance tools like a Commons Index and local operating models to unlock cross-sector investment.</p><p>The outcomes of this dialogue offer immediate policy relevance:</p>  Proposals for adapting the M10 route planning based on comprehensive ecological and social valuation;  A replicable citywide model for integrating ecological and health data into infrastructure decisions;  A framework for embedding green infrastructure value into the planning and budgeting strategies of the district, Senate, and both public and private institutions;  An alternative to outdated cost-benefit tools like the Koch method, which continues to treat trees as depreciable assets, instead recognising their full ecological, social, and economic value as resilient, multi-solving elements.  <p>If you are working to build cities that are equitable and ecologically sound, this is your invitation: <a href="mailto:%20treesai@darkmatterlabs.org">Join us</a> in advancing a movement for living infrastructure — where urban trees and nature are not obstacles to progress but essential infrastructure for urban resilience and liveable&nbsp;cities.</p><p>Full Report: Dive into the complete findings, data, and methodology in the ecosystem services valuation report &gt; <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jb5ldPRA8tjSsdd0p8jIXSgIfGAM53i9/view?usp=drive_link">Link to&nbsp;PDF</a></p><p>Interactive Dashboard: Explore the spatial distribution and value of Berlin’s tree canopy via our<a href="https://ecosystem-services.treesai.org/"> Ecosystem Services Dashboar</a>d.</p><p>Partners: District Office Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf of Berlin, The Nature Conservancy in Europe gGmbH, DorfwerkStadt e.V., and Politics for Tomorrow / nextlearning.eu</p><p>Team: Sofia Valentini, Sebastian Klemm, Chloe Treger, Gurden Batra, Caroline Paulick-Thiel</p><p>TreesAI identity created by Arianna&nbsp;Smaron</p> <p><a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org/unlocking-the-value-for-urban-nature-an-economic-case-for-street-tree-preservation-in-berlin-af0714bdd9f3">Unlocking the Value for Urban Nature: An Economic Case for Street Tree Preservation in Berlin</a> was originally published in <a href="https://provocations.darkmatterlabs.org">Dark Matter Laboratories</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Q: When is the HPP Mainnet launching?<br> The launch is happening very soon. While we initially targeted Q4, development has moved ahead of schedule. The private mainnet is up and running with select builders. We’re not sharing an exact date to avoid setting unrealistic expectations, but all signs point to a Q3 public&nbsp;launch.</p><p>Q: Will HPP offer grants or early-stage builder incentives?<br> We’re not launching a traditional grants program. Instead, we’re supporting builders through milestone-based assistance. If a project aligns with HPP’s long-term vision (especially in AI and Web3), we’re open to providing structured support. The goal is to back teams that deliver, not just&nbsp;promise.</p><p>Q: Are there any big partnerships coming?<br> Yes, but “partnership” can mean many things. Rather than vague announcements, we encourage more specific questions — are you asking about integrations, infrastructure, exchanges, or something else? We’re engaged in multiple partnership conversations, but we prefer to discuss them in the right&nbsp;context.</p><p>Q: Are DevTools available for developers building on HPP?<br> Yes. You can already access early DevTools on HPP.io, including resources for agent deployment, off-chain reasoning, and microtransaction support. More SDKs and templates are being developed to make HPP more attractive to AI-native builders.</p><p>Q: How will gas fees compare to Polygon or Arbitrum?<br> We’ll provide more details closer to the public launch. Right now, we’re focused on minimizing friction for high-frequency, micro-value transactions between agents. Fee structure comparisons will become more concrete as the network&nbsp;matures.</p><p>Q: What’s happening with Aergo staking? Some users didn’t receive expected rewards.<br> Staking is active, and rewards are being distributed as outlined in the documentation. We encourage everyone to carefully review the staking terms. If expectations weren’t met, it’s often due to a misunderstanding of the reward structure. We’ll share the docs again for&nbsp;clarity.</p><p>Q: Should we be worried about AI taking jobs?<br> Yes, especially if people don’t adapt. AI will reduce the need for human labor in many sectors, including skilled ones. But those who embrace AI tools and integrate them into their work will remain valuable. The best way to stay ahead is to become the AI expert in your field and lead the change rather than resist&nbsp;it.</p><p>Q: How are you already adapting to AI at VaaSBlock and HPP?<br> We’ve moved away from traditional hiring plans. Instead, we operate on a “solutions-first” mindset. For any task or challenge, we ask if AI can solve it before assigning it to a person. When we do bring people in, it’s often for specialized, time-bound work. This has helped us remain lean and adaptable in a rapidly changing environment.</p><p>Q: Final thoughts from this session?<br> HPP is more than a new chain. It’s the infrastructure layer for intelligent, decentralized coordination. From agent-driven services to modular AI tools, we’re building a future where applications don’t just run, they think, reason, and transact in real time. The public mainnet is coming soon, and we can’t wait to see what the community builds&nbsp;next.</p><p>Stay connected:<br> → DevTools &amp; ecosystem: <a href="https://www.hpp.io/">HPP.io</a><br> → Community chat: <a href="https://t.me/aergoofficial">Telegram</a><br> → Real-time updates: <a href="https://x.com/aergo_io">@aergo_io</a></p><p>Let us know your questions for next week.

<p>We’d like to congratulate Alison Mangiero and the Crypto Council for Innovation on a powerful and forward-looking testimony before the House Ways and Means Subcommittee. The hearing, titled “<a href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Mangiero-Testimony.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Making America the Crypto Capital of the World,</a>” spotlighted critical issues surrounding digital asset policy, and we’re proud that SpruceID’s work in privacy-preserving digital identity was highlighted as part of the solution.</p><p>As Alison noted in her remarks, digital assets reshape how we transfer value, access financial services, and verify identity. A key challenge in this transformation is ensuring that digital identity systems are secure, interoperable, and resistant to evolving threats like deepfakes generated by AI. That’s where blockchain-based approaches can play a defining role.</p><blockquote>“Today, for less than $15, artificial intelligence can generate images of people and fake IDs that can fool current identity verification security solutions. But companies, like SpruceID, are working on applications of blockchain and cryptography that have security features that even AI cannot break.” - Alison Mangiero, Crypto Council for Innovation</blockquote> Why Identity Is Core to Crypto <p>At first glance, identity and crypto may seem like separate domains, but they are deeply connected. Blockchain-based systems, by design, enable trust without intermediaries. But to participate in real-world applications, such as opening a financial account, signing a contract, or receiving government benefits, users still need a secure way to prove who they are. Privacy-preserving digital identity provides that missing link.</p><p>Using cryptographic credentials that can be selectively disclosed, individuals can prove facts about themselves (like age or residency) without oversharing personal information. This aligns with the values of the crypto ecosystem, like decentralization, privacy, and user control, while also addressing urgent needs around fraud prevention, compliance, and equitable access.</p> Real-World Deployment at Scale <p>This work is already happening. The California Department of Motor Vehicles has issued over two million mobile driver’s licenses using SpruceID’s technology, enabling residents to prove their identity online with strong privacy protections and safeguards against synthetic fraud. California is also exploring additional ways to unlock new efficiencies in public service delivery.</p> Collaborating on National Standards <p>Beyond state-level innovation, SpruceID is working with the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</a> and the <a href="https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE)</a> to demonstrate how digital credentials, when paired with regulatory clarity from agencies like FinCEN, can streamline Know Your Customer (KYC) checks and improve compliance across the financial sector.</p><p>As digital identity becomes foundational to safe participation in the digital economy, collaboration across public and private sectors will be key.</p> Building the Next Generation of Public Infrastructure <p>SpruceID’s mention in this testimony is just one piece of a much larger effort. We’re especially grateful to the public servants and policymakers working to ensure that digital infrastructure in the U.S. is secure, privacy-preserving, and future-ready.</p> <a href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Mangiero-Testimony.pdf?ref=blog.spruceid.com">Read the Full Testimony</a>  <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

             Thales Alenia Space Italy to build the Multi-Purpose Habitation module for the Moon 
 
 The Multi-Purpose Habitation module is a key building block in the Artemis roadmap for establishing a permanent human presence on the Moon. It will allow astronauts to live on the lunar surface to conduct science experiments and test initial habitability. 
 By combining module design activities with future collaborations leveraging Italy’s technological and manufacturing capabilities, the company will deliver a secure, comfortable and multifunctional habitat module for astronauts, fully compatible with other systems and components. 
 As part of the Italian Space Agency’s program, this contract strengthens the pivotal roles of Thales Alenia Space Italy and Italy in advancing crewed and robotic space exploration on the Moon and beyond. 
 Lunar exploration will benefit from Thales Alenia Space Italy’s cutting-edge technology, expertise and long experience in space exploration, space transportation systems and orbital infrastructures, that could pave the way for future missions to Mars. 
 
<p>Rome, July 25, 2025 – Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), has signed a contract with the Italian Space Agency (ASI) to perform the preliminary design phase, including development of critical enabling technologies, of the pressurized Multi-Purpose Habitation (MPH) module for the lunar surface.&nbsp;</p>
 
    
 
<p>Multi-Purpose Habitation module © Thales Alenia Space_Briot</p>
<p>Planned for launch from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in 2033, the MPH module will be the first ever dedicated habitation asset on the lunar surface as part of the Artemis Accords between NASA and ASI for bilateral Moon cooperation. The MPH module will safely host astronauts during their missions, support surface operations, enable scientific research experiments both with and without the presence of a human crew; and have the capability to move on the surface.</p>
<p>Designed for a minimum operational lifespan of 10 years, the MPH will serve as a permanent surface habitat, capable of operating synergistically with other elements of the Artemis architecture.</p>
 Part rover, part lunar shelter 
<p>Over the course of the two-year contract, Thales Alenia Space Italy will act as overall prime contractor, working alongside Altec (a public-private company owned by Thales Alenia Space and ASI) and other Italian industrial entities, for the MPH preliminary design phase. The initial development will focus on enabling technologies aimed at facing the harsh environmental conditions on the lunar surface, including extreme thermal variations, pervasive lunar dust, high radiation levels, micrometeoroid impacts, and the effects of reduced lunar gravity. In collaboration with the Industrial consortium members and space agencies, the company will lead the development of the MPH module to advance scientific discovery on the Moon, enable sustainable lunar exploration and drive the knowledge and technologies needed to support human missions to Mars.</p>
<blockquote><p>Teodoro Valente, President of the Italian Space Agency, emphasized: "MPH represents yet another scientific challenge for Italy and ASI, which are planning to bring a comfortable and safe human settlement to the lunar surface, thanks to the expertise and high, competitive technological standards that Thales Alenia Space Italy has acquired internationally in the field of space habitability. The future lunar module, the result of the historic relationship between NASA and ASI, is part of a long-term investment vision that Italy has implemented, enabling us to play an increasingly leading role in the new space race and, moreover, to be a fundamental part of the Moon to Mars Strategy of NASA's Artemis program. Today's signature confirms the Italian Government's significant and ongoing commitment to supporting the development of the Space Economy and supporting Italy's globally recognized excellence. Furthermore, it is important that this act comes just days after Parliament's approval of the country's first "Space Law".</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>“We are deeply honored that ASI has entrusted Thales Alenia Space with this contract to develop the MPH, giving us, as a leading European company, the opportunity to drive scientific and technological progress in building the first Italian human outpost on the lunar surface. This milestone will further strengthen and advance human space exploration on the Moon and beyond,” said Giampiero Di Paolo, Deputy CEO and Executive Vice President, Observation, Exploration and Navigation at Thales Alenia Space.</p>

Thu, 07/24/2025 - 18:59


             
 A joint collaboration between France and the UK to map, on a global scale, the sources and sinks of carbon dioxide; the main greenhouse gas caused by human activity. 
 MicroCarb will show how space-based science can improve our understanding of the vital carbon cycle and contribute to informed climate policy decisions to help protect our planet. 
 Thales Alenia Space was responsible for the assembly, integration and testing of the satellite platform as well as launch preparations. 
 
<p>Cannes, July 26, 2025 – The scientific mission MicroCarb, led by the French space Agency CNES, was successfully launched from Europe’s Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana.&nbsp;</p>
 
    
 
<p>MicroCarb © CNES</p>
<p>MicroCarb is a joint mission between the UK Space Agency and French Space Agency, Centre National d’Études Spatiales (CNES), serving as the prime contractor. The mission is co-financed by these two agencies, as well as by the European Commission and the French government within the framework of the Investments for the Future Program (PIA), managed by the National Research Agency (ANR). The satellite is designed to precisely map atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂), capturing detailed data on emissions from human activities as well as absorption by natural sinks such as oceans and forests.</p>
<p>The satellite is built on the CNES Myriade platform. Thales Alenia Space, a joint venture between Thales (67%) and Leonardo (33%), completed the assembly, integration, and testing of the satellite platform at RAL Space in Harwell, UK, and was responsible for launch preparations. Airbus Defence and Space provided the instrument payload, the infrared spectrometer.</p>
<p>MicroCarb will operate in low Earth orbit, at an altitude of 650 km, and serves as a precursor to the European Union’s Copernicus Anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide Monitoring (CO2M) mission – a constellation of three satellites, with payloads supplied by Thales Alenia Space, which will deliver precise measurements for human-induced atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane. MicroCarb complements the CO2M mission by providing early observations and valuable data, enhancing our capability for CO₂ and methane monitoring to inform climate policy makers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, a special city-scanning mode will enable the mapping of CO₂ distribution within urban areas, which are responsible for the majority of global emissions.</p>
<blockquote><p>Richard Thorburn, CEO of Thales Alenia Space in the UK, commented, “I am immensely proud of the contribution our teams in the UK and France have made to MicroCarb - Europe’s pioneering satellite for mapping carbon dioxide on a global scale. Huge thanks to CNES and to the UK Space Agency for the trust they have placed in us, enabling Thales Alenia Space to play a key role in advancing Europe’s leadership in climate monitoring and environmental science, and helping to protect our planet.”<br>

<p>A preview of what’s next, and a few important changes along the&nbsp;way</p><p>Ocean Nodes have come a long way since their launch in August 2024. In less than a year, we’ve seen over 1.71 million nodes deployed across 70+ countries, powered by you, our community. Together, we’ve stress tested the stack, reported bugs, experimented, and helped push the infrastructure forward. This collective effort has laid a strong foundation. Now, it’s time to build on&nbsp;it.</p><p>As we look ahead, it’s time to enter Phase 2, a new chapter that shifts the focus toward GPU-powered compute, performance-based incentives, and a more production-grade environment.</p><p>Here’s what’s changing, and how we’re preparing for what’s&nbsp;next.</p> Phase 1 rewards wrap July&nbsp;31 <p>The Ocean Nodes community has surpassed every expectation. Your contribution has proven that decentralized compute can scale globally. That effort, and your uptime, hasn’t gone unnoticed, as we currently stand at 12.45M ROSE rewards distributed. To make space for the transition into Phase 2, we’ll be ending the current rewards system as of July&nbsp;31.</p><p>Here’s why: the next stage will introduce major infrastructure updates, which require testing and refinement, with bugs and instability expected in the early stages. To keep things fair for everyone and the focus on progress towards the next stage, rewards in their current form will be paused during this time. Read&nbsp;on.</p> ONBs wrap at ONB — Perks&nbsp;ahead <p>We’re also capping Ocean Node Badges (ONBs) at ONB1. The reason is simple: initial participation was beyond projections, with over 1.71M total nodes, and we want to ensure the system remains clear and manageable going&nbsp;forward.</p><p>If you’ve earned ONB1, you’ll receive exclusive benefits in Phase 2. This is our way of recognizing the early builders who helped shape and strengthen the Ocean Nodes&nbsp;network.</p><p>The perks tied to ONB1 will be announced when Phase 2 launches. We’re making sure they’re meaningful, as per&nbsp;usual.</p> Phase 2 begins in September — with adjusted competitive rewards&nbsp;system <p>Ocean Nodes Phase 2 is set to launch in September, with a key focus on GPU-powered compute environments. This will allow for more advanced workloads and real-world AI use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>With this shift, the rewards model will be adjusted. The aim is to better reflect the value that GPU-based nodes bring to the network and to support more demanding jobs such as model training and multi-stage compute workflows.</p><p>More information about the reward structure will be shared at the time of&nbsp;launch.</p> What to expect in Phase&nbsp;2 <p>Phase 2 is all about making Ocean Nodes more powerful, usable, and aligned with real-world compute needs. Here’s a sneak peek at what’s&nbsp;coming:</p>  GPU Support — training, fine-tuning, and heavy workloads  Paid Compute Jobs — flexible pricing based on&nbsp;usage  Upgraded Monitoring System — with benchmark jobs, node history, and detailed performance metrics  Comprehensive dashboard — clearer dashboards and logs so you can see how your node is&nbsp;doing  Node Configurability — choose which features to expose or&nbsp;disable   What’s next <p>August is all about preparing for Phase 2. We’ll be testing the new system, making improvements, and finalizing how the updated rewards system will work. This will be your chance to try out what’s&nbsp;coming.</p><p>We’ll be running benchmark compute jobs on selected GPU-enabled nodes to measure performance. These benchmarks are short, simple jobs, designed to give us insight into how different setups perform. They also help us shape a reward system that’s fair, reliable, and ready for&nbsp;scale.</p> Thanks for Building With&nbsp;Us <p>As we enter this next chapter, we want to acknowledge the effort and energy this community has invested in Ocean Nodes. Phase 1 showed us what’s possible. Phase 2 is about scaling that possibility into a reliable, compute-focused network that serves real-world use&nbsp;cases.</p><p>You’ve helped bring Ocean Nodes this far, and we’re just getting&nbsp;started.</p><p>Keep an eye on our Discord, Twitter, and blog for updates and sneak peeks as we gear up for September.</p><p>Thanks for being here. Let’s keep building!</p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-nodes-update-transitioning-into-phase-2-166604982c2b">Ocean Nodes Update: Transitioning into Phase 2</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>“Much like ‘the cloud’ (really just someone else’s computer) or ‘the superhighway’ (I never have figured that one out), the metaphor of a ‘wallet’ has become a convenient shorthand for a tangle of technical, policy, and usability decisions.” </p>



<p>But as we keep building out digital identity ecosystems, complete with verifiable credentials, identity wallets, and cross-jurisdictional trust models, I want to ask:</p>



<p>Is the metaphor still helping us? Or is it time to kill the wallet?</p>



<p>(Apologies to everyone who suddenly got stuck with a <a href="https://youtu.be/KZTE9MDoaLs?si=L-S2cobw19bAjW60">Bugs Bunny</a> earworm.)</p>

 Why metaphors matter 



<p>Basically, a digital wallet is a secure container for <a href="https://sphericalcowconsulting.com/2025/01/20/digital-credentials-that-can-be-verified-a-lesson-in-terminology/">digital credentials</a>. But metaphors are powerful: They shape user expectations, influence system design, and carry emotional and cultural baggage.</p>



<p>Say “wallet,” and people conjure different things:</p>



 
 A tap-to-pay credit card or mobile payment app 



 A driver’s license or ID holder 



 A catch-all pouch for everything from boarding passes to coffee shop punch cards to loyalty cards 
 



<p>This matters because the assumptions baked into that metaphor directly affect how systems are designed and how people trust (or don’t) them.</p>



 One word, too many meanings 



<p>Consider Google Wallet. It assumes it can store just about anything, provided protocols and formats are supported. Apple Wallet is similarly broad in scope but imposes a more curated, policy-heavy experience; credentials often go through approval workflows, and Apple maintains tight control over what gets displayed.</p>



<p>Then you have purpose-built wallets like the SIROS Foundation’s <a href="https://github.com/wwWallet">wwWallet</a>, which explicitly aim for neutrality and open standards. In that case, “wallet” is just the delivery mechanism: Credentials come from many issuers, and the wallet doesn’t try to second-guess the user’s intent.</p>



<p>So far, so good. But many users still assume they’ll only need one wallet. After all, they only carry one physical one, right?</p>



<p>Well… not exactly.</p>



 Surprise: you’re already carrying multiple wallets 



<p>A growing number of users already interact with multiple wallet-like experiences; they just don’t recognize them as such.</p>



<p>Take a gym app with a scannable membership barcode. That’s not a digital wallet; it’s just displaying an unprotected credential. But a university app that stores a student ID, enables cryptographic access to campus systems, or lets students securely share transcripts? That’s starting to behave like a wallet. These apps issue, hold, and present credentials, but often without using open standards, secure storage mechanisms, or user-centric consent flows. In practice, they’re wallet-adjacent without meeting the formal definitions found in standards like ISO/IEC 18013-5 or NIST guidance.</p>



<p>This distinction matters when issuers or verifiers only trust credentials handled within their own apps. If every organization builds its own closed-loop container, users end up juggling multiple apps that can’t talk to each other. That may be good for organizational control, but it’s bad for user experience, portability, and interoperability.</p>



<p>To make sense of this ambiguity, researchers Lukkiena, de Reuver, and Bharosa offer a <a href="https://proceedings.open.tudelft.nl/DGO2025/article/view/1039/1073">taxonomy of digital wallets</a> that identifies 10 core characteristics across three levels: wallet architecture, functional capabilities, and governance model. (Thanks, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341070789057605633/">Henk Marsman</a>, for pointing me to this article!) For example, wallets can be custodial or self-sovereign, anchored to a specific platform or OS-agnostic, and focused on narrow single-issuer use cases or broader cross-domain ecosystems. Their conclusion? There’s no universal definition of “wallet,” and that’s a problem when different actors use the same word but mean fundamentally different things. When it takes this much effort to explain what we mean by “wallet,” maybe it’s time to admit the metaphor is no longer fit for purpose.</p>



 Who controls permission and consent? 



<p>The wallet metaphor also glosses over deeper architectural questions like who’s in charge of permission and consent.</p>



<p>When you hand someone your physical wallet, no pop-up asks if you’re sure. You’ve already decided what to share. Digital systems, though, are expected to do better. They support selective disclosure (I hope), enforce access policies, and (ideally) prompt you when data is about to be shared.</p>



<p>But when the wallet is mediated by a browser or embedded in a platform you don’t control, who’s responsible for enforcing that consent? The wallet? The issuer? The verifier? The browser? Even people deeply involved don’t agree on the answers here.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/digital-identities-getting-know-verifiable-digital-credential-ecosystem">NIST blog on digital wallets</a> offers a definition, and that definition sets the stage for various assumptions:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“A digital wallet is a native application on your mobile device—though in the future, may also be stored in the cloud—that holds and secures your VDCs… Depending on the entity issuing the VDC, users may need to download a wallet application supported by the credential issuer before a VDC can be issued to their phone.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is useful, but it also normalizes a model where wallets are tied to issuers, not users. If every credential needs its own issuer-approved container, we’re not talking about wallets anymore. We’re talking about app-specific credential lockers. That’s a very different interaction model and one that may undermine user control.</p>



 When regulation and design don’t talk to each other 



<p>In Europe, things get even murkier. The EU’s data protection frameworks (GDPR, eIDAS 2.0) layer in consent requirements that assume a clear user interface and intentional disclosure. A 2023 study published in the Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Technology, however, highlighted just how far the actual UX has drifted from those principles.</p>



<p>In “<a href="https://hal.science/hal-04913768/">Two Worlds Apart! Closing the Gap Between Regulating EU Consent and User Studies</a>,” researchers Bielova, Santos, and Gray examined real consent flows and found a minefield of “dark patterns” and manipulation. Decline buttons are hidden or misleading, options are presented in confusing hierarchies, and “Accept All” is given visual prominence over granular choices.</p>



<p>If we’re now building digital wallets that insert themselves into this consent process, we have to ask: are we replicating these same patterns? Are we genuinely improving user control or just rebranding old manipulations?</p>



 Designing for privacy: lessons from Kantara 



<p>The Kantara Initiative’s <a href="https://kantara.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PEMCP/overview">Privacy-Enhancing Mobile Credentials (PEMC) Implementers Report</a> offers a different and possibly more practical perspective. It doesn’t try to define “wallet” from a metaphorical standpoint. Instead, it focuses on capabilities that put the user back in charge:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The wallet SHALL be designed to facilitate user understanding and control over what data is being shared and for what purpose. User consent SHALL be explicit, contextual, and revocable.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s a higher bar than most current systems hit.</p>



<p>The report also stresses the importance of:</p>



 
 Purpose limitation: credentials should only be used for clearly defined, disclosed functions. 



 Transparency and auditability: users should be able to review where and how credentials have been used. 



 User-managed permissions: ideally, from a central UI that lets users adjust sharing policies without reissuing credentials. 
 



<p>These aren’t just checkboxes for compliance. They’re structural features that define trust. If your “wallet” can’t support these requirements, maybe it shouldn’t call itself one.</p>



 So… do we kill the wallet? 



<p>Maybe. Or maybe we reframe it.</p>



<p>The wallet metaphor has done a lot of work. It helped early adopters wrap their heads around verifiable credentials. It gave vendors a way to pitch new apps without diving into crypto protocols.</p>



<p>But now, it’s showing its limitations.</p>



 
 It implies singularity, when reality demands multiplicity. 



 It collapses trust boundaries, hiding the difference between issuer-owned and user-controlled containers. 



 It blurs accountability, especially when it comes to consent and user agency. 



 And it distracts regulators, who often assume the metaphor aligns with actual practice. 
 



<p>If we’re serious about building systems that scale, interoperate, and respect users, we may need to put the metaphor on pause. Maybe even kill it.</p>



<p>Or at least, give it a long-overdue retirement party.</p>



 Bonus question: Got a better metaphor? 



<p>I’m genuinely curious: What should we call these things? If “wallet” is too narrow, too payment-focused, or just too confusing, what’s the alternative?</p>



<p>Inbox? Locker? Credential safe? Something new entirely? Or is the ambiguity still worthwhile for a reason I’m missing?</p>



<p>Drop me a note. I promise not to brand it.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>00:00:04<br>Welcome to the Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists.</p>



<p>If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>00:00:26<br>Let’s get into it.</p>



 



 Why Do We Call It a Wallet? 



<p>00:00:30<br>So, have you ever stopped to wonder: why do we call it a wallet?</p>



<p>In digital identity, the term wallet has become so common that we don’t even think twice about it—much like the cloud (air quotes intended), which, as we know, is really just someone else’s computer.</p>



<p>The wallet metaphor has served as convenient shorthand. It wraps up a lot of complex technical, policy, and usability decisions into a single image that feels familiar.</p>



<p>But is it still serving us well? Or is it time to—dare we say—kill the wallet?</p>



<p>And yes, if you’re now hearing Elmer Fudd singing “Kill da Wabbit,” you’re not alone. It’s stuck in my head too.</p>



 



 Why Metaphors Matter 



<p>00:01:15<br>Metaphors help make the abstract more tangible. In digital identity, a wallet conjures up something:</p>



 
 Personal 



 Portable 



 Secure 



 That holds important things we don’t want to lose 
 



<p>In theory, a digital wallet does exactly that—a secure container for digital credentials.</p>



<p>00:01:34<br>However, there’s a catch.</p>



<p>Metaphors don’t just explain things—they shape them. They guide system design and influence both user and architect expectations.</p>



<p>And when a metaphor starts to mislead or restrict what’s possible, it’s time to reconsider it.</p>



 



 What Are We Really Talking About? 



<p>00:01:54<br>When we say wallet, what are we actually describing?</p>



<p>Sometimes, we mean a secure application that stores and presents digital credentials. But other times, we’re referring to:</p>



 
 A whole service ecosystem 



 Trust registries 



 Credential exchanges 



 Key management systems 
 



<p>00:02:18<br>This ambiguity creates confusion.</p>



<p>If you imagine a wallet as an app that lives only on your phone, you might not expect it to:</p>



 
 Sync across devices 



 Backup to the cloud 



 Integrate with browsers 
 



<p>So, the metaphor starts to limit understanding rather than enhance it.</p>



 



 Physical Wallets vs. Digital Identity 



<p>00:02:45<br>Think about your real wallet. You might carry:</p>



 
 Credit cards 



 A driver’s license 



 A photo of your dog 



 Maybe some cash (if you’re feeling nostalgic) 
 



<p>But your work ID might live on a badge you scan at the door.<br>Your passport is likely in a drawer.<br>Your vaccine certificate might be in an email or government portal.</p>



<p>00:03:06<br>Each credential lives in a different place and serves a different function. Yet digital credentials are expected to behave as a single type—all handled the same way.</p>



<p>That’s a problem.</p>



<p>The wallet metaphor reinforces the idea that if you control something, you must physically possess it. But that’s not how real life—or digital systems—work.</p>



 



 Delegation and Flexibility 



<p>00:03:32<br>We delegate trust and control all the time.</p>



 
 Browsers remember our passwords 



 Apps access our photos 



 Others pick up prescriptions or check in for us 
 



<p>00:03:44<br>Digital identity must support this same flexibility—not just theoretically, but by design.</p>



<p>If the wallet metaphor implies identity is always something you carry and only you carry, it fails to reflect:</p>



 
 Delegation 



 Guardianship 



 Enterprise-managed credentials 
 



<p>Sometimes, you don’t need to carry the credential—you just need to control access to it.</p>



 



 Trust, Adoption, and Governance 



<p>00:04:12<br>Another problem: the wallet metaphor implies that once you have your credentials, you’re done.</p>



<p>But really, that’s just the beginning.</p>



<p>For a credential to matter:</p>



 
 It must be accepted 



 It must be verifiable 



 It must be trusted 
 



<p>00:04:30<br>This brings us to:</p>



 
 Trust registries 



 Governance frameworks 



 Interoperability standards 
 



<p>None of these live inside the wallet. Yet without them, the wallet is just a lonely app with nowhere to go.</p>



 



 Who Are We Building For? 



<p>00:04:50<br>Are we building for everyday users—or for people like us?</p>



<p>The danger in sticking too closely to the wallet metaphor is that we end up designing for:</p>



 
 Tech-savvy users 



 Privacy-conscious individuals 



 People willing to manage keys and credentials 
 



<p>00:05:08<br>But most users aren’t in that space. They just want things to work.</p>



<p>They want identity to be seamless—not a side project.<br>And they certainly don’t want to be blamed for losing access when their private key is wiped in a phone reset—or dropped in a beer.</p>



 



 Rethinking Security and Usability 



<p>00:05:32<br>We need to stop designing for the metaphor. People aren’t all ready to manage their own cryptographic infrastructure—and that’s okay.</p>



<p>Security isn’t one-size-fits-all. Usability isn’t either.</p>



<p>There are cases where:</p>



 
 Cloud-based key management offers better recovery options 



 Delegation to trusted devices boosts usability 



 Giving users a choice increases adoption 
 



<p>We shouldn’t cling to the idea that the most secure option is always the only secure option.</p>



 



 Do We Kill the Wallet? 



<p>00:06:08<br>Not necessarily.</p>



<p>The wallet metaphor has brought us this far. It’s familiar, useful, and still works in many settings.</p>



<p>But we should be:</p>



 
 More careful in how we use it 



 Clearer about what we mean 



 Open to other metaphors—or better yet, clearer explanations 
 



<p>00:06:30<br>Maybe it’s time for:</p>



 
 Identity lockers 



 Digital toolboxes 



 Credential dashboards 
 



<p>Or maybe it’s time to explain what these systems actually do—without relying on metaphor at all.</p>



 



 Language Matters 



<p>00:06:48<br>The user brings their own context. That’s who we’re building for.</p>



<p>So:</p>



 
 In specs: our language must be crystal clear 



 For users: our explanations must be accurate and inclusive 
 



<p>We may need a whole basket of metaphors, not just one.</p>

<p>Identity providers, like Okta, offer secure, scalable, and developer-friendly tools for implementing authentication. Federated identity allows users to sign in using existing social accounts.</p>

<p>In this article, we’ll walk through how to build a React-based PWA with offline support and integrate it with Google Social Login using Okta. You’ll learn how to deliver a fast, reliable user experience with modern identity features built in. Let’s get started.</p>

<p>What you’ll need</p>

<p>This is a beginner-friendly tutorial, so you’ll mostly need the willingness to learn! However, you’d need access to a few things:</p>
 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download">Node.js</a> and NPM. Any LTS version should be fine, but in this tutorial, I use Node 22 and NPM v10 
   A command terminal 
   Basic JavaScript and TypeScript knowledge 
   An IDE of your choice. I use PHPStorm, but you can use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> or something similar. 
   A <a href="https://console.cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Console Account</a>. You can set up one using your Gmail account. 
 

 Creating an Okta integration 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need an Okta Integrator Free Plan account. To get one, sign up for an <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login">Integrator account</a>. Once you have an account, sign in to your <a href="https://developer.okta.com/login">Integrator account</a>. Next, in the Admin Console:</p>

 
   Go to Applications &gt; Applications 
   Click Create App Integration 
   Select OIDC - OpenID Connect as the sign-in method 
   Select Single-Page Application as the application type, then click Next 
   
    <p>Enter an app integration name</p>
   
   In the Grant type section, ensure that both Authorization Code and Refresh Token are selected 
   Configure the redirect URIs:
     
       Sign-in redirect URIs: <code>http://localhost:5173/login/callback</code> 
       Sign-out redirect URIs: <code>http://localhost:5173</code> 
     
   
   In the Controlled access section, select the appropriate access level 
   Click Save 
 


  Where are my new app's credentials?

<p>Creating an OIDC Single-Page App manually in the Admin Console configures your Okta Org with the application settings.  You may also need to configure trusted origins for <code>http://localhost:5173</code> in Security &gt; API &gt; Trusted Origins.</p>

<p>After creating the app, you can find the configuration details on the app’s General tab:</p>

 
   Client ID: Found in the Client Credentials section 
   Issuer: Found in the Issuer URI field for the authorization server that appears by selecting Security &gt; API from the navigation pane. 
 

   <code>Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-cli-client">Okta CLI Client</a> or <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-powershell-cli">Okta PowerShell Module</a> to automate this process. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/-/create-okta-application/">this guide</a> for more information about setting up your app.</p>



 Create the React app 

<p>We’ll use a Vite template to scaffold the project. The example app for this tutorial is a todo application called “Lister”. To create a React app named “Lister”, run the following command in your terminal to scaffold the project:</p>

   <code>  npm create vite@5.4 lister
</code>   
<p>Select React and TypeScript as the variant.</p>

<p>Follow the instructions after running the command to navigate into your app directory and installing dependencies.</p>

<p>We have extra dependencies to add. Run the following commands in your terminal.</p>

<p>Install React Router by running</p>

   <code>npm install react-router-dom@5.3.4
</code>   

<p>Install React Router types by running</p>

   <code>npm install --save-dev @types/react-router-dom@5.3.3
</code>   

<p>To use Okta authentication with our React app, let’s install the Okta SDKs by running</p>

   <code>npm install @okta/okta-react@6.9.0 @okta/okta-auth-js@7.8.1
</code>   

<blockquote>
  <p>I wrote this post using Vite 5.4, React 18.3, Okta React 6.9, and Okta AuthJS SDK 7.8.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With this, you now have the base React project set up.</p>

 Secure routes in your React app with React Router 

<p>Open the project in your IDE. Let’s navigate to <code>App.tsx</code> and paste in the following code:</p>

   <code>import './App.css';
import { Route, Switch, useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';
import { LoginCallback, Security } from '@okta/okta-react';
import Home from './pages/Home.tsx';

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
   clientId: import.meta.env.VITE_OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
   issuer: `https://${import.meta.env.VITE_OKTA_DOMAIN}`,
   redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback',
   scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email', 'offline_access'],
});

function App() {
   const history = useHistory();
   const restoreOriginalUri = (_oktaAuth: OktaAuth,  originalUri: string) =&gt; {
       history.replace(toRelativeUrl(originalUri || '/', window.location.origin));
   };

   return (
     &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}&gt;
        &lt;Switch&gt;
            &lt;Route path="/login/callback" component={LoginCallback}/&gt;
            &lt;Route path="/" exact component={Home}/&gt;
        &lt;/Switch&gt;
     &lt;/Security&gt;
   );
}

export default App

</code>   

<p>We set up the Okta authentication SDK packages in the <code>App</code> Component. Pay attention to the <code>OktaAuth</code> config:</p>

   <code>const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
   clientId: import.meta.env.VITE_OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
   issuer: `https://${import.meta.env.VITE_OKTA_DOMAIN}`,
   redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback',
   scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email', 'offline_access'],
});
</code>   

<p>If you encounter any issues with the login, a good place to start debugging is from here. We’ll use environment variables to define our OIDC configuration in the app for convenience. In the root of your Lister project, create an <code>.env</code> file and edit it to look like so:</p>

   <code>VITE_OKTA_DOMAIN={yourOktaDomain}
VITE_OKTA_CLIENT_ID={yourOktaClientID}
</code>   

<p>Replace {yourOktaDomain} with your Okta domain for example, <code>dev-123.okta.com</code> or <code>trial-123.okta.com</code>. Note the variable doesn’t include the HTTP protocol. Replace {yourOktaClientID} with the Okta client ID from the Okta application you created.</p>

<p>Before moving forward, let’s set up React Router in our project root. Navigate to <code>src/main.tsx</code> and replace the existing code with the following code snippet:</p>

   <code>import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.tsx'
import './index.css'
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root') as HTMLElement).render(
 &lt;BrowserRouter&gt;
  &lt;App/&gt;
 &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;,
)
</code>   

<p>In the <code>App.tsx</code> earlier, we imported <code>Home</code> from <code>./pages/Home.tsx</code> and used it in our routing. Let’s create the <code>Home</code> component. In the <code>src</code> folder, create a <code>pages</code> folder, and in that, create a <code>Home.tsx</code> file.</p>

   <code>const Home = () =&gt; {
 return (&lt;h2&gt;You are home&lt;/h2&gt;);
}

export default Home;
</code>   

<p>This is a minimal home component that represents our home page.</p>

 Authenticate using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) 

<p>Next, we want to add the ability to sign in and out with our Okta without social login as a starting point. We’ll add the social login connection later.</p>

<p>To do that, we’ll create the <code>SignIn</code> component and a generic <code>Layout</code> component to control user access based on their authentication. Navigate to your <code>src</code> folder, then create a <code>components</code> folder to hold child components.</p>

<p>In the newly created <code>components</code> folder, create the <code>Layout.tsx</code>, <code>Layout.css</code>, and <code>SignIn.tsx</code> files.</p>

<p>Open the <code>Layout.tsx</code> file and add the following code:</p>

   <code>import './Layout.css';
import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";
import SignIn from "./SignIn.tsx";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import logo from '../assets/react.svg';

const Layout = ({children}) =&gt; {
 const { authState, oktaAuth} = useOktaAuth();
 const signout = async () =&gt; await oktaAuth.signOut();

 return authState?.isAuthenticated ? (&lt;&gt;
  &lt;div className="navbar"&gt;
   &lt;Link to="/"&gt;&lt;img src={logo} className="logo" /&gt;&lt;/Link&gt;
   &lt;div className="right"&gt;
    &lt;Link to="/profile"&gt;Profile&lt;/Link&gt;
    &lt;button onClick={signout} className="no-outline"&gt;Sign Out&lt;/button&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div className="layout"&gt;
   {...children}
  &lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/&gt;) : &lt;SignIn/&gt;;
}
export default Layout;
</code>   
<p>This component imports the <code>useOktaAuth</code> from the <code>@okta/okta-react</code> package. This React hook helps us the user’s authenticated state and gives them access to the child components of the <code>Layout</code> component. The hook also lets us sign in or out our users.</p>

<p>At the top of the file, we import <code>Layout.css</code>. Open <code>Layout.css</code> so fill in the CSS we need:</p>

   <code>.layout {
 max-width: 1280px;
 margin: 0 auto;
 padding: 2rem;
 text-align: center;
}

.layout.sign-in {
 margin-top: 35vh;
}

.logo {
 height: 32px;
 will-change: filter;
 transition: filter 300ms;
}

.navbar {
 display: flex;
 justify-content: space-between;
}
</code>   

<p>These minor stylings help the <code>Layout.tsx</code> navbar look proper. Let’s not forget the <code>SignIn</code> component used in the <code>Layout</code> component.</p>

<p>Paste the following code into <code>SignIn.tsx</code>:</p>

   <code>import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";
import logo from '../assets/react.svg';

const SignIn = () =&gt; {
 const { oktaAuth} = useOktaAuth();
 const signin = async () =&gt; await oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect();

 return (
  &lt;div className="sign-in layout"&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt; &lt;img src={logo} className="logo" alt="Logo"/&gt; Lister&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;button className="outlined" onClick={signin}&gt;Sign In&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
 );
}

export default SignIn;
</code>   

<p>Here, we use the same <code>useOktaAuth</code> hook to sign in our user. Lastly, we update <code>src/App.tsx</code> to use our new <code>Layout</code> component. We wrap the Layout component around the routes that require authentication. Your code now looks like this:</p>

   <code>import './App.css';
import { Route, Switch, useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';
import { LoginCallback, Security } from '@okta/okta-react';
import Home from './pages/Home.tsx';
import Profile from './pages/Profile.tsx';
import Layout from "./components/Layout.tsx";


const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
   clientId: import.meta.env.VITE_OKTA_CLIENT_ID,
   issuer: `https://${import.meta.env.VITE_OKTA_DOMAIN}`,
   redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback',
   scopes: ['openid', 'profile', 'email'],
}) ;

function App() {
   const history = useHistory();
   const restoreOriginalUri = (_oktaAuth: OktaAuth,  originalUri: string) =&gt; {
       history.replace(toRelativeUrl(originalUri || '/', window.location.origin));
   };

   return (
     &lt;Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}&gt;
             &lt;Switch&gt;
                 &lt;Route path="/login/callback" component={LoginCallback}/&gt;
                 &lt;Layout&gt;
                     &lt;Route path="/" exact component={Home}/&gt;
                     &lt;Route path="/profile" component={Profile}/&gt;
                 &lt;/Layout&gt;
             &lt;/Switch&gt;
     &lt;/Security&gt;
   );
}

export default App
</code>   

<p>Be careful not to wrap the callback route in the <code>Layout</code> component, or else you’ll experience some weirdness during logins. If you look at the code above, you see we added a route for a profile component. Let’s create that component!</p>

<p>Navigate to <code>src/pages</code> and create the <code>Profile.tsx</code> and <code>Profile.css</code> files. In your <code>Profile.tsx</code> file, paste these in:</p>

   <code>import './Profile.css';
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";
import { IDToken, UserClaims } from "@okta/okta-auth-js";

const Profile= () =&gt; {
 const { authState, oktaAuth} = useOktaAuth();
 const [userInfo, setUserInfo] = useState&lt;UserClaims | null&gt;(null);

 useEffect(() =&gt; {
  if(!authState || !authState.isAuthenticated) setUserInfo(null);
  else setUserInfo((authState.idToken as IDToken).claims);
 }, [authState, oktaAuth]);

 return (userInfo) ? (
  &lt;div&gt;
   &lt;div className="profile"&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;My User Profile (ID Token Claims)&lt;/h1&gt;

    &lt;table&gt;

      const claimName = claimEntry[0];
      const claimValue = claimEntry[1];
      const claimId = `claim-${claimName}`;
      return (
       &lt;tr key={claimName}&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;{claimName}&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td id={claimId}&gt;{claimValue.toString()}&lt;/td&gt;
       &lt;/tr&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
 ) : (&lt;div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Fetching user profile...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;)
};

export default Profile;
</code>   

<p>And in your <code>Profile.css</code> file, add the following styles:</p>

   <code>td, th {
 text-align: left;
 padding: 1px 10px
}

td:first-child, th:first-child {
 border-right: 1px solid #dcdcdc;
}

table {
 max-width: 600px;
}

.profile {
 margin: auto;
}

.profile h1, p {
 text-align: left;
 width: fit-content;
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>Profile</code> component shows you the information in the <code>useOktaAuth</code>. When building your profile page, you will probably use only a handful of that information.</p>

<p>Lastly, paste this helper CSS code into the <code>index.css</code> file in your folder root; it’s just minor styling tweaks to improve your app’s appearance.</p>

   <code>#root {
 font-family: Inter, system-ui, Avenir, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
 line-height: 1.5;
 font-weight: 400;
 font-synthesis: none;

 -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
 -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
}

a, button {

}
a:hover, button:hover {

}

}

button {

}
button.no-outline {

}
button.no-outline:focus, button.no-outline:focus-visible, button.no-outline:hover, button.no-outline:active  {

}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {

   background-color: #ffffff;
 }
 a:hover {
   color: #747bff;
 }
 button {
   background-color: #f9f9f9;
 }
}

</code>   

<p>Run <code>npm run dev</code> in the console. The command serves your app at <code>http://localhost:5173</code> and you should be able to sign in with your Okta account.</p>

<p>With these, all we need to do now is integrate Social Login and then make this app a PWA, both of which are straightforward!</p>

 Federated identity using Social Login 

<p>Social login is an authentication method that allows users to sign into an application using their existing credentials from platforms like Google, Facebook, or Apple. It simplifies the login process, reduces password fatigue, and enhances security by leveraging trusted identity providers. In our case, we are choosing Google as our social login provider.</p>

 Configure Google as an Identity Provider in Okta 

<p>First, we’d need to sign up for Google Workspace and create a Google project. After that, we configure Google as an Identity Provider (IDP). Follow the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/social-login/google/main/">instructions to set up Google for Social Login from Okta Developer documentation</a>.</p>

<p>When you define the OAuth consent screen in Google Cloud, use the following configuration:</p>
 
   Add <code>http://localhost:5173</code> to your authorized JavaScript Origins - this is the test server for our React application. 
   Add <code>/oauth2/v1/authorize/callback</code> to the Authorized redirect urls session. Replace <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> with your actual Okta domain. 
 

<p>When adding the required scopes in Google Cloud, include the <code>./auth/userinfo.email</code>, <code>./auth/userinfo.profile</code>, and the <code>openid</code> scopes.</p>

<p>After setting up Google Cloud, you’ll configure Okta. Use the following values:</p>
 
   Enable automatic account linking to make it easier for users with an Okta account to sign in with Google. 
   Add <a href="https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/security/configure-routing-rules.htm?">routing rules</a> to allow all logins to use Google Social Login. For this tutorial, we’re keeping the routing conditions permissive; however, you should be a lot more stringent on a production application. You can check the routing page to configure routing to fit your use case better. 
 

 Test authenticating with Google Social Login 

<p>If you run <code>npm run dev</code> and click the sign-in button, you should see the “Sign In With Google” button and your usual Okta sign-in / sign-up screen!</p>

 Set up your React app as a PWA 

<p>Lastly, let’s make our app a PWA so we can use it offline. First, we need to add a new dependency. Open the command terminal to the project’s root and run the following command.</p>

   <code>npm install vite-plugin-pwa@1.0.1
</code>   

<p>Next, we update our vite.config.ts in your project root to include PWA configuration and add manifest icons:</p>

   <code>import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import { VitePWA } from "vite-plugin-pwa";

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
const manifestIcons = [
 {
   src: 'pwa-192.png',
   sizes: '192x192',
   type: 'image/png',
 },
 {
   src: 'pwa-512.png',
   sizes: '512x512',
   type: 'image/png',
 }
]
export default defineConfig({
 plugins: [
   react(),
   VitePWA({
     registerType: 'autoUpdate',
     devOptions: {
       enabled: true
     },
     manifest: {
       name: 'Lister',
       short_name: 'lister',
       icons: manifestIcons,
     }
   })
 ],
})
</code>   

<p>You can get cute favicons from an <a href="https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/">icon generator</a> and replace the <code>manifestIcons</code> source images with those. You can also look at the <a href="https://vite-pwa-org.netlify.app/guide/">Vite PWA documentation</a> to better understand each option’s meaning and how to use it.</p>

<p>With these changes, end your current npm script and run <code>npm run dev</code> again; everything should be peachy. Now we have an app with Social Login capabilities.</p>

<p>Since this application is a todo list application, let’s add the todo list feature. Since our app is a PWA, our users should be able to use the application even when offline. To make the data accessible offline, we can store it locally on the client using browser storage and then sync the data with our servers using service workers (let us know if you want to see a tutorial using service workers).</p>

 Build a secure todo list React PWA 

<p>Since we will persist the todo list data, creating a model is a good idea. This model serves as a layer of abstraction over the DB calls. In this section, we’ll save the data to local storage; in the future, we may want to switch to another technology. A model helps us make this change in the implementation without changing code when consuming the model. Now let’s create the model: navigate to the <code>src</code> folder and create a folder named <code>models</code>. In that folder, create a <code>Task.model.ts</code>. We’ll call each item in the todo list a task.
The task model file should look like this:</p>

   <code>export interface Task {
 name: string;
 description: string;
 done: boolean;
}

const key = 'lister-tasks';

export default {
 addTask: (task: Task) =&gt; {
  const currentTasksJSON = localStorage.getItem(key);
  if (!currentTasksJSON) {
   localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify([task]));
   return;
  }
  const currentTasks = JSON.parse(currentTasksJSON);
  currentTasks.push(task);
  localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(currentTasks));
 },

 all: (): Task[] =&gt; {
  const currentTasksJSON = localStorage.getItem(key);
  if (!currentTasksJSON) return [];
  return JSON.parse(currentTasksJSON);
 },

 save: (tasks: Task[]) =&gt; localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(tasks)),
}
</code>   

<p>The model is a small wrapper over <code>LocalStorage</code>. The first part of the model defines the Task interface – all we need for a task is its name, description, and done state. The key variable is the <code>localStorage</code> item name; I chose to use <code>lister-tasks</code> for mine.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Remember, don’t store sensitive user data (e.g., passwords) on the client side but on a secure server!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next up, we update the home page at <code>src/pages/Home.tsx</code> to look like this:</p>

   <code>import './Home.css';
import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import TaskModel, { Task } from "../models/Task.model.ts";

const EMPTY_TASK: Task = { name: "", description: "", done: false } as const;
const Home = () =&gt; {
  const [tasks, setTasks] = useState&lt;Task[]&gt;(TaskModel.all().reverse());
  const [addMode, setAddMode] = useState(false);
  const [form, setForm] = useState&lt;Task&gt;(EMPTY_TASK);
  const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState&lt;boolean[]&gt;(new Array(tasks.length).fill(false));
  useEffect(() =&gt; TaskModel.save(tasks), [tasks]);

  const toggleTask = (id: number) =&gt; {
    const _tasks = [...tasks];
    _tasks[id].done = !_tasks[id].done;
    setTasks(_tasks);
  }
  
  const addNewTask = (e: Event) =&gt; {
    e.preventDefault();
    setExpanded(new Array(tasks.length + 1).fill(false));
    setTasks([...tasks, form]);
    setForm(EMPTY_TASK);
    setAddMode(!addMode);
  }


  const toggleExpansion = (id: number) =&gt; {
    const _expanded = [...expanded];
    _expanded[id] = !_expanded[id];
    setExpanded(_expanded);
  }


  return (&lt;&gt;
    &lt;h2 className="tab-heading"&gt;
    &lt;button className={`no-outline ${!addMode &amp;&amp; 'active'}`}
        onClick={() =&gt; setAddMode(false)}&gt;Task List
    &lt;/button&gt;


    &lt;button className={`no-outline ${addMode &amp;&amp; 'active'}`} onClick={() =&gt; setAddMode(true)}&gt;New
      Task +
    &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    {addMode &amp;&amp; &lt;form className="tab" action="#" onSubmit={addNewTask}&gt;
    &lt;div className="form-fields"&gt;
      &lt;div className="form-group"&gt;
      &lt;label htmlFor="name"&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;input type="text" name="name" id="name" placeholder="Task name"
          onChange={(e) =&gt; setForm({...form, name: e.target.value})} required/&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div className="form-group full"&gt;
      &lt;label htmlFor="description"&gt;Description&lt;/label&gt;
      &lt;textarea rows="5" maxLength="800"
            onChange={(e) =&gt; setForm({...form, description: e.target.value})}
            className="form-control" name="description"
            id="description" placeholder="describe the task..."&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div className="form-group"&gt;
      &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;}
    {!addMode &amp;&amp; &lt;ul className="tab task-list"&gt;
    {tasks.map((task, idx) =&gt;
      &lt;li key={idx} className={`${task.done &amp;&amp; 'done'}`}&gt;
      &lt;div className="title-card"&gt;
        &lt;input type="checkbox" name={'task' + idx} checked={task.done}
            onChange={() =&gt; toggleTask(idx)}/&gt;
        &lt;p className="name"&gt;{task.name}&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p className="expand" onClick={() =&gt; toggleExpansion(idx)}&gt;&amp;#9660;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      {expanded[idx] &amp;&amp; &lt;p className="description"&gt;{task.description}&lt;/p&gt;}
      &lt;/li&gt;)}
    &lt;/ul&gt;}
  &lt;/&gt;);
}

export default Home;

</code>   

<p>The first three lines of the code are the necessary imports. Next, we create a default empty task. The rest of the component is a basic CRUD page, with the required state for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks. I used a <code>useEffect</code> hook to save the tasks to local storage whenever they change. If you look at the component, a <code>Home.css</code> import is at the top. Let’s create that file in the same directory and paste these into the content:</p>

   <code>.form-fields {
 display: flex;
 justify-content: space-between;
 flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.form-group{

}

.form-fields .form-group{

 flex-direction: column;
}

.form-group.check-group {

</code>   

<p>The above are helper styles. I used a tabular design for the todo list component so CRUD can be on the same page without using modal popups. Once all the files are in place, you’ll see the Todo List home page when you log in with Okta.</p>

<p>Once you have all the required manifest icons in your project, when you serve the app, you’ll see a prompt in the browser to install it on your machine! If you don’t want to create icons, use <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/okta-react-pwa-example">the ones in the sample repo</a>.</p>

 Authenticate with Social Login from a React PWA 

<p>Great job making it this far! Along the way, we’ve explored how social login works with Okta and Google and how to set up a basic PWA using React, Vite, and the Vite PWA plugin. As a bonus, we now have a handy little todo list app to help keep our day on track!</p>

<p>Of course, a production-ready application would involve more advanced service worker configurations and a proper database setup, but our current implementation is adequate for an introduction.
Now it’s your turn to have fun: open the app in your browser, try signing in with Okta or Google, and test the install prompt to see how smoothly it runs as a standalone app. Happy coding!</p>

 Insurance brand differentiation through PaaS&nbsp; 



<p>There’s a new way to stand out in the insurance industry, and it’s not about offering lower premiums or faster claims. It’s about privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Consumer expectations are shifting, and Privacy as a Service (PaaS) is emerging as a powerful differentiator for insurers seeking to lead in trust, security, and digital experience. This is your opportunity to move beyond compliance and build tangible brand equity through privacy.&nbsp;</p>



 The Rise of Privacy for the Everyday Consumer&nbsp; 



<p>In today’s hyper-digital world, privacy has gone from a background concern to a front-page priority. According to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/10/18/how-americans-view-data-privacy/#:~:text=In%20an%20era%20where%20every,May%2015%2D21%2C%202023.&amp;text=Americans%20%E2%80%93%20particularly%20Republicans%20%E2%80%93%20have%20grown,and%20the%20government%20(79%25).">Pew Research</a>, 67% of Americans say they understand little to nothing about what companies do with their data, up from 59% in previous years. Most also feel they have little or no control over how businesses or government agencies use their data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where Privacy as a Service (PaaS) becomes a critical advantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>PaaS offers insurers a strategic way to embed privacy tools into their offerings from encrypted messaging and masked contact details to user-controlled data sharing and real-time breach monitoring.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What privacy as a service looks like&nbsp; 



<p>Privacy as a Service isn’t theoretical. It’s a growing suite of tools insurers can implement today, either through white-labeled apps or integration with their existing digital platforms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These include:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Private communication channels (e.g., encrypted messaging)&nbsp;<br> 



 Virtual cards for secure payments or online purchases&nbsp;<br> 



 Digital wallets that store only necessary credentials&nbsp;<br> 



 User-controlled identity and data-sharing preferences&nbsp;<br> 



 Real-time alerts and monitoring for data breaches, leaks, or misuse&nbsp;<br> 
 



<p></p>



<p>Together, these tools help protect against fraud, phishing, impersonation, and unauthorized data sharing, all while building policyholder confidence.&nbsp;</p>



 What specific PaaS solutions are available?&nbsp; 



<p>Several technology providers now offer turnkey or customizable privacy-as-a-service toolkits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example:&nbsp;</p>



 
 <a href="https://anonyome.com/businesses/digital-identity-protection/">Anonyome Labs provides</a> secure communication tools (like virtual phone numbers and masked emails), identity protection, digital wallets, and breach monitoring.&nbsp;<br> 



 Jumio and Okta offer identity verification and access management solutions that support consumer-controlled credentialing.&nbsp;<br> 



 <a href="https://thetechpencil.com/how-googles-2025-tracking-policy-impacts-iphones-and-apple-s-ecosystem-38c168a1b5d7">Apple’s Private Relay</a> and others are shifting expectations for how personal data should be handled in digital experiences, further reinforcing the importance of privacy-centric offerings.&nbsp;<br> 
 



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Insurers can choose to license these features or integrate them into native apps for a seamless user experience.&nbsp;</p>



 How to effectively communicate the value of privacy tools 



<p>Implementing PaaS is only half the equation. Insurers must clearly articulate why it matters to customers. Here’s how:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Lead with control: Emphasize how customers can manage what they share and with whom they share it.&nbsp; 



 Show real-world benefits: Frame privacy tools as ways to reduce fraud, protect families, and save money, not just as technical features. 



 Promote peace of mind: Position your brand as one that safeguards people, not just policies.&nbsp;<br> 
 



<p>Messaging should appear across onboarding flows, app experiences, marketing campaigns, and customer support channels.&nbsp;</p>



 Differentiation in a crowded market&nbsp; 



<p>With so many insurance products becoming commoditized, Privacy as a Service provides a new lever for differentiation. It aligns with what modern consumers care about: safety, autonomy, and digital integrity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a space where brand loyalty is tied to values and experience, offering built-in privacy sends a powerful message you don’t just insure people. You protect them holistically.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ready to offer privacy as a Service?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs helps insurers integrate turnkey privacy solutions into their digital experiences. <a href="https://anonyome.com/contact/#contact-form">Request a demo</a> to discover how you can leverage privacy as your next competitive advantage.&nbsp;<br><br></p>

<p>Monzo Fined £21.1 Million for Failing to Prevent Financial Crime During Rapid Growth</p>



<p>The U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has fined Monzo Bank £21.1 million (approximately $28.6 million) for failing to maintain adequate systems to prevent financial crime between 2018 and 2022. The FCA cited poor due diligence practices that allowed high-risk customers to open accounts using implausible addresses like Buckingham Palace, and noted that Monzo failed to address compliance issues even after regulatory warnings. The digital bank’s rapid growth outpaced its onboarding controls, with over 34,000 high-risk accounts potentially added after a 2020 review. Monzo acknowledged the shortcomings, stating the issues are historical and have since been addressed. <a href="https://www.dowjones.com/professional/risk/resources/risk-blog/u-k-s-monzo-bank-hit-with-28-6-million-fine?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9Yg1KyuAixUNqZYjsp2xAlQEnvcbY4PqV0rRwiaUVIK-Y6Ybc5Nl5D-BNDY5f65Mjvbzcf">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Barclays Fined £42 Million for AML Failures in WealthTek and Stunt &amp; Co Cases</p>



<p>The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has fined Barclays Bank UK and Barclays Bank a total of £42 million for significant lapses in managing financial crime risks linked to two separate cases involving WealthTek and Stunt &amp; Co. Barclays Bank UK failed to verify WealthTek’s authorisation before opening a client money account, risking misappropriation of £34 million, and has pledged £6.3 million in voluntary payments to impacted clients. Separately, Barclays Bank did not properly assess or monitor risks tied to bullion firm Stunt &amp; Co, which was linked to a broader money laundering scheme involving £46.8 million. Despite law enforcement warnings, the bank did not reassess the relationship. The FCA acknowledged Barclays’ cooperation and ongoing efforts to improve its anti-money laundering controls. <a href="https://www.banking-gateway.com/news/uk-fca-imposes-42m-fine-on-barclays-over-financial-crime-risk-failures/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9Yg1KyuAixUNqZYjsp2xAlQEnvcbY4PqV0rRwiaUVIK-Y6Ybc5Nl5D-BNDY5f65Mjvbzcf">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Zuckerberg to Testify in $8 Billion Shareholder Trial Over Facebook’s Privacy Failures and 2012 FTC Violation</p>



<p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is set to testify in a shareholder-led $8 billion trial alleging that he and other executives allowed Facebook to operate in violation of a 2012 FTC agreement protecting user privacy. The case stems from the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal, which exposed how millions of users’ data were misused, leading to significant financial penalties for Meta, including a $5 billion FTC fine. Shareholders seek reimbursement from Zuckerberg and other former leaders, including Sheryl Sandberg and Marc Andreessen. The Delaware trial, starting this week, will scrutinize past board actions and Meta’s data governance during a period of growing privacy scrutiny. <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-investors-zuckerberg-square-off-100345201.html?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--FrdvqMjQyjjpGxHwDThlwk8zkzpz8IYONEmwrrHpmiO1wW7lGhnbFkd6hXzRV97DDy7zn">(Source)</a></p>

<p>The cloud is here, and it’s thriving, but so is enterprise software. While the industry buzzes with the promise of SaaS-first strategies and fully cloud-native ecosystems, a powerful truth remains: not all businesses can or should go all-in on the cloud. And that’s perfectly okay.</p>

<p>We often talk about digital identity as if it’s a universal construct, something that can be standardized, serialized, and slotted into global frameworks. But identity is as cultural as it is technical. And when we ignore that, we risk building trust frameworks that work beautifully on paper and fail spectacularly in practice.</p>



 Identity isn’t one thing 



<p>Digital identity systems often bundle together multiple assumptions: that identity is persistent, singular, owned by the individual, and useful primarily for authorization or reputation. But those assumptions aren’t global truths—they’re artefacts of particular social and cultural histories.</p>



<p>(I had fun researching this post; I wanted to make sure that my anecdotal experience was backed up by people who did proper research. I could do this kind of thing ALL DAY. But I digress…)</p>



<p>In a comparative study of users in Central/Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0165551519879702">Katalin Feher</a> found striking differences in how people conceive of and manage their digital selves. For many Southeast Asian users, their “digital identity” is framed in terms of accounts, i.e., external tools for managing reputation. It’s something outside themselves, instrumental and pragmatic. For Central and Eastern European users, the self–account divide is blurrier; the digital footprint is seen as a real extension of personal identity, warranting careful curation and self-expression. (This paper is not freely available; I purchased a copy.)</p>



<p>Neither is wrong. Each leads to different expectations about how identity systems should behave and who should control them.</p>



 System design reflects cultural norms 



<p>This isn’t just about user attitudes. Cultural values shape system design too. Western identity architectures often assume:</p>



 
 Ownership and individualism – the user holds and controls their identity; 



 Transparency and audit – data trails should be visible and attributable; 



 Consent as the primary safeguard – once informed, the user is responsible. 
 



<p>These align well with societies that prioritize personal autonomy. But in more collectivist or hierarchical cultures, trust may flow through institutions or communities rather than individuals. Reputation may be managed through social harmony, not audit logs. And consent may be implicit, situated, or shaped by expectations of familial or societal duty.</p>



<p>Trying to implement a one-size-fits-all identity system on top of that diversity? That’s how you end up with systems people don’t trust, don’t use, or work around.</p>



<p>One of the biggest hurdles to designing identity standards that reflect cultural diversity is that the standards development community itself isn’t particularly diverse. Let’s look at the IETF as an example, since they publish easily accessible demographic information. According to the <a href="https://www.ietf.org/blog/ietf-community-survey-2023/">2023 IETF community survey</a>, nearly 80% of participants came from North America or Europe, and 85% identified as men. Most respondents spoke fluent English—the only language used for meetings, mailing lists, and documents. That streamlines coordination but inevitably filters out who can easily participate. When standards bodies fail to include regional, linguistic, and gender diversity, they naturally produce results that reflect the norms and assumptions of those already at the table.</p>



 When assumptions don’t translate: cultural mismatch in identity systems 



<p>We’ve seen identity systems built around one cultural model fall short when deployed in another. Sometimes, the mismatch causes friction; other times, it leads to outright rejection.</p>



<p>Take digital wallets built around the idea of individual ownership. In many Western contexts, this makes perfect sense: Users expect to control their credentials on personal devices. But in parts of Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, phones are often shared among family members or even communities. Identity systems that assume one person per device can break down quickly in these environments, creating exclusion where access was the goal.</p>



<p>Or consider face recognition. In the U.S. and Europe, it has sparked privacy concerns, but it still sees widespread deployment. In parts of the world where historical surveillance or ethnic targeting is fresh in public memory, even a technically secure facial recognition tool can feel untrustworthy. The issue isn’t the technology, it’s the cultural resonance of how people use the technology.</p>



<p>Then there’s the matter of naming. Systems that require a first and last name in Latin script are common, but not universally applicable. Cultures with patronymics, single names, or character-based scripts often find their identities shoehorned into forms they didn’t design and can’t fully control.</p>



<p>These aren’t just edge cases. They’re warning signs. When we treat digital identity as a neutral infrastructure, we miss the social and cultural weight it carries. And that weight can’t be standardized away.</p>



 We need regionally adaptable trust frameworks 



<p>If we want digital identity to serve people globally, we need frameworks that can flex to local norms while maintaining interoperability. That doesn’t mean abandoning global standards; it means decoupling the mechanism from the assumption set.</p>



<p>A few ideas worth exploring:</p>



 
 Modular trust anchors – Let different regions define who or what counts as a trustworthy issuer. 



 Flexible disclosure models – Don’t assume every system must default to maximum transparency. 



 Interoperable semantics, adaptable governance – Let credential formats be standardized, but leave room for local rules around their issuance and use. 
 



<p>The Levin &amp; Mamlok paper, “<a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/info12020068">Culture and Society in the Digital Age</a>,” warns of a creeping homogenization of experience as digital systems encode particular ways of being into their logic. If we’re not careful, we’ll reproduce the same flattening in digital identity where diversity becomes a bug, not a feature.</p>



 Identity is local. Interop is global. 



<p>We’re building the infrastructure of digital personhood. That’s no small task. But if we want that infrastructure to support real people, not just tidy models, we have to let it speak in more than one voice.</p>



<p>That means more than just designing flexible architectures. It means actively bringing more voices into the rooms where those architectures are shaped. If cultural norms differ (and they do), then we need people who live those differences to help define what trustworthy, usable, and empowering identity systems look like. Otherwise, we risk exporting assumptions, not standards.</p>



<p>Trust doesn’t scale unless it can adapt. And adaptation doesn’t happen without inclusion.</p>

 Transcript 



<p>[00:00:00]<br>Welcome to The Digital Identity Digest, the audio companion to the blog at Spherical Cow Consulting. I’m Heather Flanagan, and every week I break down interesting topics in the field of digital identity—from credentials and standards to browser weirdness and policy twists.</p>



<p>If you work with digital identity but don’t have time to follow every specification or hype cycle, you’re in the right place.</p>



<p>[00:00:26]<br>Let’s get into it.</p>



 



 What Is Digital Identity, Really? 



 



<p>[00:00:29]<br>Hi there, and welcome back to The Digital Identity Digest. In today’s episode, I want to ask you a simple but profound question:</p>



<p>[00:00:35]<br>What comes to mind when you hear the term digital identity?<br>Do you think of:</p>



 
 Biometrics? 



 Login credentials? 



 A string of JSON? 



 Your social media handle? 
 



<p>[00:00:46]<br>The answer likely depends on several factors:</p>



 
 Where you’re from 



 How old you are 



 How tech-savvy you feel 
 



<p>[00:00:52]<br>Cultural context plays a big role here.</p>



<p>[00:00:57]<br>We often talk about digital identity like it’s universal—something we can standardize, serialize, and fit into tidy global frameworks.</p>



<p>[00:01:08]<br>But identity is as cultural as it is technical. Ignoring that can lead to trust frameworks that look great on paper but fail in practice—especially when so-called edge cases were never edge at all.</p>



 



 Unpacking Assumptions About Identity 



 



<p>[00:01:23]<br>Let’s start with a key reminder: identity isn’t one thing.</p>



<p>[00:01:26]<br>Most digital identity systems are based on a set of unspoken assumptions:</p>



 
 Identity is persistent 



 It’s singular 



 It’s controlled by the individual 



 It exists mainly for authorization or reputation 
 



<p>[00:01:42]<br>But none of these are universal truths—they are cultural artifacts. They reflect the norms of specific regions, especially the US and Europe, where many of these systems originated.</p>



<p>[00:01:54]<br>I’ve seen these cultural assumptions in standards work and tech deployments. But I wanted to back that up with research—not just anecdotes.</p>



 



 Meet the Research: Catalyn Fair 



 



<p>[00:02:07]<br>Enter Catalyn Fair (and fingers crossed I’m pronouncing that correctly).</p>



<p>[00:02:12]<br>Fair conducted a comparative study of digital identity and online self-management, focusing on Central and Eastern Europe vs. Southeast Asia.</p>



<p>[00:02:23]<br>The study included:</p>



 
 60 in-depth interviews 



 Equal focus on students and business leaders 



 Solid, qualitative insights 
 



<p>[00:02:33]<br>What she found wasn’t subtle.</p>



<p>[00:02:33]<br>In Southeast Asia, digital identity is often seen as external—a tool for:</p>



 
 Managing reputation 



 Accessing services 
 



<p>It’s instrumental, not personal.</p>



<p>[00:02:49]<br>But in Central and Eastern Europe, identity is seen as deeply connected to the self.<br>Your digital presence isn’t just metadata—it’s:</p>



 
 An extension of who you are 



 Something you curate and express 



 Part of your personal narrative 
 



<p>[00:03:05]<br>Neither model is better. But each one shapes user expectations—and design choices.</p>



 



 Design Reflects Culture, Too 



 



<p>[00:03:17]<br>Cultural values don’t just affect users—they show up in system architecture.</p>



<p>[00:03:23]<br>Western identity models often assume:</p>



 
 The individual owns and controls their identity 



 Transparency is inherently good 



 Informed consent makes systems trustworthy 
 



<p>[00:03:43]<br>These assumptions work well in societies that value personal autonomy and individual accountability.</p>



<p>[00:03:54]<br>But in collectivist or hierarchical cultures, trust flows differently:</p>



 
 Through institutions or family 



 Reputation relies on social harmony 



 Consent may be implicit or relational 
 



<p>[00:04:16]<br>So when a single identity model is deployed globally, friction is inevitable.</p>



 



 Who’s in the Room? 



 



<p>[00:04:31]<br>Let’s talk about the people building these systems.</p>



<p>[00:04:35]<br>One challenge is that standards development communities lack diversity.</p>



<p>[00:04:46]<br>Take the IETF—the Internet Engineering Task Force:</p>



 
 In 2023, ~80% of participants were from North America or Europe 



 85% identified as male 



 Most were fluent in English (the sole language used in IETF spaces) 
 



<p>[00:05:17]<br>This streamlines communication—but filters out valuable perspectives.</p>



<p>[00:05:29]<br>So even well-meaning people design standards based on their own assumptions.</p>



<p>[00:05:34]<br>We’ve seen how badly that can go.</p>



 



 Real-World Design Conflicts 



 



<p>[00:05:45]<br>Let’s take a closer look at where systems break.</p>



<p>[00:05:50]<br>Digital wallets in the West:</p>



 
 Built around individual control 



 One person, one device 
 



<p>[00:06:00]<br>But in parts of Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa:</p>



 
 Phones are shared across families and communities 



 Exclusive smartphone access isn’t guaranteed 
 



<p>[00:06:09]<br>If your system assumes one phone per person—it fails immediately.</p>



<p>[00:06:23]<br>Facial recognition sparks privacy debates in the US and Europe.<br>But in regions with a history of surveillance or ethnic targeting, it’s actively distrusted, regardless of technical safeguards.</p>



<p>[00:06:55]<br>Then there’s the perennial issue of naming.</p>



<p>[00:06:59]<br>Many systems require:</p>



 
 First and last names 



 In Latin characters 
 



<p>[00:07:08]<br>But that’s not globally applicable. Consider:</p>



 
 Cultures with single names 



 Languages using non-Latin scripts 



 Regions where names reflect lineage or patronymics 
 



<p>[00:07:17]<br>Forcing conformity erases identity and damages trust.</p>



 



 Designing for Cultural Flexibility 



 



<p>[00:07:50]<br>So—what do we do about all this?</p>



<p>[00:07:51]<br>We need regionally adaptable trust frameworks—systems that flex to local norms while preserving interoperability.</p>



<p>[00:07:59]<br>That doesn’t mean abandoning global standards.<br>It means designing with flexibility.</p>



<p>[00:08:11]<br>What might that look like?</p>



 
 Modular trust anchors<br>Let regions define trusted issuers—whether they’re governments, nonprofits, or private entities. 



 Flexible disclosure<br>Enable minimal, selective proof. Don’t force full data dumps for basic verification. 



 Standardized semantics + localized governance<br>Agree on technical formats, but allow cultural variation in credential rules, issuers, and legal weight. 
 



<p>[00:08:58]<br>These aren’t just ideas—they’re already being explored in:</p>



 
 Decentralized identity 



 Verifiable credentials 



 Wallet interoperability 
 



<p>But they need cultural awareness to succeed.</p>



 



 Digital Identity as Cultural Infrastructure 



 



<p>[00:09:12]<br>A great paper by Levin and Mamlock—Culture and Society in the Digital Age—makes an important point:</p>



<p>[00:09:27]<br>Digital systems don’t just provide tools.<br>They encode worldviews.</p>



<p>[00:09:34]<br>Without care, we end up with flattened experiences—forcing everyone into one digital model.</p>



<p>[00:09:43]<br>If diversity becomes a bug to work around, instead of a feature, we’re building the wrong world.</p>



<p>[00:09:53]<br>We are designing the infrastructure of digital personhood.</p>



<p>[00:09:58]<br>If that’s going to support real people—not just tidy models—we need systems that speak in more than one voice.</p>



<p>[00:10:06]<br>And that means more than just flexible tech.</p>



<p>We need:</p>



 
 Broader participation 



 Cultural representation 



 Inclusion at the table 
 



<p>[00:10:24]<br>Otherwise, we’re not building local systems—we’re exporting our assumptions.</p>



<p>[00:10:30]<br>And without cultural adaptation, trust doesn’t scale.</p>



<p>[00:10:39]<br>Something to think about.</p>

<p>Here are the main industry highlights of this week impacting identity and fraud, cybersecurity, trust and safety, financial crimes compliance, and privacy and consent management.</p>



 







 



 🪄Innovation and New Technology Developments 



 



<p>Italy Modernizes Civil Services and Digital Wallet with National Integration and Offline Access</p>



<p>Italy is advancing its digital identity infrastructure with significant updates to its national digital services. Over 700 municipalities have joined the centralized National Archive of Civil Status (ANSC), replacing paper-based record-keeping with a unified digital platform for civil documents. Synchronization with the National Registry of the Resident Population ensures data accuracy and streamlines administrative workflows. Concurrently, Italy’s “IO” app now supports offline access to its digital wallet, allowing users to retrieve essential documents like driving licenses and health cards without an internet connection. With nearly 90 million digital identities issued and robust growth in digital document adoption, Italy is ahead of its National Recovery and Resilience Plan targets. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202507/italy-gets-offline-digital-wallet-access-as-country-advances-digitalization?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--EhejpP-DJoIdVyFYvvhEYiEQmuuoHZ_inGkXjP6sExOWjy_d6qBqBlDxxMAiUQOh__a6m">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>African Nations Advance Digital Identity and Governance to Promote Security and Inclusion</p>



<p>Nigeria, Somalia, South Africa, and Eswatini are advancing digital identity and governance initiatives as part of broader digital transformation efforts across Africa. Nigeria is using biometrics and digital wallets to distribute aid more efficiently and securely, aiming to curb corruption and preserve recipients’ dignity. Somalia has implemented a U.S.-developed biometric border control system to enhance national security. Meanwhile, South Africa and Eswatini signed a digital cooperation agreement to harmonize ICT policies, expand digital literacy, and collaborate on emerging technologies. These efforts highlight the continent’s growing emphasis on secure, inclusive digital infrastructure. <a href="https://coingeek.com/nigeria-somalia-south-africa-eswatini-advance-digital-id-plans/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-87Rsozl63vNzLLjQA7ctkZbywkY0hR9qCl-OlvF4cgTwV1bySN4mO4sDRnETAyaMoke1vL">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Anonybit and SmartUp Launch Decentralized Biometric Identity Solution for Enterprise AI Agents</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/anonybit/">Anonybit</a> has partnered with AI-native no-code platform @SmartUp to launch a privacy-preserving digital identity solution for AI agents, aimed at enhancing trust and accountability in agent-driven enterprise workflows. The solution leverages Anonybit’s decentralized biometric cloud and token management system to securely authenticate users and authorize actions through identity-bound agents. Supporting multiple biometric modalities, the system ensures compliance, data residency, and quantum-resistant security without centralized data storage. This partnership enables practical deployment of agentic automation in areas like payments and supply chain management, addressing rising concerns around identity and fraud in AI-driven processes. <a href="https://finovate.com/anonybit-partners-with-smartup-to-introduce-digital-identity-solution-for-ai-agents/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-87Rsozl63vNzLLjQA7ctkZbywkY0hR9qCl-OlvF4cgTwV1bySN4mO4sDRnETAyaMoke1vL">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>South Africa Launches Upgraded Identity Verification System With Faster, More Reliable Access to NPR</p>



<p>South Africa’s Department of Home Affairs has launched an upgraded identity verification platform that allows both government and private sector entities to verify identities against the National Population Register (NPR). Previously plagued by high failure rates due to underinvestment, the new system now handles over 180,000 daily transactions with minimal error and sub-second response times. The justice sector and several private users have already transitioned, benefiting from improved reliability and efficiency. While some users were unprepared for the switch despite prior consultations, the Department is offering a grace period until October to optimize usage and reduce costs, crediting back overpayments based on off-peak verification adjustments. <a href="https://techafricanews.com/2025/07/07/south-africa-modernises-identity-verification-tackles-system-failures-with-new-platform/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9AcPmS6M7PouHHT7-YBBPeS9LeulsWJ5XjCam_W1Tjye7ZIC51VltsRjatJxvGMZtzc_jS">(Source)</a></p>

<p>Indian Gig Platforms Push for Aadhaar-Based ID Verification to Curb Fraud and Simplify Onboarding</p>



<p>Indian gig-economy startups in sectors like food delivery, ecommerce, and ride-hailing are seeking government approval to use Aadhaar-based identity verification to address fraud and streamline worker onboarding. The Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) has restricted unauthorized use of Aadhaar services, pushing firms to obtain formal permission for legitimate access.

<p>Germany Urges Apple and Google to Remove DeepSeek Over GDPR Violations and Data Transfers to China</p>



<p>Germany’s data protection authority has requested Apple and Google to block the Chinese chatbot app DeepSeek from their app stores, citing unlawful data transfers to China and violations of GDPR. The Berlin Data Protection Commissioner argued that DeepSeek fails to provide adequate safeguards for user data, especially given Chinese authorities’ extensive access rights. The app had already been banned in Italy earlier this year for similar concerns, and investigations are ongoing in several other EU countries. Despite a recent privacy policy update, DeepSeek remains under scrutiny for opaque data retention practices and lack of user protections equivalent to those in the EU. <a href="https://www.techradar.com/computing/cyber-security/deepseek-faces-ban-in-germany-as-privacy-watchdog-reports-the-app-to-google-and-apple-as-illegal-content?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Nq70wR3hz92SgvzeicgX3SVZTGLAxw_U41RLc7VtNk7iKfCO3oWZ00cj5vsDHUykMTpQ4">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Stanford Paper Critiques Age Assurance Laws as Suppressive and Fragmented Regulatory Measures</p>



<p>In a new paper from Stanford Law School, legal scholar Eric Goldman critiques online age assurance laws, arguing they amount to “segregate-and-suppress” legislation that undermines privacy, innovation, and free expression. Goldman challenges the fragmented regulatory landscape and the terminology underpinning age assurance technologies, claiming such laws expose users to surveillance and economic harms. However, critics note that his argument downplays the risks of unrestricted access to harmful content and seems aligned with the stance of industry groups like NetChoice. The paper ultimately favors parental oversight and digital literacy over legal mandates, though it has been criticized for overlooking the practical and ethical concerns driving age assurance efforts. <a href="https://www.biometricupdate.com/202507/respected-legal-authority-frames-age-assurance-legislation-as-segregation-suppression?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-87Rsozl63vNzLLjQA7ctkZbywkY0hR9qCl-OlvF4cgTwV1bySN4mO4sDRnETAyaMoke1vL">(Source)</a></p>



 



<p>Healthline Faces Record CCPA Settlement Over Misuse of Sensitive Health Data and Consent Failures</p>



<p>Healthline Media has agreed to a $1.55 million settlement with the California Attorney General for alleged violations of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and Unfair Competition Law—the largest CCPA-related settlement to date. The investigation found that Healthline continued to share user data with advertisers for targeted ads even after users opted out, particularly revealing sensitive health-related information based on visited pages. Additional violations included inadequate contract terms with ad partners and non-functional cookie consent tools. As part of the settlement, Healthline must implement corrective measures, including fixing opt-out mechanisms, halting the sharing of health-related article titles, and maintaining a robust CCPA compliance program.

<p>Meta Challenges EU Fine Over “Pay or Consent” Model in Ongoing Data Privacy Dispute</p>



<p>Meta plans to appeal a €200 million fine issued by the European Union for allegedly violating the Digital Markets Act through its “pay or consent” model, which offers users a choice between paying for ad-free access or consenting to data tracking. The European Commission found this approach failed to provide an equivalent alternative without personalized data use, deeming it non-compliant with EU rules. Meta contests the ruling, citing prior legal precedent supporting subscription-based models. The case marks another chapter in Meta’s ongoing conflict with European regulators over data privacy, following earlier fines and legal disputes concerning ad targeting and transatlantic data transfers. <a href="https://dmarketforces.com/meta-to-appeal-e200m-eu-fine-over-data-privacy-concerns/?utm_campaign=Morning%20Brief&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_47aar0ufxldN8lVyCXG_g_T8CN4LP8I0Euf7fYO4O_HOoHpsP7mGz29UF72Gy3DmB6xfq">(Source)</a></p>

 4 Arrested in £440M M&amp;S Cyber Attacks; Are They Members of Scattered Spider?  
<p>On July 10, 2025, the U.K. National Crime Agency (NCA) announced a major breakthrough in its investigation into a series of devastating cyber attacks, arresting four individuals from their homes in the West Midlands and London. The suspects face a litany of serious charges, including Computer Misuse Act offenses, blackmail, money laundering, and, notably, "participating in the activities of an organized crime group."</p> 
<p>While the NCA confirmed the suspects' involvement in an organized syndicate, they did not officially name the group. This has led to widespread speculation, and the cybersecurity community is asking one major question: are they members of Scattered Spider? While an official confirmation is pending, it's widely believed that the group is responsible. The tactics used in the £440 million retail heist, specifically the reliance on advanced social engineering ploys, are a known signature of the Scattered Spider hacker group.</p> 
<p>HYPR’s Take: Whether or not these four individuals are confirmed members, the profile of this attack and the suspects themselves paint a vivid picture of the threat that groups like Scattered Spider represent. The suspects are incredibly young, ranging from just 17 to 20 years old, which aligns perfectly with the known demographics of this new generation of digital native cybercriminals.</p> 
 How Young, Native-Speaking Groups Outmaneuver Traditional Defenses  
<p>For years, enterprise security has been architected to defend against a specific type of threat: sophisticated, often foreign, nation-state actors. The defense playbook was designed to spot technical vulnerabilities and hunt for clues of foreign intrusion, like language errors in phishing emails or unusual geopolitical motives. But today, the most dangerous threat isn't a foreign government; it's a teenager in a Western country who sounds exactly like one of your employees on the phone.</p> 
<p>The attackers in groups like Scattered Spider are shockingly young, often between 16 and 22 years old. They are true digital natives who have grown up in a world of social media, online gaming, and instant communication. This gives them more than just technical skill; it provides them with an intuitive grasp of online psychology and a mastery of social manipulation that older, more traditional hacking groups often lack. They don't operate in rigid hierarchies but as fluid, decentralized collectives, working together like a gig-economy startup for cybercrime.</p> 
<p>Their single most effective weapon is the English language. Unlike many foreign adversaries, these young attackers are native speakers. When they call an IT help desk to impersonate an employee, there are no accents, stilted phrases, or cultural missteps to raise alarm bells. They can build rapport, express urgency, and navigate corporate jargon flawlessly, weaponizing trust to turn your most helpful employees into unwitting accomplices. Their process is a masterclass in psychological manipulation:</p> 
  
  Reconnaissance: They scour social media like LinkedIn to find a target employee, gathering personal details like their role, colleagues, and even recent projects.  
  Impersonation: Armed with this information, they call the IT help desk, often during a busy shift change. They create a sense of urgency – "I'm locked out and have a huge presentation in five minutes!" – to pressure the agent.  
  Exploitation: They skillfully answer security questions using the data they’ve collected and trick the well-meaning agent into resetting credentials or even enrolling a new MFA device.  
  
<p>This operational model is fundamentally different from that of a nation-state. These groups are not driven by ideology; they are financially motivated, seeking maximum profit with calculated efficiency. This agile and opportunistic structure makes them incredibly difficult to track. They will focus on one industry, refine their social engineering tactics for that sector's specific culture, extract as much money as possible, and then move on to the next target. The security playbooks written for yesterday's threats are simply not equipped to handle this new breed of adversary.</p> 
 How to Stop Scattered Spider: Defeating the Gen-Z Hacker with Identity Assurance  
<p>Fighting a new breed of predator requires a new class of defense. Probabilistic security has failed. The only way to stop a Scattered Spider attack is to move to a deterministic model of security; one that provides absolute certainty about a user's identity.</p> 
<p>HYPR dismantles the Scattered Spider playbook piece by piece:</p> 
  
  Eliminate the Attack Vector with Phishing-Resistant MFA: The primary weapon of Scattered Spider is credential phishing. HYPR Authenticate replaces passwords with FIDO-certified, passkey-based authentication. Authentication is bound to the true domain of the service, making it impossible for AiTM tools like Evilginx to function. If a user is lured to a fake site, the authentication will simply fail. There is no credential to steal and no session cookie to hijack. The attack is stopped before it begins.<br><br>  
  Secure the Help Desk with Deterministic Identity Verification: The help desk is Scattered Spider's favorite entry point. HYPR Affirm slams that door shut. To perform a sensitive action like a credential reset, the user must prove who they are, not just what they know. Affirm uses a multi-layered, configurable workflow that can include verifying a government-issued ID, a biometric selfie match, and other deterministic factors. A scammer on the phone cannot fake their way through a live facial recognition scan. We help you verify the person, not the account.  
  
<p>Scattered Spider thrives on uncertainty, manipulation, and the fundamental flaws of legacy identity security. HYPR provides certainty.</p> 
<p>Don't wait to become Scattered Spider's next headline. It's time to move beyond security that hopes it's right to a system that knows.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>We’ve just released a <a href="https://holochain.org/roadmap/?ref=blog.holochain.org">new roadmap</a> for Holochain that we redesigned to improve visibility into both the development status and the workflow of the Holochain team. It shows a summary of release history, status of in-progress work, and planning of upcoming work including releases actively being planned and those that are just incubating. These summaries are linked to our actual Github project management tooling to calculate our work velocity and expected completion of work in progress as well as planning estimation.</p> Context <p>Showing the evolution and progress of an open-source project in an easily digestible way is both a critical and a non-trivial task.While we have been operating transparently for quite some time using Github Projects to manage and prioritize our work, the available summarizing and visibility tooling GitHub provides for roadmaps and burn-down don’t provide the necessary accessibility to developers and non-developers alike to stay informed on what’s currently being worked on, and what is yet to come. And we too have struggled with how best to create visibility into projected completion times, as this is<a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/10/26/evidence-based-scheduling/?ref=blog.holochain.org"> notoriously difficult to do</a>.</p><p>Our new, dynamic roadmap addresses these challenges by making our completion estimates visible the same way we see them internally - based on real data of our historical velocity, and compared with the team’s complexity estimation on future and in-progress work. <br><br>Take a look at how the new timeline in this video walk-through, or read on for more info on how it works.</p> What we show  Released <p>The Released column provides a list of actually released software. For the most part this shows Holochain releases, but it also includes notable releases of other stand-alone projects (like the HTTP Gateway). More current releases link to actual issues completed in our Github Projects tool.</p> In Progress <p>The “In Progress” column provides visibility into the releases we are currently actively working on. For each release you can see the percentage completion of story points, the current velocity and estimated time to completion. The story point completion is also broken down by epic for more detailed project data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> Up Next <p>The “Up Next” column provides visibility into our team planning and estimation process. As well as coding and delivering on current releases, we are also looking ahead to what comes next, and getting a handle on how much complexity is involved and what to put into future releases. So in this column what you see is the progress on the issues and time to complete for a release.</p> Our Process <p>To really make sense of this roadmap, it helps to understand our team process. Like many software teams, we use a simple modified Kanban-based agile workflow for low-level task management, and releases and epics for higher-level prioritization.</p>  Work items enter our flow as bugs and feature requests, either from Holochain team members or stakeholders adding them as GitHub issues, on one of our repositories. As the team breaks down larger items of work, they may add more issues across various repositories.  All of these end up in the project backlog where we prioritize them and slot them into a release and an epic, which collects larger chunks of work.  From there the items are set to "Ready for refinement" which is the crucial step of the team assessing the complexity of an issue, and possibly breaking it into smaller issues that are all estimated. There is much written about story point estimating in agile process, which you can google for if you want to understand this more deeply. Suffice it to say that it's best not to estimate "time/effort" but rather to estimate complexity. Looking back on completed issues reveals the time it takes for the team to complete items of that level of complexity.  When items have been estimated, they are marked "Ready" and team members can start the work according to priority.  Our releases are currently numbered in the pre-release <a href="https://semver.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">semver</a> numbering style of 0.X.Y. X is considered a major release where we allow ourselves to break APIs, which for developers means they may have to recompile their hApps, and/or actually make updates because the <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/?ref=blog.holochain.org">HDK</a> is changed, and also will have to update the conductor version their runtime is using, because networking formats may have changed. The Y value is a minor and for those, no DNA updates are required; simply updating the Holochain version in a runtime will either add new non-breaking features, or have fixed bugs.  <p>Thus, our new roadmap helps make our internal process more accessible and visible. We show what releases we have completed, which we are working on, and are planning and incubating going forward.</p><p>Please note that this map is fluid. We move epics from one release to another as we evaluate them, and sometimes simply because we realize it makes more sense to get a release out sooner. Usually, what's In-Progress is fairly well planned out, and the scope should remain fairly stable. What's marked as Planning not so much, and what's marked Incubating even less so.</p><p>We've made it so that Releases and Epics are links on the site so you can navigate directly to our Github project for those who want to delve in deeper.</p> The GitHub Project <p>To look under the hood at what's on in GitHub here are some things to note:</p>  If you go to the <a href="https://github.com/orgs/holochain/projects/11/views/22?ref=blog.holochain.org">release view</a> you will see all of the releases also on the website, plus a few more that we are holding even more loosely on that gradient of certainty, so we don't show them on the website.  Releases on GitHub are prefixed with a "*" for those in planning, and an "_" for those being incubated.  You may notice that data is not pulled live from GitHub, but it is updated reasonably often. This is currently a manual process that will eventually be automated.  <p>This roadmap provides transparency into both our timelines and development processes, giving real-time insight into how we work, what we're building, and when. This helps community members make better-informed decisions when building on Holochain. We'll continue refining this roadmap based on your feedback - so we look forward to hearing what you think.!</p>

			 Héctor Castro Mateos is QA Lead at Tokeny, he joined the company in 2022. 
 Reflecting on the 3-year Journey 
 You’ve been with the company for three years, as a QA engineer. How has the company supported your growth during this time? 
<p>Since I joined the company three years ago, I’ve always felt empowered to take ownership of the QA process and shape it in a way that truly fits our team and product. That level of trust and autonomy has been key to my growth. On top of that, everyone here is genuinely supportive and collaborative, which makes it much easier to take on challenges and keep improving.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 Tokeny’s Culture Involvement 
 Tokeny has grown significantly since you joined. How has the company culture evolved in your opinion? 
<p>A lot has definitely changed over these three years. As the company has grown, the tech team has constantly refined its processes, always aiming to improve step by step so we can deliver the best possible product.</p>

		 
	 
                  
	 
		 
			 “We’ve managed to keep that “family feeling” despite team changes, and I think that’s something really valuable to preserve.” 

		 
	 
             
	 
		 
			 “We’ve managed to keep that “family feeling” despite team changes, and I think that’s something really valuable to preserve.” 

		 
	 
                 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe your own personal growth within the company? 
<p>The QA team has grown since I joined, and with that, so have my responsibilities. I started as the only QA, and now we’re a team of four. That shift has pushed me to grow into a leadership role, learning how to manage a team, balance priorities, and make sure everyone feels both productive and motivated. It’s been a continuous learning experience, and I’m still growing every day.</p>

		 
	 
                            
	 
		 
			 “It’s been a continuous learning experience, and I’m still growing every day.” 

		 
	 
       
	 
		 
			 “It’s been a continuous learning experience, and I’m still growing every day.” 

		 
	 
                  
	 
		 
			 Company Values in Practice 
 You mentioned in your previous interview how much you enjoyed working with a very committed team, that creates a sense of belonging to a community. Can you share an example of a project where you or your team used this commitment, and how it was received? 
<p>There was a release where many things got delayed and we had blockers just a few days before the deadline. Instead of panicking, the team stayed fully engaged and focused. We split the work, adapted priorities, and everyone went the extra mile to make sure things were properly tested. It really showed how committed the team is, not just to doing their own tasks, but to making sure the company delivers quality on time.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 Reflections and Future Outlook 
 If you could give advice to your younger self, just starting out at Tokeny, what would it be? 
<p>I’d tell myself to be more confident from the beginning and to trust the team. You don’t need to have all the answers on your own, the best outcomes come when you collaborate and rely on others. We’re all here to help each other grow.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 As someone who has been with the company through significant milestones, where do you see Tokeny going in the next five years, and how do you envision your role evolving in that journey? 
<p>The industry is evolving really fast, so it’s hard to predict exactly what things will look like in five years. Personally, I see myself continuing to grow professionally, leading a bigger QA team, and contributing to even more advanced testing strategies to keep ensuring the quality and reliability of our product.</p>

		 
	 
                       
	 
		 
			 “I’m confident Tokeny will be at the forefront of that change” 

		 
	 
                        
	 
		 
			 “I’m confident Tokeny will be at the forefront of that change” 

		 
	 
                       
	 
		 
			 Finally, as we’ve gotten to know you over the years, you’ve often shared your love for nutrition and a wide range of sports. Do any learnings or skills from these passions translate into your work at Tokeny? 
<p>Absolutely. I think anyone who approaches sports with passion and commitment develops a mindset built on patience, resilience, and the drive to keep going until the goal is achieved. That mentality naturally carries over into work, where consistency and perseverance are key.</p>

<p>Part of Bluesky’s mission to create a more open and decentralized social web is
helping users feel safe and in control of their experience. We always try to
balance safety with privacy, and free expression with civility.</p>
<p>To achieve our mission, we also work with governments around the world. In the
UK, the Online Safety Act requires that online platforms take specific steps to
reduce the risk of children seeing harmful content. Since certain parts of that
act come into effect later this month, we’re making some changes for people in
the UK.</p>
<p>We’ll use Epic Games’ <a href="https://www.kidswebservices.com/en-US">Kids Web
Services</a> (KWS) to give our UK
community choices about how to verify their age. If you’re in the UK, you can
choose between
<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/kids-web-services/pv-service/verification-methods">methods</a>
like credit card verification and face scans. (See
<a href="https://www.kidswebservices.com/en-US/faq">here</a> to
learn more about how KWS safeguards user information.) For people who are under
18 or don’t want to go through this process, we’ll make adult-appropriate
content inaccessible, and we’ll disable features like direct messaging.</p>
<p>If you’re in the UK, you’ll see a notification on our platform when this update
takes effect, and a way to report unwanted content:</p>

  
  Users in the UK will see notices of age requirements, and
  instructions for completing age verification.


  
  Users can report content through flows like the one pictured.

<p>In addition to these updates, we’ll continue to look at how we’re doing to
shield children from unwanted content, and how we can improve.</p>

 Universities can’t afford to treat cybersecurity as an afterthought. Here’s how to close the gaps before the next breach.&nbsp; 
<p>On June 24, 2025, Columbia University joined the growing list of higher education institutions compromised by sophisticated cybercriminals. The attack, which <a href="https://therecord.media/hacker-political-agenda-columbia-cyberattack">exposed 1.6 gigabytes of sensitive data from 2.5 million student applications</a>, wasn’t the work of a random opportunist, it was a politically motivated hacktivist who exploited systemic weaknesses in the university’s identity infrastructure.</p>
<p>This breach represents more than an isolated incident. It’s a stark warning about the reality facing higher education: attacks targeting universities have <a href="https://www.cloudrangecyber.com/news/higher-education-faces-rising-cyber-attacks-in-2024">surged nearly 70%</a> since 2023, with institutions now facing an <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/10/10/cyber-signals-issue-8-education-under-siege-how-cybercriminals-target-our-schools/">average of over 2,500 cyberattack attempts each week</a>. For university CISOs and IT leaders reading about yet another campus breach, this one demands immediate attention, because the vulnerabilities that enabled Columbia’s compromise exist across virtually every campus in America.</p>
 Why Higher Education Has Become a Prime Target 
<p>Universities present an irresistible combination of valuable data and defensive weaknesses that make them ideal targets for both cybercriminals and nation-state actors. Unlike heavily regulated industries like finance or healthcare, higher education operates with unique vulnerabilities that attackers systematically exploit:</p>
 Open by Design, Vulnerable by Default 
<p>The collaborative nature of academic environments creates massive attack surfaces. Universities must balance open access for research and learning with security requirements—a tension that often resolves in favor of accessibility rather than protection. Multiple campuses, diverse user populations, and thousands of personal devices create countless entry points that traditional perimeter defenses can’t adequately secure.</p>
 Legacy Identity Systems Built for Trust, Not Security 
<p>Most universities still rely on authentication systems designed decades ago for smaller, more trusted communities. Password-based access controls and basic multi-factor authentication leave institutions vulnerable to the same social engineering and credential theft tactics that have compromised organizations across every sector.</p>
 Resource Constraints in a High-Risk Environment 
<p>Shrinking budgets force difficult choices between academic priorities and cybersecurity investments. IT teams often operate with skeleton staff while managing complex, distributed infrastructure that spans multiple generations of technology. This combination of limited resources and broad attack surfaces creates the perfect storm for successful cyberattacks.</p>
 The Columbia Attack: A Preview of What’s Coming 
<p>The details emerging from Columbia’s investigation reveal attack patterns that should concern every higher education leader. While the full forensic analysis remains ongoing, early reports suggest the attackers exploited weak identity verification processes to gain initial access, then moved laterally through systems containing sensitive student data.</p>
<p>This follows a predictable pattern: compromise user credentials through phishing or social engineering, bypass traditional MFA through known techniques, then abuse legitimate access to extract maximum value before detection.</p>
<p>The financial impact extends far beyond immediate incident response costs. Universities face regulatory fines, legal liability, remediation expenses, and the long-term reputational damage that affects enrollment and donor relationships.</p>
 Third-Party Risks Universities Often Overlook 
<p>Higher education institutions rely heavily on external vendors for everything from student information systems to dining services. Each vendor relationship introduces potential vulnerabilities, particularly when those providers have privileged access to campus systems or sensitive data.</p>
<p>The challenge isn’t just direct vendor access—it’s the inherited trust relationships that come with those partnerships. When a student information system provider gets compromised, attackers often inherit that vendor’s access to multiple university clients. This supply chain risk multiplies across the dozens of technology providers most universities depend on for daily operations.</p>
 Identity-First Defense for Higher Education 
<p>Traditional cybersecurity approaches fail in university environments because they focus on protecting systems rather than verifying identities. When attackers can convince legitimate users or help desk staff to grant access, network security becomes irrelevant.</p>
<p>The most effective defense requires securing the identity layer itself. Here’s how identity-first security addresses the specific vulnerabilities that made Columbia’s breach possible:</p>
 Verified Identity Authentication 
<p>The Challenge: University help desks process hundreds of password reset requests daily from students, faculty, and staff across multiple time zones. Traditional verification relies on security questions or basic information that attackers can easily research or socially engineer.</p>
<p>The Defense: Identity platforms that require users to prove their actual identity through biometric verification tied to government-issued identification. When someone requests account access, the system can definitively verify whether the person is who they claim to be—regardless of what information they provide over the phone.</p>
 Phishing-Resistant, Passwordless Authentication 
<p>The Challenge: University users are prime targets for phishing attacks, with students and faculty often sharing credentials across multiple personal and academic platforms. Traditional MFA can be bypassed through push notification fatigue or social engineering.</p>
<p>The Defense: Eliminating passwords entirely and using FIDO2-compliant biometric authentication that cannot be phished, intercepted, or socially engineered. There are no codes to read over the phone and no push notifications to accidentally accept.</p>
 Risk-Based Access Controls 
<p>The Challenge: University environments require flexible access from multiple locations and devices, making traditional location-based or device-based controls impractical.</p>
<p>The Defense: Identity-bound access controls that verify the person requesting access, regardless of their device or location. Even if attackers compromise approved devices or spoof trusted networks, they cannot authenticate without the legitimate user’s verified biometric identity.</p>
 Implementation Considerations for Universities 
<p>Regulatory Compliance Universities handle FERPA-protected student records, research data subject to various federal requirements, and often health information covered by HIPAA. Identity platforms that meet federal standards like FedRAMP High Authorization and NIST 800-63-3 demonstrate they can handle the complex compliance requirements universities face.</p>
<p>Operational Continuity Identity-based attacks can disrupt everything from class registration to research operations. The cost of operational disruption often exceeds the direct costs of incident response and can affect the institution’s academic mission for months or years.</p>
<p>Integration Requirements Modern identity platforms must integrate with existing campus systems—from learning management platforms to research computing resources—without disrupting daily academic operations.</p>
 The Time to Act is Now 
<p>Columbia’s breach isn’t an isolated incident—it’s a preview of what’s coming for every university that hasn’t modernized their identity infrastructure.</p>
<p>Rather than detecting breaches after they’ve compromised sensitive data, identity-first security prevents them from succeeding by securing the identity layer that attackers target first. The question isn’t whether your institution will face an identity-based attack—it’s whether you’ll be ready when it comes.</p>

<p>On this episode we spoke with Teresa Wu, Vice President of Smart Credentials and Access at IDEMIA. IDEMIA has been involved with many U.S. states for their mobile IDs, including New York, Arizona, Iowa, Delaware and more. Very few people on earth have more experience than Teresa working with governments to issue digital credentials.</p><p>We asked her what would encourage more states to launch mobile IDs and drive end-user adoption. Her response was: more relying party use cases. So, we spent most of our conversation exploring questions like:</p>  Should relying parties wait to adopt until standards mature and more people have digital IDs?  How can relying parties get started now?  How much should the industry channel its energy towards innovation vs. standardization?  How will the wallet landscape evolve? Will operating system wallets dominate, or will there be lots of wallets?  <p>We closed out by covering the lessons Teresa has learned through all this experience for public servants. I think this conversation will be relevant to anybody interested in digital IDs, either on the issuance or acceptance side.</p><p>You can find <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/teresawu/">Teresa</a> on Linkedin and learn more about <a href="https://www.idemia.com/">IDEMIA</a> on their website.</p><p>Subscribe to our newsletter for more announcements related to the future of identity at <a href="http://trinsic.id/podcast">trinsic.id/podcast</a></p><p>Reach out to Riley (<a href="https://twitter.com/rileyphughes">@rileyphughes</a>) and Trinsic (<a href="https://twitter.com/trinsic_id">@trinsic_id</a>) on Twitter.
