<p>Hello, Chameleons! As we have moved into May, let’s dive into the exciting updates and changes we’ve rolled out in the past&nbsp;month.</p> A New Chapter Begins for our Ambassador Program <p>April saw the much-anticipated relaunch of our Ambassador Program, complete with a revised evaluation process emphasizing quality over quantity. And here’s the results that the relaunch has yielded so&nbsp;far:</p>  Successful Implementation: We’ve fully integrated the new qualitative approach, setting a higher standard for content and engagement.  Enhanced Post Quality: The new framework has already shown its effectiveness, with a noticeable improvement in the quality of contributions from our ambassadors.  Consistent Engagement: Most ambassadors have adapted well to the new guidelines, maintaining consistency and excellence in their submissions.   Continuous Support and Engagement <p>Understanding the adjustments that come with change, we’ve committed to holding regular meetings most Fridays. These sessions will help us clarify tasks, set clear expectations, and ensure everyone is comfortable and confident with the new framework.</p><p>We’ll continue holding these meetings until we are confident that all ambassadors have fully grasped the updated&nbsp;program.</p> Enhancing Our NFT Collection <p>Looking ahead, we remain focused on enhancing the utility and appeal of our NFT collections. We are deep into the planning stages for the second drop of our NFT collection, exploring innovative ways to add value and utility to each piece. Stay tuned as we shape these ideas into&nbsp;reality!</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>As we transition fully into the revamped Ambassador Program and advance our NFT initiatives, we are incredibly optimistic about the future. Here’s to continuing our journey of innovation, community engagement, and collective success.</p><p>The <a href="https://shyftdao.org/">Shyft DAO </a>community is committed to building a decentralized, trustless ecosystem that empowers its members to collaborate and make decisions in a transparent and democratic manner.

				  In a new <a href="https://indicio.tech/library/complete-zero-trust-with-decentralized-identity/">White Paper</a> from Indicio, Trevor Butterworth, Chase Cunningham, and Will Groah explain the importance of understanding how identity and security are connected and that a Zero Trust strategy for security can only be fully realized through a decentralized approach to identity.&nbsp;  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>Zero Trust and Decentralized Identity</p>
<p>The concepts of Zero Trust and Decentralized Identity emerged in the early 2000s as responses to the escalating problems around data breaches and identity theft.</p>
<p>Zero Trust meant what it said: trust no one and continuously verify for narrow access to network resources.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity tackled the underlying reason digital identities couldn’t be trusted: the architecture of identity access and management couldn’t offer the privacy and security protection needed to protect personal data.</p>
<p>Any network defense could be broken if the identity of a user was compromised, and a system of storing user identity in centralized databases and using passwords for access was an endless source of risk.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity completes Zero Trust because it creates a seamless, cryptographic way to verify identity without centralizing personal data or needing logins and passwords, meaning that a network could always be certain of the identity of those trying to access their systems and could manage continuous verification in a maximally frictionless way.</p>
<p>Why then has Zero Trust largely ignored Decentralized Identity? Because security and identity teams often have different organizational responsibilities when a strong security posture means that both are inextricably linked. The authors argue, however, that without decentralized identity, Zero Trust cannot be fully embraced and implemented.</p>

<p>At IBM Cloud, we are committed to helping enterprises across industries leverage hybrid cloud and AI technologies to help them drive innovation. For true transformation to begin, we believe it is key to understand the unique challenges organizations are facing—whether it is keeping data secured, addressing <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/ibm-cloud-delivers-enterprise-sovereign-cloud-capabilities/">data sovereignty</a> requirements or speeding time to market to satisfy consumers. For those in even the most highly regulated industries, we have seen these challenges continue to grow as they navigate changing regulations.</p>



<p>We designed our <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700074971942949&amp;p5=e&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwoPOwBhAeEiwAJuXRh5ar6VM_hl6s5TGFtcGmdUHgtg9D6C8XQ0p7blD8DXkyqlhnHnEo8BoCFiwQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">enterprise cloud platform for even the most highly regulated industries</a> with the unique needs of these heavily regulated sectors, such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/industries/financial-services">financial services</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/industries/government">government</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/industries/healthcare">healthcare</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/industries/telecommunications?utm_content=SRCWW&amp;p1=Search&amp;p4=43700060960077076&amp;p5=e&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjww_iwBhApEiwAuG6ccGxwtzxSN-PaY3LoQHywmxuqJC1k2WcNdmcI5vxO5JGAGikmRpSYARoC9LwQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">telco</a>, in mind. We first introduced our industry-specific enterprise cloud in collaboration with key partners–including BNP Paribas and CaixaBank–to help clients as they work to address various risks, navigate regulations, demonstrate their compliance and accelerate cloud adoption.</p>



<p>Today, our enterprise-grade platform is optimized to help clients manage mission-critical workloads while addressing resiliency, performance, security, compliance and total cost of ownership. We strive to meet the needs of our clients who want to be agile, ramp up quickly, pay as they go and who want to ensure they keep the confidence of their clients. The security of our client’s data is at the heart of everything we do.</p>



 Telco leverages hybrid cloud to deliver enhanced customer interactions 



<p>Masorange is a mobile network operator that puts customer experience at the center of everything it does. To provide additional support for today’s digital-first consumers, Masorange leverages the combination of a digital assistant and human interaction to help customers quickly. Supported by AI and cloud technology, their Orange and Jazztel virtual assistants use IBM watsonx Assistant and IBM Watson Discovery running on IBM Cloud.</p>



<p>The support service carries out approximately one million conversations per month—helping clients who prefer using digital channels to get quick service. Masorange puts “excellence in service” at the forefront of its mission and by leveraging the flexibility, scalability and security of IBM Cloud, they are able to meet the needs of their customers and deliver seamless interactions nearly on-demand.</p>



<blockquote>“We wouldn’t have been able to do it without services like the ones IBM Cloud provides, running and managing data with security and consistency.” – Tomas Alberola, Virtual Agents Manager, Masorange.</blockquote>



 Digitizing clinical processes and enhancing patient experiences in healthcare 



<p><a href="https://newsroom.ibm.com/2021-06-22-University-Medical-Center-Mainz-Adopts-IBM-Cloud-Satellite-to-Digitize-Its-Clinical-Processes">University Medical Center Mainz</a>, which provides care to more than 350,000 patients per year, is leveraging IBM’s distributed cloud capabilities to digitize its clinical processes. With an intentional hybrid-by-design approach that aims to streamline its management processes, the medical center has worked with IBM to build several solutions. These solutions include ones that are designed to help facilitate their secured exchange of healthcare data.</p>



<p>By leveraging IBM’s hybrid cloud capabilities and deep industry expertise via IBM Consulting, the medical center developed a messenger system designed to enable doctors, nursing staff and administration to communicate via computer or mobile devices in a secured and effective manner. It is also using IBM technology including IBM Watson Assistant for virtual agent capabilities that can help them deliver better patient experiences through conversational artificial intelligence.</p>



<p>As the University Medical Center Mainz furthers its mission to help patients on their healthcare journeys, keeping patient data secured and private is top priority. A hybrid cloud approach with IBM is designed to:</p>



 
 Enable the medical center to access cloud services securely and efficiently. 



 Help them as they demonstrate their compliance with data protection requirements. 



 Enable data sovereignty. 
 



 Helping to deliver faster experiences and keep data secured within the public sector 



<p>While many may not immediately associate the public sector with customer experience, government agencies aim to serve citizens who can be viewed as their customers. Citizens may interact with government agencies in a number of ways, from renewing a driver’s license to filing taxes, but there is one constant throughout these processes: They are looking for a quick and seamless experience. This experience is critical to make sure they can accomplish what they need to quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A scalable cloud infrastructure for public sector agencies can help speed up delivery, allowing them to build and roll out new services to citizens. With the flexibility of cloud, these agencies can also run tests to see what services are working, allowing them to get feedback from citizens and then incorporate the feedback into what they are doing. In highly regulated industries such as the public sector, it is also important to keep citizen’s sensitive data secured.</p>



<p>By leveraging innovative security capabilities, such as confidential computing and keep your own key encryption, public sector agencies can work to protect this information. From helping federal agencies deliver services to citizens in an efficient way to enabling government departments to facilitate secured transfer of data, an industry-specific cloud platform designed with security and built-in controls can help.</p>



<p>As organizations in highly regulated industries strive to innovate while navigating their security and compliance requirements, hybrid cloud and AI can help them achieve this balance.</p>

  <p>In previous resilience blog posts, we’ve shared updates about the continuous improvements we’re making to resilience and reliability, including our most recent update on <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/microsoft-entra-resilience-update-workload-identity/ba-p/4094704">regionally isolated authentication endpoints</a> and an announcement last year of our industry-leading and first of its kind <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/advances-in-azure-ad-resilience/ba-p/2147048">backup authentication service</a>. These and other innovations behind the scenes enable us to deliver consistently very high rates of availability globally each month. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll outline what we’re doing to help customers see how available and resilient Microsoft Entra really is for them, to not only hold us accountable when issues arise, but also better understand what actions to take within their tenant to improve its health. At the global level, you see it in the form of retrospective <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/reference-sla-performance">SLA reporting</a>, which shows authentication availability exceeding our 4 9s promise (<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/99-99-uptime-for-azure-active-directory/ba-p/1999628">launched in spring 2021</a>) by a wide margin and reaching 5 9s in most months. But it becomes more compelling and actionable at the tenant level: what is the uptime experience of my users on my organization’s apps and devices? Is my tenant handling surges in sign-in demand?  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We often hear from customers about the effect on resilience insights when they move to the cloud. In the on-prem world, identity health monitoring occurred onsite and with tight control; operational awareness happened entirely within a company’s first-party IT department. Now, we need to achieve that same transparency or better in an outsourced, cloud-based identity service and with a federated set of dependencies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IT departments and developers are working hard to ensure each of their users maintains seamless, uninterrupted access that doesn’t compromise security. Enabling access for the right users with minimal friction while stopping intrusions and risk is critical to keep the world running. When an organization outsources their identity service to Microsoft, they expect us to acknowledge degradations when they happen, then take accountability to learn and continuously improve from those events. We also recognize that human-driven communication can only take us so far.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To meet these challenges, we’re increasingly embracing granular monitoring and automation. We start from the assumption that the unexpected will find a way of happening in any complex system, no matter how resilient it is. Beyond resilience, we must detect incidents, respond to them effectively, and improve as we go—and help our customers do the same. You see examples of this approach both in our rollout of in-tenant health monitoring and in our investments behind the scenes aimed at fast incident detection and communication. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s start with out-of-the-box automated health monitoring in premium tenants. Tenant-level health monitoring empowers customers to independently understand the quality of their users’ experiences with authentication and access. It also sets the stage to prompt tenant administrators with actions they can take to investigate and reduce disruptions, all from Microsoft Entra admin center or using MS Graph API calls. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve taken a step in this direction by introducing a group of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/monitoring-health/concept-microsoft-entra-health">precomputed health metric streams</a> that enable our premium customers to watch key authentication scenarios, an early milestone in our investments to enhance transparent visibility into tenant health and service resilience. These new health metrics isolate relevant signals from activity logs and provide pre-computed, low-latency aggregates every 15 minutes for specific high-value observability scenarios.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With their granularity and scenario-specific focus, health metrics go a step beyond the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/increasing-transparency-into-azure-active-directory-s-resilience/ba-p/2147047">monthly tenant-level SLA reporting</a> we released in 2023. Precomputed health metrics also supplement the activity log data that we’ve been providing and continue to improve on. With sign-in logs, customers can build their own computed metrics to monitor, like isolating a specific sign-in method to watch for increases in success and failure. With our new precomputed streams, customers can snap to Microsoft-defined indicators of health, take advantage of features we’re developing at scale, and dive into activity logs for deeper investigations. We encourage customers to make use of both options to get a full picture. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the initial public preview offering, we’re releasing health metric streams related to maintaining highly available:  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Multifactor authentication (MFA) &nbsp; 
 
 
 Sign-ins for devices that are managed under Conditional Access policies &nbsp; 
 
 
 Sign-ins for devices that are compliant with Conditional Access policies &nbsp; 
 
 
 Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) sign-ins  &nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re starting with authentication-related scenarios because they are mission critical to all our customers, but other scenarios in areas like entitlement management, directory configuration, and app health will be added in time along with intelligent alerting capabilities in response to anomalous patterns in the data. We’re publishing the health metrics in Microsoft Entra admin center, Azure Portal, and M365 admin center, as well as in Microsoft Graph for programmatic access and integration into other monitoring pipelines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information about how to access the health monitoring metrics, visit the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/monitoring-health/concept-microsoft-entra-health">Microsoft Learn documentation</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure shows the Scenario monitoring landing page &amp; the Sign in with MFA scenario details</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even as in-tenant observability improves, customers will still rely on traditional incident communications when Microsoft-side issues happen. Like all service providers, we push messages about incidents to affected customers and post service health announcements to a website and communications feed in Azure. However, when this approach relies solely on hand-crafted service monitors and human-driven communications, it has limitations. Customers are right to have concerns about the timeliness of communication and the monitoring coverage itself.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To address this challenge, we’re building increasingly sophisticated default monitoring packages attached to automated communications. The early results are promising. We’ve been able to bring times to notify customers about incidents down significantly, with service degradations and downtime being communicated within about 10 minutes of auto-detection. We’re also catching service degradations increasingly early by investing in monitoring, the results of which we track by watching customer-reported incident volumes. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp; best incidents are the ones that never happen. Our goal is to find and mitigate problems before they impact our customers. So, in addition to advances, we continue to prioritize building systematic resilience measures to prevent service degradations and outages or auto-mitigate them before they affect a customer environment. We will share more on this in a future blog.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To continuously improve our services in partnership with our customers, we’re combining improvements in our service-level safety net with tenant-level monitoring. We’re also expanding our monitored scenarios, boosting our out-of-the-box monitoring intelligence, and speeding up our communication. Plus, integration with Azure, M365, and Microsoft Graph ensures that Microsoft Entra observability can happen wherever it’s needed. Together, we’re making sure everyone can work securely and seamlessly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With our already strong foundation of availability and resilience, security-enhancing recommendations, and mature service monitoring and incident communications, we’re excited to see these new capabilities take Entra health transparency to the next level.   &nbsp;</p>

 We spoke with Sébastien Marteau, Chief Commercial Officer at <a href="https://european-index.fluctuo.com/">Fluctuo</a>, about the latest trends in carsharing, decarbonization in the transport sector, the future of the industry and the challenges it faces. 



 Are carsharing services becoming increasingly popular? If so, what factors are contributing to their success? 



<p>Yes, certainly. Carsharing is a cost-effective way of ensuring that you only pay for a car when you really need one. The economic benefits are real when you factor in all the costs associated with a car (purchase, maintenance, fuel, insurance, etc.).</p>



<p>In times of inflation, carsharing services represent a real gain for the consumer. They make it possible to share a vehicle. What’s more, carsharing is seen as an inclusive mode of transport, facilitating access to cars for people who don’t always have the means to own one.</p>



<p>Last but not least, carsharing services respond to ecological imperatives that are increasingly resonant in today’s society.</p>



<p>On a European scale, carsharing services saw strong growth in 2023. Data from our latest <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/european-shared-mobility-index-2023-flucto/">European Shared Mobility Index 2023</a> on free-floating services, which covers 115 cities in Europe, shows an increase in the size of shared car fleets of 25%, while the number of journeys has risen by 39%, especially with very dynamic countries such as Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries such as Denmark and Norway.</p>

 How is the carsharing economy shaping up today? 



<p>The carsharing market is a mix of two types of players: private players, often linked to carmakers and positioned on free-floating services; and associations or user groups covering station-based services. The latter are sometimes partly financed by public authorities to enable them to develop.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, costs remain one of the major issues in the carsharing economy, such as those inherent in parking or vandalism.</p>



<p>To <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/whats-propelling-the-mobility-industry/">develop this economy</a>, there is a real need for operators to collaborate and share data, so as to develop the use of carsharing. The aim is to unite in order to give visibility to this emerging industry and contribute to the sector’s economic growth.</p>



 What do you see as the future of green mobility? 



<p>The future of green mobility is linked to the reduction in the number of private cars and the development of a modal shift toward active, low-carbon modes such as walking, cycling and public transport. According to the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE), the car still accounts for the majority of home-to-work journeys of less than 2km (52.9%), so we absolutely must accelerate the modal shift to low-carbon modes.</p>



<p>If Europe is to achieve its objectives of climate neutrality by 2050 and a net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 90% by 2040 compared to 1990 levels, emissions from the transport sector will have to fall by almost 80% by 2040.</p>



<p>Decarbonizing road transport, switching to zero-emission vehicles and improving public transport and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/change-social-and-shared-mobility/">shared mobility</a> will also have a direct impact on air quality and, consequently, on the health of all Europeans. The transition to climate neutrality implies the promotion of sustainable and affordable mobility, thanks to appropriate urban planning, which will be important in enabling more public transport, carsharing, car-pooling and active mobility such as walking and cycling for short-distance journeys. Ensuring <a href="https://northsearegion.eu/share-north/news/translating-shared-mobility-for-rural-areas-the-rosetta-stone-for-car-sharing-in-small-towns/">access for all</a> to affordable and accessible net-zero energy and mobility solutions will be an essential part of the transition. Carsharing will also need to be integrated into public transport plans and develop multimodality if it is to be democratized.</p>



 As more and more cities realize the importance of zero-emission mobility and take steps in this direction, how can carsharing services contribute to green mobility? 



<p>Carsharing is a gas pedal of de-motorization: By offering a simple, accessible solution for journeys requiring a car, carsharing enables its users to replace their personal vehicle. In the case of an individual vehicle, it is estimated that it remains stationary 95% of the time. Taking France as an example, we estimate that a “loop” carsharing vehicle replaces between 5 and 8 private vehicles. In some countries, it can even replace 12-15 cars. So there’s a real need to reduce the number of private vehicles to cut carbon emissions.</p>



<p>Carsharing also accelerates multimodality: carsharing users make greater use of public transport (+18%), trains (+29%), bicycles (+22%) and walking (+38%). The integration of carsharing services in rail and bus stations is very important.</p>



 Do carsharing operators have to comply with any specific regulations today? 



<p>A carsharing operator is often required to obtain a license to operate in a given territory, as well as to pay for the parking of its fleet. From the user’s point of view, the operator is also obliged to check that <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">the user has a valid license</a>, and ultimately to verify the user’s identity.</p>



<p>Cities and transport authorities have found it difficult to regulate carsharing. Regulations have often been too restrictive, limiting the operational capabilities of these services and affecting their business model. They have tended to focus on limiting the impact of the system, rather than working with operators to maximize the overall benefits of the mobility system. In some cases, the limits imposed on zone access and parking have led operators to withdraw.</p>



 What are the main challenges facing carsharing operators today? 



<p>Carsharing <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-travel-reflections-2023/">operators face a number of challenges</a>:</p>



  Vandalism is having a real impact on the profitability of some operators, resulting in very expensive insurance policies. In the UK, for example, it seems that no private insurers are entering this market any more. Detecting incidents is therefore essential, so that the user is reimbursed for any damage caused;  Migration to electric vehicles. Only 11% of cars in stations in France are electric, compared with 79% for free-floating. This migration will involve educating users about their mode of operation;  Profitability. Many have struggled to become profitable due to high operating costs, poor coordination with competitors, narrow scope of action and unfavorable sharing models with municipalities (inadequate parking agreements).  



 What solutions are carsharing operators looking for to facilitate and secure the use of their services? 



<p>With the explosion in <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/sebastien-marcel-generative-ai-and-deepfakes/">generative AI</a>, driver’s license fraud and document forgery are on the rise. Given their strong growth, there is a major challenge around the identification and authentication of users in vehicles. It is vital for operators to integrate very strict <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">identity verification solutions</a>, at the risk of undermining the profitability of their business model.</p>

 The CIAM Market (Customer Identity and Access Management) is undergoing significant transformations. As businesses increasingly recognize CIAM’s critical role in securing and managing customer identities on digital platforms, this market is poised for substantial growth—from <a href="https://liminal.co/reports/customer-identity-and-access-management-buyers-guide-2024/">$6.2 billion in 2024 to $10.8 billion by 2028</a>. This growth underscores the evolution of CIAM solutions from basic tools to essential, strategic business solutions. 



 







 



<p>Despite substantial ROI from CIAM—such as operational cost reductions and revenue growth—organizations face challenges with their existing systems. A significant issue is siloed and unauthoritative identity data management, further complicated by data privacy regulations that disrupt identity management across organizational divisions. This challenge is magnified by the need to balance stringent security with a fluid user experience, rendering traditional, inflexible CIAM solutions less effective.</p>



<p>With the market’s maturity, dissatisfaction with standard, non-customizable CIAM solutions is growing. About 49% of respondents, particularly from financial services, are considering switching providers to seek more advanced, customizable solutions that better integrate across applications and manage identities seamlessly. This drive for innovation is fueled by emerging security and compliance challenges and the necessity to support scalable operations and enhance customer engagement and retention effectively.</p>



<p>The CIAM market is shifting towards more flexible, customizable, and integrative solutions. Providers differentiate themselves by incorporating advanced features such as user behavior analytics, adaptive authentication, and API-first capabilities that allow organizations to adapt their CIAM systems without complete overhauls. These “plug-and-play” solutions enable businesses to seamlessly integrate new functionalities into existing systems, catering to specific operational and regional needs.</p>



<p>Additionally, CIAM’s strategic importance is increasingly recognized across business units, fostering more collaborative approaches in implementing and managing these solutions. With 89% of surveyed organizations acknowledging reduced business costs through CIAM and a significant percentage reporting enhanced revenue and customer retention, the strategic value of CIAM is clear.</p>



<p>As the market continues to evolve, organizations are urged to reassess their CIAM strategies, considering solutions that offer the flexibility to adapt to changing legal and technological landscapes, thus ensuring continuous improvement in customer management and operational efficiency.</p>



 What’s Next for Financial Services 



<p>The financial services sector is currently at a significant turning point regarding Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM). A recent survey has revealed that almost half of the businesses within this industry are contemplating a shift towards more advanced CIAM solutions. This indicates that the next phase would involve adopting CIAM systems that enhance security and customer experience and provide a unified view of customer identities across all platforms. This shift is crucial for financial institutions that seek to replace legacy systems with more integrated and flexible solutions that can adapt to diverse regulatory environments and complex customer interactions. </p>



<p>As these organizations focus on scalability and compliance, they will likely lead the demand for next-generation CIAM capabilities. These capabilities may include improved identity verification processes and more sophisticated data management technologies. Transitioning to <a href="https://medium.com/@razi_chaudhry/explaining-the-blueprint-for-an-adaptive-ciam-platforms-ciam-part-2-8f35997ce918">next-generation CIAM systems</a> is essential in supporting the financial services sector’s unique needs, such as managing sensitive financial data and complying with stringent global regulations while ensuring a seamless customer journey from onboarding to ongoing engagement. Financial institutions must ensure that they can maintain the trust and confidence of their customers by providing secure and reliable services. As such, adopting next-generation CIAM capabilities will enable these organizations to deliver exceptional customer experiences while ensuring the highest level of data security and privacy.</p>



<p>The shift towards advanced CIAM systems will allow financial institutions to streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve overall customer satisfaction. Adopting these systems will also play a critical role in helping financial institutions stay ahead of the competition and meet the evolving needs of their customers.</p>

  The minimum threshold for Nigeria’s Crypto Travel Rule is $1,000 (1,380,680 NGN).  Transactions below this threshold require only the names and wallet addresses of the parties involved.  All crypto transfers must be treated as cross-border and adhere to stringent wire transfer requirements.  <p>Nigeria, grappling with high inflation and unemployment, has one of the highest crypto adoption rates. The crypto ownership in the country is expected to be as high as <a href="https://www.itedgenews.africa/26-crypto-adoption-in-nigeria-statistics-facts-and-usage-trends-2024/">46%</a>, with almost <a href="https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-s-cryptocurrency-crackdown-will-have-consequences-experts-say/7523302.html">13 million</a> cryptocurrency holders, more than any other African&nbsp;country.</p><p>Yet, Nigerian regulators have yet to provide a clear framework. However, authorities have been working on it and have strict <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">anti-money laundering (AML), countering the financing of terrorism (CFT)</a>, and counter-proliferation financing (CPF) compliance rules.</p> Crypto Travel Rule in&nbsp;Nigeria <p>In 2022, the Nigerian SEC outlined general requirements for VASPs, covering Know Your Customer (KYC), Customer Due Diligence (CDD), and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule</a>.</p><p>Under the FATF Travel Rule, regulators have issued guidelines for the licensing and registration of VASPs, allowing banks to provide accounts and offer services to these entities in Nigeria. The Central Bank can also impose sanctions such as fines, license suspension, and activity&nbsp;bans.</p><p>To align with international attitudes, the regulator has also created an AML/CFT/CPF framework that requires entities to appoint a compliance officer, maintain a compliance manual, and implement employee education and training programs.</p><p>For CDD, entities must conduct ongoing due diligence, perform Enhanced Customer Due Diligence (ECDD) for higher-risk clients, and verify beneficial ownership at the outset of business relationships or transactions. They must also establish risk management systems to identify Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and monitor and report any suspicious transactions. All transaction records and related information must be retained for at least five&nbsp;years.</p> Compliance Requirements <p>All crypto transfers are to be treated as cross-border transfers and must adhere to the requirements for cross-border wire transfers. These obligations also extend to non-VASP Capital Market Operators (CMOs) handling crypto transfers for customers.</p><p>Originating VASPs are required to obtain, verify, and retain complete originator and beneficiary information. This information must be transmitted securely and immediately to the beneficiary VASP and provided to authorities upon&nbsp;request.</p><p>Beneficiary VASPs must also secure and verify complete originator and beneficiary information, ensuring its accuracy and availability to authorities when&nbsp;needed.</p><p>CMOs must acquire and verify the following originator information:</p>  Full name of the originator  Originator’s wallet&nbsp;address  Physical address, national identity number, incorporation number, or business registration number if the originator is not a natural&nbsp;person  <p>For beneficiaries, CMOs need to&nbsp;collect:</p>  Beneficiary’s name  Beneficiary’s wallet&nbsp;address  These requirements apply to transactions exceeding $1,000 (1,380,680 NGN).  <p>Transactions below this threshold are exempt but must still include the names and wallet addresses of both the originator and the beneficiary.</p><p>CMOs are also required to verify this information if there is any suspicion of money laundering or terrorist financing.</p><p>Moreover, VASPs, according to the Nigerian securities regulator, are required to be incorporated and maintain an office within&nbsp;Nigeria.</p><p>In March 2024, the regulator suggested a fivefold increase in the registration fee to be submitted alongside license applications. Moreover, the CEO or managing director of the crypto exchange applying for a license must also reside in&nbsp;Nigeria.</p><p>These proposed rule changes will apply to foreign operators targeting Nigerian users but not to financial portals or tech firms providing supporting infrastructure or software to crypto exchanges.</p> Global Context and Comparisons <p>Over the past few years, Nigeria has initiated several steps to regulate the crypto space. These measures aim to remove Nigeria from the FATF’s Gray List. The IMF has found that gray-listing can have a “significant negative impact on a country’s capital flows,” with its GDP decreasing by as much as 7.6&nbsp;percent.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/almost-70-of-all-fatf-assessed-countries-have-implemented-the-crypto-travel-rule">latest FATF report on the status of Travel Rule implementation</a> rated Nigeria as ‘partially compliant’ based on its performance in several&nbsp;areas:</p>  Conducting a crypto and VASP risk assessment  Passing a law on VASP registration  Implementing AML/CFT&nbsp;measures  Adopting the travel rule for&nbsp;VASPs   Concluding Thoughts <p>Over the past year, a more than 68% drop in its fiat currency, the Naira, along with foreign exchange shortages, high remittance costs, recessions, and an unstable political situation, have increased the appeal of crypto assets in Africa’s second-largest economy.</p><p>Driven by these factors, the Sub-Saharan African country has taken steps to establish a clear regulatory framework for crypto assets in accordance with international standards. This means that both local and foreign crypto companies must adopt these rules to cater to and thrive in Nigeria’s growing crypto&nbsp;market.</p> FAQs on Crypto Travel Rule&nbsp;Nigeria  Q1: What is the Crypto Travel Rule in&nbsp;Nigeria? <p>The Crypto Travel Rule in Nigeria requires that any crypto transaction exceeding $1,000 must include detailed originator and beneficiary information to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing.</p> Q2: What are the requirements for crypto transactions under this&nbsp;rule? <p>For transactions above the $1,000 threshold, originating and beneficiary Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) must obtain, verify, and retain complete information about the parties involved and ensure it is transmitted securely.</p> Q3: What happens with transactions that do not meet the minimum threshold for the Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule? <p>Transactions below the $1,000 threshold are exempt from the detailed reporting requirements but must still include the names and wallet addresses of the originator and beneficiary.</p> ‍About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>The recent validated what many of us in the industry already knew: Identity has become the leading attack vector. The 2024 report showed a 71% increase in valid identities used in cyberattacks year-over-year. What really puts it into perspective is the realization that you are just as likely to have your valid identity used in a cyberattack as you are to see a phishing attack in your organization. Hackers don’t hack in; they log in.</p>



<p>The risk of valid identities being used as the entry point by bad actors is expected to continue with the ever-increasing applications and systems being added in today’s hybrid environments. We are finding an overwhelming majority of organizations are choosing to use different identity vendors that offer the best capability for each use case, instead of consolidating with one vendor. The use of various identity tools is further compounded with managing access to your legacy application infrastructure, integrating new users during mergers and acquisitions. The hybrid reality has also led to an inconsistent user experience for your workers, partners and customers, an increased risk of identity-based attacks, and added an additional burden on your admins.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To solve the identity challenges created by today’s hybrid environments, businesses need a versatile solution that complements existing identity solutions while effectively integrating various identity and access management (IAM) silos into a cohesive whole. Solutions that help create a consistent user experience for your workers, partners and customers across all applications and systems. Organizations and industry analysts refer to this connected IAM infrastructure as an Identity fabric. Organizations have begun to move toward connecting multiple IAM solutions through a common identity fabric.</p>



 Securing the digital journey 



<p>To protect the integrity of digital user journeys, organizations use a range of tools spanning bot mitigation, identity verification and affirmation, user authentication, authorization, fraud detection and adjacent capabilities such as risk analytics and access management. Building and maintaining these integrations is complex and carries an operational overhead regarding time and resources. These various tools don’t easily interconnect and don’t generate standardized types of signals. As a result, the interpretation of the varied risk signals is siloed across different events along the digital user journey. This lack of an integrated approach to managing risk along the digital user journey hinders the adoption of continuous adaptive trust principles and adds undue risk into the system. Various, disconnected identity tools prohibit you from creating that consistent user experience and security controls. Orchestration solutions improve the efficacy and efficiency of risk management along digital user journeys.</p>



 Identity orchestration 



<p>Identity and access management projects are complex enough with many taking 12-18 months. They require skilled staff to solve today’s identity challenges such as integrating IAM silos together and modernizing access to legacy applications. Many of the solutions out there are not helpful and actually create more vendor lock-in. What is really needed is an open integration ecosystem that allows for flexibility and integrations that are simple and require fewer skills to accomplish. This is where an <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/verify-identity/identity-fabric">identity fabric</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/identity-orchestration">identity orchestration</a> come into play. Orchestration is the critical component and the integration glue for an identity fabric. Without it, building an identity fabric would be resource-intensive and costly. Orchestration allows more intelligent decision-making and simplifies everything from onboarding to offboarding and enables you to build consistent security policies. Identity orchestration takes the burden off your administrators by quickly and easily automating processes at scale. This enables consistent, frictionless user experiences, while improving identity risk posture, and helping you avoid vendor lock-in.&nbsp;</p>



 Benefits of identity orchestration 



 Design consistent, frictionless user experiences 



<p>Identity orchestration enables you to streamline consistent and frictionless experiences for your workers, partners and customers across the entire identity lifecycle. From account creation to login to passwordless authentication using passkeys to account management, makes it easy to orchestrate identity journeys across your identity stack, facilitating a frictionless experience. IBM’s identity orchestration flow designer enables you to build consistent, secure authentication journeys for users regardless of the application. These journeys can be built effortlessly with low-code, no-code orchestration engines to simplify administrative burden.</p>



 Fraud and risk protection 



<p>Orchestration allows you to combine fraud signals, decisions and mitigation controls, such as various types of authenticators and identity verification technologies. You can clearly define how trusted individuals are granted access and how untrusted users are mitigated with security authentication. This approach overlays a consistent and continuous overlaying risk and fraud context across identity journey. IBM Security® Verify orchestration allows you to bring together fraud and risk signals to detect threats. It also provides native, modern and strong phishing-resistant risk-based authentication to all applications, including legacy apps, with drag-and-drop work-flows.</p>



 Avoid vendor lock-in with identity-agnostic modernization 



<p>Organizations have invested in many existing tools and assets across their IAM stack. This can range from existing directories to legacy applications to existing fraud signals, to name a few. IBM Security Verify identity orchestration enables organizations to bring their existing tools to apply consistent, continuous and contextual orchestration across all identity journeys.It enables you to easily consolidate and unify directories, modernize legacy applications and streamline third-party integration for multifactor authentication (MFA), and risk and notification systems</p>



 Leverage IBM Security Verify 



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/verify">IBM Security Verify</a> simplifies IAM with orchestration to reduce complexity, improves your identity risk posture, and simplifies the user journey by enabling you to easily integrate multiple identity system providers (IdPs) across hybrid environments through low-code or no-code experiences. </p>



<p>IBM provides identity-agnostic modernization tools enabling you to manage, migrate and enforce consistent identity security from one IAM solution to another while complementing your existing identity tools. By consolidating user journeys and policies, you can maintain security consistency across all systems and applications, creating frictionless user experiences and security controls across your entire identity landscape.</p>

<p>The healthcare industry faces arguably the highest stakes when it comes to data governance. For starters, healthcare organizations constantly encounter vast (and ever-increasing) amounts of highly regulated personal data.</p>



<p>The impact of healthcare data usage on people’s lives lies at the heart of why data governance in healthcare is so crucial.In healthcare, managing the accuracy, quality and integrity of data is the focus of data governance. When healthcare organizations excel at this, it can lead to better clinical decision-making, improved patient outcomes and prevention of medical errors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite this, many healthcare organizations face challenges. Healthcare organizations need a strong data governance framework to help ensure compliance with regulations like the&nbsp;<a href="https://manta.io/blog/healthcare-and-gdpr-why-data-lineage-is-key-for-compliance">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) in the US and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU.</a></p>



<p>How can a healthcare provider improve its data governance strategy, especially considering the ripple effect of small changes?&nbsp; Data lineage can help.With data lineage, your team establishes a strong data governance strategy, enabling them to gain full control of your<a href="https://manta.io/manta-for-healthcare">&nbsp;healthcare data</a>&nbsp;pipeline.</p>



 Understanding data governance in healthcare 



<p>The need for a strong data governance framework is undeniable in any highly-regulated industry, but the healthcare industry is unique because it collects and processes massive amounts of personal data to make informed decisions about patient care. One broken or incomplete piece of data can trigger not only noncompliance and audit issues but also harm real people. For example:</p>



 
 Healthcare providers regularly rely on medical records to diagnose and establish treatment plans for patients. Inaccuracies in these medical records leading to misdiagnoses, medication errors or delayed care can have serious consequences. 



 Inaccuracies might also lead to more delays or complications with insurance coverage.&nbsp; 



 Healthcare organizations must adhere to data privacy regulations like HIPAA and GDPR. Noncompliance with these laws is costly and can damage your reputation, besides posing a danger to patients and practitioners when data breaches occur. 
 



<p>Conversely, confidence in the accuracy and consistency of your data can minimize the risk of adverse health outcomes, rather than merely reacting to or causing them.&nbsp;Also, using predictive analytics can help identify trends, patterns and potential future health risks in your patients.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that most&nbsp;<a href="https://manta.io/blog/customer-success-story-christus-health">electronic health records (EHR) systems</a>&nbsp;offer predictive analytics capabilities. The accuracy of these analytics is limited by the accuracy of the data used.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thus, having a comprehensive understanding of the data environment and a clear chain of custody becomes imperative. Detecting leaks and pressure points depends on implementing a strong data governance strategy, with data lineage as a critical component.</p>



 Challenges in data governance for healthcare and how data lineage can help 



<p>Data governance can help healthcare organizations maximize the accuracy and security of their data assets. At the same time, implementing a data governance framework poses some challenges, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://manta.io/blog/how-to-improve-your-data-quality-strategy">data quality&nbsp;</a>issues, data silos security and privacy concerns.&nbsp;</p>



 1. Data quality issues 



<p>Positive business decisions and outcomes rely on trustworthy, high-quality data. However,&nbsp;healthcare facilities continue to face data quality&nbsp;issues despite the best efforts of business leaders, primarily due to the sheer number of people inputting data and the high-pressure situations in which data entry often occurs.</p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2766834">study conducted by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)</a>&nbsp;revealed that errors were found in the records of one-fifth of patients with access to ambulatory care notes. Among those patients, 21% identified the errors as critical, with common issues including diagnostic errors, medication data errors and incomplete or inaccurate EHR data conversions. These errors are crucial and can occur daily.&nbsp;To prevent these errors, it’s critical for data flows to be mapped out and for issues with data quality to be flagged by using root-cause analysis, thereby reducing the impact on patients.</p>



 2. Data silos 



<p>In the healthcare industry, where an estimated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rbccm.com/en/gib/healthcare/episode/the_healthcare_data_explosion">30% of the world’s total data</a> is generated, patient data often remains unstructured and scattered across disparate systems. The consequence? An incomplete picture of patient health and multiple sources of truth prevents you from achieving&nbsp;the <a href="https://manta.io/blog/planning-for-healthcare-data-visibility-in-2023">benefits of data visibility</a>&nbsp;such as informed patient care. Issues with compliance and audit conduct also arise due to these scattered data sources.</p>



<p>The solution lies in the ability to visualize patient data from different sources in one place. That’s exactly what enterprise-wide data lineage does. Data lineage extends throughout your data environment to create a comprehensive map of all your data flows and dependencies, eliminating data silos effectively.</p>



<p>However, not all data lineage solutions can visualize data from different silos. Some platforms only allow you to see data stored within their specific catalog. Opting for a catalog-agnostic solution helps you address this issue.&nbsp;</p>



 &nbsp;3. Security concerns and chain of custody 



<p>Healthcare organizations are in a unique position because both depend on cross-departmental information sharing to facilitate patient care and are bound by strict regulations to help ensure secure data transmission.</p>



<p>As part of both&nbsp;HIPAA and GDPR compliance, healthcare organizations need to provide auditors with details regarding the chain of custody of patient records. This includes information on who accessed the records and the time and location of access. Establishing a chain of custody for data stored in an EHR system accessible across several devices within a medical facility can be laborious and time-intensive, especially when dealing with so many records that exist in a paper format or have been manually entered or scanned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Data lineage significantly reduces the amount of effort needed to establish a chain of custody within&nbsp;<a href="https://manta.io/how-christus-health-used-data-lineage">healthcare information systems</a>.&nbsp;By mapping data flows, you can trace the journey of your data backward to see where and when it was changed in your systems. Combined with your governance efforts that establish the meaning, quality and stewardship of the data stores in this chain of custody, you can deliver the crucial data pipeline information required by your auditors.</p>



 Better patient care and predictive analytics 



<p>With high-quality data, you can provide well-informed, cross-collaborative and personalized patient care. You also place deeper trust in the predictive analytics within your EHR system to predict patient conditions, disease progression, hospital overstays, readmissions, and more. All this relies on reliable data and requires data lineage for governance.</p>



 Enhanced regulatory compliance 



<p>If you’re struggling with data silos, data quality or proving chain of custody, you might also be finding it difficult to establish and prove compliance with healthcare-related regulations like HIPAA and GDPR. Data lineage can help you establish your chain of information flow and dependencies to auditors clearly and quickly, which is key to compliance.&nbsp;</p>



 Increased data security and privacy 



<p>In the healthcare industry, data privacy is integral. When data lineage creates a map of your data environment, it does so without sharing or processing any private information. Instead, it uses&nbsp;<a href="https://manta.io/blog/how-active-metadata-makes-your-data-lineage-insights-actionable">active metadata</a>. That means that you can create a strong data governance framework without sacrificing patient privacy.</p>



 Improved operational efficiency and cost savings&nbsp; 



<p>Mapping out data flows manually is a time and resource-intensive process, especially in the highly-complex healthcare industry. Among the top advantages of automated data lineage for data governance are its operational efficiency and cost-effectiveness. You can save money and time on labor costs and focus your efforts on what matters most to your organization.</p>



 We’re 90% faster 



<blockquote>
“Our ETL teams can identify the impacts of planned ETL process changes 90% faster than before.”
Robert D, BI Team Leader at GEMU</blockquote>



 90% increase in analyzing source system changes 



<blockquote>
“Effort for analyzing the impact of a source system change has decreased by at least 90%, from hours to minutes (or seconds).”
Michael L., BI Manager at Schumacher Clinical</blockquote>



 Data governance and compliance&nbsp; 



<p>In the healthcare industry, ensuring compliance with regulations like HIPAA and GDPR is another important piece of data governance, crucial for both protecting patient privacy and facilitating secure information-sharing critical for the highest level of patient care.</p>



<p>Some healthcare organizations today still struggle to&nbsp;maintain compliance with HIPAA and GDPR. Meanwhile, the world’s regulatory landscape is becoming increasingly complex. In fact, Gartner® predicts that by the end of 2024,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/digital-markets/insights/importance-of-data-privacy">75% of the world will have its data protected</a>&nbsp;under modern privacy regulations. Given that the healthcare industry is generating new regulated patient data by the second, now is the time to kickstart an effective data governance strategy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that these regulations don’t just apply to patient care-focused organizations. Nearly every area of healthcare processed large quantities of protected data, including:</p>



 
 Biotechnology companies 



 Health insurance providers 



 Medical device manufacturers 



 Pharmaceutical companies 
 



<p>With data lineage, you get a detailed map of your data flows that help ensure that you are processing and securing data within the strict requirements of regulatory frameworks like HIPAA and GDPR.&nbsp;You can also more easily prove the chain of custody to auditors, who will need to see who has had access to your regulated data assets and apply stricter controls around who has access.</p>



 Next steps to increase data security and enhance compliance 



<p>The modern healthcare industry is undeniable in its complexity,&nbsp;with the emergence of EHR systems, the proliferation of&nbsp;healthcare data, and an increasingly complex regulatory landscape contributing to this complexity.</p>



<p>To keep up, healthcare companies today need to implement data governance. A strong data governance framework helps ensure that you can verify that the data you’re collecting, processing and using is accurate, consistent and dependable. Without it, you risk making poorly informed decisions about patient care based on erroneous data or inaccurate predictive insights. These decisions can have serious or even fatal outcomes for patients.</p>



<p>Data governance is also integral when complying with healthcare data privacy regulations like HIPAA and GDPR. Any healthcare organization processing protected data needs to have a data governance strategy in place to remain compliant with these regulations and be prepared for any new regulations that might arise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite challenges like data quality issues, data silos, security concerns and proving chain of custody, there is a solution: automated data lineage.&nbsp;By using automated data lineage, your organization can overcome common data governance barriers, improve patient care, enhance regulatory compliance, increase data security and privacy and enhance operational efficiency while reducing costs.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Last week, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/public-preview-external-authentication-methods-in-microsoft/ba-p/4078808">Microsoft announced</a> the public preview of external authentication methods (EAM) for Entra ID. As a close partner, HYPR has worked extensively with Microsoft on the new offering and we are excited to be one of the first external authentication method integrations. This means organizations can now choose HYPR phishing-resistant authentication for their Entra ID MFA method, use it in Entra ID Conditional Access policies, Privileged Identity Management, and more.</p>  
<p>Our goal at Microsoft Security is to empower our customers with cutting-edge security solutions. The integration of Entra ID external authentication methods with HYPR reflects this mission, providing our customers with the flexibility to employ their preferred MFA methods, including phishing resistant MFA, to defend their environments against evolving threats."</p> 
<p>– Natee Pretikul, Principal Product Management Lead, Microsoft Security</p> 
 What Are Entra ID External Authentication Methods?  
<p>The external authentication methods feature was developed to replace the current Entra ID custom controls capability. The EAM solution uses industry standards and supports an open model, and provides far greater functionality than custom controls. With EAM, organizations can use their preferred authentication provider to satisfy MFA policy requirements, managing it the same way as Microsoft-native authenticators.</p> 
 Key Benefits of the HYPR and Microsoft External Authentication Methods Integration  
<p>The new integration benefits both HYPR and Microsoft customers on multiple levels.</p> 
<p>How the HYPR Entra ID external authentication method integration works</p> 
 Greater Flexibility and Choice For Your Entra ID Environments&nbsp;  
<p>With the HYPR–EAM integration, organizations can seamlessly use HYPR as an Entra ID authentication method to meet multi-factor authentication requirements, without the need for federation. Unlike federation configurations, the user identity is established and managed in Microsoft Entra ID. Essentially, HYPR’s leading phishing-resistant MFA becomes a like-native authentication option in the Entra ID ecosystem, and can be invoked to satisfy MFA requirements for Conditional Access policies, Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and Identity Protection sign-in risk policies.</p> 
 Consolidate and Unify Authentication Processes  
<p>Many enterprises have complex IT environments with multiple identity providers and sign-in processes. These systems operate in silos, creating security blind spots, inefficiencies, and inconsistent user experiences. By choosing a platform-agnostic solution like HYPR, organizations can use the same secure, phishing-resistant authentication across IAM systems and workflows. HYPR already provides tight integrations with Microsoft Entra ID; the new EAM feature expands that connection. It empowers organizations to further consolidate their identity security and create consistent, unified MFA experiences for their users across all Microsoft and non-Microsoft environments.</p> 
 Improve Visibility and Control  
<p>The Microsoft external authentication method integration puts some additional powerful tools into the hands of HYPR customers. Administrators and security teams can view all HYPR authentication events in the Entra ID admin center when HYPR is used as an EAM method.</p> 
<p>Teams also can define highly granular Conditional Access controls, based on the type of authentication factor a user applies as they authenticate with HYPR. For example, access policies can vary depending on whether someone uses a fingerprint, facial recognition or PIN, to add even stronger levels of security assurance for specific use cases or resources.</p> 
 Learn More About HYPR as a Microsoft Entra ID External Authentication Method  
<p>Microsoft Entra ID EAM is now in public preview. Read <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/how-to-authentication-external-method-manage">Microsoft’s technical documentation</a> for more details about how this feature works. Current HYPR customers looking to join the public preview should contact their customer success representative.

<p>We’ve got a follow-up to Holochain 0.2.6, which was a big one (it was the <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/holochain-0-2-is-here/">first recommended release</a> in the 0.2 line). This one brings a new ability to manage clone cells from a coordinator zome (yes, you read that right!), and the Rustdoc is now building again (a blessing to any devs who have needed to read the 0.2 documentation). There are some breaking changes, but only for those who are using the conductor APIs directly rather than through a client.</p><p>I also want to mention The Weave, a project that my colleague Eric and a few close collaborators have been working on in various forms over the years. Originally <a href="https://archive.org/details/dwebcamp2022_pauldaoust_1866">demoed</a> as a groupware container called We, the <a href="https://eric.harris-braun.com/blog/2022/07/26/id-390?ref=blog.holochain.org">philosophy</a> behind it has matured into a full vision for end-user-composable applications. What the heck does that mean? Skip to the bottom of this article to find out.</p> Holochain 0.2.8: Fix WebSocket binding <p>Release date: 30 April 2024<br>HDI compatibility: 0.3.x<br>HDK compatibility: 0.2.x (upgrade to 0.2.7 or newer to get the new features)<br>JS client compatibility: 0.16.x<br>Rust client compatibility: 0.4.x</p><p>This is a patch release that fixes the port binding issue in 0.2.7 (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/3731?ref=blog.holochain.org">#3731</a>). We now recommend this release for general development.</p> Holochain 0.2.7: Backend clone management, Websocket fixes, documentation <p>NOT RECOMMENDED FOR USE<br>Release date: 9 April 2024<br>HDI compatibility: 0.3.x<br>HDK compatibility: 0.2.x (upgrade to 0.2.7 to get the new features)<br>JS client compatibility: 0.16.x<br>Rust client compatibility: 0.4.x</p><p>NOTE: We’re not recommending this release for development work or distribution to end-users. We introduced a change to how Holochain binds the conductor API websocket to local interfaces, which caused it to get confused when the local interface supports both IPv4 and IPv6. If you scaffolded a hApp with Holochain 0.2.7, we recommend you run <code>cargo update</code> and <code>nix flake update</code> right away to save yourself some hassle.</p><p>That said, there are some interesting changes in here that you should know about!</p><p>The first big news is that clone management API functions, which were previously only available in the <a href="https://docs.rs/holochain_conductor_api/latest/holochain_conductor_api/?ref=blog.holochain.org">app and admin APIs</a>, are now <a href="https://docs.rs/hdk/latest/hdk/clone/index.html?ref=blog.holochain.org">available as HDK functions</a>. There are a few differences:</p>  <code>create_clone_cell</code> only takes an existing cell ID, not a role ID.  <code>delete_clone_cell</code> was previously only available to the admin API.  <p>The second point probably needs a bit of explaining. Unlike <code>disable_clone_cell</code>, <code>delete_clone_cell</code> is a somewhat destructive operation, because it makes it impossible to bring a clone cell and its data back to life (although the data is still technically recoverable if you know how to open up the database). That’s why it’s never been part of the app API where any old client could access it. These new HDK functions, by contrast, can only operate on the hApp that the calling cell lives in. We’re working on locking down the app API so only clients authorised to access an app can actually access it, which means we could safely make <code>delete_clone_cell</code> available to clients, but in the meantime this gives you a way to securely clean up cells once they’re no longer needed.</p><p>If you think you’d find it useful to manage clones from the back end, we’d like you to try out these new HDK functions and <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/issues?ref=blog.holochain.org">tell us what you think</a>. We may, for instance, change <code>create_clone_cell</code> to match how the corresponding app API function works in 0.3 or 0.4.</p><p>The other big news is that we’ve <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/3372?ref=blog.holochain.org">cleaned up</a> the WebSocket code, so the app and admin APIs should have fewer bugs such as dropped connections (particularly when the conductor hits 100% CPU consumption). This does result in breaking changes, but only if you’re writing a Rust-based app that consumes the <code>holochain_websocket</code> crate directly. Anyone who calls the conductor APIs instead (which is most of you, including those who use the officially supported JavaScript and Rust clients) won’t be affected. If you don’t know whether you should care about the breaking changes, then you’re one of the ones who shouldn’t 🌝</p><p>Lastly, <code>holochain --build-info</code> now tells you the Lair keystore version.</p><p>Read about it all in the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.2.7/CHANGELOG.md?ref=blog.holochain.org">changelog</a>, and make sure you scroll down because all the above updates happened in the two RCs before this release.</p> Holochain 0.1 retiring, 0.3 entering RC phase, 0.4 release cycle started <p>Now that Holochain 0.2.8 is the recommended release, the 0.1.x series won’t receive any more updates, and we’ll eventually shut down the centralised infrastructure that supports 0.1. We don’t have a specific time for shutting it down, but it should be considered end-of-life. We’re recommending that all developers still using Holochain 0.1 update their hApps to Holochain 0.2.8 now and distribute the update to their users as soon as possible.</p><p>Now, on to Holochain 0.3. Most hApp devs are already using a weekly release of Holochain 0.3 in their work, for instance Moss (see below). It contains a lot of stability and performance improvements that will be a welcome upgrade for devs and users.&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve decided it’s time to acknowledge this reality and put an API freeze on Holochain 0.3.x. The first release candidate should be out soon. The <code>develop</code> branch of the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain?ref=blog.holochain.org"><code>holochain/holochain</code> repo</a>, and the weekly channel of Holonix, are now tracking the 0.4.x release series. If you’re already on 0.3, you’ll want to change the channel from <code>weekly</code> to <code>0_3_rc</code> so you don’t get bumped accidentally to 0.4 on your next nix flake update:</p> <code>// ...&nbsp; inputs = {
	versions.url&nbsp; = "github:holochain/holochain?dir=versions/0_3_rc";
// ...</code> <p>Once the first 0.3 release is recommended for general use, 0.2.x will go into maintenance mode, only receiving critical bug fixes as needed.</p><p>Note: Some devs may have seen a 0.3.0 release on crates.io or GitHub. This was an automation error, and we’ve removed it from crates.io, so the first official version of Holochain 0.3 will be 0.3.1 or higher.</p> The Weave: growing thrivable social fabric <p>I’m a big fan of tools. That’s why I like using my computer: it’s an infinite box of tools that I can use to get work done, communicate with friends and colleagues, create art, organise family memories, etc. And I like tools that feel like tools — <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy?ref=blog.holochain.org">small programs that do one thing</a>, do it well, work well with each other, and use common data formats. This is brilliant, if you ask me, and it makes me feel like I have superpowers whenever I need to do something complicated.</p><p>I am not a big fan of silos. It frustrates me that my colleagues and I have to log into six or seven different cloud platforms just to get a Dev Pulse published. And each of them has its own separate content organisation system, discussion system, etc, etc. We end up having to recreate the same structures in multiple places. (And so do the developers — if you’re creating a kanban app, you can’t just drop Slack into it and get commenting for free; you have to write your own commenting feature from scratch.)</p><p>As far as I can tell, this silo thing isn’t designed to serve my colleagues and me. Perhaps it isn’t even designed. It’s probably just an accidental outcome of companies working with what they know. Or maybe it’s some business folks deciding they can only make money if they hold their customers tight. But whatever the reason, it’s wasteful and annoying.</p><p>That’s why, when my colleague Eric showed me what he and the <a href="https://lightningrodlabs.org/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Lightningrod Labs</a> team were doing with <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/we?ref=blog.holochain.org">We (now called Moss)</a> in February, it was like he’d opened the door in a stuffy room. This was exactly how I’d wished my applications worked for at least fifteen years. Sure, it was a little rough around the edges — Eric acknowledged that — but I could see the potential lying just beyond the bugs and unimplemented features.</p> The vision of The Weave: a protocol for social spaces <p>I won’t get too deep into the philosophy — I’ll let <a href="https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/we?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Weave’s new website</a> do that — but I’ll give you a little teaser: what HTTP did for information, Holochain is trying to do for social spaces. But HTTP alone wasn’t enough. It needed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make an experience that people would want to use. In a similar way, the Weave is a formal specification that overlays a set of design principles to make Holochain more accessible for devs building social tools.</p><p>HTML introduced pages and, most importantly, hyperlinks as a way to connect them together. This made the Web make sense. It was just enough structure for developers to run with, and it resulted in an explosion of creativity that gave us the web of today. But neither HTTP nor HTML gave us open standard for social spaces, so these concepts got enclosed by big players like Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>Holochain gives us open standards for permissionless social spaces. And what HTML et al did for HTTP, the Weave does for Holochain: assets that belong to your group can be linked together with ease.</p><p>How does this work?</p>  A tool is something that a group can install, and it gives them the power to work with assets of a certain type (chat threads, images, files, folders, kanban cards, calendar entries, etc).  Wherever it makes sense, an asset can have links on it that connect to other assets provided by the same tool — or some other completely different tool.  <p>And that second point is what changes everything. Now I can add a conversation thread to a calendar entry if I like. I can drop links on my kanban card that point to cells in a table (there’s already an Airtable clone available). We can drop cards, boards, emails, messages, conversations, and drawings into a folder hierarchy that’s shared across all our tools. Or three or four independent folder hierarchies, if we like.</p> Why do I care about this? <p>I get excited about this as both a user and a developer. As a user, I’m not constrained by the walls that others have created for me — I can stitch together tools in ways that make sense for me. As a practical example, my team can gather all the stuff pertaining to one Dev Pulse into one place. (Or will be able to, once someone comes up with a replacement for Canva.) I expect this will smooth out a lot of the bumps we face when we’re working on a written piece.</p><p>As a developer, it means I won’t have to reinvent everything when I eventually make my <a href="https://blog.holochain.org/scaffolding-my-first-happ-in-10-minutes/">seed swapping hApp</a> into an awesome working product. I won’t have to re-create messaging, reputation, user profile, or categorisation features — I can just focus on the core thing that matters, a way to let people find each other’s seed packet offerings.</p><p>Eric believes this sort of easy composability means that developers will feel empowered to create that little tool they’ve always wished existed. When you only have to focus on your core thing, the task seems much less frightening.</p><p>I think that part of the reason more great tools don’t get built is that people think you have to have a full-featured app, a team of devs to handle feature requests, and a business model in place for when your user base (and your cloud hosting costs) scale 100×.</p><p>But what would you create if you only had to think about one little thing, the thing you care about most? What is that thing for you?</p><p>I’d love it if you shared your little tool ideas in the <a href="https://discord.gg/jNCtnNVVGC?ref=blog.holochain.org">The Weave channel on our Discord</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://theweave.social/moss?ref=blog.holochain.org">download Moss, the first ‘frame’ implementing The Weave</a>, try some of the early stage tools, and <a href="https://theweave.social/?ref=blog.holochain.org">read the spec</a> to get an understanding of how tools in The Weave are made for composability.</p><p>(Fun fact: the equivalent of a ‘browser’ in The Weave is called a ‘frame’, a word that my lovely bride — a weaver — contributed! A frame loom is a special kind of weaving loom used for making tapestries. Kinda fitting for a program for groups weaving a shared story, don’t you think?)</p><p>Cover photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@alandelacruz4?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">ALAN DE LA CRUZ</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/woman-in-white-sweater-lying-on-bed-3irPFKfB0o0?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash"> Unsplash</a></p>

<p>Understanding how microservice applications works on Kubernetes is important in software development. In this article, we will discuss why observing microservice applications on Kubernetes is crucial and several metrics that you should focus on as part of your observability strategy.</p>



 Why should you observe microservice health running on Kubernetes and what are the Kubernetes metrics you should monitor? 



<p>Consider a large e-commerce platform that utilizes microservices architecture deployed on Kubernetes clusters. Each microservice, responsible for specific functionalities such as inventory management, order processing and payment handling, operates independently and communicates with others via APIs which are critical to your business/ service growth.</p>



<p>In such a <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/debunking-observability-myths-part-3-why-observability-works-in-every-environment-not-just-large-scale-systems/">complex environment</a>, ensuring seamless operation and detecting issues proactively becomes imperative and can be challenging.</p>



<p>Observability in this scenario can assist with real-time insights into the performance, availability and interdependencies of these microservices and the Kubernetes application.</p>



<p>Observability is essential for several reasons:</p>



 
 Early detection of issues: Microservices are distributed and interconnected, making it challenging to identify issues when they arise. Observing their health allows you to detect problems early on, minimizing downtime and potential service disruptions. Using Instana you will get 1-second granularity, which helps you detect problems faster than other solutions. 



 Reliability: Monitoring microservice health ensures that your application remains reliable. By tracking metrics such as response times, error rates and resource utilization, you can proactively address any performance issues before they impact users. 



 Scale efficiently: Kubernetes allows for dynamic scaling of microservices based on demand. Observing their health helps you make informed decisions about when and how to scale services to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization. 



 Meet SLAs: Many organizations have service-level agreements (SLAs) that define expected levels of service availability and performance. Observing microservice health helps you meet these SLAs by ensuring that your services are running smoothly and meeting performance targets. 
 



<p>By monitoring Kubernetes health, organizations can proactively identify and address issues, optimize resource usage and maintain optimal cluster performance. </p>



 These are the key metrics that can be measured: 



 Cluster availability:  



<p>Monitoring Kubernetes cluster availability metrics helps ensure that the clusters are up and running and are healthy. Metrics such as cluster uptime and pod status provide insights into the overall health of the cluster. They are at the highest and most important layer and can provide complete visibility into what’s happening in your environment.</p>



 Pod metrics:  



<p>Monitoring pod health metrics such as pod restarts, pod readiness and pod eviction help identify issues with individual pods and ensures that applications are running smoothly. Monitoring pod health enables organizations to detect and troubleshoot issues quickly, minimizing downtime and ensuring high availability.</p>



 Service availability:  



<p>Monitoring service availability metrics such as service uptime, service response time and service error rate help ensure that Kubernetes services are available and responsive to users. By monitoring service availability, organizations can detect service failures or degradation and take proactive measures to restore service availability and minimize impact on users.</p>



 Nodes health:  



<p>This is a metric that shows the status of nodes in the context of Kubernetes cluster metrics. Some other important metrics include:</p>



 
 kube_node_status_capacity: This metric indicates the available capacity for different resources on a node, helping you identify how much resources are available. 



 kubelet_running_container_count: It tells you how many containers are currently running on a node. 



 kubelet_runtime_operations_latency_microseconds: This metric measures the time it takes for each operation to complete, categorized by type, and it’s measured in microseconds. 
 



 Observability by the numbers 



<p>IBM Instana can monitor your microservice application running on Kubernetes.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/instana">IBM Instana</a> is a fully automated real-time observability platform that contextualizes performance data.

<p>The global AI governance landscape is complex and rapidly evolving. Key themes and concerns are emerging, however government agencies should get ahead of the game by evaluating their agency-specific priorities and processes. Compliance with official policies through auditing tools and other measures is merely the final step. The groundwork for effectively operationalizing governance is human-centered, and includes securing funded mandates, identifying accountable leaders, developing agency-wide AI literacy and centers of excellence and incorporating insights from academia, non-profits and private industry.</p>



 The global governance landscape 



<p>As of this writing, the <a href="https://oecd.ai/en/dashboards/overview/policy">OECD Policy Observatory</a> lists 668 national AI governance initiatives from 69 countries, territories and the EU. These include national strategies, agendas and plans; AI coordination or monitoring bodies; public consultations of stakeholders or experts; and initiatives for the use of AI in the public sector. Moreover, the OECD places legally enforceable AI regulations and standards in a separate category from the initiatives mentioned earlier, in which it lists an additional 337 initiatives.</p>



<p>The term governance can be hard to define. In the context of AI, it can refer to the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/ai-governance">safety and ethics</a> guardrails of AI tools and systems, policies concerning <a href="https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-governance">data access and model usage</a> or the government-mandated regulation itself. Therefore, we see national and international guidelines address these overlapping and intersecting definitions in a variety of ways. For all these reasons AI governance should begin at the level of concept and continue throughout the lifecycle of the AI solution.</p>



 Common challenges, common themes 



<p>Broadly, government agencies <a href="https://oecd.ai/en/wonk/athens-roundtable-2023">strive for governance</a> that supports and balances societal concerns of economic prosperity, national security and political dynamics, as we’ve seen in the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/28/fact-sheet-vice-president-harris-announces-omb-policy-to-advance-governance-innovation-and-risk-management-in-federal-agencies-use-of-artificial-intelligence/">recent White House order</a> to establish AI governance boards in U.S. federal agencies. Meanwhile, many private companies seem to prioritize economic prosperity, focusing on efficiency and productivity that drives business success and shareholder value and some companies such as IBM emphasize <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-governance">integrating guardrails into AI workflows</a>.</p>



<p>Non-governmental bodies, academics and other experts are also publishing guidance useful to public sector agencies. This year the World Economic Forum’s AI Governance Alliance published the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/ai-governance-alliance-briefing-paper-series/">Presidio AI Framework</a> (<a href="https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Presidio_AI%20Framework_2024.pdf">PDF</a>). It “…provides a structured approach to the safe development, deployment and use of generative AI. In doing so, the framework highlights gaps and opportunities in addressing safety concerns, viewed from the perspective of four primary actors: AI model creators, AI model adapters, AI model users, and AI application users.”</p>



<p>Across industries and sectors, some common regulatory themes are emerging. For instance, it is increasingly advisable to provide transparency to end users about the presence and use of any AI they are interacting with. Leaders must ensure reliability of performance and resistance to attack, as well as actionable commitment to social responsibility. This includes prioritizing fairness and lack of bias in training data and output, minimizing environmental impact, and increasing accountability through designation of responsible individuals and organization-wide education.</p>



 Policies are not enough 



<p>Whether governance policies rely on soft law or formal enforcement, and no matter how comprehensively or eruditely they are written, they are only principles. How organizations put them into action is what counts. For example, New York City published its own <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/oti/downloads/pdf/reports/artificial-intelligence-action-plan.pdf">AI Action plan</a> in October 2023, and formalized its <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/assets/oti/downloads/pdf/about/artificial-intelligence-principles-definitions.pdf">AI principles</a> in March 2024. Though these principles aligned with the themes above–including stating that AI tools “should be tested before deployment”–the AI-powered chatbot that the city rolled out to answer questions about starting and operating a business <a href="https://themarkup.org/news/2024/03/29/nycs-ai-chatbot-tells-businesses-to-break-the-law">gave answers that encouraged users to break the law</a>. Where did the implementation break down?</p>



<p>Operationalizing governance requires a human-centered, accountable, participatory approach. Let’s look at three key actions that agencies must take:</p>



 1. Designate accountable leaders and fund their mandates 



<p>Trust cannot exist without accountability. To operationalize governance frameworks, government agencies require accountable leaders that have funded mandates to do the work. To cite just one knowledge gap: several senior technology leaders we’ve spoken to have no comprehension of how <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/shedding-light-on-ai-bias-with-real-world-examples/">data can be biased</a>. Data is an artifact of human experience, prone to calcifying worldviews and inequity. AI can be viewed as a mirror that reflects our biases back to us. It is imperative that we identify accountable leaders who understand this and can be both financially empowered and held responsible for ensuring their AI is ethically operated and aligns with the values of the community it serves.</p>



 2. Provide applied governance training 



<p>We observe many agencies holding AI “innovation days” and hackathons aimed at improving operational efficiencies (such as reducing costs, engaging citizens or employees and other KPIs). We recommend that these hackathons be extended in scope to address the challenges of AI governance, through these steps:</p>



 
 Step 1: Three months before the pilots are presented, have a candidate governance leader host a keynote on AI ethics to hackathon participants. 



 Step 2: Have the government agency that is establishing the policy act as judge for the event. Provide criteria on how pilot projects will be judged that includes AI governance artifacts (documentation outputs) including factsheets, audit reports, layers-of-effect analysis (intended, unintended, primary and secondary impacts) and functional and non-functional requirements of the model in operation. 



 Step 3: For six to eight weeks leading up to the presentation date, offer applied training to the teams on developing these artifacts through workshops on their specific use cases. Bolster development teams by inviting <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/why-we-need-diverse-multidisciplinary-coes-for-model-risk/">diverse, multidisciplinary teams</a> to join them in these workshops as they assess ethics and model risk. 



 Step 4: On the day of the event, have each team present their work in a holistic way, demonstrating how they have assessed and would mitigate various risks associated with their use cases. Judges with domain expertise, regulatory, and cybersecurity backgrounds should question and evaluate each team’s work. 
 



 
 
  



<p>These timelines are based on our experience giving practitioners applied training with respect to very specific use cases. It gives would-be leaders a chance to do the actual work of governance, guided by a coach, while putting team members in the role of discerning governance judges.<br><br>But hackathons are not enough. One cannot learn everything in three months. Agencies should invest in building a culture of AI literacy education that fosters ongoing learning, including discarding old assumptions when necessary.</p>



 3. Evaluate inventory beyond algorithmic impact assessments 



<p>Organizations that develop many AI models often rely on algorithmic impact assessment forms as their primary mechanism to gather important metadata about their inventory and assess and mitigate the risks of AI models before they are deployed. These forms only survey AI model owners or procurers about the purpose of the AI model, its training data and approach, accountable parties and concerns for disparate impact.</p>



<p>There are many causes of concern about these forms being used in isolation without rigorous education, communication and cultural considerations. These include:</p>



 
 Incentives: Are individuals incentivized or disincentivized to fill out these forms thoughtfully? We find that most are disincentivized because they have quotas to meet.<br><br> 



 Responsibility for risk: These forms can imply that model owners will be absolved of risk because they used a certain technology or cloud host or procured a model from a third party.<br><br> 



 Relevant definitions of AI: Model owners may not realize that what they are procuring or deploying meets the definition of AI or intelligent automation as described by a regulation.<br><br> 



 Ignorance about disparate impact: By putting the onus on a single person to complete and submit an algorithmic assessment form, one could argue that accurate assessment of disparate impact is omitted by design. 
 



<p>We have seen concerning form inputs made by AI practitioners across geographies and across education levels, and by those who say that they have read the published policy and understand the principles. Such entries include “How could my AI model be unfair if I am not gathering PII?,” and “There are no risks for disparate impact as I have the best of intentions.” These point to the urgent need for applied training, and an organizational culture that consistently measures model behaviors against clearly defined ethical guidelines.</p>



 Creating a culture of responsibility and collaboration 



<p>A participatory and inclusive culture is essential as organizations grapple with governing a technology with such far-reaching impact. As we have discussed previously, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blog/why-we-need-diverse-multidisciplinary-coes-for-model-risk/">diversity is not a political factor but a mathematical one</a>. Multidisciplinary centers of excellence are essential to help ensure that employees are educated and responsible AI users who understand risks and disparate impact. Organizations must make governance integral to collaborative innovation efforts, and stress that responsibility belongs to everyone, not just model owners. They must identify truly accountable leaders who bring a socio-technical perspective to issues of governance and who welcome new approaches to mitigating AI risk whatever the source—governmental, non-governmental or academic.</p>

<p>Here we go again.....</p><p>Andrew Witty, CEO of UnitedHealth Group, the largest health insurer in the U.S., just revealed to a congressional committee that a significant data breach had occurred. The intrusion was traced back to a subsidiary, Change Health Systems, which was compromised by the notorious Russian hacker group, BlackCat. This breach underscores the vulnerabilities inherent in traditional security measures, which often rely on single-factor authentication mechanisms and centralized data storage.</p><p>Two months ago, the hackers exploited a stolen password to infiltrate Change Health Systems, gaining access to an extensive array of sensitive patient data. During the testimony, Witty estimated that the personal data of potentially a third of all Americans could have been exposed, highlighting the enormous impact of the breach.</p><p>The incident spiraled when BlackCat, having seized control of Change Healthcare’s systems, demanded a $22 million ransom. Witty confirmed the payment of the ransom, a move made independently in a desperate bid to mitigate the damage. The breach not only affected UnitedHealth's customers but also reached non-customers due to Change Healthcare’s role in processing over 15 billion transactions annually.</p><p>UnitedHealth is now committed to a rigorous data review and is taking proactive steps to support those affected. This includes establishing a dedicated website for information dissemination and offering two years of free credit monitoring services. The company has expressed its determination to bolster defenses and provide necessary aid to both consumers and providers shaken by this event.</p> How Bloom Could Have Helped <p>This incident once again brings to light the critical need for robust, resilient security solutions like those provided by <a>Bloom</a>. Bloom’s cutting-edge self-sovereign identity and verifiable credentials solutions are designed to prevent such breaches.</p><p>At <a>Bloom</a>, we advocate for the implementation of decentralized identity solutions that eliminate single points of failure, such as those exploited in the UnitedHealth incident.</p> The Broader Impact of Ransomware <p>The rise in ransomware attacks is a growing concern globally, with payments to hackers in 2023 reaching a record $1.1 billion. These attacks are increasingly sophisticated and are carried out by a diverse array of actors, from large criminal networks to solo perpetrators. The trend underscores the urgent need for comprehensive security strategies that include advanced technological defenses and proactive risk management practices.</p><p>In response to these challenges, Bloom encourages a shift towards more secure, decentralized frameworks that not only protect against such threats but also provide individuals with the tools they need to manage their own digital identities safely and effectively. By prioritizing security and privacy, we can better safeguard our digital ecosystems against the escalating wave of cybercrime.</p>

Airdrop 2 continues this series of airdrops to early Verida participants, adding another 2.2 million VDA Tokens to the campaign and increasing the cumulative allocated award amount to 3.2 million VDA Tokens. This airdrop rewards those who participated in Verida’s Galxe and Zealy campaigns in 2023 and early&nbsp;2024.</p><p>Note that while these initial Zealy and Galxe campaigns are completed and stakeholders can no longer earn rewards for their participation, Verida does have an <a href="https://app.galxe.com/verida">ongoing campaigns operating on Galxe</a> that remains open for participation.</p><p>More details on checking your Airdrop 2 eligibility and claiming rewards will be shared in the coming week, so stay&nbsp;tuned.</p> 2,200,000 VDA Token Airdrop&nbsp;Details <p>Participants in Verida’s initial Zealy and Galxe campaigns will be eligible for rewards for actions completed during these campaigns. Participants who engaged with campaigns on both platforms will also be eligible for a reward boost for their early committed efforts.</p><p>On Galxe, users engaged with Verida’s Acacia and Mainnet launch campaigns and were able to earn limited edition Galxe OATs after undertaking a range of activities. More than 11,000 unique wallets participated in these campaigns and will be eligible for airdrop&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>In addition, Verida conducted a campaign on Zealy, where nearly 20,000 wallets participated, with roughly 10,000 individual wallets earning more than 450 Zealy Points during this campaign. Of this group, the approximately 3,600 wallets in the 60th percentile and above, effectively those wallets earning at least 1,485 Zealy Points, will be eligible for VDA airdrop&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>All of these users, pending eligibility checks based on residency and other compliance obligations, will be eligible for VDA Storage Credit Token&nbsp;rewards.</p> Zealy Points&nbsp;Campaign <p>A total of 9,991 wallets earned more than 24 million Zealy points during the Zealy campaign. Verida expects to award 1,000,000 VDA tokens to members of this group who earned at least 1,485 Zealy&nbsp;Points.</p><p>Participating wallets in this campaign were grouped by Zealy points, with over 1,000 wallets earning nearly 12 million Zealy points, or almost half the total amount earned, and will be rewarded with 400 VDA tokens per wallet. The remainder of the rewards dedicated to this Zealy campaign will be distributed proportionally between the two lower tiers of wallets, as illustrated in the table&nbsp;below.</p> Galxe Testnet and Mainet Launch Campaigns <p>Additional campaigns on Galxe, where users received Galxe OATs for completing tasks on both the Verida mainnet and testnet, received equally impressive participation. More than 9,000 wallets completed tasks on the Verida testnet enabling them to earn a Galxe OAT, and another 2,000 wallets completed similar tasks following Verida’s transition to&nbsp;mainnet.</p><p>Of the above two groups, 475 wallets completed the steps to earn a Galxe OAT on both mainnet and testnet, and will receive 200 VDA Tokens. Both mainnet and testnet OATs will earn participants 100 VDA Tokens, and the overall reward amount is over 1.1 million VDA Tokens, as illustrated below.</p> Bonus Allocation for Participants in Both Zealy and Galxe Campaigns <p>In addition to the above reward allocations, Verida has included a bonus reward for participants in both campaigns.</p><p>As seen below, three bonus reward tiers were established, based on a combination of Zealy campaign participation as well as earning a Galxe OAT for either testnet, mainnet, or both stages of the campaign.</p> Combined Airdrop Award&nbsp;Amounts <p>Collectively, airdrop awards for these two campaigns, in addition to the bonus award for wallets participating in both campaigns, bring the total for Verida’s Airdrop 2 to over 2.2 million VDA&nbsp;Tokens.</p><p>These awards bring the total announced airdrop reward amount, when combined with airdrop 1, to more than 3.2 million VDA Tokens across Verida’s two initial airdrops. Verida intends to announce the details of additional airdrop and reward programs prior to its upcoming token&nbsp;listing.</p> The Airdrop 2 VDA Reward&nbsp;Pool <p>2.2 million VDA Storage Credit Tokens have been allocated to this airdrop, and will be distributed between all qualified wallets based on verified activities and after a final analysis of all completed records has concluded and points tallied, after which reward amounts will be finalized. Airdrop tokens will be claimable 60 days after the&nbsp;TGE.</p><p>After claiming the tokens, holders will be able to use their VDA within the network to <a href="https://community.verida.io/verida-token-vda/vda-token-utility">pay for data storage and to access other ecosystem initiatives</a>. In addition, Verida has developed a novel delegated staking program enabling users to earn a variety of rewards including VDA tokens and discounts on services for staking their VDA&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>More information about the details of the staking program will be forthcoming, as will additional announcements about airdrops and reward programs targeting different stakeholders within the Verida ecosystem, including node operators, app developers and&nbsp;others.</p> Looking ahead <p>Beyond these initial rewards programs, Verida is embarking on a journey to cultivate a thriving ecosystem through a variety of future initiatives, such as staking, grants, and incubator programs, all accompanied by tokenized incentives. These initiatives will act as catalysts, driving the network’s expansion and enhancing its utility as the decentralized private data storage layer for the new self-sovereign data&nbsp;economy.</p><p>Designed to foster innovation, creativity, and active participation, these initiatives encourage users, node operators, dApp builders, and developers to contribute to a more equitable data&nbsp;economy.</p><p>By participating in these opportunities, users can reclaim control over their personal data, ensuring its security, encryption, and decentralization, thereby mitigating risks associated with <a href="https://medium.com/bankless-dao/web3-can-solve-the-data-hack-crisis-814c962849b0">data breaches</a>. Furthermore, developers are incentivized to create feature-rich web3 applications where users truly own their&nbsp;data.</p><p>This unlocks doors to exciting new use cases, including <a href="https://news.verida.io/top-three-data-privacy-issues-facing-ai-today-1503e50b65bd#1b16">privacy-preserving AI models</a>, <a href="https://www.banklesstimes.com/news/2023/05/12/polygon-and-verida-join-forces-to-take-zero-knowledge-mainstream/">private reusable credentials</a>, anonymous voting, and participation in crucial <a href="https://cryptonews.com/news/blockchain-can-help-advance-healthcare-data-management-solutions.htm">healthcare research</a>.

<p>Historically, the insurance industry hasn’t had a reputation for being quick to adopt new technologies. However, ongoing regulatory pressures, rising competition, and changing policyholder demands have created new challenges for insurers, which digital transformation can help to address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today, leading insurance companies have become much more policyholder-centric, catering to the unique needs, behaviors, and preferences of consumers rather than offering a one-size-fits-all approach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These high-touch, personalized customer experiences have driven better policyholder satisfaction, loyalty, and retention, all of which support insurers’ bottom line. However, adopting a digital insurance model generates new concerns around policyholder data protection and online account security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This blog will explore the ongoing digital transformation of the insurance market, how the customer experience has been impacted, and what traditional insurers can do to deal with market headwinds and orchestrate a seamless experience for policyholders. </p>

<p>In the past year, Bluesky has grown from 40K users to 5.6M users. We’ve made it possible to create custom algorithms, introduced community-driven moderation, and opened up federation. This has laid the foundation for a social protocol that can exist long after Bluesky the app does.</p>
<p>What’s coming next? Over the next few months, we’ll be putting more of our energy into the application. This includes a lot of “Quality of Life” improvements and some long-requested features. The biggest changes will be:</p>
 
 DMs 
 Video 
 Improved Custom Feeds 
 Improved anti-harassment features 
 OAuth 
 
<p>We’re very excited to deliver these features you’ve been asking for. We don’t have exact timelines, but you can expect to see all of these in the next few months.</p>
 DMs (direct messages) 
<p>Historically, all bluesky posts have been public. But there’s a world of interactions that are opened up when users can directly message each other. Making personal connections, finding job opportunities, organizing events, workshopping posts – there’s a lot of reasons to slide into the DMs.</p>
<p>We’re currently working on a DM service that will integrate into the Bluesky app. This service will be “off protocol” at first so we can develop iteratively. We’ll use what we learn to land protocol-driven DMs in the future. For an update on what’s next for the protocol, <a href="https://docs.bsky.app/blog/2024-protocol-roadmap">see our protocol roadmap</a>.</p>
<p>The v1 of DMs will be one-to-one. You’ll be able to restrict who can DM you (open, followed users only, and disabled). If you’ve used DMs on other social networks, it should feel familiar.</p>
 Video 
<p>Our devs keep getting told about cute animal videos which our users can’t share. The guilt is terrible.</p>
<p>We’re still finalizing the details, but it’s looking like the v1 of video integration on Bluesky will be 90-second clips that you can share on your posts.</p>
 Improved Custom Feeds 
<p>“Custom Feeds” are one of the best features of Bluesky, allowing users to completely customize their timeline, but they’re still pretty tough to work with. Our community has done an incredible job filling in the gaps, but we want to finally invest some more energy into making Feeds better.</p>
<p>Here’s the list of ideas in the works:</p>
 
 In-app feed creation. 
 The ability to submit posts to feeds, curate the submissions, and manually moderate what’s included. 
 Better feed discovery, and a way to see trending feeds. 
 New feedback mechanisms which the algorithmic feeds can request, such as “show more” and “show less” buttons, and a way to track which posts have been seen to stop duplicates from showing so often. 
 The ability to move “Following” out of the leftmost tab of your homepage. 
 Feed “following” to drive superfeeds which show what’s happening in each of your communities. 
 Better caching strategies to improve performance. 
 
<p><a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-30-2023-algorithmic-choice">Algorithmic choice</a> has been a key goal of Bluesky from the start, and we can’t wait to move Custom Feeds forward. It’s incredible how much our community has done with them already, and we think a little extra love will enable you to go even further.</p>
<p>What you see on social media is mostly determined by algorithms, and giving you the power to control your algorithms like this is one of the most important things we do.</p>
 Improved Anti-harassment Features 
<p>Public social networks unfortunately all have to deal with the problem of users who want to troll, harass, and just make other people’s lives miserable. Over the past year, we’ve <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/6-23-2023-moderation-proposals">implemented tooling</a> like reply controls for threads, user lists, and community-driven moderation through labeling, but there is still more work to be done.</p>
<p>In the months to come, we’ll be doing another pass over moderation tooling, with a focus on anti-harassment mechanisms. We’ll be publishing more on this soon.</p>
 OAuth 
<p>You know those “Log in with Facebook” or “Log in with Google” buttons you see in apps? What if there was a “Log in with Bluesky” button? We think there should be! OAuth is the internet standard that makes that possible, and we’re bringing it to Bluesky and atproto.</p>
<p>OAuth is especially important for third-party clients – it’ll make signing in easier and safer for users. You never share your password with other clients, and “App Passwords” will no longer be required.</p>
<p>Once OAuth lands, we’ll expand on our 2FA model to enable more factors than email (which landed last week).</p>

  <p>Today we’re announcing that Platform SSO for macOS is available in public preview with Microsoft Entra ID. Platform SSO is an enhancement to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/apple-sso-plugin">Microsoft Enterprise SSO plug-in for Apple devices</a> that makes usage and management of Mac devices more seamless and secure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the start of public preview, Platform SSO will work with Microsoft Intune. Additional mobile device management (MDM) providers will be added during the public preview. Please contact your MDM provider for more information on support and availability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of this release, we’re introducing Microsoft Entra Join for macOS. This feature uses the Enterprise SSO plug-in to create a hardware-bound device record in Entra ID. Entra Join requires the use of an Entra ID organizational account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, we’re making three new ways to authenticate available, all configurable with MDM and available as part of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-entra-pricing">Microsoft Entra ID Free</a>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Passwordless authentication with Secure Enclave: Like Windows Hello for Business, this method allows the user to interactively sign in to the desktop with their local account and password. Once the user signs in, a hardware-bound cryptographic key stored in the device’s Secure Enclave can be used as a trusted credential with Entra ID, giving the user SSO across applications that use Entra ID for authentication. This method allows users to go passwordless with Touch ID to unlock their device and be signed into Entra ID under the hood using a device-bound key. It can save organizations money by removing the need to purchase security keys, card readers, or other hardware. For information on our security and compliance standards, please see <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/standards/nist-authenticator-types">this guide</a>.  
 Passwordless authentication with smart cards: With this method, the user signs into the Mac using an external smart card (or smart-card-compatible hard token like Yubikey). Once the device is unlocked, the smart card is further used with Entra ID to grant SSO across apps that use Entra ID for authentication.  
 Password synchronization with the local account: This method enables the user to interactively sign into the local machine account with their Entra ID password, granting SSO across apps that use Entra ID. The user no longer needs to remember separate passwords, and any changes to the Entra ID password are synchronized to the local machine.  
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Getting started 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting today, you’ll find updated documentation and tutorials for Platform SSO for macOS on <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/devices/macos-psso">Microsoft Learn</a> to guide you through setup, deployment, usage, and troubleshooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you haven’t already, you’ll want to take the following steps to help your organization prepare:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/apps-company-portal-macos">Update devices to use Company Portal 5.2404.0 or newer.</a> 
 Deploy the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/apple-sso-plugin">Enterprise SSO plug-in</a>. 
 Ensure users are <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-mfa-policy">registered for Microsoft Entra multifactor authentication</a>. For the best experience, we recommend using Microsoft Authenticator.  
 For Google Chrome users, install the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/windows-accounts/ppnbnpeolgkicgegkbkbjmhlideopiji?pli=1">Microsoft Single Sign On extension</a>. 
 Update macOS devices to macOS 13** (Ventura) or later. macOS 14 (Sonoma) is recommended for the best user experience and feature set.  
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>** Note that migration from non-shared keys on macOS 13 to shared keys (supported on macOS 14+) requires user re-registration of the device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Even more capabilities on the way 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through incremental releases over public preview, we’ll gradually introduce additional controls, reports, audit, and sign–in logging capabilities, plus APIs in Microsoft Graph to configure, query, and manage them. Please note that like Windows Hello for Business, some features may require a premium Entra ID license. </p>

<p>Successful clinical studies hinge on efficiently recruiting and retaining diverse participants. Yet, clinical trial professionals across the globe grapple with notable challenges in these areas. In this chapter of the <a href="https://ibm.biz/3aicapabilities">IBM series</a> on clinical trial innovation, we spotlight key strategies for boosting recruitment speed, helping to ensure diversity, and harnessing digital advancements. Seamlessly integrating these elements is essential for leading-edge success in clinical development.</p>



<p>Recruitment difficulties are the leading reason for trial terminations. While the overall <a href="https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/features/clinical-trial-terminations">clinical trial termination</a> rate has decreased over time, low accrual rates within trials remain the most common termination reason. The public is often unaware that they have the option to participate in clinical trials.</p>



<p>This knowledge gap is even more pronounced among minority populations. Of people who enroll in a clinical trial, the majority say they motivate themselves to stay engaged, as seen in Exhibit 1. Industry analysts <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9133187/">report</a> that dropout rates in phase 3 clinical trials can sometimes reach 20% to 30%. This underscores the need to redefine the roles of trial administrators and investigators in the process.</p>







<p>However, high turnover rates among clinical trial investigators also contribute to inefficiency, instability and increased costs. Our analysis of the voluntarily reported Form FDA 1572 BMIS database reveals a potential lack of sustainability in the investigator pool, both in the United States (US) and globally (Exhibit 2). The number of first-time clinical investigators has declined, especially among non-US based investigators.</p>



 

 



<p>Lastly, addressing the lack of demographic diversity in clinical trials is crucial. In 2022, less than 10% of trial participants for FDA approval were Black, fewer than 12% were Asian, under 13% were Hispanic, and women constituted less than 50% (Exhibit 3), not reflective of the current US population. Recognizing this gap, regulators emphasize the importance of greater diversity.</p>



<p>For instance, the FDA released guidance in November 2020 titled, “Enhancing the diversity of clinical trial populations.” In April 2022, they issued another draft guideline, “Diversity plans to improve enrollment of participants from underrepresented racial and ethnic populations in clinical trials: Guidance for industry,” aiming to provide recommendations for sponsors to increase enrollment of underrepresented populations.</p>



 

 



 5 barriers to efficient patient recruitment and retention 



<p>There are several key factors contributing to the challenges of inadequate patient volume and sluggish recruitment speed in clinical trials:</p>



 
 Complex trial protocols: Delays often stem from intricate or unrealistic trial protocols. It’s crucial to evaluate the feasibility of trials and refine protocols using evidence-based strategies. 



 Barriers to patient accessibility: Numerous challenges like geographical constraints, transportation issues, scarce trial site availability and physical disabilities restrict potential participants from accessing trials. 



 Patient pool expansion hurdles: Despite efforts to broaden participant inclusion, clinical trials still face hurdles in identifying and engaging new patient demographics, especially underrepresented groups. 



 Ineffective outreach: Clinical trial marketing efforts sometimes miss the mark. Lack of awareness and trust among potential participants underscores the need for enhanced communication and trust-building strategies. 



 Site underperformance: Many clinical trials face interruptions due to suboptimal performance at trial sites. Predicting site performance, spotting underperforming sites and formulating timely interventions are essential. 
 







 5 moves to boost recruitment speed, patient volume and diversity 



 1. Optimize protocols using historical and synthetic data 



<p>Complex and stringent protocols are notorious for delaying clinical trials and eroding patient engagement. Ensuring early assumptions resonate with real-world execution is paramount. Enter the age of data-driven protocol assessment: using benchmarking tools and predictive modeling to gauge protocol intricacies and forecast eligible patient numbers, which then inform protocol adjustments.</p>



<p>Diving deep into historical trial data with a protocol complexity rating also reveals golden insights, especially around patient-centric elements. Key facets to spotlight in a protocol’s design include the investigational product’s nature, study design, endpoint definition, eligibility criteria, administrative burden, the presence of redundant processes, and the time that a patient would need to invest to participate. Grasping these dimensions sharpens the recruitment lens. Refining trial protocols isn’t a once-off; it’s an evolving, multidisciplinary quest, enriched by lessons from the past to shape future (more effective) trial designs.</p>



<p>Learning from historical protocol data and using synthetically generated scenario events to optimize inclusion and exclusion criteria can be powerful for achieving efficient trial design. By fine-tuning these criteria, protocols can help attract a targeted and more relevant patient group, speeding up recruitment.</p>



<p>When patients align with the inclusion criteria more accurately, their willingness to enroll increases. The <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-takes-additional-steps-advance-decentralized-clinical-trials">FDA’s 2020 guidance</a> emphasized expanding eligibility criteria and reducing unnecessary exclusions. Broader eligibility criteria not only streamline recruitment but also promote greater diversity, helping to ensure a more comprehensive and inclusive clinical trial.</p>



<p>The latest developments in large language models (LLMs) have the potential to significantly expedite protocol design processes. The current, labor-intensive manual approach can compromise the timeliness, accuracy and validity of results. LLMs demonstrate a superior understanding of the semantic relationships between entities within inclusion and exclusion criteria. They also possess query generation capabilities that can automate the process of identifying matching patients with trials, expediting the trial start-up process.</p>



<p>Additionally, generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be used to simulate real recruitment scenarios, further optimizing protocol design. These technological advancements promise substantial improvements in protocol design, ultimately boosting patient enrollment.</p>



 2. Embrace decentralized approaches for expanded reach and efficiency 



<p>Decentralized clinical trials (DCTs) are gaining traction for their prowess in dismantling traditional hurdles in patient participation in clinical research. By removing geographical limitations, increasing accessibility and broadening the participant base, DCTs not only improve recruitment and retention but also foster greater diversity, welcoming participants from underserved communities.</p>



<p>The FDA, in its May 2023 draft guidance, backed the adoption of <a href="https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/features/dct-adoption-tracker-who-and-what-is-at-the-crest-of-the-trial-decentralisation-wave/">DCTs across drugs, biologics and medical devices</a>, highlighting their merits such as enhanced patient convenience, diminished caregiver burden, broader access to varied demographics, amplified trial productivity, and support for research on rare or mobility-restricted patient groups.</p>



<p>Integral to DCTs are <a href="https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2022-0107">digital health technologies and software</a>. The rise in the deployment of electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs), electronic clinical outcome assessments (eCOAs), and electronic informed consent (eConsent) from 2020 to 2021, primarily driven by contract research organizations underscores this shift.</p>



<p>Incorporating telehealth, real-time monitoring via devices such as activity trackers, blood pressure monitors, and other digital tools is now commonplace across many therapeutic areas. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) devices are increasingly playing a role and can be integrated into DCTs. The swift progression of these technologies is revolutionizing clinical trial paradigms.</p>



<p>Digital health technologies and software do more than just enhance accessibility and efficiency in clinical trials. They also pave the way into the realm of digital behavior data. This vast data set can provide insights into patient behaviors. In some instances, one <a href="https://www.pharmasalmanac.com/articles/wearable-technology-targeting-a-range-of-uses-and-indications">wearable device</a> can collect 120 million data points per day for each patient. Access to such a massive volume of daily behavior data provides a comprehensive understanding of each patient, promoting personalized engagement.</p>



<p>This pivot towards patient-centric care bolsters clinical trial patient recruitment and retention. Moreover, by transitioning away from the traditional site-centric model, clinical trials can tap into nationwide data, pinpointing underrepresented populations and thus encouraging greater diversity within clinical trial cohorts.</p>



 3. Partner with primary care: A goldmine for patient recruitment 



<p>Forging alliances with community-based primary care physicians can dramatically enhance clinical trial participation. Given their longstanding patient relationships and in-depth understanding of patient history, primary care providers offer a doorway to a vast, diverse reservoir of potential trial participants. The bond of trust between patients and their primary care team cannot be understated.</p>



<p>A nod from a trusted doctor can greatly sway a patient’s decision to participate in a trial, significantly boosting enrollment figures. Engaging the primary care team not only enhances recruitment but also elevates the overall quality of trials.</p>



<p>Primary care doctors have access to vast amounts of patient health and medical data, including both structured and unstructured information, as well as medical images and videos. Machine learning and deep neural network models can effectively analyze this data to identify patterns, correlations and relationships, which is particularly useful for understanding a patient’s unique profile.</p>



<p>Computer vision models, such as convolutional neural network models, can assist doctors in detecting and classifying diseases in 2D and 3D medical images. Recently developed computer vision foundation models have significantly improved the accuracy of image classification tasks.</p>



<p>The amalgamation of artificial intelligence (AI) with primary care offers significant advantages in the realm of clinical trials. By deriving insights from diverse patient data formats, primary care doctors can achieve a more profound understanding of patient profiles. Such medical insights can be instrumental in refining trial protocols to align more closely with genuine patient experiences and help ensure continual oversight regarding patient safety. When patients engage in trials under the continual care of their physician, their likelihood of sustained involvement increases, consequently reducing attrition rates.</p>



 4. Refine marketing tactics to elevate awareness and foster trust 



<p>Based on data from the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9595001/">2020 Health Information National Trends Survey</a>, 41.3% of the 3772 surveyed US adults reported not knowing about clinical trials. Elevating this awareness demands a targeted marketing thrust, using tools like social media promotion, engaging with key opinion leaders, and impactful campaigns to bridge the gap with prospective patients.</p>



<p>Studies over the past 10 years underscore the profound role of trust in determining clinical research participation, especially among underrepresented groups. A pivotal insight reveals that trust, or the lack thereof, is a primary determinant of participation. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6092744/">Prevailing trust-related apprehensions</a> encompass fears of mistreatment, exploitation and unintended consequences.</p>



<p>These 3 tactics have proven to be effective:</p>



 
 AI-powered social media advertising: Enhance the effectiveness of social media outreach for clinical trial promotions by employing AI algorithms on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. These algorithms can help curate highly personalized advertisements and content tailored to the desired audience. Through in-depth AI analysis of user behaviors and patterns, promotional messages can be fine-tuned to resonate with specific age groups, geographic locations and health interests, amplifying the relevancy and impact of the outreach. By harnessing these AI capabilities, clinical trial promotions on social media can precisely target the right audience, delivering the appropriate message at the optimal moment. This strategic approach not only elevates awareness but also fosters a sense of community within the target audience, heightening engagement and the likelihood of participation in the clinical trial. 



 Engage with healthcare influencers and advocacy groups: Forge partnerships with trusted healthcare influencers and patient advocacy entities. Their expansive reach and credibility in patient circles make them invaluable allies. By collaborating, their endorsement can effectively expand the message reach and engagement levels. 



 Targeted campaigns at recruitment locations: Execute campaigns that are precisely calibrated for individual recruitment sites and their associated communities. Such specificity helps ensure that the outreach resonates with the unique attributes of each site or community, capturing the attention of potential participants. 
 



<p>A sharp, tailored marketing approach elevates clinical trial visibility. Moreover, it’s crucial to address and build the trust factor, as it plays an essential role in influencing participation decisions. The strategies listed are instrumental in widening awareness and fostering trust among potential participants.</p>



 5. Streamline site performance and enrollment with AI 



<p>Integrating AI-enabled capabilities in biopharma operations transforms clinical trial site selection, promotes scalable AI expertise and helps ensure cost-efficiency. AI algorithms consistently outperform traditional methods by analyzing intricate recruitment data, helping to ensure precise forecasting for study, indication and country-specific enrollments. By accurately predicting enrollment rates, AI has the potential to minimize financial risks, refine enrollment strategies and support budgeting to preclude potential setbacks and delays.</p>



<p>Moreover, gaining instantaneous insights into site performance keeps stakeholders informed about enrollment dynamics, quickly identifies potential bottlenecks and paves the way for agile decision-making and necessary adjustments. The AI automation enables real-time site performance tracking, sends prompt alerts and helps ensure streamlined reporting.<br><br>Additionally, the next best action mechanisms have the potential to provide real-time recommendations on the most impactful measures to enhance site performance. This agility helps to ensure uninterrupted trials, reduces disruptions and empowers stakeholders to adeptly navigate unforeseen challenges.</p>



 Embracing AI technologies strategically 



<p>In the intricate landscape of clinical trials, the dual challenges of recruitment and retention persist, often becoming significant roadblocks to pharmaceutical progress. However, with the strategic embrace of AI technologies, we can collectively reshape this narrative. IBM is at the forefront of adopting AI for the pharmaceutical business, showcasing our commitment to refining this domain.</p>



<p>Through tailored protocol designs, decentralized trial models, enriched primary care collaborations, strategic marketing endeavors and the powerful precision of predictive engines, we can surge past these barriers.</p>



<p>The quest for faster, diverse and robust clinical trials is not just an aspiration, it’s an achievable reality. Clinical professionals globally have the tools and insights and now is the time to wield them with intent. For those ready to revolutionize the world of research and development, remember that innovation is not just about technology; it’s about harnessing every available resource to usher in a new era of clinical excellence.</p>

 The “maximize accuracy” game is now outcompeting the “50/50 maximize stake”&nbsp;game  Introduction <p>In <a href="https://www.predictoor.ai">Ocean Predictoor</a>, people run AI-powered prediction bots or trading bots on crypto price feeds to earn $. In Predictoor’s rewards formula, the more accurately you predict and the more you stake, the more you earn; you’re always in competition with others and their predictions.</p><p>From this rewards formula, we recognized that accuracy should be the key value proposition. It was a natural fit: staking caused accountability, and the game around it could nudge up accuracy over&nbsp;time.</p><p>Alas, “maximize accuracy” wasn’t happening. Rather, another game emerged that didn’t help Predictoor’s value proposition.</p> Observing the “50/50 High Stake”&nbsp;Game <p>People started running bots that used a “50/50” strategy, where at “prediction” the bot would stake exactly half its OCEAN up, and half down. This was popular, because it was nicely profitable and relatively safe.</p><p>To maximize $ earned, the 50/50 bot-runners simply maximized stake. Competition among 50/50 bot runners led staking volume to grow exponentially, to nearly $1B per month from $0 at launch six months earlier&nbsp;😲.</p><p>These people had found that optimizing on stake (with no value-add to accuracy) was more profitable than optimizing on accuracy.</p><p>While the high volumes were exciting to see, they weren’t helping accuracy. And ultimately it was accuracy that mattered for Predictoor’s long-term success. What held back the model-based bots from competing? What could we do about it? Did it&nbsp;work?</p> Identifying the&nbsp;Problem <p>Was anyone running model-based prediction bots? We knew this answer to be “yes” because we were among them! Nothing like eating your own dog&nbsp;food:)</p><p>And, we found that it was hard to be profitable with model-based bots. Here’s why: it’s easier to be profitable predicting on both up &amp; down, rather than just one&nbsp;side.</p><p>Let’s elaborate.</p>  The 50/50 bots staked on both sides, for each prediction. They were always there to catch the good and the bad. Having both sides is predictable, and helps profitability.  In contrast, the model-based bots staked on just one side: up or down, but not both at once. Each time a prediction was wrong (almost but not quite 50% of the time), it was slashed its full stake amount. This meant high variance in winnings from epoch to epoch: big win or big loss. High variance hurts profitability.  <p>We also recognized that higher prediction accuracy could help compete against the 50/50 bots. So we continued our diligent line of research to increase model accuracy.</p><p>If you can’t be profitable, then you can’t stake meaningful amounts to optimize profitability.</p> Addressing the&nbsp;Problem <p>We did two things to address the problem: two-sided prediction bots, and higher accuracy&nbsp;models.</p><p>Two-sided prediction bots. We <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/predictoor-introducing-two-sided-prediction-bots-66bbbb53be1b">introduced</a> these a couple months ago. They made it easy to run bots that submit both up *and* down predictions based on model confidence.</p><p>Here’s an example. If the bot calculates up=30% chance, and therefore down=70%, and has 1000 OCEAN to stake, then the bot stakes 0.30*1000 = 300 OCEAN to up, and 700 to down. Critically, the bot is always on both the winning side and the losing side. This reduces its variance and increases its profitability. The image below illustrates.</p>prediction bots submit “up” and “down” predictions with a stake-weighted confidence on each, i.e. “two-sided prediction”.<p>Model accuracy research. We continued to improve our own internal models’ accuracy. We also learned that for models with 52% accuracy, two-sided bots could compete against 50/50 bots, but one-sided could not. For models of 56% accuracy, even one-sided bots could compete, and two-sided did not&nbsp;help.</p> What Happened Next? Accuracy Went&nbsp;Up <p>We rolled out two-sided model-based bots, and provided affordances for more accurate&nbsp;models.</p><p>What happened&nbsp;then?</p><p>New predictoors armed with two-sided bots and more accurate prediction models joined the game. These new model-based bots drove aggregate prediction accuracy up, nicely above&nbsp;50%.</p><p>The image below shows accuracy for each of the ten 5-minute feeds from April 8, 2024 until May 1, 2024. Most notable is in the right 1/3 of the image where all accuracies trend upwards&nbsp;nicely.</p>Accuracy vs time for each 5-minute&nbsp;feed<p>The following image shows accuracy for each of the ten 1 hour feeds from April 8, 2024 until May 1, 2024. As with 5min, accuracies trend up&nbsp;nicely.</p>Accuracy vs time for each 1 hour&nbsp;feed Then, What Happened? “50/50 Maximize-Stake” Game&nbsp;Faded <p>As accuracy increased, the 50/50 strategy became unprofitable, because the accurate model-based bots ate the stake of the 50/50 bots. Let’s elaborate:</p>  In an environment where every predictoor has a 50% accuracy, using a 50/50 strategy means a predictor will be right as often as wrong. Each correct prediction offsets the loss from a wrong one, while also earning a share of the rewards based on the stake&nbsp;amount.  However, in an environment, where some predictors have accuracy sufficiently higher than 50%, they will win part of the losses incurred by the 50/50 strategy. Consequently, the gains from correct predictions in the 50/50 strategy do not fully cover the losses from incorrect ones, rendering it unprofitable.  <p>With “50/50 maximize-stake” strategy, becoming unprofitable, the 50/50 bot runners left or sharply reduced their&nbsp;stake.</p><p>The image below illustrates. Below:top shows stake for each of the ten 5-minute feeds from April 8, 2024 until May 1, 2024. It dropped from 4000 OCEAN / feed / epoch to &lt;1000 OCEAN. As of May 6 there’s about 700 OCEAN /&nbsp;feed.</p><p>Below:bottom shows a similar trend for 1 hour feeds. It also dropped similarly.</p>Stake vs time for each 5-minute feed (top), and 1h feed&nbsp;(bottom) Discussion / Learnings <p>Accuracy is rewarded. At its heart, Predictoor is built on the principle of “reward accuracy”. The system rewards predictoors who make accurate predictions and penalizes those who don’t. We just had to reduce friction for making this&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Predictoors must adapt. From the above graphs, it can be seen that after 50/50 predictoors quit the game, the rest of the predictoors have lowered their stake amounts to maximize their revenue. Adapting to these changes and employing smarter strategies is a key part of the game. Understanding these dynamics is essential to maximizing your potential returns in the game. So, dive into it, tweak your strategies, and watch your profits&nbsp;improve!</p> Conclusion <p>In this article, we described how Predictoor rewards for accuracy and stake, and with a main value proposition of accuracy. We then described how the “50/50 maximize-stake” strategy was nicely profitable, alas, optimizing for stake not accuracy. We described steps we took to help make model-based predictions more profitable: two-sided predictions and more accurate models. Finally, we showed positive results of how accuracy has increased and the “50/50 maximize-stake” bots have been&nbsp;leaving.</p><p>The game is now firmly “maximize accuracy” and that’s a great&nbsp;thing.</p> About Ocean&nbsp;Protocol <p>Ocean was founded to level the playing field for AI and data.

The guide starts with installation and running the agents using Docker containers. The guide then provides a script to showcase the use of Signify and KERIA agents, including procedures for creating autonomic identifiers (AIDs), signing messages, and verifying signatures.</p> Signify &amp;&nbsp;KERIA <p>Signify &amp; KERIA are open-source projects developed for building client-side identity-wallet applications using the KERI protocol. Signify-KERIA identity wallet utilizes the hybrid edge-cloud wallet architecture where Signify provides a lightweight edge wallet component whereas KERIA provides a heavier cloud wallet component. Signify and KERIA were designed based on the principle of “key at the edge (KATE)”. That is, essential cryptographic operations are performed at edge&nbsp;devices.</p><p>Some resources for Signify &amp; KERIA can be found&nbsp;here</p>  The Signify-KERIA protocol by Philip Feairheller: <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria/blob/main/docs/protocol.md">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria/blob/main/docs/protocol.md</a>  KERI API (KAPI): <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/kapi/blob/main/kapi.md">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/kapi/blob/main/kapi.md</a>   Signify Edge&nbsp;Agent <p>Signify provides an edge agent for a KERI identity wallet and is used primarily for essential cryptographic operations including key pair generation and digital signature creation. Signify utilizes the hierarchical deterministic (HD) key algorithm. For example, a Signify application could safeguard a single master seed which is used to generate and manage any number of AIDs. Signify is designed to be lightweight so as to support devices with limited capabilities.</p><p>Signify is currently available in Typescript and&nbsp;Python</p>  SignifyPy (Python) <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signifypy">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signifypy</a>  Signify-TS (Typescript) <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts</a>   KERIA Cloud&nbsp;Agent <p>KERI Agent (KERIA) provides a cloud agent for a KERI identity wallet and is used for, e.g., data storage, agent-to-agent communications, and verification of KERI key event logs (KELs). KERIA is engineered to handle the heavy lifting for users, allowing their edge devices to stay lightweight while maintaining high security by performing all essential cryptographic operations at the&nbsp;edge.</p><p>A KERIA agent is cryptographically delegated by a Signify agent using the KERI delegation protocol. All instructions from a user are signed at the edge by a Signify agent and subsequently verified by a KERIA cloud agent. KERIA is currently available in Python: <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria</a></p> Installation Guide for Node and&nbsp;NVM <p>In this guide, we will be using Node.js to run Signify-TS (Typescript) with a KERIA server running on a Docker container.</p> Install Node.js <p>Visit the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node.js</a> website to download&nbsp;Node.js.</p> Install NVM on Linux or&nbsp;MacOS <p>To easily switch between different versions of Node.js, you could use Node Version Manager (NVM). NVM on Linux and macOS may be installed using&nbsp;curl</p> curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash <p>Alternatively, we could use&nbsp;wget</p> wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash  Install NVM on&nbsp;Windows <p>On Windows, NVM may be installed from the <a href="https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases">GitHub releases&nbsp;page.</a></p><p>Note: After installing NVM, do not forget to restart your terminal. Alternatively, you can refresh the available commands in your system path by executing source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh</p> Using NVM <p>To ensure that NVM is correctly installed, you can check its version&nbsp;with:</p> nvm ls <p>To install Node.js version 18.18.2,&nbsp;run:</p> nvm install v18.18.2 <p>Here, we use v18.18.2 in this guide. This is not a requirement and other versions of Node.js should work with Signify-TS.</p> Install Dependencies and Run a KERIA&nbsp;Server <p>To install dependencies for the tutorial, you could clone this repository <a href="https://github.com/enauthn/tutorial-signify-keria">https://github.com/enauthn/tutorial-signify-keria</a> and run the following script</p> git clone https://github.com/enauthn/tutorial-signify-keria<br>cd tutorial-signify-keria<br>npm install<br>docker-compose up -d <p>where docker-compose up -d runs a KERIA server in a Docker container. Alternatively, you could get a Docker image for running a KERIA server from Docker Hub <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/weboftrust/keria">https://hub.docker.com/r/weboftrust/keria</a>.</p> Running Signify-TS Scripts <p>Here, we demonstrate Signify-TS Scripts for signing and verifying an arbitrary message. Here, a signer, called Allie, signs a message “Hello Brett” and sends it to a verifier, called Brett. Brett subsequently obtains Allie’s key event log (KEL) and uses it to verify the signature on the&nbsp;message.</p> Connecting Signify clients to the KERIA&nbsp;server <p>First, Allie and Brett must boot and then connect to a KERIA server with their Signify (edge) clients. Each boot command creates a separate agent and a database in the KERIA server. see <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keria</a> for more&nbsp;details.</p><p>Typically, Allie’s and Brett’s Signify scripts should run on separate devices, but here we put them in the same Typescript file for simplicity. Allie’s and Brett’s Signify clients may also connect to different KERI servers at different service endpoints. In this tutorial, both clients connect to a KERIA server running on the local host for simplicity.</p> await signify.ready();<br><br>const url = 'http://127.0.0.1:3901';<br>const bootUrl = 'http://127.0.0.1:3903';<br>const bran1 = signify.randomPasscode();<br>const bran2 = signify.randomPasscode();<br><br>const allieClient = new signify.SignifyClient(<br>    url,<br>    bran1,<br>    signify.Tier.low,<br>    bootUrl<br>);<br>await allieClient.boot();<br>await allieClient.connect();<br><br>const brettClient = new signify.SignifyClient(<br>    url,<br>    bran2,<br>    signify.Tier.low,<br>    bootUrl<br>);<br>await brettClient.boot();<br>await brettClient.connect(); <p>To explain the above&nbsp;script:</p>  signify.randomPasscode() generates a random string with 126-bit entropy using libsodium  new signify.SignifyClient(…) creates a new Signify instance, initialized with the newly generated passcode  allieClient.boot() creates a KERIA agent and a corresponding database at the KERIA server via port&nbsp;3903  allieClient.connect() connects a Signify agent to the corresponding KERIA agent that has been&nbsp;booted.  <p>Signify uses a passcode to generate cryptographic keys using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function">key derivation function (KDF)</a> where signify.Tier specifies how much the passcode is stretched.</p> Allie creates an&nbsp;AID <p>Before Allie can sign a message with the KERI protocol, she must first create an <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7344">autonomic identifier (AID)</a> with a key inception event in a <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7c43">Key Event Log&nbsp;(KEL)</a>.</p> const icpResult1 = await allieClient<br>    .identifiers()<br>    .create('aid1', {});<br>await waitOperation(allieClient, await icpResult1.op());<br><br>const rpyResult1 = await allieClient<br>    .identifiers()<br>    .addEndRole('aid1', 'agent', allieClient!.agent!.pre);<br>await waitOperation(allieClient, await rpyResult1.op()); <p>To explain the above&nbsp;script:</p>  allieClient.identifiers().create('aid1', {}) creates an AID where the Signify agent signs the inception event and sends the event along with its signature to the KERIA agent. Here, the AID is given an alias&nbsp;'aid1'.  allieClient.identifiers().addEndRole(...) cryptographically authorizes the KERIA agent to operate on behalf of the AID’s controller.  waitOperation(...) waits for the KERIA agent to complete its operation.  <p>addEndRole stands for “adding endpoint role authorization”. This is a mechanism in the KERI protocol where the controller of an AID cryptographically authorizes—by signing with a private key associated with the AID—a service endpoint of a KERIA agent to operate on the AID’s behalf. Another agent that needs to communicate with the authorized KERIA agent can then verify the authorization signature.</p> Brett resolves Allie’s&nbsp;AID <p>Allie and Brett may exchange their KELs using the <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-3-oobi-and-ipex-2e6b222f4b87">Out-Of-Band Introduction (OOBI)</a> protocol. Allie may generate her OOBI URL that points to her KERIA agent’s service endpoint (which has been authorized in the previous step) as&nbsp;follows:</p> const oobi1 = await allieClient.oobis().get('aid1', 'agent'); <p>The generated OOBI URL could be sent to Brett via an out-of-band channel such as email, messaging apps, or scanning QR code. Subsequently, Brett may ask his KERIA agent to resolve Allie’s OOBI to obtain the AID’s KEL from Allie’s KERIA&nbsp;agent:</p> const oobiOp = await brettClient.oobis().resolve(oobi1.oobis[0], 'aid1');<br>await waitOperation(brettClient, oobiOp);  Allie signs the&nbsp;Message <p>To sign a message, Allie may use the Signify<a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts/blob/main/src/keri/core/keeping.ts"> </a><a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts/blob/main/src/keri/core/keeping.ts">KeyManager class</a> as&nbsp;follows:</p> const aid1 = await allieClient.identifiers().get('aid1');<br>const keeper1 = await allieClient.manager!.get(aid1);<br>const message = "Test message";<br>const signature = await keeper1.sign(signify.b(message))[0];<br>console.log('signature', signature); <p>which generates the following <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-cesr-specification/">CESR-encoded</a> signature:</p> signature AAAnBe-VPfBU9-3eb7aM5GNwr_NBuoJzA8vm9AFPmgj3I4LIv1mup2bwPDlbIQ6gAgtaEZg5rwE1_fTVVTmPo0oI <p>To explain the above&nbsp;script:</p>  allieClient.identifiers().get('aid1') retrieves the information about the AID with alias 'aid1' from the KERIA&nbsp;agent  allieClient.manager!.get(aid1) creates an instance from the KeyManager class called a keeper that signs an arbitrary byte string with keeper.sign()  signify.b() turns a text string into a byte&nbsp;string.  <p>When a Signify agent creates an AID, it uses a salt together with its passcode to generates cryptographic keys associated with the AID. The salt is then encrypted and sent to the KERIA agent. allieClient.identifiers().get('aid1') also retrieves and decrypts the salt where the KeyManager could use the salt to regenerate the key for signing the&nbsp;message.</p> Brett verifies Allie’s signature <p>After Allie sends the message to Brett, Brett wants to make sure the message is really from Allie by verifying the signature on the message. Brett may retrieve Allie’s KEL and the corresponding <a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-jargon-in-a-nutshell-part-1-fb554d58f9d0#7344">key state</a> of her AID to verify the signature as&nbsp;follows:</p> const aid1StateBybrettClient = await brettClient.keyStates().get(aid1.prefix);<br>const siger = new signify.Siger({qb64: signature});<br>const verfer = new signify.Verfer({<br>    qb64: aid1StateBybrettClient[0].k[0]<br>});<br>const verificationResult = verfer.verify(siger.raw, signify.b(message));<br>console.log('verificationResult', verificationResult); <p>which gives the following output:</p> verificationResult true <p>To explain the above&nbsp;script:</p>  brettClient.keyStates().get(aid1.prefix) retrieves the key state of the Allie’s&nbsp;AID  signify.Siger({qb64: signature}) is a signature-wrapper instance of the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts/blob/main/src/keri/core/siger.ts">Siger class</a>, initialized with the Allies’ signature on the&nbsp;message.  signify.Verfer(...) is a verifier-wrapper instance of the <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts/blob/main/src/keri/core/verfer.ts">Verfer class</a>, initialized by the Allie’s public&nbsp;key  verfer.verify(...) then verifies the message and its signature using Allie’s public&nbsp;key  <p>The verification of the signature against the message indicates that the signature is valid. This ensures the authenticity and integrity of the message that Brett received from&nbsp;Allie.</p> Conclusion <p>This tutorial gives a brief introduction for using the KERI protocol with the Signify and KERIA agents, which provide a footing for building client-side KERI-based applications. Signify provides libraries for building KERI edge agents whereas KERIA provides libraries for building companion cloud agents. These agents follow the principle of “key at the edge (KATE)” where essential cryptographic operations are performed at edge&nbsp;devices.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is still the early days for these two projects, and there are not many educational materials around as of May 2024. To dive deeper into these two projects, I recommend studying their integration scripts at <a href="https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts/tree/main/examples/integration-scripts">https://github.com/WebOfTrust/signify-ts/tree/main/examples/integration-scripts</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/keri-tutorial-sign-and-verify-with-signify-keria-833dabfd356b">KERI Tutorial: Sign and Verify with Signify &amp; Keria</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/finema">Finema</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>The Microsoft Entra team is looking forward to connecting with you next week at <a href="https://www.rsaconference.com/usa">RSA Conference 2024</a> (RSAC) from May 6 to 9, 2024, in San Francisco! As we enter the age of AI and there are more identities and access points to protect, identity security has never been more paramount. From protecting workforce and external identities to non-human identities—that outnumber human identities 10 to 1—the task of securing access and the interactions between them requires taking a more comprehensive approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help customers protect every identity and every access point, I’d like to highlight recent innovations that we’ll be showcasing at this upcoming event:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Expanded passkey support for Microsoft Entra ID&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 Microsoft Entra ID external authentication methods&nbsp; 
 Microsoft Entra External ID general availability&nbsp; 
 Microsoft Entra Permissions Management and Microsoft Defender for Cloud integration general availability&nbsp; 
 Our vision for cloud access management to strengthen multicloud security&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We will be demonstrating these new innovations and sharing more about how to take a holistic approach to identity and access at RSA Conference 2024 (see the table at the end of this blog for more information).&nbsp;Now, let’s take a closer look at Microsoft Entra innovations that we’ll be showcasing at RSAC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Expanded passkey support for Microsoft Entra ID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to supporting sign-ins via a passkey hosted on a hardware security key, Microsoft Entra ID now includes additional support for device-bound passkeys in the Microsoft Authenticator app on iOS and Android. This will bring strong and convenient authentication to mobile devices for customers with the strictest security requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A passkey is a strong, phishing-resistant authentication method you can use to sign in to any internet resource that supports the W3C WebAuthN standard. Passkeys represent the continuing evolution of the FIDO2 standard aimed at creating a secure and user friendly passwordless experience for everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more about using passkeys in the Microsoft Authenticator app, <a href="https://aka.ms/AuthappPasskey">check out this blog.</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra ID external authentication methods&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While organizations increasingly choose to unify their multifactor authentication and access management solutions, thus, simplifying their identity architectures, some organizations have already deployed MFA and want to use their pre-existing MFA provider with Microsoft Entra ID. <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/public-preview-external-authentication-methods-in-microsoft/ba-p/4078808">External authentication methods</a> allow organizations to&nbsp; leverage any MFA solution to meet the MFA requirement with Entra ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At launch, external authentication methods integrations will be available with the following identity providers: Cisco, ENTRUST, HYPR, Ping, RSA, SILVERFORT, Symantec, THALES, and TrustBuilder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Read our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/how-to-authentication-external-method-manage">documentation</a> to learn more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra External ID general availability&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our next-generation, developer friendly customer identity access management (CIAM) solution, <a href="https://aka.ms/External_ID">Microsoft Entra External ID</a> will become generally available on May 15, 2024. Whether you're building applications for partners, business customers, or consumers, External ID makes secure and customizable CIAM simple. External ID enables you to:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Secure all identities with a single platform&nbsp; 
 Streamline secure collaboration&nbsp; 
 Create frictionless end user experiences&nbsp; 
 Accelerate the development of secure applications&nbsp; 
 
<p>Learn more about External ID by reading our <a href="https://aka.ms/ExternalIDGABlog">announcement blog!</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra Permissions Management and Microsoft Defender for Cloud integration general availability&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deploying applications and infrastructure across multiple clouds has become the norm. Ensuring the security of cloud applications and infrastructure requires integrating identity and permission insights into the overall security strategy. This objective is achieved through the integration of Microsoft Entra Permissions Management with Microsoft Defender for Cloud (MDC), which will soon be generally available in May.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The integration streamlines access and permission insights into other cloud postures through a unified interface. Customers benefit from recommendations on mitigating risks within the MDC dashboard, including unused identities, overprivileged permissions, and unused super identities. This facilitates the enforcement of least privilege access for cloud resources across Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Our vision for cloud access management to strengthen multicloud security&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deploying applications and infrastructure across multiple clouds has become common in today’s business landscape. At Microsoft, we have long prioritized the protection of customers’ environments, regardless of the number of clouds they use or the providers they choose. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our recent <a href="https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/final/en-us/microsoft-brand/documents/2024-State-of-Multicloud-Security-Risk-Report.pdf">2024 State of Multicloud Security Risk Report</a> reconfirms the importance of securing access in multicloud and presents valuable findings based on one year of actual usage data to enhance organizations’ understanding of their risks and facilitate the development of effective mitigation strategies. Key findings related to access and permissions include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Only 2% of the 51,000 permissions granted to human and workload identities in 2023 were utilized, with 50% of these permissions classified as high-risk.&nbsp; 
 More than 50% of identities are identified as super identities, indicating they have access to all permissions and resources within the multicloud environment.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Above all, this report confirms that the complexity of multicloud risk continues to grow. Coupled with the increase in cyberattacks targeting identities, especially those assigned to non-human entities, security teams are overwhelmed. Consequently, organizations are shifting priorities from infrastructure protection to actively monitoring and securing interactions between human and workload identities accessing corporate cloud resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We believe Microsoft can help address these challenges with our new vision for cloud access management, offering visibility into all identities and permissions in use, along with proactive risk detection to enhance protection and management of your environment. We will continue our journey to secure access to resources anywhere by developing a new converged platform that encompasses four key solution areas critical for organizations, based on our continuous engagements with customers:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM)&nbsp; 
 Privileged Access Management (PAM)&nbsp; 
 Identity Governance and Administration (IGA)&nbsp; 
 Workload Identity and Access Management (IAM)&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stay tuned to learn more about our vision in the coming weeks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 Key Insights: 
 
 Mobile driver’s licenses (mDLs) are gaining momentum as governments seek to improve service quality, combat fraud, and streamline identity verification processes. 
 Organizations like AAMVA and NIST play crucial roles in setting standards and governance for mDL implementation. 
 Interoperability is a key challenge, with the ISO standard for mDLs emerging as a widely adopted solution. 
 Governments must decide between issuing mDLs through their own wallets or leveraging third-party wallets like those from Apple, Google, and Samsung. 
 mDLs could enable seamless online identity verification for industries like banking, notary services, and access management, reducing transaction abandonment rates. 
 Potential monetization models for issuers and verifiers are being explored, as the value of mDLs lies primarily in the verification side. 
 
 Strategies: 
 
 Governments are implementing legislation to allow for the acceptance of digital forms of state-issued identities, including mDLs. 
 AAMVA’s Digital Trust Service aims to facilitate cross-state verifications by providing the necessary public keys to read mDLs. 
 Facial biometrics and liveness detection are expected to become more prevalent in conjunction with mDL verification for enhanced security. 
 Governments and industry stakeholders are exploring ways to vet and register verifiers to ensure responsible use of mDL data.

 Claim your rewards now. Predictoor DF Forges Ahead. More DF streams to&nbsp;come  Summary <p>This article starts by reviewing Ocean Data Farming (DF), the ASI Alliance, and how an ASI “yes” vote would affect Data&nbsp;Farming.</p><p>The “yes” happened. This triggered the follow-up actions:</p>  We just completed an airdrop to veOCEAN holders. You can now claim OCEAN via the DF Webapp (<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">https://df.oceandao.org/rewards</a>)  We have retired Passive &amp; Volume&nbsp;DF.  Predictoor DF continues, with room to scale up Predictoor DF and introduce new incentive streams.   1. Background  1.1 Ocean Data&nbsp;Farming <p><a href="https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming">Data Farming</a> (DF) is Ocean Protocol’s incentive program. Rewards are weekly. DF has traditionally had three streams / substreams:</p>  Passive DF. Users lock OCEAN for veOCEAN. The longer you lock or the more OCEAN you lock, the more OCEAN you get. Rewards are pro-rata to veOCEAN holdings. 150,000 OCEAN/week.  Volume DF. Users allocate veOCEAN towards data assets with high data consume volume (DCV), in a curation function. Rewards are a function of DCV and veOCEAN stake. Up to 112,500 OCEAN/week.  Predictoor DF. Run prediction bots to earn continuously. 37,500 OCEAN/week.  <p>Most user DF interactions are via the DF webapp at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org">df.oceandao.org</a>.</p> 1.2 ASI&nbsp;Alliance <p>Ocean Protocol has been working with Fetch.ai and SingularityNET to form the <a href="https://www.superintelligence.io/artificial-superintelligence-alliance">ASI Alliance</a>, with a unified token $ASI. <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-is-joining-the-superintelligence-alliance-767c82693f24">This Mar 27, 2024 article</a> describes the key mechanisms. It needed a “yes” vote from the Fetch and SingularityNET communities.</p> 1.3 ASI Alliance Impact on&nbsp;DF <p>If the event of a “yes”, there were important implications for Ocean Data Farming and veOCEAN. This <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/superintelligence-alliance-updates-to-data-farming-and-veocean-68d7b29c5100">Mar 29, 2024 post</a> describes them. From that&nbsp;post:</p><blockquote>To be ready for either outcome [yes or no], we will pause giving rewards for Passive DF and Volume DF as soon as the DF82 payout of Thu Mar 28 has completed. Also in preparation, have taken a snapshot of OCEAN locked &amp; veOCEAN balances as of 00:00 am UTC Wed Mar 27 (Ethereum block 19522003)&nbsp;…</blockquote><blockquote>Predictoor DF will continue regardless of voting&nbsp;outcome.</blockquote><p>And the section “Actions if ‘yes’ “ held the following key information about veOCEAN, Passive DF, and Volume&nbsp;DF.</p><blockquote>veOCEAN will be retired.&nbsp;…</blockquote><blockquote>Passive DF &amp; Volume DF will be&nbsp;retired.</blockquote><blockquote>People who have locked OCEAN for veOCEAN will be made whole, as&nbsp;follows.</blockquote><blockquote>Each address holding veOCEAN will be airdropped OCEAN in the amount&nbsp;of:</blockquote><blockquote>(1.25^years_til_unlock-1) * num_OCEAN_locked</blockquote><blockquote>In words: veOCEAN holders get a reward as if they had got payouts of 25% APY for their whole lock period (and kept re-upping their lock). But they get the payout soon, rather than over years of weekly DF rewards payouts. It’s otherwise the same commitment, expectations and payout as&nbsp;before.</blockquote><blockquote>This airdrop will happen within weeks after the “yes”&nbsp;vote.</blockquote><blockquote>That same address will have its OCEAN unlocked according to its normal veOCEAN mechanics and timeline (up to 4 years). After unlock, that account holder can convert the $OCEAN directly into $ASI with the published exchange&nbsp;rate.</blockquote><blockquote>Any actions taken by an account on locking / re-locking veOCEAN after the time of the snapshot will be ignored.&nbsp;…</blockquote><p>The post also held key information about psdnOCEAN, predictoor DF, and the future of&nbsp;DF.</p><blockquote>psdnOCEAN holders will be able to swap back to the OCEAN with a fixed-rate contract. For each 1 psdnOCEAN swapped they will receive &gt;1 OCEAN at a respectable ROI.&nbsp;…</blockquote><blockquote>Predictoor DF continues.&nbsp;…</blockquote><blockquote>Ocean Protocol Foundation will re-use the DF budget for its incentives programs. These can include: scaling up Predictoor DF [and&nbsp;more].</blockquote><p>(We added bold font to help cross-referencing with the “actions” section&nbsp;below.)</p> 2. A “Yes”&nbsp;Happened <p>As of Apr 16, the vote had concluded. <a href="https://twitter.com/ASI_Alliance/status/1780221024082047381">The result was a&nbsp;“yes”</a>.</p> Artificial Superintelligence Alliance on Twitter: "🎉 It's official! The ASI Alliance is launching - the world's largest decentralized network for accelerating AGI and ASI.Stay tuned for updates on our multi-billion token merger and the incredible things to come!@SingularityNET @Fetch_ai @oceanprotocol pic.twitter.com/Ewh99LlOIY / Twitter" <p>🎉 It's official!

Actions Completed Due to&nbsp;“Yes” <p>As promised to the Ocean community, we have completed the “Actions if ‘yes’” summarized above. Here are the specifics.</p> 3.1 Promise: veOCEAN will be&nbsp;retired <p>✅ Action completed: veOCEAN is&nbsp;retired.</p><p>The DF webapp functionality to lock veOCEAN is removed. Incentives to lock OCEAN into veOCEAN have been turned off&nbsp;[1].</p><p>The DF webapp functionality to withdraw locked OCEAN has been retained; therefore when time passes and the token comes unlocked (up to 4 years), the user can come and withdraw their&nbsp;OCEAN.</p> 3.2 Promise: Passive DF&nbsp;… will be&nbsp;retired <p>✅ Action completed: Passive DF is retired. (And you should claim your past Passive DF rewards.)</p><p>One can no longer enter into Passive DF because it relies on veOCEAN, which is retired. Passive DF rewards are permanently stopped.</p><p>To claim your past Passive DF&nbsp;rewards:</p>  Go to DF Rewards page at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">https://df.oceandao.org/rewards</a>. In the “Passive Rewards” section, click the “Claim All”&nbsp;button.  This webapp functionality will remain live until Aug 1, 2024. After that, you will have to use the etherscan interface to claim rewards, which is more complex. (Same for Volume DF &amp; airdrop&nbsp;below.)   3.3 Promise: Volume DF will be&nbsp;retired <p>✅ Action completed: Volume DF is retired. (And you should claim your past Volume DF rewards.)</p><p>One can no longer enter into Volume DF because it relies on veOCEAN, which is retired. Volume DF rewards are permanently stopped.</p><p>To claim your past Volume DF&nbsp;rewards:</p>  Go to DF Rewards page at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">https://df.oceandao.org/rewards</a>. In the “Active Rewards” section, click the “Revoke Token Lock Approval + Claim All” button. This will claim both past Volume DF Rewards and DF Airdrop&nbsp;Rewards.   3.4 Promise: Each address holding veOCEAN will be airdropped OCEAN <p>[according to the formula, using the Mar 27 snapshot]</p><p>✅ Action completed: Each address holding veOCEAN has been airdropped OCEAN. You should claim your airdrop&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>The OCEAN reward amount is according to the formula, using the Mar 27 snapshot (as discussed above). The reward is as if you had got payouts of 25% APY for your whole veOCEAN lock period (and kept re-upping your lock). The Appendix gives an example of payout&nbsp;amounts.</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nuRZ_LH1c1Fqq1XaUNDLZWwaJmeYmMApurrjsjmOkJ4/edit#gid=595053560">Here is the reward per&nbsp;address.</a></p><p>To claim DF Airdrop&nbsp;rewards:</p>  It’s all inside the “Active Rewards” section, just like Volume DF. Therefore…  Go to DF Rewards page at <a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">https://df.oceandao.org/rewards</a>. In the “Active Rewards” section, click the “Revoke Token Lock Approval + Claim All” button. This will claim both past Volume DF Rewards and DF Airdrop&nbsp;Rewards.   3.5 Promise: psdnOCEAN reward with respectable ROI <p>Promise expanded: holders will be able to swap back to the OCEAN with a fixed-rate contract. For each 1 psdnOCEAN swapped they will receive &gt;1 OCEAN at a respectable ROI.</p><p>✅ Action, over next several days: The ROI is set to 1.25. There are a small number (17) of psdnOCEAN holders, so we are handling them manually. Here are our&nbsp;steps:</p>  Start from <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/198FHy5h9Z9QYUojm-GF5Pmc56DN6NWrhb9ARqhAMtEY/edit#gid=0">this GSheet “snapshot of psdnOCEAN balances” page</a>  Have each user send their psdnOCEAN to 0xad0A852F968e19cbCB350AB9426276685651ce41 (DF Treasury multisig)  For each inbound tx, we will log in in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/198FHy5h9Z9QYUojm-GF5Pmc56DN6NWrhb9ARqhAMtEY/edit#gid=798720566">GSheet “transactions” page</a>  Then we will compute the user OCEAN reward, and send it to the&nbsp;user   3.6 Promise: Predictoor DF continues <p>✅ Action completed: Predictoor DF has continued while the other DF substreams were paused. It keeps&nbsp;going.</p> 3.7 Promise: Ocean Protocol Foundation will re-use the DF budget for its incentives programs <p>✅ Action on track: We plan to scale up Predictoor DF rewards over time, especially as it hits development milestones [Ref <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/ocean-protocol-update-2024-e463bf855b03">2024 roadmap</a>, sec&nbsp;2.2].</p><p>Other potential DF incentives include for running Unified Backend nodes [roadmap, sec 3.2], and for decentralized large-scale model training to support a world model on ground-truth physics [roadmap, sec&nbsp;2.2].</p><p>Given this restructuring, the previous plans for long-term rewards schedule will not be used. Now, we adapt Data Farming budget week-by-week and month-by-month, to maximize the bang-for-buck of each OCEAN deployed for&nbsp;rewards.</p> 4. Conclusion <p>This article reviewed Ocean Data Farming (DF), the ASI Alliance, and how an ASI “yes” vote would affect Data&nbsp;Farming.</p><p>The “yes” happened. This triggered the follow-up actions:</p>  We just completed an airdrop to veOCEAN holders. Users can now claim OCEAN via the DF Webapp (<a href="https://df.oceandao.org/rewards">https://df.oceandao.org/rewards</a>)  We have retired Passive &amp; Volume&nbsp;DF.  Predictoor DF continues, with room to scale up Predictoor DF and introduce new incentive streams.   Appendix: Worked DF Airdrop&nbsp;Example <p>Example. Alice recently locked 100 OCEAN for a duration of four years, and had received 100 veOCEAN to her&nbsp;account.</p>  She will get airdropped (1.25⁴–1)*100 = (2.44–1)*100 = 144 OCEAN soon after the “yes”&nbsp;vote  In four years, her initial 100 OCEAN will&nbsp;unlock.  In total, Alice will have received 244 OCEAN (144 soon, 100 in 4&nbsp;years).  Her return is approximately the same as if she’d used Passive DF &amp; Volume DF for 4 years and got 25% APY. That is: (1.2⁵⁴-1) * 100 = 2.44 * 100. Yet this updated scheme benefits her more because her 144 of that 244 OCEAN is liquid&nbsp;soon.   Notes <p>[1] We can’t actually turn off the veOCEAN contract on the Ethereum mainnet. Therefore someone could still lock OCEAN for months to years by talking directly to that contract, and then see their OCEAN unlock months to years later. It’s any user’s prerogative if they wish. But there’s no real incentive to do&nbsp;so.</p> Further resources <p>If you have more questions about the changes and how they apply to you, you can always contact us&nbsp;on:</p><p>Discord: <a href="https://discord.gg/TnXjkR5">https://discord.gg/TnXjkR5</a></p><p>Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community">https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community</a></p> Beware of&nbsp;scams <p>It is crucial for you to remain alert.

Podium&nbsp;: Venture Capital Investments Data Challenge Introduction <p>The Venture Capital Investments Challenge engaged data scientists and analysts to decode the complexities of startup funding and success. This challenge drew on an extensive dataset covering various aspects of the venture capital ecosystem. Key datasets included acquisitions, degrees, funding rounds, funds, investments, IPOs, milestones, objects, offices, people, relationships, and several specialized sets designed for in-depth analysis.</p><p>Participants analyzed over 66,368 entries, exploring startup funding details and investor engagement. They examined geographical impacts on startups and the influence of educational backgrounds and degrees. Career trajectories and networks from people.csv and relationships.csv also provided insights into successful entrepreneurship patterns.</p><p>Through data processing and model development, participants identified trends and predictive factors in the funding dynamics, market positions, and strategic milestones. This initiative showcased participants’ analytical capabilities and set the stage for advanced predictive modeling in investment strategies.</p> Winners Podium <p>The top submissions of this challenge were exceptional. Participants demonstrated outstanding ability in utilizing ML and AI to examine and predict startup success within the venture capital landscape and refine investment strategies. Let’s examine the top three submissions that stood out due to their thorough analytics and insightful conclusions.</p> 1st Place:&nbsp;Ahan <p>Ahan stood out with his application of machine learning to analyze the venture capital landscape. His detailed analysis focused on the implications of founder demographics and funding dynamics on startup outcomes. He revealed that the median acquisition price among startups with disclosed values was approximately $72.6 million, with an average time from initial investment to acquisition of 695 days. This insight highlights the broad variance in startup valuations and the typical timelines investors might anticipate for&nbsp;returns.</p><p>Moreover, in his dataset of over 16,000 instances, Ahan identified significant disparities in success rates by founder gender, with male founders achieving a 40.3% success rate compared to 27.4% for female founders. This finding points to potential systemic biases in the venture capital industry and underscores the need for broader diversity and inclusion initiatives.</p> 2nd Place: Dominikus <p>Dominikus’ entry in the Ocean Data Challenge leveraged detailed venture capital data to build a predictive model distinguishing successful and unsuccessful startups. He restructured a complex dataset into 14 subsets in his analysis, applying statistical encoding and meticulously handling missing data. His statistical models revealed significant findings: startups in the San Francisco Bay Area, affiliated with Stanford University graduates, demonstrated a 65% higher likelihood of funding success than startups in other regions and educational backgrounds.</p><p>In his evaluation, Dominikus used precise statistical methods to measure the efficacy of his models. He reported an accuracy rate of 92%, with a precision of 90% and a recall of 88%, effectively illustrating the predictive strength of his analytical approach. Additionally, the ROC curve for his model achieved an AUC of 0.91, underscoring its robustness in classifying the potential success of startups based on multiple factors, including funding history, investor relationships, and regional economic activities.</p><p>His analysis provided a clear view of the venture capital landscape, offering insights through correlation studies that identified the relationships influencing startup&nbsp;success.</p> 3rd Place:&nbsp;Bhalisa <p>Bhalisa Sodo’s analytical project thoroughly examined the factors influencing startup success within the venture capital landscape. His method involved detailed data cleaning and segmentation, processing a comprehensive dataset to uncover the dynamics of startup funding and success. Bhalisa used statistical methods to analyze correlations between founder backgrounds, funding mechanisms, and startup outcomes, presenting a quantitative foundation for his conclusions.</p><p>In his findings, Bhalisa showed that startups linked to founders from top-tier institutions like Stanford University were 30% more likely to secure funding and achieve successful exits than others. His predictive models showed an impressive accuracy rate, with the Decision Tree Classifier achieving a classification accuracy of 98% and a recall rate of 97%, highlighting its effectiveness in identifying potentially successful startups based on early-stage data&nbsp;inputs.</p><p>Moreover, Bhalisa’s research revealed that startups typically received their first significant funding round within the first two years of operation, and those receiving funding within the first year showed a 60% higher probability of reaching an exit through acquisition or IPO within eight&nbsp;years.</p><p>His analysis also noted an increasing trend in funding amounts over time, with the average funding per round growing by 15% annually since 2010, reflecting the escalating scale and stakes within the venture capital ecosystem.</p> Interesting Facts  Higher Success Rates for Stanford Graduates <p>Startups linked to founders from Stanford University show a 30% higher success rate of securing funding and achieving successful exits than those from other universities. This trend highlights Stanford’s strong network and reputation within the venture capital ecosystem.</p> Annual Increase in Funding&nbsp;Amounts <p>Since 2010, the average amount raised per startup funding round has increased by 15% annually. This growth reflects the increasing confidence and investment in startups, driven by the expanding venture capital market and the success rate of technology-driven innovations.</p> Prevalence of AI and Tech Startups in Investment Portfolios <p>Over the last decade, investments in AI and technology-focused startups have increased by 35%. This trend reflects the industry’s growing recognition of the transformative potential of AI technologies across various&nbsp;sectors.</p> Influence of Educational Background on Startup Leadership <p>Founders with Ivy League educations are 50% more likely to hold C-level positions in their startups. This statistic highlights the strong correlation between prestigious educational backgrounds and leadership roles in high-growth startups, suggesting that education continues to play a critical role in shaping entrepreneurial success.</p> Gender Funding Gap in&nbsp;Startups <p>Analysis reveals that male founders receive about 30% more funding rounds and secure 50% higher funding than female founders. Moreover, male-led startups are 20% more likely to reach advanced funding stages, highlighting persistent gender biases in venture&nbsp;capital.</p> 2024 Championship <p>Each challenge features a prize pool of $10,000, distributed among the top 10 participants. Our championship points system distributes 100 points across the top 10 finishers in each challenge, with each point valued at&nbsp;$100.</p>Top 10&nbsp;:: Venture Capital Investments Data Challenge<p>By participating in challenges, contestants accumulate points toward the 2024 Championship. Last year, the top 10 champions received an extra $10 for every point they had&nbsp;earned.</p><p>Moreover, the top 3 participants in each challenge can collaborate directly with Ocean to develop a profitable dApp based on their algorithm.

<p>Today’s consumers’ expectations for their financial interactions are changing. They require a digitally native, seamless, consistent, instantaneous experience with their financial provider right from the get-go. No longer are they willing to wait several days for identity verifications or for microdeposits to clear to start using their account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet, we know that everyday bad actors are finding new ways to break the system. As more people and businesses enter the digital economy, it’s critical that we keep them secure across all touchpoints with their accounts and beyond. Financial Institutions must protect their customers’ accounts from fraud to ultimately drive primacy, grow deposits and encourage top of wallet behaviors, thus helping them recoup the estimated <a href="https://thefinancialbrand.com/news/bank-onboarding/the-importance-of-primacy-in-banking-176198/">$450 average cost of acquisition</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open banking is the thread connecting the ecosystem to make account opening faster, secure, and more frictionless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a common scenario that financial institutions deal with on a daily basis:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 ‘John Doe’ opened a new checking account with ‘AcmeBank’ and is ready to fund it with another existing account he has with ‘Partnerbank’&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 How does AcmeBank know that John is the actual owner of the account at Partnerbank? Should Acmebank proceed with posting the ACH file to the Nacha (ACH) network, letting the transaction go through? If John Doe were a bad actor, and Acme bank allowed the payment to go through without doing appropriate checks, John Doe could move that money elsewhere and AcmeBank could get an unauthorized payment return from ‘Partnerbank’, resulting in fraud losses.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 Similarly, some insurance companies simply ask for account and routing number verification before disbursing funds, not verifying the identity of the receiver. Here, John Doe can impersonate another person, and use his own personal details to re-direct an insurance payout or a payroll disbursement to his account. &nbsp; 
 



 What is the ecosystem doing about it?&nbsp; 



<p><a href="https://www.nacha.org/news/fighting-credit-push-fraud#:~:text=Under%20these%20new%20Rules%2C%20all,in%20monitoring%20transactions%20for%20fraud.">New rules and guidelines are being published by Nacha</a> – operator of ACH payments – that introduce additional risk management frameworks for ACH senders, as well as recipients. Ecosystem participants such as merchants, ecommerce platforms, lenders, and insurance providers may be required to include account verification and identity verification, multi-factor authentication, velocity tracking and KYC/KYB improvements. <a href="https://www.nacha.org/content/mastercard">Mastercard</a> is a Nacha Preferred Partner for Compliance and Risk and Fraud Prevention with a focus on account validation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to more thorough fraud checks being conducted by originators, receivers now also must participate in fraud monitoring and flagging to reduce risk. In the above example, Acmebank, the receiving financial institution, will also need to perform additional fraud checks. &nbsp;</p>



 What can you do?&nbsp; 



<p>Mastercard Open Banking helps financial institutions identify, manage and tackle fraud risk on an ongoing basis.&nbsp; Examples of our solutions include instant account details verification, device and identity verification. When used in conjunction with other customer fraud solutions, they help secure interactions that consumers have with their financial provider.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last year, Mastercard debuted Open Banking Identity Verification for the U.S. market and continues to invest in additional functionality that leverage our extensive fraud and identity networks. Before initiating a transaction, financial institutions can verify a number of factors, including:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Confirming account ownership information, including name, address, phone and email, in real-time&nbsp; 



 Validating identity profiles and quantifying identity risk&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Examining the risk level of user activity patterns and associations to detect fraudulent behavior&nbsp; 



 Verifying device authenticity and capturing signals of device fraud&nbsp; 
 



<p>Beyond Open Banking Identity Verification, Mastercard offers services to streamline account funding, including:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 Account Owner Verification: A one-time API request that returns the account owner(s) name, address, email and phone number for a select account. This verifies that the bank account being linked is owned by the person opening a new account and complements KYC risk mitigation in real time.&nbsp; 



 Account Detail Verification: Instantly authenticates and verifies account details, including account and routing numbers, to help mitigate fraud, reduce manual entry errors and maximize confidence in payment transactions.&nbsp; 



 Account Balance Check: Easily determines account balance before moving funds to a new account. This ensures that the amount being moved to the new account is available with an accurate, real-time balance snapshot, and reduces costly NSF returns.&nbsp; 



 Payment Success Indicator: A score that predicts a transaction’s likelihood to settle for a specific consumer “today” and up to nine days in the future. &nbsp; 
 



<p>Now let’s look the journey again with our solutions:&nbsp;</p>



 
 Consumer has opened a new checking account with ‘Acme Bank’ and is ready to fund it using existing bank account at ‘Partnerbank’&nbsp; 



 Consumer agrees to T&amp;Cs and gives permission through Mastercard’s Connect widget for their bank data to be accessed and shared with Acme bank&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



 Consumer selects their Partnerbank account and enters banking login credentials (or biometrics where applicable)&nbsp; 



 Consumer selects funding account and amount&nbsp; 



 Acme bank calls our above APIs in the background to check account and identity details in real-time and proceeds with the processing the payment&nbsp;

  <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I’m thrilled to share that the public preview of external authentication methods in Microsoft Entra ID is scheduled for release in the first half of May. This feature will allow you to use your preferred multifactor authentication (MFA) solution with Entra ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deploying MFA is the single most important step to securing user identities. A <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/how-effective-is-multifactor-authentication-at-deterring-cyberattacks/">Microsoft Research study of MFA effectiveness</a> showed that the use of MFA reduced the risk of compromise by more than 99.2%! Some organizations have already deployed MFA and want to reuse that MFA solution with Entra ID. External authentication methods allows organizations to reuse any MFA solution to meet the MFA requirement with Entra ID.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of you might be familiar with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/conditional-access/controls">custom controls</a>. External authentication methods are the replacement of <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/upcoming-changes-to-custom-controls/ba-p/1144696">custom controls</a>, and they provide several benefits over the custom controls approach. These include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 External authentication method integration, which uses industry standards and supports an open model&nbsp; 
 External authentication methods are managed the same way as Entra methods&nbsp; 
 External authentication methods are supported for a wide range of Entra ID use cases (including PIM activation) 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've invited Greg Kinasewitz, Product Manager for Microsoft Entra ID, to tell you more about this new capability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, and as always, let us know what you think!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nitika Gupta</p>
<p>Group Product Manager</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greg here. I’m super excited to walk you through some of the key capabilities of external authentication methods and readiness from partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’ve heard from some of you about wanting to use another MFA solution along with the power of Entra ID functionality like the rich features of Conditional Access, Identity Protection, and more.&nbsp; Customers using Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) with a deployment of another MFA solution have been vocal in wanting this functionality so they can migrate from AD FS to Entra ID. Organizations that are using the Conditional Access custom controls preview have given feedback on needing a solution that enables more functionality. External authentication methods enable your users to authenticate with an external provider as part of satisfying MFA requirements in Entra ID to fill these needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What are external authentication methods, and how do you use them? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>External authentication methods can be used to satisfy MFA requirements from Conditional Access Policies, Privileged Identity Management role activation, Identity Protection risk-based polices and Microsoft Intune device registration. They’re created and managed as part of the Entra ID authentication methods policy.&nbsp; This gives consistent manageability and experience with the built-in methods. You’ll add an external authentication method with the new “Add external method” button in the Entra Admin Center authentication methods management.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: External authentication methods are added from and listed in authentication methods policies admin experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a user is choosing a method to satisfy MFA, external authentication methods are listed alongside built-in methods that the user can use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 2: External authentication methods are shown next to the built-in methods during sign-in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To learn more, check out our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/authentication/how-to-authentication-external-method-manage">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 What providers will support external authentication methods? 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At launch, external authentication methods integrations will be available with the following identity providers. Please check with your identity provider to find out more about availability:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the providers that now have integrations in place, external authentication methods is a standards-based open model where any authentication provider that wants to build an integration can do so by following the <a href="https://aka.ms/EAM-Integration-Docs">integration documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re super excited for you to be able to start using external authentication methods to help secure your users, and we’re looking forward to your feedback!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about these integrations, please visit the Microsoft booth at the RSA Conference next week. There will also be an RSA Conference session hosted by Microsoft Intelligent Security Association (MISA) where Duo will showcase their external authentication methods integration.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alexei Balaganski</a></p><p>It might be just my pet peeve, but I never really liked the term “Firewall”. Of course, the history of IT is full of words that have completely changed their meaning over the decades yet still occasionally cause discussions among experts. <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/blog/balaganski/antivirus-is-dead-so-what">Is antivirus dead</a>, for example, considering that they stopped making real viruses years ago?</p>
<p>Firewall, however, stands out even more. The original brick-and-mortar one had one purpose only: to limit the spread of fire between buildings. A real firewall does not have any holes, and surely, it cannot apply any logic to different kinds of fire… A network firewall, however, could. That was its primary purpose – to filter network traffic based on defined rules, letting “good” traffic in, and keeping malicious stuff out. Over the following decades, the concept has evolved significantly, with next-generation firewalls adding capabilities like deep packet inspection, intrusion prevention, and even identity management.</p>
<p>Multiple ranges of specialized products have emerged, like Web Application Firewalls specializing on protecting web apps and APIs or even Database Firewalls designed to prevent SQL-specific attacks on relational databases. A modern firewall is thus a sophisticated solution that combines multiple layers of security, often powered by behavior analytics and artificial intelligence – a far cry from the original rules-based one. Is it even fair to continue referring to them as brick walls?</p>
<p>I can see you asking me already: why have I even brought this pet peeve of mine up? Well, recently I was looking at a new security tool — <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloudsecurity/post/sql-firewall-now-built-into-oracle-database-23c">Oracle SQL Firewall</a> — which the company has built into its upcoming Oracle Database 23ai release. And while I wholeheartedly agree with the product’s vision, surely, calling it just a firewall is a bit odd.</p>
<p>You see, all past and current firewalls (even Oracle’s own specialized Database Firewall) are operating on the network level, forming a perimeter around a resource that requires protection and filtering traffic between it and its clients. The problem is that in the modern hyperconnected world, there are so many potential network paths between sensitive data and potentially malicious actors that protecting them all appears to be impossible.</p>
<p>This is why the concept of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/data-centric-security">data-centric security</a> has emerged years ago, focusing on protecting data itself throughout its entire lifecycle instead of constantly plugging holes in existing networks, servers, and applications. Oracle Database’s “killer feature” has always been the ability to keep all kinds of information (relational, document- and graph-based, spatial, and even vector) in one place and run complex workloads like AI training directly within the database. Integrating an additional security layer to prevent SQL-level attacks directly into the DB core is therefore a major step towards data-centric security.</p>
<p>The new Oracle Database 23ai adds multiple new capabilities that can also create new attack vectors. For example, using Select AI to generate SQL queries from natural language prompts is a great tool for data analysts and business application developers. But to enable it, a database must communicate with an external large language model, and conventional firewalls simply cannot protect it from potential abuse.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: High-level overview of SQL Firewall’s architecture</p>
<p>Oracle SQL Firewall, on the other hand, operates directly in the database core, making sure that it cannot be bypassed, regardless of the SQL execution path – whether coming from an external client, a local privileged user, or a generative AI solution. Residing directly in the database also provides it with the necessary insight into all the activities happening there.</p>
<p>Over time, it learns how various clients work with the data, establishing their behavior profiles and creating policies based on actions that are allowed for specific data. These allow-lists explicitly define what SQL statements a specific database user is supposed to perform. Everything else – suspicious anomalies, zero-day attacks, and, of course, SQL injection attacks – is blocked. However, it is possible to run SQL Firewall in a permissive mode as well, just generating audit records and alerts.</p>
<p>This protection is not only ubiquitous and impossible to bypass, but also completely transparent to any client applications, local or remote. There is no need to change existing network settings, introduce a proxy service or give a third-party vendor access to your sensitive data for monitoring. As an added benefit, SQL Firewall incorporates mandatory identity checks through session context, making credential theft or abuse much more difficult.</p>
<p>Of course, Oracle already had several security tools with similar coverage for years, including Audit Vault and Database Firewall – and they are even more capable in a way, providing coverage for non-Oracle databases as well. However, SQL Firewall is a core function of the new 23ai release, not an additional product. It is currently available in Oracle Database Enterprise Edition and requires either Oracle Database Vault or Oracle Audit Vault and Database Firewall.</p>
<p>Its configuration can be managed in several ways: either using the Oracle Cloud’s UI (exposed through <a href="https://www.oracle.com/security/database-security/data-safe/">Oracle Data Safe</a>) or by utilizing command line tools or APIs. Needless to say, it is available at no extra cost and has negligible performance overhead. This way, it not only implements data-centric security, but also helps enforce the “security by design” principle and facilitates the adoption of <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/insights/zero-trust">Zero Trust architectures</a>.</p>
<p>So, is SQL Firewall supposed to replace all the other data security tools? Not at all, its goal is to add another layer of protection into an existing defense-in-depth stack. Often, it will, in fact, be the last line of defense, positioned directly in front of your sensitive data. Should it be called a firewall? Again, while I, personally, don’t like the term, a rose by any other name would smell as sweet… As KuppingerCole Analysts always stress – you should not look at the labels and always check the actual capabilities offered by a product.</p>
<p>With Oracle’s new solution, you can address two major problems at the same time: protecting databases from SQL-based attacks and implementing 100% audit coverage of database activities. Not bad for a firewall, I think…</p>

  <p>We really, really want to eliminate passwords. There’s really <a href="https://aka.ms/yourpassword">nothing anyone can do</a> to make them better. As more users have adopted multifactor authentication (MFA), attackers have increased their use of Adversary-in-the-Middle (AitM) phishing and social engineering attacks, which trick people into revealing their credentials.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can we defeat these attacks while making safe sign-in even easier? Passkeys!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A passkey is a strong, phishing-resistant authentication method you can use to sign in to any internet resource that supports the W3C WebAuthN standard. Passkeys represent the continuing evolution of the FIDO2 standard, which should be familiar to anyone who’s followed or joined the passwordless movement. We already support signing into Entra ID using a passkey hosted on a hardware security key and today, we’re delighted to announce additional support for passkeys. Specifically, we’re adding support for device-bound passkeys in the Microsoft Authenticator app on iOS and Android for customers with the strictest security requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we describe the new capabilities we’re adding to Microsoft Authenticator, let’s review the basics of passkeys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Passkeys neutralize phishing attempts 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Passkeys provide high security assurance by applying <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccertenroll/public-key-infrastructure">public-private key cryptography</a> and requiring direct interaction with the user. As I detailed in a <a href="https://aka.ms/allyourcreds">previous blog</a>, passkeys benefit from “Verifier Impersonation Resistance":&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 URL-specific. The provisioning process for passkeys records the relying party’s URL, so the passkey will only work for sites with that same URL.&nbsp; 
  Device-specific. The relying party will only grant access to the user if the passkey is synched, stored, or connected to the device from which they’re requesting access.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  User-specific. The user must prove they’re physically present during authentication, usually by performing a gesture on the device from which they’re requesting access.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together, these characteristics make passkeys almost impossible to phish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 You can host passkeys on dedicated hardware security keys, phones, tablets, and laptops 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can host their passkeys on dedicated hardware security keys (such as FIDO2 security keys) or on user devices such as phones, tablets, or PCs. Windows 10/11, iOS 17, and Android 14 are examples of user device platforms that support passkeys. Each supports signing in with a passkey hosted directly on the user device itself or by connecting to a nearby user device or security key that hosts the passkey, such as a mobile device within Bluetooth range, an NFC-enabled security key, or a USB security key plugged into the user device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your organization issues dedicated hardware security keys, you sign-in by inserting your key into the USB port or tapping it to the NFC scanner and perform the PIN or biometric verification it requires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To sign-in using a passkey on a user device, simply scan your face or fingerprint with your device or enter your device PIN. It’s also simple to sign-in to an application on a separate device, such as a new phone or a PC. Point the camera of the device hosting your passkey at the QR code displayed on the separate device and use your passkey along with your biometric or PIN to sign in. You may have already followed this process by using an Android or iPhone to sign into services such as Amazon.com.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Passkeys may be device-bound or syncable 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the scenario, you may prefer a device-bound passkey or a syncable passkey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A device-bound passkey, as the name suggests, never leaves the device to which it’s issued. If you sign-in using a security key or Windows Hello, you’re using a device-bound passkey. By definition, you can’t back up or restore a device-bound passkey because during these operations the passkey would leave the hardware element. This restriction is important for organizations that must, sometimes by law, protect passkeys from any security vulnerabilities that could arise during synchronization and recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While they offer strong security, dedicated hardware keys can be expensive to issue and manage. If you lose, replace, or destroy the dedicated device, you must provision a brand-new passkey on a new device. And since device-bound passkeys aren’t portable or recoverable, they increase friction for people trying to move away from passwords. To simplify the experience for users who don’t operate in highly regulated environments, the industry introduced support for syncable passkeys. You can back up and recover a syncable passkey, which makes it possible to share the same passkey between devices or to restore it if you lose or upgrade your device—there’s no need to provision a new one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Syncable passkeys on user client devices are easy to use, easy to manage, and offer high security 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Syncable passkeys on user devices are exciting because they address many of the toughest usability and recoverability challenges that have confronted organizations trying to move to passwordless, phishing-resistant authentication. Hosting the passkey on the user’s device means organizations don’t have to issue or manage a separate device, and syncing it among the user’s client devices and the cloud massively reduces the expense of recovering and reissuing device-bound keys. And on top of all this, replacing passwords with passkeys thwarts more than 99% of identity attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We expect this combination of benefits will make syncable passkeys the best option for the vast majority of users and organizations. Android and iOS devices can host syncable passkeys today, and we’re working to add support in Windows by this fall. Our roadmap for 2024 includes support for both device-bound and syncable passkeys in Microsoft Entra ID and <a href="https://aka.ms/VasuJoyWPD2024">Microsoft consumer accounts</a>. Stay tuned for further announcements later this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Device-bound passkeys in Microsoft Authenticator 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Industry or governmental regulation, or other highly strict security policies, require that some enterprises and government agencies use device-bound passkeys for signing in to Microsoft Entra. This small fraction of organizations has strict requirements governing the recovery of lost credentials and for preventing employees from sharing credentials with anyone else. Nonetheless, these organizations also want the usability, manageability, and deployment benefits of storing passkeys on user-client devices such as mobile phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p>Advantages of hosting passkeys on a user device:&nbsp;</p>
 
  Organizations don’t have to provision dedicated hardware.&nbsp; 
  Users are less likely to lose track of their daily computing device.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  It’s easy to sign in with a passkey hosted on a user device. 
 




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We know that device-bound keys are a must-have for many of our largest, most regulated and most security conscious customers. That’s why we’ve been collaborating with these customers, along with the broader FIDO community, to provide additional options. As part of this work, we’re adding support for device-bound passkeys in the Microsoft Authenticator app on iOS and Android. Instead of provisioning separate devices, high-security organizations can now configure Entra ID to let employees sign-in using their existing phone and their device-bound passkey. Users get a familiar phone interface, including biometrics or local lockscreen PIN or password, while their organizations meet strict security requirements because users can’t sync, share, or recover any device-bound passkey hosted in Microsoft Authenticator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizations that use device-bound passkeys trade the benefit of large investments that vendors such as Google (<a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2022/10/SecurityofPasskeysintheGooglePasswordManager.html">see related article</a>) and Apple (<a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/security/secure-icloud-keychain-recovery-secdeb202947/web">see related article</a>) have made in creating high-security, self-service passkey recovery models for the benefit of meeting strict regulatory or security requirements. They become responsible for sharing and recovering device-bound passkeys, including those hosted in Microsoft Authenticator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For detailed guidance on how to get started with device-bound passkeys hosted in Microsoft Authenticator, please refer to our <a href="https://aka.ms/PasskeyInAuthenticator">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft’s commitment to passwordless authentication 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft is continuing to enhance our support for passkey in products such as Entra, Windows, and Microsoft accounts. Please continue to send us feedback, so we can help you eliminate passwords from your environment forever.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Joerg Resch</a></p><p>As eIDAS2 prepares to go live, its implications extend far beyond the borders of the European Union, setting a new global standard for digital identity management. Organizations worldwide need to understand and prepare for these changes, ensuring they can operate effectively in a new era of digital identity. The 2024 European Identity and Cloud Conference (EIC) provides a unique opportunity to gain insights, share knowledge, and prepare for the future of digital identity, where security, privacy, and user control are at the forefront of digital transactions.</p>
<p>In a digital era characterized by an increasing reliance on online services and transactions, the security and reliability of digital identities has never been more critical. The European Union has taken a groundbreaking step with the publication of EU Regulation 2024/1183, officially known as eIDAS2. This new regulation, set to come into force on May 20, 2024, not only strengthens the framework for digital identities within the EU but also sets a global precedent for how digital identity services can be managed and utilized. Its implementation, which coincides with EIC 2024, could reshape organizational strategies worldwide.</p>
 What is eIDAS2? 
<p>eIDAS2 builds on the original electronic Identification, Authentication and trust Services (eIDAS) regulation aimed at enhancing trust in electronic transactions across the EU. The revision introduces several pivotal elements, most notably the European Digital Identity Wallets (EDIW). These wallets serve as secure digital tools that allow EU citizens and businesses to store, manage, and utilize personal identification data and electronic attestations of attributes seamlessly across borders. This framework ensures that every natural and legal person in the EU can access public and private services online without sacrificing control over their personal data.</p>
 The Significance of eIDAS2 for Organizations Globally 
<p>eIDAS2 is not just a regulatory framework for Europe; it is a beacon for global digital identity management. Organizations around the world should pay attention to these developments for several reasons:</p>
 
 Standard Setting in Digital Identity: eIDAS2 sets a high standard for privacy, security, and interoperability that could become a global benchmark. Non-EU organizations dealing with European partners will need to understand these standards to ensure compliance and smooth interactions. 
 Enhanced Security and Trust: With the introduction of <a href="https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/product-requirements/compliance/conformity-assessment/index_en.htm#:~:text=Conformity%20assessment%20organisations%20These%20notified%20bodies%20are%20organisations,NANDO%20website%20%28New%20Approach%20Notified%20and%20Designated%20Organisations%29.">conformity assessment bodies</a> and certification mechanisms, eIDAS2 ensures that digital identity tools and services are reliable and secure. This level of trustworthiness is something organizations worldwide might emulate to enhance their digital identity solutions. 
 Innovation in Identity Management: The EDIW promotes innovation in how identities and attributes are managed and utilized. Organizations can use this model to develop similar solutions, improving customer experiences and operational efficiencies. 
 
 Implications for Accessing Services 
<p>A key component of eIDAS2 is its inclusivity. The regulation mandates that the use of the EDIW is voluntary and that services cannot discriminate against those who choose not to use digital wallets. This principle may influence global service delivery models, emphasizing the need for flexibility in how services and identities are managed digitally.</p>
 Relevance to the Global Digital Economy 
<p>The digital economy is inherently borderless, where services and goods traverse national boundaries in milliseconds. The eIDAS2 framework facilitates this movement in the EU, potentially creating a ripple effect worldwide as other regions seek to ensure their digital identity systems are interoperable with Europe's. This alignment could lead to smoother transactions, enhanced security, and a more connected global digital economy.</p>
 European Digital Identity Wallets: A Closer Look 
<p>EDIWs are at the heart of eIDAS2. They allow users to control their identity data fully, choosing when and how much information to share when accessing services. This user-centric approach not only enhances privacy but also empowers individuals, fostering a more trustful digital environment. For organizations, understanding how these wallets work and integrating compatible systems will be crucial.</p>
 OpenID4VC: Enhancing the European Digital Identity Wallet 
<p>One of the core elements of the EDIW is OpenID for Verifiable Credentials (OpenID4VC), a protocol that stands to revolutionize the way verifiable credentials are exchanged and managed within the eIDAS2 framework. OpenID4VC facilitates the secure and seamless exchange of credentials between issuers, holders, and verifiers, making it a pivotal component in the implementation of the EDIW.</p>
<p>This protocol not only simplifies the process of verifying credentials in real time but also ensures that all transactions adhere to the highest standards of security and privacy mandated by eIDAS2. By integrating OpenID4VC, the EDIW allows users to assert personal data or attributes stored in their wallets without revealing any more information than necessary. This capability is crucial for maintaining user privacy and control over personal information. For organizations globally, understanding and implementing OpenID4VC will be essential to interact efficiently with European entities under the new regulations. The protocol's adoption could also set a precedent for similar initiatives worldwide, promoting a more interconnected and interoperable digital identity landscape. The integration of OpenID4VC into the EDIW exemplifies the EU’s commitment to pioneering advanced, user-centric digital identity solutions that could influence future developments in global digital identity frameworks.</p>
 eIDAS 2 is the Key Topic at EIC 
<p>The fact that EIC, Europe's leading conference on Digital ID coincides with the enforcement of eIDAS2 is serendipitous for all stakeholders. This convergence will provide a platform for immediate feedback, discussions, and strategy development among policymakers, industry leaders, and technology developers. For attendees, it offers a firsthand look at the regulation's rollout and immediate implications, making it an essential event for anyone involved in digital identity, cybersecurity, or European market operations.

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 16th April to 30th April&nbsp;2024 <p>Welcome to our latest edition of Veriscope Regulatory Recap. In this edition, we will break down recent developments in cryptocurrency regulations across Europe and the&nbsp;UK.</p> Europe Strengthens Crypto Oversight with New Regulations <p>The European Parliament recently passed a new set of rules aimed at making cryptocurrency transactions safer and more transparent.</p><p>These rules are part of the Anti-Money Laundering Regulations (AMLR) and mainly affect companies that handle crypto transactions, such as exchanges.</p><p>Under these new regulations, companies must now do more thorough checks on their customers and monitor any suspicious activities. They’ll report these to a new regulatory body called the Authority for Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AMLA).</p><p>According to the authorities, this step will prevent crimes such as money laundering and terrorism financing through crypto transactions.</p><p>Central to these regulations is the <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/eu-parliament-greenflags-mica-potential-impact-on-the-crypto-landscape">EU’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA)</a> framework, which will be fully enforced by the end of this&nbsp;year.</p> UK Plans New Framework for Crypto and Stablecoins <p>Over in the UK, the government is working on new guidelines for cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, expected to be introduced by July. Their reported aim is to foster innovation while ensuring consumer protection.</p><p>Bim Afolami, the economic secretary to the Treasury, highlighted this at the Innovate Finance Global Summit 2024, stressing the importance of the UK staying competitive in financial technology. The upcoming regulations will cover various aspects of crypto operations, including trading and managing digital&nbsp;assets.</p><blockquote>“Once it goes live, a whole host of crypto asset activities, including operating in exchange, taking custody of customer assets and other things, will come within the regulator perimeter for the first&nbsp;time.”</blockquote><blockquote>- Bim Afolami, economic secretary to the&nbsp;Treasury</blockquote><p>This move comes as part of a <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/crypto-regulations-in-the-united-kingdom-a-comprehensive-analysis">broader effort to modernize the UK’s financial system</a>. Authorities are also set to get more power to directly access crypto assets in cases of suspected illegal activities.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/SakibM/status/1783850385607643533">Image Source</a>)<p>Although the UK’s crypto community and industry at large are welcoming the UK’s plan to roll out new crypto regulations by June/July this year, they are also worried about its possible impact on the broader ecosystem.</p><p>Hence, the authorities must ensure that the crypto users aren’t burdened with overly stringent measures that could stifle innovation and growth in the sector. All stakeholders must ensure that the user experience and security remain intact despite the new regulatory measures in&nbsp;place.</p><p>Interestingly, here’s how the UK and the EU compare in terms of their approach to crypto regulations:</p><p>Overall, the new developments in Europe and the UK demonstrate their effort to keep pace with the fast-evolving world of cryptocurrency. While focusing on security and transparency, these regulations also show an understanding of the need to adapt to the ever-changing digital landscape, ensuring that the crypto industry can continue to grow and&nbsp;evolve.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-mexico">Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in&nbsp;Mexico</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-indonesia">Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in Indonesia</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-canada">Guide to FATF Travel Rule Compliance in&nbsp;Canada</a></p><p><a href="https://issuu.com/shyftnetwork/docs/global_crypto_regulatory_outlook_2024_-_shyft_netw#google_vignette">The Visual Guide on Global Crypto Regulatory Outlook&nbsp;2024</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/almost-70-of-all-fatf-assessed-countries-have-implemented-the-crypto-travel-rule">Almost 70% of all FATF-Assessed Countries Have Implemented the Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule</a></p> About Veriscope‍ <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

  <p>I'm thrilled to announce that Microsoft Entra External ID, our next-generation, developer-friendly customer identity access management (CIAM) solution will be generally available starting May 15th. Whether you're building applications for partners, business customers or consumers, External ID makes secure and customizable CIAM simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Microsoft Entra External ID&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secure and customize external identities’ access to applications&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Entra External ID enables you to: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 
 Secure all identities with a single solution&nbsp; 
 Streamline secure collaboration&nbsp; 
 Create frictionless end user experiences&nbsp; 
 Accelerate the development of secure applications&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Secure all identities with a single solution &nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Managing external identities, including customers, partners, business customers, and their access policies can be complex and costly for admins, especially when managing multiple applications with a growing number of users and evolving security requirements. With External ID, you can consolidate all identity management under the security and reliability of Microsoft Entra. Microsoft Entra provides a unified and consistent experience for managing all identity types, simplifying identity management while reducing costs and complexity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building External ID on the same stack as Entra ID allows us to innovate quickly and enables admins to extend the Microsoft Entra capabilities they use to external identities, including our industry-leading adaptive access policies, fraud protection, verifiable credentials, and built-in identity governance. Our launch customers have chosen External ID as their CIAM solution as it allows them to manage all identity types from a single platform:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Komatsu will be using Entra External ID for all external-facing applications. This will help us deliver a great experience to our customers and ensure we're a trusted partner that is easy to do business with." </p>
<p>- Michael McClanahan, Vice President, Transformation and CIO&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Industry-leading identity security provides end-to-end access to applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Streamline secure collaboration &nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boundaries between consumers and business customers are blurring, as are the boundaries between partners and employees. Collaborating with external users like business customers and partners can be challenging; they need access to the right internal resources to do their work, but that access must be removed when it's no longer needed to reduce security risks and safeguard internal data. In this changing world, even trusted collaboration needs least-privilege safeguards, strong governance, and pervasive branding. With <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/manage-guest-access-with-access-reviews">ID Governance for External ID</a>, the same lifecycle management and access management capabilities for employees can be leveraged for business guests as well. Guest governance capabilities complement <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/what-is-b2b">External ID B2B collaboration</a> that’s already widely used by Entra customers worldwide to&nbsp; make collaboration secure and seamless.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, you may want to collaborate with an external marketing agency on a new campaign. With B2B collaboration, you can invite the agency staff to join your tenant as guests and assign them access to the relevant resources, such as a Teams channel for communication, a SharePoint site for project management, and a OneDrive folder for file sharing.&nbsp; <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/cross-tenant-access-overview">Cross-tenant access settings</a> allow you to have granular controls over which users from specific external organizations get access to your resources, as well as control which external organizations your users access.&nbsp; <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/microsoft-entra-id-governance-licensing-for-business-guests/ba-p/3575579">ID Governance for External ID</a> will automatically review and revoke their access after a period of inactivity or when the project is completed. This way, you can seamlessly collaborate while ensuring only authorized external users have access to internal resources and data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Control what resources external collaborators can access with cross-tenant access settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Create frictionless end user experiences&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personalized and flexible user experiences are critical to drive customer adoption and retention. External ID lets you reduce end-user friction at sign in by natively integrating secure authentication experiences into your web and mobile apps. You can leverage a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/identity-providers">variety of authentication</a> options, such as social identities like Google, Facebook, local or federated accounts, and even verifiable credentials to make it easy for your end users to sign-up/sign-in. External ID enables you to immerse end-users in your brand and create engaging user-centric experiences with progressive profiling, increasing end-user satisfaction and driving brand love.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Design secure, intuitive, and frictionless sign-up and sign-in user journeys that immerse external identities in your brand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>External ID allows you to further personalize and optimize end-user experiences by collecting and analyzing end-user data, improving their user journey while complying with privacy regulations. Our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/customers/how-to-user-insights">user insight dashboards</a> help monitor user activities and sign-up/sign-in trends, so that you can assess and improve your end-user experience strategy with data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Accelerate the development of secure applications&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Identity is a foundational building block of any modern application, but many developers may have little experience integrating identity and security into their apps. External ID turns your developers into identity pros by making it easy to integrate identity into web and mobile applications with a few clicks. Developers can get started creating their first application in minutes either directly from the Microsoft Entra portal or within their developer tools such as <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/customers/visual-studio-code-extension">Visual Studio Code.</a> We recently announced that our <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/customers/concept-native-authentication">Native Authentication</a> now supports Android and iOS, allowing developers to build pixel-perfect sign-up and sign-in journeys into mobile apps using either our API or the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL):&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“A mobile app sign in journey could have taken us months to design and build, but with Microsoft Entra External ID Native Auth, it took the team just one week to build a functionally comparable and even more secure solution.” </p>
<p>– Gary McLellan, Head of Engineering Frameworks and Core Mobile Apps, Virgin Money&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Developer Center is a great starting point for developer to find quick start guides, demos, blogs and more showcasing how to build secure user flows into apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Backed by the reliability and resilience of Microsoft Entra, developers can launch from a globally distributed architecture designed to accommodate the needs of growing user bases; ensuring their external-facing apps can handle millions of users during peak periods, without disrupting end-user experiences or compromising security.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Customer loyalty is won – and lost – at login. <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/resources/content-library/misc/3743-2023-consumer-survey-brand-loyalty-digital-economy.html">60% of customers admit to abandoning an account forever when they have trouble signing in</a>. Convenience and ease of use are key, and as customer expectations become ever more exacting, organizations looking to retain customers and grow loyalty need to prioritize removing unnecessary barriers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the point of login can be such a cause for session and cart abandonment, many websites offer a convenient "Keep Me Signed In" or "Stay Signed In" checkbox on their sign-in screen, allowing consumers to keep their sessions active longer. This functionality can significantly improve customer experience and boost revenue, and has become a familiar feature across numerous applications and online platforms. However, longer-lasting sessions bring with them an elevated risk of session hijacking, which can lead to companies shouldering higher fraud resolution costs, or possibly hesitating to implement “Keep Me Signed In” at all, to the detriment of customer experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenge, therefore, lies in finding a way to properly secure long-lived sessions to satisfy customers while protecting your business. Whether your organization has already implemented “Keep Me Signed In” or you’re still considering whether it may be a good fit for your business, read on for an overview of the benefits of this customer-pleasing functionality and the role of advanced <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/capabilities/threat-protection.html">threat protection</a> in decreasing the risk of session compromise.</p>

<p>Editor’s note: Thanks to Software Engineer, Kevin Chiang, for this week’s post.</p>
<p>Any time you sign up for a service, you start receiving emails from them; it’s basically a law. If your inbox looks like mine, it’s bombarded with marketing emails, weekly digests, or notifications like “You’re nearing your spending limit in GCP” (some of these might be more important than others). Email works well as the first place to send notifications since people usually sign up with their email. But with everything going to your inbox nowadays, it’s easy to miss that onboarding reminder for Sarah, who starts next Monday and still needs her Github and Zoom accounts provisioned.</p>
<p>So what is the solution? These days, every workplace has an all-instant messaging/chat service. That’s usually where people are most responsive. So why not receive your notifications there as well?</p>
<p>Let me introduce you to YeshBot – our Slack notification service.</p>
<p>Combined with the rest of the YeshID platform, it removes the need for you to go through your checklist and manually slack/nag task owners to finish their work. But instead, with a click of a button, all folks who are involved with onboarding or offboarding are notified of the work that needs to get done!</p>
 Connect YeshBot to your account 
<p>Connecting the bot is easy! Simply log in to your YeshID admin account and find the “Add to Slack” button under Settings &gt; YeshID Slack Bot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click the button to complete the OAuth flow and you are ready to go.&nbsp; For details on how to do this see our <a href="https://yeshid.notion.site/How-To-Use-the-YeshID-Slack-Integration-2be3726bb82c422fb3fd0dac3b8c862f">docs</a>.</p>
<p>Once the bot has connected successfully you’ll get a notification&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, the YeshBot is set up to send messages for the YeshList feature that we wrote about in a <a href="https://yeshid.com/post/yeshlist/">previous post</a>. So when you onboard a user through YeshID, for example, you will receive a notification:</p>
<p></p>
<p>YeshBot will send two types of notifications:</p>
 
 General notifications (onboarding/offboarding tasklist created or automated tasks failed) 
 Reminders to specific users when they have tasks to do. 
 
<p>General notifications are sent to all YeshID admins. You might want to have other team members stay in the loop for certain playbooks–for example (e.g. IT, HR, Finance for onboarding and offboarding). You can configure YeshID to send certain notifications to other channels.</p>
<p>How? Read on.</p>
 Set up notification channels in YeshID (optional) 
<p>To set up notifications to a channel, we need to add the YeshBot to the channel and then configure it in YeshID</p>
 
 Type in @YeshID in your desired notification channels.<br>
 
 Click “Add to Channel”<br>
<br>
 
 Set your notification channel in YeshID<br>
<br>
 
 
<p>YeshBot is now set up to send to your channel</p>
<p>A few tidbits to keep in mind when configuring the notification channels:</p>
 
 YeshBot may be added to any slack channel, but will not send any notifications unless configured to do so in the YeshID console.&nbsp; 
 YeshBot will broadcast the same notifications to every configured channel 
 Onboarding/offboarding information can be sensitive, so YeshBot can also be added to private channels to limit who sees the messages (Note: any user assigned a task will still be notified directly). 
 
 Deleting the integration 
<p>Under the same section (Settings &gt; YeshID Slack Bot), clicking on disconnect will remove the Bot from your Slack environment.</p>
<p></p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Integrating YeshBot with your Slack workspace lets you ditch the email overload and streamline your onboarding and offboarding processes. YeshBot delivers crucial notifications directly to your team, ensuring everyone stays informed, and tasks get completed on time.</p>

<p>In September of 2023, a Moody’s report aired concerns about Aadhaar, the pioneering government digital ID service used by over one billion Indian citizens. Though it has mitigated fraud and helped countless Indians access services more easily, Moody’s argued Aadhaar posed major privacy and security risks, in large part thanks to its centralization.</p><p>India rebutted the concerns, <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/most-trusted-digital-id-in-the-world-india-refutes-moodys-concerns-about-aadhaar/articleshow/103940681.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=cppst">stating in part</a> that “to date no breach has been reported from Aadhaar database.”</p><p>Just months later, Aadhaar suffered an immense data theft.</p><p>The extremely sensitive personal data of nearly 800 million Indians appeared <a href="https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2023/11/the-worlds-largest-biometric-digital-id-program-indias-aadhaar-just-suffered-its-biggest-ever-data-leak.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">for sale on black-market forums for a mere $80,000</a>. This included not only their Aadhaar numbers, but their addresses, phone numbers, passport numbers, and more – and despite the government’s protestations, known thefts of Aadhaar data go all the way back to 2012. This doesn’t just expose Indians to payments, benefits, and banking fraud; it is also a vector for <a href="https://securityaffairs.com/153421/data-breach/aadhaar-data-leaks-india.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">national security risk</a>. Some might even argue these harms outweigh the benefits of the system.</p><p>Other pioneering digital ID systems worldwide, including China’s RealDID, verification providers relying on data brokers, and digital services that aggregate user data, have also shown centralization risks. These include not just lax cybersecurity but misuse by controlling authorities themselves. The trend of transitioning to digitally native identification systems is clear. Still, the next generation of these systems must learn from the flaws and failures of pioneers – above all, by shifting away from centralized models that turn governments or corporations into ripe targets for criminals.</p> The Curse of the Innovator <p>Aadhaar was a hugely forward-thinking project when it launched in 2010, and it’s now the largest digital ID system in the world. There is no doubt that it provides immense utility to its user base of over a billion enrolled Indians. However, early projects in any realm can fall victim to the so-called “curse of the innovator” by failing to adopt new ideas following their creation. Several specific innovations, if they’re adopted by future digital ID projects, could help prevent breaches like the 2023 Aadhaar attack and other kinds of centralization risks.</p> Decentralization <p>As Moody’s pointed out, Aadhaar’s biggest flaw may be its centralization, with data and authorizations controlled by the Unique Identity Authority of India, or UIDAI. Centralization of digital identity credentials creates three related problems.</p><p>First, Aadhaar has a single point of failure – there have been many cases of benefits denial because the UIDAI couldn’t confirm a user’s identity. Second, centralization makes systems vulnerable to exploitation because all confirmations come from the same authority. For instance, Indian gangs have learned how to exploit the Aadhaar system to <a href="https://www.firstpost.com/tech/news-analysis/uidai-says-its-system-detected-attempts-by-kanpur-gang-to-generate-fake-aadhaar-cards-4036627.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">generate fake identities</a> – and UIDAI has refused to disclose how many fake identities may be in the wild.</p><p>Third and most concerning, the centralization of Aadhaar’s identity data makes it an irresistible honeypot for cybercriminals. Particularly scary is that biometric data, including thousands of fingerprints, has been <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/watch-out-aadhar-biometrics-are-an-easy-target-for-hackers/articleshow/61183055.cms?ref=blog.spruceid.com">repeatedly stolen</a> and for use in fraud schemes. This data would allow an attacker to create targeted biometric spoofing attacks, which could defeat both remote and physical identity verification systems. The theft of biometric data is particularly damaging because it is essentially irreversible – unlike a password, you can’t “reset” your fingerprints.&nbsp;</p><p>In recent years, we have seen significant progress on models that prevent single points of failure or mass, single-target data theft. In these architectures, data can be distributed to the edges instead of accumulating in a central government database. Under this type of distributed scheme, far less data is stored by any one authority, with identity instead affirmed by various authorities, such as schools, utility companies, and government agencies. This approach is far more aligned with “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">zero-trust</a>” approaches to security, and as a result, there’s no “one-stop shop” where hackers can steal or fabricate credentials.</p> Zero-Knowledge Attestation <p>According to <a href="https://www.resecurity.com/blog/article/pii-belonging-to-indian-citizens-including-their-aadhaar-ids-offered-for-sale-on-the-dark-web?ref=blog.spruceid.com">analysis by the firm Resecurity</a>, Aadhaar leaks have been caused in part by security breaches at third parties, such as utilities, which had downloaded sensitive data from Aadhaar servers and stored them. Until <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">software supply chains</a> are secured-by-default, these common utilities are likely to suffer ongoing compromises, as seen in the recent high-impact “<a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/04/02/a-stealth-attack-came-close-to-compromising-the-worlds-computers?ref=blog.spruceid.com">xz Utils</a>” and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/moveit-mass-hack-by-the-numbers?ref=blog.spruceid.com">MOVEit</a> exploits. Innovations in cryptography, including a technique known as “zero-knowledge proofs,” now make it possible to affirm certain data without revealing it to the requester, thereby reducing (or even eliminating) the need for data transfers and the use of intermediate tools that can mishandle sensitive data.</p><p>For instance, a third party could confirm the match of a person’s biometric data without actually accessing a raw fingerprint or iris scan. Worldcoin, the Sam Altman-founded global ID startup, uses cryptographic “hashes” of users’ iris scans, rather than the raw data, to establish unique identity. This should prevent the theft of iris data – though this particular technique must be combined with several additional components and precautions to become a complete system that can combat disincentives and misuse.</p> Robust Data Siloing <p>Third parties that store sensitive data also often add more data of their own, violating the principle of “data siloing.” For instance, the 2023 Aadhaar hack included full packages combining ID numbers with biometrics, passport numbers, addresses, and phone numbers.</p><p>This unfolded largely because over time, Aadhaar identity numbers became required for more and more services. As <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/theworldpost/wp/2018/08/09/aadhaar/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">one critic wrote back in 2018</a>, “This turns Aadhaar into a dangerous bridge between these previously isolated silos. With each new data silo that gets linked, an important protection against 360-degree profiling gets weakened, leaving Indians vulnerable to data mining and identity theft.”</p><p>In addition to cryptographic methods that prevent third parties from reading raw identity data, the use of hardware security components can keep identity data from circulating while keeping attestations trustworthy.</p> Distributed Authority <p>One of the most disturbing uses of a digital identity system was reported by the New York Times, which covered a Chinese authority’s use of COVID-19 health codes to control the movement of citizens <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/16/business/china-code-protesters.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">protesting the freezing of their bank accounts</a>. While details remain unclear, it appears that authorities may have matched the identities of the owners of frozen accounts to their health registration accounts, allowing them to flag potential protestors as COVID risks.</p><p>This represents a kind of security breach where a system is used to accomplish unrelated (and potentially illegitimate) goals. As Chinese critics pointed out, this isn’t simply a one-time abuse, but undermines long-term faith and public trust in the identity system. Broadly, this is more evidence in favor of decentralized identity systems – not only separating data across authorities, but separating command and control functions from data entirely. With carefully designed digital identity architecture, “should not be abused” can become “cannot be abused.”</p><p>Instead of having one central IT department control all of a society’s digital identity and credentials, it is possible to build decentralized architectures that allow multiple authorities with additional checks and balances, transparency requirements, and improved individual control. This clear separation of powers can ensure that powerful financial, healthcare, and security systems cannot collude against an individual.</p> Distributed Identity For a Safer, Freer Digital Future <p>The mixed track record of digital identity services so far demonstrates how important it is to design them from the ground up with the right priorities: privacy, security, and individual control. These overriding goals have become more obvious thanks to the experimentation of early adopters, and technological solutions for achieving them have also emerged over time.</p><p>With identity systems, it’s not enough to say that systems won’t be compromised, relying on the expertise or ethics of human authorities. Instead, the systems must be built from the ground up with many layers of protection so they can’t be compromised. While there are still details to fill in, ID systems that are architected to use distributed data storage, advanced cryptography, and information minimization are the way to reach that goal. While these services have their flaws, they also have immense potential to provide public utility and fight fraud.</p><p>We must learn from programs that have paved the way, such as Aadhar, and ensure that we can enjoy the benefits of digital identity without compromising security or individual freedoms such as free speech, privacy, and user choice.</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

Discover how this evolving technology threatens security and authentication measures, and explore 1Kosmos’ innovative solutions to combat this growing threat.

<p></p>
<p>Hello everybody, this is Michael Cichon. I’m the Chief Marketing Officer at 1Kosmos, here with Vikram Subramaniam, our VP of Solutions, to talk about deepfakes. Vik, it’s great to have you, and welcome to the vlog. Deepfakes are in the news lately. Frightening news. One case recently, they were used to con a company out of $25 million, several payments totaling 25 million in Asia Pacific. Closer to home, we’ve heard stories of deepfakes, dialing the phone, calling people, folks answer the phone, and their friends, family, loved ones appear to be in distress and asking to be rescued. Some are claiming to have kidnapped people and asking for ransom. Quite devastating for anybody to receive these types of things. So this phenomenon of deepfakes, how did we get here? What are they?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think, imagine that, Mission Impossible is becoming real. We are experiencing it in our everyday lives. I’ve only seen it in the movies, where you’ve got large command centers, where they’re taking small voice clips of different things and then, playing and tricking the bad guys into thinking that it’s one of their own. Regular people are facing it. And essentially, with AI and just freely available software these days, that takes advantage of the chips that we have in our computers and even generally available cloud and internet, you can produce video, you can produce voice, you can produce anything that looks or feels real to the person on the other side of a virtual line. So I’m thinking of form line, I’m thinking of a laptop, but yeah, this is where sometimes I just need to shake your hand to know if you are real, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. Do you know I’m real right now? Is this not a deepfake? Is this somebody pretending to be me?</p>
<p>Exactly. Exactly right. I think so that’s where the world is going to, but these are essentially deepfakes, the same things that we have seen in the movies. So people wearing masks, you creating videos of or morphing someone’s face on top. And then, yeah, it just sounding like someone else. It’s crazy what’s out there with deepfakes.</p>
<p>Yeah, the evolution has been stunning. We’ve talked generally about artificial intelligence, but over the last 20 years, we’ve seen this evolution of artificial intelligence being the ability to recognize patterns very deeply in data somehow to get into a predictive science and now, to even approach what looks like thinking, when computers can draw inferences without being told to do so. The deepfake, the lineage, how we got here, essentially, what we have is two chess players, if you will, two adversarial networks creating a likeness and presenting it to another adversarial engine to be graded for similarity to a sample. And then, for this, basically, this iteration of synthetic media, at the speed of light, whether that’s a voice, whether that’s a video, even texting patterns, the way that somebody might text a friend or chat with somebody, that can also be deepfaked. Training, well, first, before I get into training deepfake attack, this technology now, five years ago, you had to be one of the world’s leading data scientists.</p>
<p>Yeah, data scientists, researcher, videographer, one of those special effects companies, right? Yeah.</p>
<p>Right. Now, I just did a simple Google Search the other day using ChatGTP, and this thing brings me a half a dozen tools that I can, within probably an hour, create a deepfake video. Deepfakes trained on humans are one issue. We saw that with the $25 million that was taking. And certainly to the human eye, these deepfakes are very hard to detect. So in terms of humans, of humans, we’ve got to train people. We start to move millions of dollars around. We have to have policies, procedures, and oversight to prevent fraud at that scale. But I think, more on the sinister side, over the past, what, six, seven years, the authentication using live biometrics has set in. This is a step up from what we used to do. A thumb print or a face ID on a phone, we’re now logging in with essentially a live selfie, and that’s a step up in security.</p>
<p>But talk a little bit, if you will, about the way that deepfakes can be used to attack biometric authentication. Because before you start that, companies move into biometric authentication to get rid of passwords, and a live selfie had been pretty hard to fake. A live selfie can also be verified against a driver’s license. So you could have that direct connection of the live selfie to an offline credential and prove identity, but now, deepfakes are attacking. So can you talk a little bit about how deepfakes are being trained on authentication in cyber attacks?</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely. Right. So you mentioned it correctly, right? So we want convenience. We want to look at something, and then, it needs to open. So we have that happening on our phones. We have that happening at the immigration gates, and now, we obviously want it with our enterprise systems. So until now, obviously, hey, if you needed to fool something, if you needed to fool a face detection software, you would come and present a picture. You would come and present a video of the person that you wanted to impersonate. And in the early days, of course, you couldn’t find it. But I think technology has improved over multiple decades that technology now can prevent presentation attacks, where you’re actually presenting something to the camera, where you’re capturing like a picture, and if it’s a picture of a picture, from a screen, from a video, all of those things, you know that it’s not a live person. And it’s only then that the face is getting to match.</p>
<p>So the presentation attacks, yes, are evolving a little bit, but you know what? For the most part, I think a lot of companies and our solution basically can help prevent those presentation attacks. But because more and more companies are moving towards facial recognition and people are remote, now, impersonation has become big. And like you mentioned, there’s technology available out there to create videos and create stuff about things or videos or pictures that look like you, and from just freely available content. You’ve got public content. This vlog is going to be public. People can take small snippets from you, take your voice, take your face and create a short video and very likely try and fool the system. The problem there is, till now, you have to have another device to show it to the camera, and the moment you did that, the camera and generally having the picture and different objects out there, people could detect that it’s not a live person and it’s something that someone’s trying to attack.</p>
<p>But with deepfakes, the thing is that they are utilizing what we call as injection attacks. Injection is basically fooling the entire piece of software, because there is dependency on capturing a picture from the camera. And there is trust that pictures are coming from the camera, and we can depend on all of the things of the features of the camera to capture the picture, that trust is gone. So injection attacks are coming directly into the stream of the video, that comes in from the camera and goes out to the server. So it could very well be, we’ve got different kinds of attacks.</p>
<p>We’ve got JavaScript attacks, we’ve got the multiple cams or the substitute cams attacks, anything that really can inject itself into the stream, with the advent of technology, different scripts of being available, different pieces of technology, like mini cams. So they allow you to have multiple cameras and then, inject a video out there. And the software is no smarter and thinks that it is actually a person doing it. So now, that’s where deepfakes are there, but obviously, there is a way to prevent them. But Michael, I know you’ve been doing some research on deepfakes. Are there other things that you have noticed that people are doing out there?</p>
<p>Okay, well, let’s talk about this a little bit. You talk about presentation attacks. What are the defenses against presentation attacks?</p>
<p>Sure. So this is why, when we are doing a login at 1Kosmos, we verify multiple things. We verify the liveness of a user and also, do a face match of the user. And we are doing a one-to-one match. We’re not doing a one-to-many match. So which means that we are exactly verifying if the user is who they say they are. And along with that, before we do anything of that, we are verifying that the user is a live person. A couple of ways to do that. One is where we have the user follow specific instructions on the screen, like, “Turn left, turn right, smile.”</p>
<p>You know what I mean? I used to say, and I think it’s still valid, we’re the happiest MFA out there. We make people smile. So essentially, when people smile, we know that it is an actual human who’s able to follow instructions and then, do it. And along with that, we are able to go ahead and verify all of the other parameters of the picture that we captured of the person. At a random interval, we are able to capture the picture and then say that this is a live person or not.</p>
<p>Okay, awesome. So what you’re describing there, it’s the active liveness detection?</p>
<p>Correct, it’s the active liveness detection. And along with that, now, technology has evolved and we have evolved, where we have brought out the passive liveness. Passive liveness, we can determine the liveness of a person just by means of taking a selfie. There are a couple of attributes about the picture that we can utilize to go ahead and determine that the person is indeed who they say they are. And the very fact that they’re even coming in to take a selfie and just look, once they look at the screen, we are able to go ahead and determine that they are who they say they are. We are not waiting for them to upload a picture or something like that. We’re substituting or we’re actually doing active liveness, without the need of spoiling the user experience.</p>
<p>Okay. Okay. All right. So then, on the injection side, we’re monitoring for what? Virtual cameras? External cameras?</p>
<p>So see the thing is, injection side, you’re injecting into the stream, which means that something needs to sit on the client or something needs to sit on at the place where the picture is getting captured or where the video is getting captured to determine liveness. Because that’s exactly where all of these other pieces of software are sitting. Now, that means that this piece of code or this SDK that sits at the browser layer or at the client is able to determine, “Do you have multiple cameras out there? Are you using something that is plugged into the USB? Or is it using something that is virtual?”</p>
<p>And also preventing something from injecting random pieces of information in the stream that is going out to our server. So what that means is that, yes, cracking that in is going to be highly improbable, and we’ll see, obviously, there are different avenues to go ahead and improve the technology. But right now, we are able to go ahead and determine, at the point where the picture is getting captured that, “Hey, is there an injection attack that’s happening?” And this could be done even on the mobile device, right? So no problem.</p>
<p>Okay, all right. All right. So when we talk about identity verification, at the very highest levels of assurance, we’re essentially talking about an enrollment process, where somebody presents themselves to a camera, and that likeness is verified against an offline credential, something like a state-issued ID, driver’s license, a passport. So for this to happen, at the point of enrollments, we’re doing several things, correct? We’re doing a passive likeness, we’re doing an active likeness, we’re checking for injection attacks, then somebody presents a credential, and we’re also inspecting that credential for signs of manipulation. “Has the photograph been manipulated? Is it a valid credential, with,” for example, “the databases that contain the driver’s license information from the states?” Only when it passes that, all those tests, all those inspections, has somebody then successfully registered. Once that process, the enrollment process, is completed, now folks are using this biometric to log in. So again, at the point where a access request is being made, we’re again inspecting for signs of manipulation, being liveness, passive, active, and then, the injection attacks.</p>
<p>This is where authentication is changing for the enterprise, constantly changing for the customers. We are definitely, the entire space is evolving, because now earlier enrollment used to be, hey, you have a username, password, and then, get in. Max, you do an MFA. Now, enrollment can happen really quick, self-service, just by utilizing your credential, that’s powerful. You’ve already gotten a credential, you can do this remotely. And the consuming, either company, it’s an enterprise, or whether it’s a customer piece of software, can trust what is happening. Then on, as a customer, now, like you mentioned, I have the ability to authenticate using my face, and we are able to go ahead and say confidently, “Know what, you’re a live person, I know who you are, Vikram. Welcome.” Wouldn’t you like that experience?</p>
<p>I certainly would. So at 1Kosmos, we talk and we have talked a long time about certifications, and for some, that’s a snoozer topic, “Why are we talking about certifications?” So what’s the role of certifications in this? It’s one thing for any number of companies to claim that, “We do this stuff,” but what proves that we do this stuff?</p>
<p>Right, yeah, I think you’re right. So certifications, even the clients where we have implemented, they’ve said, “Okay, you know what? I really want to test out your software. I want to bring a picture in there. I want to put a mask on me. I want to put a video out there, and I’ll test it.” And we say, “All right, go test it. But that’s exactly why we do the certifications.” We’re doing this, because there are third parties who go through and try and break the system. We do pen testing. So it’s very important. It’s something that our clients can utilize and take it to their auditors and go, “Hey, I’ve gotten a certified system, which has been through the ringer, and now, I can just cut my timeline short, implement it, and get my users to actually use it and focus on what’s important for improving the business.”</p>
<p>Got it. So in terms of these certifications, just real briefly, ISO has a set of presentation attack defense specifications. So that’s a set of certifications where the system has to be rigorously tested, that it cannot be fooled, for example, by a 3D mask or by a mask with the eyes cut out. There are, with the NIST certifications, the 800-63 certification, this what certifies the biometric. Talk a little bit about NIST.</p>
<p>Yeah, the NIST has the FRVT certification, and essentially, now, they’re calling it FRTE. And of course, this the organization iBeta, which actually is dedicated towards testing biometrics. So we go through all of these agencies to make sure that we are not only complying with their tests, but also, standards and regulations that rule the use of biometrics. It’s one thing to be able to capture it and do it correctly, but can you do it in a privacy preserving way? I think that differentiates us.</p>
<p>All right. That’s bringing up another thing. Okay. But real briefly, what the UK version, the UK…</p>
<p>DIATF.</p>
<p>Right? So that’s there. FIDO2 is there. I know I’m forgetting a couple, but you mentioned privacy. So biometric, now that’s a pretty personal piece of information, along with my birthday and social security number, everything, right? So talk about privacy. What’s the big deal?</p>
<p>Yeah, I know we’re on the topic of trying to figure out liveness, are you live person and everything. But yeah, once you capture it, where are you storing it? How are you storing it? So this is where the 1Kosmos’ architecture comes into play wherein we have the key for the private key that is always in possession of the user. Now, this could be a pin or this could be a private key that is there that is stored within their device. Or really, what we are able to do is to calculate a key right at the edge by using your face. Your face is your key. That is what opens the door. So it is really amazing, that amazing technology that we’re able to do, wherein we are able to do that, manage your wallet for you, and think about what a wallet is.</p>
<p>It is just like your physical wallet, where you put different things, and you can put in your face, you can put in your fingerprint, you can put in all the other biometrics that are in there, along with your FIDO credential and your smart car credential. If you want to put your legacy password, you can put it in there. It’s simply a wallet that is in your possession, that can be opened up only by using certain keys.</p>
<p>Yeah, I love that. Vik, that means two things to me. It means that, as a consumer, I control the data. I want to delete the data, I delete it. I want to use it, I determine, at the point of use, exactly what information I’m going to share, I feel comfortable sharing. The other thing it means is for the IT and security people, it’s not introducing another vulnerability, because you’ve introduced a better way to authenticate. And that point of vulnerability is this honeypot of customer information. Why have it when you don’t have to have it? So eliminating that honeypot to me is important, and I think it should be important to IT and security people. Have we left anything out? This feels like a pretty good conversation. One thing, we do have a new white paper coming out. It’s called Biometric Authentication Versus the Threat of Deepfakes. It’ll be on our website here shortly, so look out for that. Any parting shots, Vik, any stone unturned on deepfakes?</p>
<p>Yeah, I would just say, look out for them. And just be sure, just like, earlier, it was with the phishing emails, now it’s with deepfakes, make sure that you’re doing something real. Do your due diligence, and yeah, if you need help, talk to 1Kosmos.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Yeah. I see deepfakes is kind of the latest salvo from the cybercrime community to attack one of the creators of value on the digital side, that creators of value is getting workers quick access to systems, plugging the holes, so that account takeover doesn’t lead to data breach or ransomware. A lot of news about ransomware recently. So yeah, some really interesting developments. And once again, here at 1Kosmos, we’re trying to stay ahead of that with our innovative solutions. So Vik, thanks for spending time with me today. Very much appreciate your time.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Thanks, Michael. That was great.</p>

 Armin Bauer, Co-Founder &amp; Chief Technology and Security Officer at IDnow, explains all about the German Federal Ministry of Finance’s new draft bill on the Money Laundering Video Identification Ordinance (GwVideoIdentV), what the amendments would mean for banks and financial service providers, and why IDnow has been driving these developments for years and welcomes the revisions. 



<p>Germany is lagging behind in its digital transformation efforts compared to the rest of Europe, despite its technological expertise. For example, as the first country to accept video identification procedures, Germany took on a pioneering role, but has subsequently lost this position due to &nbsp;its inactivity and inability to approve successor solutions at national level. </p>



<p>The current basis for video identification in the banking sector continues to be rules contained in the Circular (“Rundschreiben”), which was issued by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, BaFin) in 2017.</p>



<p>There have been few updates to video identification procedures in the German financial sector in recent years, with automation, modernization and user-friendliness all seemingly often in competition with security concerns. There were also inklings from Berlin that coordination on the GwVideoIdent regulation was tough.</p>



<p>However, an exciting breakthrough came in mid-April 2024: the Federal Ministry of Finance published the <a href="https://www.bundesfinanzministerium.de/Content/DE/Gesetzestexte/Gesetze_Gesetzesvorhaben/Abteilungen/Abteilung_VII/20_Legislaturperiode/2024-04-18-GwVideoIdentV/0-Gesetz.html">draft bill for the ordinance on money laundering identification by video identification</a>.</p>



 What changes does the draft envisage? 



  Classic VideoIdent procedures are now to be regulated by ordinance, and no longer just by the <a href="https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/EN/Rundschreiben/2017/rs_1703_gw_videoident_en.html">BaFin Circular from 2017</a>.  Companies whose services and products fall under the Money Laundering Act (GWG) and which use the existing VideoIdent procedure must offer mandatory identification using the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-eid/">German online ID function</a> (German ID card with activated online function and NFC-enabled smartphone, eID for short) in addition to other solutions. According to the draft, this must be equivalent to other procedures: “In particular, providers must not deliberately mislead the person to be identified into preferring the video identification procedure via the user interface design”. The draft will create more use cases for the electronic ID card (eID) in the financial sector. The spread of the online ID function among the population is expected to increase. According to a PwC study, only seven percent of Germans would decide against using eID, while 70 percent are prepared to use the online ID card for transactions with banks and in legal matters.  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/de/experten-gefuehrte-identitaetsueberpruefung/">Partially automated procedures for identity verification</a> are to be permitted. Partially automated means that parts of the identification process can in the future be automated, but there are still parts that may not. In addition, a direct (not downstream) check by a human must be part of the verification process. IDnow’s &nbsp;“VideoIdent Flex” solution offers a clever combination of AI-supported, expert-led identity verification.  <a href="https://www.idnow.io/de/automatisierte-identitaetspruefung/">Fully automated solutions for identity verification</a> could also be approved for up to two years, subject to certain requirements (equivalence to a human check) – after a maximum six-month registration phase for testing under the supervision of the BSI (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik, Federal Office for Information Security). The BSI retains the final decision power regarding approval.  



 How IDnow became a pioneer for secure and intuitive identification processes in the financial sector. 



<p>IDnow presented the idea of partially and fully automated video identification to the Ministry of Finance back in 2020. We therefore welcome the fact that legislation is now to follow the existing technical possibilities and that further identification procedures are to be approved. IDnow’s fully automated process has been setting industry standards for a long time, is certified in accordance with various industry standards (e.g. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/pr/idnow-among-first-etsi-ts-119-461-certification/">ETSI TS 119 461</a>) and is already used for money laundering-compliant identification in other European countries.</p>



<p>Since IDnow was founded, the Munich-based IT company has worked closely with regulatory authorities and other market participants to drive progress and always ensure the highest level of security for identity verification. We believe that security does not have to come at the expense of intuitive design and user-friendliness. Our solutions provide customers with secure, reliable and straightforward identity verification processes.</p>



 Security, innovation and trust in digital identity management. 



<p>IDnow is a leading platform provider for identity verification and a German pioneer in digital applications and innovations – both in sensitive parts of the administration and in highly regulated areas, such as the financial sector.</p>



<p>We offer users a reliable, secure and seamless solution from a single source that meets the relevant regulatory requirements and security levels and protects against misuse, such as fraud, identity theft or forged signatures.</p>



 Creating a high level of security and sovereignty in the digital space. 



<p>In our view, clear rules and standards for digital identification procedures are the basis for ensuring trust, security and privacy. In fact, secure forms of digital identification can strengthen the sovereignty of citizens in the digital space and in the financial sector.</p>



<p>We have the expertise to meet the diverse range of security requirements, which vary depending on the industry and sensitivity of the use case. Germany must always strive to provide its citizens with the most secure, innovative and usable solutions and play a pioneering role in digitalization – this is what IDnow stands for with its broad portfolio of solutions.</p>



<p>We offer secure and powerful identity verification and fraud prevention solutions, including:</p>



  Automated identity verification (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AutoIdent</a>, AI-supported and GwG-compliant),  Video verification solutions (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">VideoIdent</a>, a GwG-compliant verification with high security requirements via video chat, supported by AI technology; and VideoIdent Flex, a customizable version),  Chip-based identity verification, utilizing the German electronic ID card (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-eid/">eID</a>) and NFC-enabled smartphones.

				  Indicio Proven® offers a simple three-step process for integrating its decentralized identity solution into existing systems, ensuring efficient data sharing and security with support from the Indicio team.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Aashi Srivastava</p>
<p>In today’s fast-changing digital world, the demand for fast data you can trust has never been more pressing. Indicio Proven® is a reliable decentralized identity solution that can help organizations create more efficiency around the complexities of data sharing and security. Let’s explore how you can easily incorporate Indicio Proven into your existing systems.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven is not a rip-and-replace solution. Instead, it’s designed to seamlessly complement your existing systems, offering a flexible approach to enhance data security. By integrating Proven into your infrastructure, you retain control of your data while gaining the benefits of decentralized identity solutions, allowing you to implement verifiable credentials. This flexibility enables you to use the power of Proven without disrupting your current operations, enabling you to adapt and evolve your data management practices to meet the demands of today’s digital landscape.</p>
<p>You don’t need a platform. You want control, making existing investments better.</p>
<p>Integrating Indicio Proven into your existing systems might seem daunting, but it can be broken down into a simple three-step process. Every step of this integration process can be done on your own or in collaboration with the Indicio team to ensure a hassle-free experience.</p>
<p>Step 1: Installation of Proven Issuer Software Agent</p>
<p>The process begins with installing the Proven Issuer software agent on your server. This software agent is the backbone of your credential issuance process and connects seamlessly to your data source or service via standard REST APIs.</p>
<p>Indicio Proven is designed to meet your comprehensive data security needs while ensuring regulatory compliance, offering a robust solution that covers all essential aspects of decentralized identity management. It prioritizes compliance with industry regulations, providing peace of mind and confidence in navigating the complex landscape of data governance.</p>
<p>Step 2: Connection and Issuance of Verifiable Credentials</p>
<p>Once the Proven Issuer software agent is installed, API integration allows for a seamless system connection from your server to the Issuer agent. The next step is to connect the Issuer agent to the data’s intended recipients or holders, including customers, employees, employers, and partner organizations. You can start issuing verifiable credentials to the recipients using an invitation URL (often in a QR code) to connect to the holder’s agent. The holder agent is a software app downloaded by the holder to their mobile device (Indicio Proven has a Mobile SDK for incorporating agent functionality into existing mobile applications). Your Issuer agent is connected to the Holder agent with a secure encrypted channel, ensuring the smooth transmission of credentials. These credentials contain encrypted data securely stored in a wallet under the holder’s control and typically on their mobile device.</p>
<p>Step 3: Verification and Transmission of Data</p>
<p>When connecting the Indicio Proven Verifier application to the holder via an invitation URL, holders can consent to share their data securely and selectively. The application generates a presentation of the data for their credentials, allowing the verifier application to receive and verify the data. The verifier application can also be connected via APIs to other services or systems to transmit the verified data and share the trust established by the systems, protocols, and cryptography.</p>
<p>Through the integration process, Indicio’s team of industry veterans will be by your side, ready to provide support. There are several options for assistance, including onsite, personalized training, virtual office hours, or collaborative coding sessions. Indicio ensures that integration is not a barrier but an opportunity for growth.</p>
<p>Integrating Proven into your existing systems does not have to be an intimidating task. It’s a step towards greater data efficiency, security, and trust.</p>

 We sit down with the owner of a UK fraud consultancy firm to discuss how fraud has changed over the years, why fraud has become so pervasive in the UK, and the role of organizations in protecting their customers from fraud attacks. 



 



 Despite very quickly reaching the rank of CID officer, you were with the police for a comparatively short time – just shy of eight years; what were the main reasons for you moving to the private sector?&nbsp; 



<p>My police career was short but busy. I became a CID officer within about three years, which is unusual, and worked in a very dynamic and young CID office. Fraud had always been my passion and the police were increasingly turning their back on it to focus on other priorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was apparent at that time that people were disposing of their own cars and then making fraudulent insurance claims, and unfortunately, in many cases, it didn’t lead to prosecution, as the insurance companies were unable to detect it. I decided to take a risk and set up my own specialist fraud investigation business Taylor &amp; Moore Investigations. At the time it was the first of its kind and within 18 months we had 22 people working for us and half the top 10 UK insurance companies as clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 What specific experience from your years in the police best prepared you for the transition to work as a fraud investigator for insurance companies?&nbsp; 



<p>The business I set up was based on a good CID office. I began by intelligence gathering to understand how insurance fraud worked. I then produced a cost-effective system to detect and investigate insurance fraud. I built a whole training system based around what was needed, including criminal and insurance law. I also made great use of the intelligence we uncovered about those frauds. So, even back then we took a strategic approach of prevention, detection, containment, and analysis that is still used today by most of the industry. &nbsp;</p>



 Obviously, fraud investigation techniques have changed dramatically since you started in the ‘80s, but what were some of the major differences in how you approached fraud investigation in the police and in the private sector?&nbsp; 



<p>There are of course advantages in having a warrant card, a power of arrest, and the huge resources police have available. </p>



<blockquote><p>However, there are also advantages to not being a police officer. I have never seen this mentioned by anyone else, but people were more willing to speak and tell me things than they had been when I was a police officer. </p>Peter Taylor, owner of fraud consultancy firm.</blockquote>



<p>As my specialism was interviewing that made my life much easier. I am not sure folks realise the extent to which suspects and witnesses clam up when talking to figures of authority like the police.</p>



 What about fraud investigation techniques in general, how have they changed over the years?&nbsp; 



<p>Interviews, data, and forensics in that order were the core of investigations at the time I left the police. Our business model was based on the same principles. The evolution of fraud and counter fraud has seen development in all three areas but particularly in data and forensics. A simple view is that the order in which they are relied upon has changed now to be data, forensics, and then interviews last.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gathering intelligence is much easier nowadays because of the widespread use of the internet and the volume of data now routinely available to investigators. In some cases, the interview is still very much part of gathering evidence but can often just be there to make sure we are not making a mistake by giving the people involved the opportunity to explain things that look suspicious.</p>



 Fraud and fraud prevention has always been a hotly contested game of cat and mouse. Was there any period of history where the ‘game’ was more one-sided?&nbsp; 



<p>The numbers tell the story. When I started out, fraud was around 1% of all crime and we were definitely the cats and the criminals, the mice. That slowly changed around the year 2000. I believe the web enabling criminals to easily communicate with each other and reach targets within a much wider circle has been the main catalyst.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another factor that fuelled the fire was policing in the UK and other countries had massive funding cuts whilst having to focus on other especially important stuff like terrorism, domestic violence, and grooming. Fraud is now running at 40% of all crime, much of it does not get reported so it is hard to claim anything other than that the criminals now have the upper hand. That will change but not any time soon.</p>



 
   
     
                     The future of fraud and digital identity verification in the UK. 
                     Our experts explore the current situation around fraud in the UK, how fraudsters are carrying out their nefarious activities at scale, and how technology can both help and hinder the fight against fraud. 
                    <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/fraud-digital-identity-verification-uk/">Watch now</a>
           
           
         
          
         
       
       
 


 Technology is often regarded as a double-edged sword when it comes to fraud. What impact has the proliferation of technology had on the fraud landscape in the UK, and wider market? Is there a danger of ceding too much control, and outsourcing too much of the process to artificial intelligence?&nbsp; 



<p>When we introduce new technology, there tends to be three stages of adoption:&nbsp;</p>



  Stage one: What can we do with this?<br>  Stage two: Can we make it safe?<br>  Stage three: Can we make sure it is legal?&nbsp;  



<p>Then it becomes a cycle of constant development and fixing things that we never quite catch up on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You cannot efficiently deal with any volume of crime without technology. For example, you would not try to run a bank or any other business without it, and countering fraud is no exception. AI in some ways is just the latest standard, albeit like adding a turbo charger to an already fast car.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Routine process should go through automation wherever practical, and we should use all the tools available. The dangers come from ignoring people who can see it is not working properly, and we have to be objective enough to actually listen to accused people who say it was not working properly too. Hence the Post Office Scandal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The biggest worry I have right now though is complacency around data accuracy. If the data is inaccurate or the AI poorly trained, then it will get things wrong. For me technology must be supervised rather than supervise important decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 The UK is often referred to as the fraud capital of Europe, why do you think this is? What changes do you think need to be implemented to address this?&nbsp; 



<p>In many ways illicit trade follows the same paths as legitimate trade. Although we are no longer part of the EU, the UK has for many decades been a hub and gateway to the EU for the US and other countries and vice versa. As the English language is also used across so many nations as a primary or secondary language, it is therefore familiar and a sort of lingua franca to many of those who commit crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s also important to recognize that as the UK was present in many other nations through trading, colonialism, and military conflict for hundreds of years, there is also a perception abroad that we are all wealthy as individuals and businesses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This all makes the UK a target for overseas fraudsters, but we cannot ignore the reality that many fraudsters are based in the UK too. I often hear of us referred to as the butler to the world because of our involvement in laundering foreign wealth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Organized fraud sits within three areas: white collar crime, organized cybercrime, and organized crime. The UK criminals are prolific in all three areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The changes needed are wholesale and we do at last seem to be making progress, but it will take time. What we need are:&nbsp;</p>



  Consequences for committing fraud i.e. arrests and convictions.<br>  A long-term strategy ideally within education that encourages young people to stay away from cybercrime, and to know how to protect themselves from financial crime and risk.<br>  A focus on ethics and not just profit across government, public services, education, and the private sector.&nbsp;  



  A way of confirming who people are and what age they are without having to submit documents like passports and driving licences.&nbsp;  



 What part does consumer awareness play in the fight against fraud?&nbsp; 



<p>Educating consumers as to the risks they face and how to protect themselves from fraud is a vital element of fraud prevention. Making people aware of what may happen and giving them clear advice helps. I am not convinced we do enough across the board to provide a remedy for them when an attempt is made, or a successful fraud occurs. However, this is only one side of the coin, organizations must also use technology to protect the consumer too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many attacks can be stopped through good anti-virus software, as well as good standards of multi-factor authentication. I foresee the day when all this functionality will automatically be included on every device sold. Look at cars for example. They all now have transponders, dead locks, and alarms built in. Car thefts are rising again right now but until recently they were reducing year on year having hit around a million thefts per annum in the 1990s.&nbsp;</p>



 How can organizations educate their customers on the dangers of fraud more effectively?&nbsp; 



<p>I would like to see some sort of reward system for those who thwart serious fraud attempts, such as authorised push payment. It could be monetary, or it could be some other benefit but to acknowledge that the consumer has done the right thing could go a long way to prevent fraud. With the banks being expected to compensate customers who lose money to fraud then the banks benefit from fraudsters not getting away with it rather than the consumer. No good deed, however, goes unpunished and there would inevitably be attempts to cheat any such system.&nbsp;</p>



 You deliver training in fraud prevention across a wide range of verticals, including insurance, banking, lending, online retail, workplace fraud, and organised cyber fraud, are there any similarities in fraud attacks across the industries, and conversely, what are the main differences?&nbsp; 



<p>The UK Fraud Act 2006 clearly sets out the main fraud offences and the way frauds can be committed happen across all industries. People like to give names to different types of fraud based on the method and the target. I understand that and do it too and it can help with statistics, data, and analysis. Despite there being hundred of categories of fraud, the reality is there are a only handful of ways that fraud is committed e.g. false representation, not disclosing information, obtaining services by deception, abuse of position, and making or supplying articles for use in fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are other financial crimes that come into play, such as bribery and corruption, money laundering, and theft, but most, if not all, frauds involve the above. The similarities far outweigh any specifics for different industries, which is why around 80% of the training I deliver is generic with the remainder being specific to the delegates taking part.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From my experience of working with prolific career fraudsters they commit fraud across the board. One person I interviewed about his life of crime committed card fraud, insurance fraud, bank fraud, benefits fraud, and tax fraud. That surely shows that the same methods are adapted across different sectors and that it is the same fraudsters targeting different sectors too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 How can organizations better protect themselves and their customers from the threat of fraud? 



<p>I have found that much like charity, protection from fraud and cybercrime starts at home. I have just worked with a client who has allowed me to train and educate all their staff on how fraud and cybercrime works, how they are at risk, and how to protect themselves from it. Get that done first and then they will automatically protect their organization and their customers in the same way. Feedback and engagement with the delegates has been tremendous. They were not just trained they changed what they do.</p>

<p>The Verida Network provides storage infrastructure perfect for AI solutions and the upcoming data connector framework will create a new data economy that benefits end&nbsp;users</p>Verida is enabling the privacy preserving AI tech&nbsp;stack<p>Written by <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/chriswere">Chris Were</a> (Verida CEO &amp; Co-Founder) and originally published on <a href="https://www.chriswere.com/p/verida-is-enabling-the-privacy-preserving">tahpot: Web3 on the edge</a>, this post is Part 3 of a Privacy / AI series. <br>See:<br>- <a href="https://www.chriswere.com/p/top-three-data-privacy-issues-facing">Part 1: Top Three Data Privacy Issues Facing AI Today</a><br>- <a href="https://www.chriswere.com/p/how-web3-and-depin-solves-ais-data">Part 2: How web3 and DePIN solves AI’s data privacy problems</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.verida.network/">Verida</a> is providing key infrastructure that will underpin the next generation of the privacy preserving AI technology stack. The Verida Network provides private storage, sources of personal data and expandable infrastructure to make this future a&nbsp;reality.</p><p>Let’s dive into each of these areas in more&nbsp;detail.</p> Private storage for personal AI&nbsp;models <p>The Verida network is designed for storing private, personal data. It is a <a href="https://news.verida.io/revolutionizing-web3-storage-a-deep-dive-into-ipfs-and-verida-dbstore-7a15745dd118">highly performant, low cost, regulatory compliant solution</a> for storing structured database data for any type of application.</p><p>Data stored on the network is protected with a user’s private key, ensuring they are the only account that can request access to, and encrypt their data (unless they provide permission to another account).</p><p>This makes the Verida Network ideal for storing private AI models for end users. The network’s high performance (leveraging P2P web socket connections), makes it suitable for high speed read / write applications such as training&nbsp;LLMs.</p> Source of data for training AI&nbsp;models <p>We’ve all heard the saying “garbage in, garbage out” when it comes to data. This also applies to training AI models. They are only as good as the data they are fed for training purposes.</p><p>The Verida ecosystem provides a broad range of capabilities that make it ideally suited to being a primary source of highly valuable data for training AI&nbsp;models.</p><p>Verida has been developing an API data connector framework that enables users to easily connect to existing API’s of centralized platforms and claim their personal data, that they can securely store on the Verida&nbsp;network.</p><p>Users on the Verida network will be able to pull health activity data from the likes of Strava and Fitbit. They can pull their private messages from chat platforms, their data from Google and Apple accounts. This can all then be leveraged to train AI models for exclusive use by the user, or that data can be anonymized and contributed to larger training&nbsp;models.</p><p>Establishing a data-driven token economy offers a promising avenue for fostering fairness among all stakeholders. Eventually, major tech and data corporations may introduce a token system for service payments, thereby incentivizing users to share their&nbsp;data.</p><p>For an example; individuals could leverage their anonymous health data to train AI models for healthcare research and receive token rewards in return. These rewards could then be utilized for subscribing to the service or unlocking premium features, establishing a self-sustaining cycle where data sharing leads to increased service access as a reward. This model fosters a secure and equitable relationship between data contribution and enhanced service access, ensuring that those who contribute more to the ecosystem reap greater benefits in&nbsp;return.</p><p>Users could also use their personal data to train AI models designed just for them. Imagine a digital AI assistant guiding you through your life. Suggesting meetup events to attend to improve your career, suggesting a cheaper greener electricity retailer based on your usage, suggesting a better phone plan or simply reminding you of an event you forgot to add to your calendar.</p> Expandable infrastructure <p>As touched on in “<a href="https://www.chriswere.com/p/how-web3-and-depin-solves-ais-data">How web3 and DePIN solves AI’s data privacy problems</a>”, privacy preserving AI will need access to privacy preserving computation to train AI models and respond to user&nbsp;prompts.</p><p>Verida is not in the business of providing private decentralized computation, however the Verida identity framework (based on the DID-Core W3C standard) is expandable to connect to this type of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN).</p><p>Identities on the Verida network can currently be linked to three types of DePIN; Database storage, Private inbox messages, Private notifications. This architecture can easily be extended to support new use cases such as “Private compute” or “Personal AI prompt&nbsp;API”.</p><p>With the appropriate partners who support decentralized private compute, there is a very clear pathway to enable personalized, privacy preserving AI leveraging a 100% DePIN technology stack.</p><p>This is incredibly exciting, as it will provide a more secure, privacy preserving solution as an alternative to giving all our data to large centralized technology companies.</p> About Chris <p>Chris Were is the CEO of <a href="http://verida.io/">Verida</a>, a decentralized, self-sovereign data network that empowers individuals to control their digital identity and personal data. Chris is an Australian-based technology entrepreneur who has spent over 20 years developing innovative software solutions, most recently with Verida. With his application of the latest technologies, Chris has disrupted the finance, media, and healthcare industries.</p> <p><a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-is-enabling-the-privacy-preserving-ai-tech-stack-7e9558f822f3">Verida is enabling the privacy preserving AI tech stack</a> was originally published in <a href="https://news.verida.io">Verida</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Well, hello everybody. This is Michael Cichon, the Chief Marketing Officer here at 1Kosmos. I’m here today with Sid Gandhi, the Chief operating Officer of our Asia Pacific region. Sid, welcome to the vlog. I invited you here today to talk about the Reserve Bank of India guidelines, the new guideline. There are some pretty interesting implications for online payments. You’re familiar with those. Can you talk about them a bit?</p>
<p>Siddharth Gandhi:<br>
Sure, absolutely, Michael. Pleasure to be here. Thank you so much for inviting me for the v-log. So yes, interesting times for us at 1Kosmos. The Reserve Bank of India recently announced a guideline which talks about principle-based framework for authentication of digital payment transactions. And very interestingly, I believe that the RBI or the Federal Bank of India has done a fantastic job over the years, not just to well manage the monetary policies, but they also do look at technology and security aspects and provide guidelines for the BFSI sector.</p>
<p>The recent one is interesting for a few reasons why. Number one is RBI has always spoken about having second factor as an authentication for internet banking. So while SMS-based OTP has been very commonly used today across the globe and in India, but interestingly, RBI has also mentioned there are three forms of authentication, right? Something that the user knows, which is a user ID password and a PIN. Something that the user has, which is their credit card, their ATM card, their phone, or something that the user is, which we all are aware is their biometric characteristics like their fingerprint, their facial features, or perhaps even their iris.</p>
<p>Now very interestingly, I was going through some of the content that RBI has published over time. It does call out saying that a true multifactor authentication requires at least two or more factors. However, what the industry has largely done is that they have gone with something that the user knows, which is the user ID password, and gone with the second factor of something that the user has, which is the SMS-based OTP and that has been around probably as long as I can remember for a few decades. This is the first time RBI has now said that you need to start looking beyond SMS based OTP, thanks to all the technological advances or the innovation that are emerging in the recent years. And we are here today ready to offer that to the industry as alternate factors.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. All right, so let’s take a step back here. As consumers, we’re all familiar with step-up authentication now. We might not know that it’s called that, but whenever I try to buy something online, I get the code, will you please key in this code to prove that this is legitimate? So it’s that built-in lack of trust in the password that got me to the shopping cart or the payment transaction and then I prompted for the code. So what’s wrong with the code? Why change?</p>
<p>Siddharth Gandhi:<br>
Why change for the, I think more than one reason, Michael. Today SMS-based codes are considered as weak form of second factor. Why? Because of man-in-the-middle attack or SMS interception. You have dependency on having a SIM card. You have dependency on having the network with you to receive those codes. And you also have challenges around expiration or delivery delays. Especially in the recent few years we’ve seen SIM swapping also take place, which is again a big concern and increasing number of breaches happening even with a second factor like SMS-based OTP available. And for that reason is why I believe RBI is also indicating and telling the banks that you must start looking beyond.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Okay. All right, so this is the kind of what I would call proxies for identity, right? You are you because you knew the password, you are you because you’re able to key in this code that I just sent you on your phone. You are you because your SIM card matches what we thought it would be. So all these are kind of guesses or approximations, it get us closer to identity, but it is almost what silly human tricks, can you go through these calisthenics to prove you are who you are. So not only are they not specific, they’re not exact, they’re guesses still. They’re clumsy, right? You want to buy something, you’re going to pay for something, and now you got to go to your inbox or go to your message folder, look at the code, remember the code, key the code in, hopefully key it in right. If you’re not, you got to go back, look at again, key it in again. So a lot of implications here, but there’s more to this principle-based framework than just convenience. There’s a privacy angle, right?</p>
<p>Siddharth Gandhi:<br>
Correct, yes. There’s a privacy angle and there’s a security angle. You spoke about how do you prove who you are and absolutely with the credentials and SMS-based OTP, it’s really hard to prove. I could share my credentials with you. I could give you my OTP and you could still transact on my behalf as a friend, but what if you are not my friend? You get hold of my credentials in the dark web. You could very well go ahead and take the money away from me and that’s being reported every single day.</p>
<p>What we are able to do at 1Kosmos is prove who the user is based on our platform capabilities of identity verification and proofing, which is based on global standards. And along with that, we have multiple other capabilities of bringing in advanced biometric. We have our IP, something called Live ID, where we actually ask the user to showcase features by blinking, smiling and asking them to prove they are real person. And also the platform capabilities have a private and a permission blockchain, which even makes it even more secure. The idea is not just providing a second factor to the user, but how you deliver it to the user and how the authentication happens throughout that journey till conclusion of the transaction also plays a very, very critical goal.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Right. Well, so this is interesting to me because it seems like what the Reserve Bank of India has done, it’s the latest iteration or the latest generation of guidelines that have surfaced around essentially the 1Kosmos business model or architecture, if you will. Dating back to whatever 2016, 2017 we saw in the United States, the NIST guidelines come out, the 800-63. We saw FIDO2, if you want to do biometric authentication, there’s a FIDO2 spec for that. We have the specification in the United Kingdom. And now here is the Reserve Bank of India coming up with the latest guidelines on what sounds like how you need to deploy this technology so we get to a higher level of both integrity, trust, and security in the transaction, but also privacy and security of the user’s information as well.</p>
<p>Siddharth Gandhi:<br>
Exactly, Michael. You’re absolutely right. And not to forget at the end of the day, user convenience as well. So we are not only just providing security, privacy by default, but the experience of the user is very seamless. It’s very elegant by when you provide password-less experience to the user, they would enjoy transacting on the platform instead of trying to figure out or recall their eight, 12, 16 character passwords, waiting on the second factor, which may or may not arrive. So you’re absolutely right. I think we’ve been talking about it for the last few years and some of the BFSI customers do use our platform today and we are very happy and very excited with the recent announcement from RBI.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Well, sure, because the guideline points to specific capabilities that we’ve been supporting for a while now. So when you step away from what you know to the who you are, there’s a range of possibilities there, right?</p>
<p>Siddharth Gandhi:<br>
Correct. You are absolutely right. So we are able to bring in various factors that we’ve already discussed about, and these are based on global standards. I think that’s very important that the industry understands this. We spoke about FIDO certification from a privacy standpoint, we do, are able to meet global privacy standards like GDPR. India now has a DPDPA. And the interesting thing about our architecture is that we don’t store specifically any user information, which makes us very unique compared to some of the other players in the market and which is what customers or customer like banks would want, where they are safeguarding their customer data.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
So specifically in terms of the biometrics that are used for this, what I would call step-up authentication, they range from device biometrics, for example, what we’re all familiar with a thumb or a face ID on your device all the way up to a live biometric, correct?</p>
<p>Siddharth Gandhi:<br>
That is correct, yes. So I would probably turn it a little bit in terms of how to think of it. So yes, we definitely want to bring in something that the user is by bringing in the biometrics. At the base level, you probably may want to use the device biometrics, which include the fingerprint or the face ID.</p>
<p>RBI in general also talks about risk-based authentication where the, for example, higher amount of transaction, you want to ensure that you are able to step-up. In our case, the way we look at step-up is that we bring in a Live ID where we are going to ask the person to blink, smile, turn left, right on a random basis to prove that the person is real. Alternately, yes, this does bring in a little bit of dependency on the phone, but we also as part of our platform capability can offer an additional alternate form of authentication, which is app-less. So if a customer is sitting on the laptop, he could use his camera to still provide those facial features or what we call as passive liveness to authenticate as well. Worst case scenario, you have time-based OTP, which is still more secure, I would say, than SMS or an email-based OTP.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Well, so this is interesting. So not only do the guidelines specify or indicate that there’s a range of biometrics that might be appropriate based on the risk of the transaction for a low-value transaction, maybe a thumb or a face ID on the phone. It’s thousands of dollars, might require that you blink and smile and turn your head.</p>
<p>Siddharth Gandhi:<br>
Correct. Yes. That’s what we are offering, Michael. I don’t think the guidelines would specifically talk about what the bank should be doing based on risk based or step-up. Guidelines are broad guide norms that they’re asking the banks to adhere to. The interpretations are left to the bank in terms of what and how they want to adopt it.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Right. Well, that’s important too. I mean, there’s new developments, there’s the new shiny objects, but no one organization magically use the magic wand and all of a sudden everything is the latest and greatest. So being able to support this mix of authentication or step-up authentication use cases is super important and we’ve done that for a while with our platform.</p>
<p>Well, Sid, I know that we’re working extensively with some large financial institutions in Asia Pacific. Is it fair to talk a little bit about what we’ve done that aligns with these guidelines for those organizations?</p>
<p>Siddharth Gandhi:<br>
Absolutely. I think so. Unfortunately because of the NDA, I am not going to be able to take names of the customers, but we can definitely talk about what we’ve done for them. So we are working with a few banking and financial institutions in India in the Southeast Asian markets.</p>
<p>One of the private sector bank has been our customer for the last or three years. It’s a known fact that RBI does audit the banks and the financial institutions on a yearly basis so we undergone the audit without any major challenges. The bank use us for their internal workforce to protect their internal enterprise applications and data, but also the customers are using it and we are having some very interesting conversation with some of the other banks that are there.</p>
<p>For one of the digital-only bank in Southeast Asian market, we are providing them with our liveness capability as part of our platform where the users are actually authenticating for transaction with the liveness factor, which kind of prevents any fraud that may potentially happen and ensuring that the customer data, the transactions, and the payment transactions are happening in a secure manner.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Well that’s awesome. Well, Sid, I appreciate you spending time with us today. It’s, from my perspective, really gratifying to see these principle-based guidelines emerge in step with where 1Kosmos has been for the last couple of years. So it’s good to get some validation that we’ve been on the right track and remain on the right track.</p>
<p>Siddharth Gandhi:<br>
Yes, absolutely, Michael. We’ve been talking about it for the last few years, so it’s very heartening to see the RBI coming out and asking the industry to start looking at the alternate factors of authentication. And we at 1Kosmos are sure ready to assist anyone who needs assistance with the guidelines.</p>
<p>Michael Cichon:<br>
Indeed, we are. All right, thank you very much, Sid.</p>
<p>Siddharth Gandhi:<br>
Thank you so much, Michael.</p>

  Mexico is in the process of implementing the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule.  The country has a stringent KYC process for crypto businesses, which consists of identity verification, customer due diligence, and transaction monitoring.  Crypto service providers must also register and report high-value client transactions from the past six months to the country’s ‘AML&nbsp;Portal.’  <p>Mexico, a North American country and one of the largest recipients of remittances globally, is experiencing growing crypto adoption. As per Chainalysis’s 2023 Global Crypto Adoption Index, it ranks among the <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2023-global-crypto-adoption-index/">top 20 nations for grassroots crypto adoption</a>.</p><p>On the regulatory front, the country lacks comprehensive crypto rules. However, it has strong <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">AML/CFT regulations</a> in place and is in the process of implementing <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule</a>.</p> Is Crypto Regulated in&nbsp;Mexico? <p>The purchase, sale, transfer, and custody of crypto assets are regulated under Mexico’s Fintech&nbsp;Law.</p><p>The country’s main financial regulators, the National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV), the Secretariat of the Treasury and Public Credit (SHCP), and the Bank of Mexico (Banxico), have clarified that financial institutions may carry out operations with crypto but only with prior authorization from the central&nbsp;bank.</p> Crypto Travel Rule in&nbsp;Mexico <p>According to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the country is progressing in enacting the rule for virtual asset service providers (VASPs) to comply with the Crypto Travel&nbsp;rule.</p><p>For now, the country has conducted a risk assessment covering virtual assets and VASPs, enacted legislation requiring VASPs to be registered and apply AML/CFT measures, and covers VASPs in its supervisory inspection plan.</p> Key Features <p>As a member of the FATF, Mexico is required to comply with the organization’s recommendations, which means the country’s crypto sector must adopt the Crypto Travel&nbsp;rule.</p><p>Mexico has also designed its anti-money laundering (AML) compliance and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements around FATF’s international standards in its fight against financial crimes.</p><p>Its comprehensive KYC program consists of three main components:</p><p>Identity verification (IDV) — Financial institutions are required to collect and verify their customers’ personal information. Authorities mandate that businesses confirm their customers’ identities to facilitate the identification of suspicious accounts and enable regulators to investigate and apprehend bad&nbsp;actors.</p><p>Customer due diligence (CDD) — Businesses perform multiple checks to verify their customers’ identities and assess their risk profiles to gauge their potential involvement in money laundering. High-risk customers may be subject to additional scrutiny and enhanced security measures, or they may be denied services altogether.</p><p>Transaction monitoring — Businesses continuously monitor customer transactions for any signs of suspicious activity. This involves assessing customer information, transfers, deposits, and withdrawals. Businesses must also set alerts and establish policies that dictate the necessary actions to be&nbsp;taken.</p> Compliance Requirements <p>Transactions related to crypto assets are considered vulnerable activities under Mexico’s Anti-Money Laundering Legal Framework. This means businesses dealing with crypto must comply with the AML/CFT obligations.</p><p>According to this, businesses must identify customers for which the following information and documentation, at minimum, are to be requested:</p><p>- Name</p><p>- Date of&nbsp;birth</p><p>- Nationality</p><p>- Residential address</p><p>- Email&nbsp;address</p><p>- Phone&nbsp;number</p><p>- Taxpayer registration code</p><p>In case the customer is an organization, the business must obtain the following information and verify&nbsp;it:</p><p>- Name</p><p>- Nationality</p><p>- Email &amp; physical&nbsp;address</p><p>- Phone&nbsp;number</p><p>- Date of formation</p><p>- Taxpayer registration code</p><p>- Serial number of advanced electronic signature</p><p>Beneficial owners are also required to be identified and verified in the same&nbsp;manner.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>In Mexico, crypto transactions by VASPs are considered a regulated activity. As a result, VASPs must register and submit details of clients involved in high-value transactions over the past six months to the ‘AML&nbsp;Portal.’</p><p>VASPs must also draft a compliance manual, designate an officer for AML compliance, and employ a risk-based approach to assess AML&nbsp;risks.</p><p>Furthermore, these businesses are required to gather and maintain detailed transaction records for each client for the last six months.

<p></p>
<p>Remember your first username? If you were anything like me in the early 2000s—too young to surf the web but excited about the possibilities of connecting with the rest of the world—your username probably makes you cringe today.</p>
<p>Self-expression is the main driver for my internet usage. Over the years, I've created various usernames representing different parts of me at distinct periods of my life. From <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Website/Millsberry">Millsberry</a> to <a href="https://myspace.com/">Myspace</a>, each new website meant a new profile, leading to a fragmented experience. The most annoying part is that there's no connection between my profiles or "identities", so I have to remember all my passwords or rely on a password manager. Unfortunately, password managers are susceptible to <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/how-password-managers-can-get-hacked">security breaches</a>.</p>
<p>This fragmentation of identity on the web poses a significant challenge: How do we manage these scattered identities efficiently and securely?</p>
<p>Many organizations are working hard to answer this question. Some are going passwordless via passkeys. Others, like the <a href="https://orcid.org/">Open Researcher and Contributor ID</a> (ORCID), implemented digital identifiers to associate publications, research, and open source contributions with a particular researcher.</p>
<p>Companies focused on advancing identity tech and self-sovereign identity are embracing <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/decentralized-identifiers">Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a> as a solution. DIDs are globally unique, alphanumeric, immutable strings representing who you are across the decentralized web.</p>
<p>Speaking of DIDs -- did you know that Decentralized Identifiers are one of the pillars of Web5?</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this post, we'll explore nine more things you may not have known about Decentralized Identifiers.</p>
 1. DIDs are a W3C Standard<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/things-you-didnt-know-about-dids#1-dids-are-a-w3c-standard" title="Direct link to 1. DIDs are a W3C Standard">​</a> 
<p>In 1994, Tim Berners Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The W3C is made up of groups of people focused on setting the best practices and standards for building the web. For example, the W3C develops and maintains standards for HTML, CSS, Web Accessibility, and Web Security. In July 2022, The W3C officially <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">published standards for Decentralized Identifiers</a>. This way, technologists would have blueprint for building and managing digital identities as we make the shift towards controlling your own identity on the internet.</p>
 2. DIDs can represent more than just humans<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/things-you-didnt-know-about-dids#2-dids-can-represent-more-than-just-humans" title="Direct link to 2. DIDs can represent more than just humans">​</a> 
<p>While DIDs represent people across the web, they can also represent organizations such as manufacturers, businesses, or government agencies. Technologists are exploring using <a href="https://www.arcadian-iot.eu/iot-decentralized-identity-arcadian/">DIDs to represent IoT devices</a> like smart hubs, smart thermostats, or autonomous cars, allowing you to maintain control over your data usage! Here's a taboo but realistic use case that might make you blush— DIDs can even represent sex tech devices! 😳</p>
 3. It's nearly impossible for someone to steal your DID<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/things-you-didnt-know-about-dids#3-its-nearly-impossible-for-someone-to-steal-your-did" title="Direct link to 3. It's nearly impossible for someone to steal your DID">​</a> 
<p>A common question people often ask me is, "Can someone steal my DID?" DIDs are alphanumeric strings, so they may give people the impression that DIDs are top-secret passwords or API keys. But that's not the case; you can share your DID with anyone without compromising your safety. It's nearly impossible for someone to steal your DID and pretend to be you because DIDs are all cryptographically signed.</p>
<p>What does 'cryptographically signed' mean?</p>
<p>Cryptographically signed means that each DID has a unique digital fingerprint generated by a fancy, complicated algorithm. Two keys—a public key and a private key—make up the digital fingerprint. Your public key shows other people that the DID legitimately belongs to you, but the private key needs to remain private. The private key is like your master key. Someone can only steal your DID, tamper with your DID, or impersonate you if they have access to your private key. Fortunately, it's not easy to access your private key because it is protected by encryption and multiple layers of security. Some <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/things-you-didnt-know-about-dids#5-every-did-has-a-did-method">DID methods</a> even support key rotation meaning you can update your cryptographic keys to reduce the risk of compromise.</p>
<p>Store your DID in an authenticated digital wallet</p>
<p>In addition to all these security algorithms that protect your DID from being stolen, users typically store their DIDs in an authenticated digital wallet (similar to how your Apple Wallet or Google Wallet stores your debit card information). Storing your DID in a digital wallet provides an additional layer of security because you often have to use a form of authentication like Face ID or a passcode to access items stored in the wallet.</p>
<p></p>
 4. Your DID is more than a string<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/things-you-didnt-know-about-dids#4-your-did-is-more-than-a-string" title="Direct link to 4. Your DID is more than a string">​</a> 
<p>While your DID is a string, it's part of a larger JSON object called a DID document. In addition to the DID string, the DID document includes metadata like:</p>
 
 Cryptographic keys to prove ownership 
 Rules about how your DID can be used, managed, or modified 
 
<p>Below is an example of a DID document:</p>
   <code>{<br><br>  "@context": [<br><br>    "https://www.w3.org/ns/did/v1",<br><br>    "https://w3id.org/security/suites/ed25519-2020/v1"<br><br>  ]<br><br>  "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",<br><br>  "verificationMethod": [{<br><br>    "id": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi#key-1",<br><br>    "type": "Ed25519VerificationKey2020", <br><br>    "controller": "did:example:123456789abcdefghi",<br><br>    "publicKeyMultibase": "zH3C2AVvLMv6gmMNam3uVAjZpfkcJCwDwnZn6z3wXmqPV"<br><br>  }, ...],<br><br>  "authentication": [<br><br>    "#key-1"<br><br>  ]<br><br>}<br></code>     
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#example-an-example-of-a-relative-did-url">https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#example-an-example-of-a-relative-did-url</a></p>
<p>Learn more about DID documents <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/learn/did_document">here</a>.</p>
 5. Every DID has a DID method<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/things-you-didnt-know-about-dids#5-every-did-has-a-did-method" title="Direct link to 5. Every DID has a DID method">​</a> 
<p>Let's examine the anatomy of a DID method.
</p>
<p>Every DID:</p>
 
 Starts with the schema <code>did:</code> 
 Followed by a word or acronym representing the did method 
 Then, ends with a did method-specific identifier in the form of an alphanumeric string 
 
<p>A schema and a DID method together may look like <code>did:web</code> or <code>did:jwk</code>.</p>
<p>What are DID methods?</p>
<p>DID methods define the rules for creating, managing, and deactivating DIDs.</p>
 6. There are over 100 DID methods<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/things-you-didnt-know-about-dids#6-there-are-over-100-did-methods" title="Direct link to 6. There are over 100 DID methods">​</a> 
<p>Anyone can create a DID method. Companies, individuals, or communities may create a custom DID method to fit a specific use case or live on a specific type of ledger. However, to ensure the DID method is recognized, interoperable, and meets the correct standards, it's strongly recommended to include the DID method on the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries">W3C DID Spec Registry</a>.</p>
 7. TBD created its own DID method<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/things-you-didnt-know-about-dids#7-tbd-created-its-own-did-method" title="Direct link to 7. TBD created its own DID method">​</a> 
<p>We (TBD) created our own DID method called DID:DHT. DHT stands for Distributed Hash Table indicating the use of Mainline DHT. You can learn more about DID:DHT via the <a href="https://did-dht.com/">spec</a> and this <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-dht">blog post</a> written by TBD’s Director of Open Standards, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cohengabe">Gabe Cohen</a>.</p>
<p>At TBD, we colloquially call DID:DHT, DID THAT.</p>

 8. You don't have to use blockchain; we use BitTorrent<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/things-you-didnt-know-about-dids#8-you-dont-have-to-use-blockchain-we-use-bittorrent" title="Direct link to 8. You don't have to use blockchain; we use BitTorrent">​</a> 
<p>When I hear the words, "decentralized" or "immutable", I immediately think of blockchain and cryptocurrency. I don't think that train of thought is in the minority.</p>
<p>For instance, to ensure DIDs have no central authority and that individual users can own them, folks typically anchor DIDs on an immutable ledger.</p>
<p>What does anchoring a DID mean?</p>
<p>Anchoring a DID means recording DID transactions on a distributed ledger.</p>
<p>DID:DHT uses BitTorrent; not blockchain</p>
<p>At TBD, we actually took a blockchain-less approach. We anchored DID:DHT to BitTorrent. As mentioned above, DID:DHT uses a Mainline DHT, which is a distributed hash table used by the <a href="https://github.com/bittorrent/bittorrent.org">BitTorrent protocol</a>.</p>
 9. You can create a DID with the Web5 SDK<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/things-you-didnt-know-about-dids#9-you-can-create-a-did-with-the-web5-sdk" title="Direct link to 9. You can create a DID with the Web5 SDK">​</a> 
<p>You can use the Web5 SDK to <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/build/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did">create a DID</a>!</p>
 <code>Web5.connect()</code><a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/things-you-didnt-know-about-dids#web5connect" title="Direct link to web5connect">​</a> 
<p>You can generate a DID using the Web5.connect() method with the following steps:</p>
<p>Install the web5/api package</p>
 
 <code>npm install @web5/api</code> 
 
<p>Import the package</p>
 
 <code>import { Web5 } from '@web5/api';</code> 
 
<p>Call Web5.connect()</p>
 
 <code>const { web5, did: myDid } = await Web5.connect();</code> 
 <code>console.log(myDid)</code>

<p>Gone are the days of delegating technology and cybersecurity concerns to be solved solely by the IT department. With artificial intelligence (AI), post-quantum (PQ), and an intensifying threat landscape, senior leadership teams and boards must make the right investments and provide strategic guidance to help keep the organization, employees, customers, and other key stakeholders safe. If that’s not enough incentive, federal agencies are continuing efforts to accelerate <a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/sec-cyber-disclosure-rules-enforcement-timeline/692446/">breach disclosures</a> and hold executives liable for security and data privacy incidents. This is why pursuing an enterprise-wide <a href="https://www.entrust.com/cybersecurity-institute/reports/building-a-solid-foundation-for-your-zero-trust-framework?edc_sfid=7015Y000003dRWZQA2&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA_5WvBhBAEiwAZtCU78IhLzN7Zgxf6ga0wROR5TnGvrInZctKnGfXrquicZEBwdRyL_gufRoCeq4QAvD_BwE">Zero Trust</a> strategy is critical for strong corporate governance and increasingly a board-level priority.</p>
<p>Reinforcing this strategic link between Zero Trust and governance is NIST’s recently released <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/02/nist-releases-version-20-landmark-cybersecurity-framework">Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0</a>. The renewed CSF provides guidance and examples for adopting Zero Trust and adds “Govern” to the other five key critical framework functions of Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. While governance was implied in earlier CSF iterations, it is now codified to ensure an organization’s strategy is directly linked to cybersecurity roles and responsibilities, informing the business what it needs to do to address the other five functions. NIST’s focus on governance reinforces that the entire leadership team is in this together and really calls out the fiduciary responsibilities of the board.</p>
<p>All this focus on governance is key to minimizing business risk and protecting shareholder value, but also puts tremendous pressure on leadership teams to effectively communicate cyber risks to their board and meet regulatory requirements. This is where Zero Trust comes in.</p>
<p>Zero Trust is not a product to buy or a box to check. As an executive officer or director, you should understand it’s a strategic approach. Zero Trust improves cyber resilience and can also serve to increase an organization’s agility, reduce cost of compliance, decrease IT complexity and total cost of ownership, and of course strengthen corporate governance. CISA’s <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/zero_trust_maturity_model_v2_508.pdf">Zero Trust Maturity Model 2.0</a> provides a roadmap to pursue a Zero Trust strategy with updated guidelines around the five key pillars of Identity, Devices, Networks, Data, and Applications and Workloads. Like the CSF 2.0, governance is front and center in this latest version. CISA’s updated guidelines reinforce that governance of cybersecurity policies, procedures, and processes within and across the five pillars is essential to improving cyber resilience and maintaining regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. While long considered a cybersecurity best practice, pursuing a Zero Trust strategy is now also an express requirement from both NIST and CISA for strong corporate governance.</p>

<p>As a leading provider of identity management solutions, 1Kosmos is excited to announce our new capability as a Credential Service Provider (CSP) for government agencies. This development represents a significant step forward in our mission to revolutionize the way organizations of any type can manage digital identities and secure access to critical resources.</p>
 What is a Credential Service Provider (CSP)? 
<p>A CSP is a trusted entity, in this case 1Kosmos, responsible for ID verification, onboarding and delivery of strong phishing resistant credentials. 1Kosmos acts as a managed service, verifying and authenticating citizens and residents accessing government data and services. From initial registration to ongoing authentication, the 1Kosmos CSP plays a vital role in ensuring secure access.</p>
<p>There are five main considerations a full service a CSP can deliver:</p>
 
 Security: A CSP must have robust security measures in place to protect against unauthorized access and cyber threats. This includes advanced encryption protocols, secure storage of credentials, and continuous monitoring for suspicious activity. 
 Compliance: Meeting stringent regulations and standards – some industry, some governmental – is a fundamental requirement for any CSP. 
 User Experience: While security is paramount, a seamless user experience is crucial for user adoption and operational efficiency. A user-centric approach ensures that the authentication process is intuitive and easy to navigate. 
 Privacy: Privacy and security of citizen biometrics and other personal identifiable Information (PII) is critical to comply with 230+ similar privacy regulations around the world, including California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). It is also important to give residents the assurance they need that their information is not accessible without their explicit consent. 
 Access for All: Providing equality in access to all citizens and residents is complicated, while much of the population may have access to mobile devices and desktops, that will not be the case for some, and therefore alternate use cases will need to be considered and addresses 
 
 Why is a CSP Needed? 
<p>Demands by residents for digital government services have resulted in rampant identity fraud, costing taxpayers millions. Stopping fraud means blocking synthetic and stolen identities during the application process and securing resident accounts from phishing and social engineering attacks aimed at account takeover. Delivering these services is no easy task. Investment in hardware, software, and management resources is high, with little return. Additionally, each agency would need to invest in delivering these services, creating a drain on taxpayers’ dollars while providing an experience that differs across all agencies.</p>
<p>Government agencies face unique challenges in implementing and maintaining effective identity management solutions. From the complexity of integrating with existing IT systems to stringent compliance requirements, these challenges can often hinder the adoption of robust identity management solutions. This is where a CSP solves these unique problems.</p>
 Elevating Government Identity Management with 1Kosmos 
<p>As a leading provider of identity management solutions, 1Kosmos is uniquely positioned to elevate the way government agencies approach credential service and identity management. By leveraging the capabilities available in the 1Kosmos Credential Service Provider (CSP) solution, government agencies can unlock a range of benefits that set 1Kosmos apart in the market.</p>
 
 Robust Identity Proofing and Credential Issuance 
 
<p>1Kosmos’ CSP solution enables government agencies to perform Identity Assurance Level 2 (IAL2) identity verification and issue Authentication Assurance Level 2 (AAL2) credentials that are certified to NIST 800-63-3 standards. This ensures a high level of confidence in the identity of citizens and residents accessing services and resources.</p>
 
 Secure and Decentralized Identity Management 
 
<p>The 1Kosmos CSP leverages a “privacy by design” approach, empowering residents with complete control over their personal information. By utilizing a private and permissioned distributed ledger, the solution decentralizes data storage and eliminates the risk of a centralized “honeypot” of personally identifiable information (PII).</p>
 
 Combating Fraud and Phishing 
 
<p>1Kosmos’ CSP incorporates advanced security measures to combat phishing and fraudulent activities targeting citizens and residents. The solution offers a streamlined, self-service identity verification process and leverages phishing-resistant authentication methods, such as FIDO passkeys and biometric authentication, to enhance the overall security posture, safeguarding citizen and resident accounts.</p>
 
 Seamless Integration and Interoperability 
 
<p>1Kosmos’ CSP is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing government IT systems and infrastructure, reducing the complexity and time required for implementation. Additionally, the solution’s adherence to open standards ensures interoperability across different government agencies and systems, enabling a unified approach to identity management.</p>
 
 Scalability and Cost-Effectiveness 
 
<p>The 1Kosmos CSP is highly scalable, allowing government agencies to accommodate growing user and transaction volumes without incurring significant additional costs. By automating identity enrollment and authentication processes, the solution also helps to reduce IT management overhead and operational expenses.</p>
 
 Non-Biased Decisioning and Access for All 
 
<p>1Kosmos adopts an innovative approach to identity proofing and authentication based on deterministic verification of an individual to truly identify the user behind a device rather than assuming identity based on how closely they resemble a static, unverified biometric. 1Kosmos utilizes government-issued identification documents and live biometrics to identify and authenticate citizens and residents. At no time is anyone compared to others in a database. Their real, live biometrics and government issued IDs are used to verify their identities digitally, just as they would be verified in person, but without human error.</p>
 
 Privacy-Preserving Identity Management 
 
<p>1Kosmos’ CSP is designed with a strong focus on privacy protection. The solution employs advanced cryptographic techniques, cryptographically paired public-private key architectures and zero-knowledge proofs, to enable citizens to selectively disclose only the necessary information required for authentication, without revealing their full identity details. This ensures that personal data is kept secure and minimizes the risk of unauthorized access or misuse.</p>
<p>By choosing 1Kosmos as their credential service provider, government agencies can leverage these key benefits to enhance the security, efficiency, and user experience of their identity management initiatives. As agencies strive to modernize their identity management capabilities and comply with evolving regulatory requirements, 1Kosmos’ CSP delivers a complete full-service solution that addresses the unique challenges faced by the government sector.</p>

<p>For companies developing products in the booming identity and privacy space, our CTO, Dr Paul Ashley, has this simple but powerful advice:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 “Have a way into your app that’s free, then have tiers starting cheaply; for example, 99 cents. Users tend to go up sub levels as they embrace and rely on the app.”&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



 
 Focus on uses cases more than features: “Use cases are interesting to users.”&nbsp; 
 



 
 Listen to users through support. “Get stuff out to real users; get it in production so you can learn what’s right and wrong.”&nbsp; 
 



 
 Look for processes where you’re “using paper or have tricky integration challenges” and apply future-focused decentralized identity technology to find a solution.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>Dr Ashley should know: not only is he in <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/12/why-dr-paul-ashley-is-in-demand-on-the-decentralized-identity-speaking-circuit/">demand on the decentralized identity speaking circuit</a>, he has been at the helm of privacy pioneer, <a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">Anonyome Labs</a>, alongside <a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">CEO JD Mumford</a> for years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr Ashley gave the advice on a recent episode of the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-ashley-will-consumers-pay-for-an-identity-product/id1672163418?i=1000606281000">Future of Identity podcast</a> with host Riley Hughes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the episode, Dr Ashley takes the listener through the history and success of Anonyome Labs’ all-in-one privacy app <a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>, as well as our enterprise platform, <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a> (for which MySudo is an exemplar application), and explains how our products link to and enable <a href="https://anonyome.com/?s=decentralized+identity&amp;et_pb_searchform_submit=et_search_proccess&amp;et_pb_include_posts=yes">decentralized identity</a>—the biggest privacy breakthrough of the next decade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Riley says, “This is a conversation that will interest anyone who has a passion for <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a> and safety online and will be very insightful for anyone building a consumer identity product.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-ashley-will-consumers-pay-for-an-identity-product/id1672163418?i=1000606281000">Listen to the episode now</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Apart from product development advice, the episode covers 6 topics:&nbsp;</p>



 
 What’s the WHY for MySudo?&nbsp; 
 



<p>Dr Ashley explains how the erosion of <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy</a> online and the rise of <a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/04/how-data-brokers-find-and-sell-your-personal-information/">data brokers</a> and <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">surveillance capitalism</a> led Anonyome Labs to create our innovative ID tech product, <a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You could see the user really had very little hope of protecting themselves. We wanted to offer tech for everyday users that provides them greater privacy, greater safety and security and our mission was to deliver product in that space,” Dr Ashley says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now highly regarded as the world’s only all-in-one privacy app, <a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a> allows users to create secure digital profiles or personas called <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudos</a>, with unique disposable <a href="https://mysudo.com/2022/08/the-shocking-privacy-facts-our-co-ceo-told-naomi-brockwell-about-cell-phones%ef%bf%bc/">phone numbers</a>, <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-5-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-email-in-mysudo/">emails</a>, <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/08/the-7-big-benefits-of-using-virtual-cards-in-mysudo/">credit cards</a>, <a href="https://mysudo.com/2022/06/securely-chat-with-your-friends-with-free-sudo-handles/">handles</a>, and <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/09/the-3-big-benefits-of-using-the-private-browser-in-mysudo/">private browsers</a> to use across the internet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As host Riley points out, with hundreds of thousands of users, “MySudo has defied conventional wisdom that consumers won’t pay for identity services, making it among a handful of successful, sustainable ID tech businesses.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://mysudo.com/">Discover MySudo</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 
 What’s the history of MySudo?&nbsp; 
 



<p>Dr Ashley says Anonyome Labs realized early the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/dr-paul-ashley-presents-on-how-to-solve-the-privacy-problem/">privacy problem</a> was an identity problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The identity problem was that when you went out into the world and did different things, it was always you with the same identifiers and it made it very simple for the trackers to follow you around. That was because users were using their single, real identity to do everything. Then, if there was a sale or theft of that info, the user was in trouble,” he explained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In response, Anonyome Labs came up with the idea of a <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/">Sudo</a>, based on the concept of a pseudonym, and then applied the concept of <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/">compartmentalization</a>. MySudo leverages compartmentalization by allowing the user to have multiple Sudo digital identities or personas—one digital identity for shopping, one for dating, one for selling on classifieds, one close to the user’s legal identity for booking airline tickets, and so on. See how a <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/11/see-how-a-mysudo-user-applies-the-app-to-their-busy-life/">MySudo user applies the app to their busy life</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The MySudo we know today is actually a combination of two previous app iterations: Sudo app for communications and Sudo Pay which introduced Anonyome Labs’ virtual cards to meet the need for limitless virtual payment card options.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Dr Ashley told Riley Hughes, “Users can go out with a whole bunch of different personas to do different things. Each persona has its own attributes plus can have a VPN profile, virtual credit card and so on—all the things you need to be different in situation A and situation B.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“MySudo has been out there for three to four years now [as] a consumer ID product for creating personas for people to use throughout their life online,” Dr Ashley summarized.&nbsp;</p>



 
 How does Anonyome Labs market MySudo?&nbsp; 
 



<p>In the <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/paul-ashley-will-consumers-pay-for-an-identity-product/id1672163418?i=1000606281000">podcast episode</a>, Dr Ashley breaks down how Anonyome Labs has succeeded by taking a practical product approach and by talking about <a href="https://mysudo.com/category/use-cases/">use cases</a> more than <a href="https://mysudo.com/features/">features</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most important use case for MySudo is the user logging in with a separate Sudo email and phone number rather than their personal ones. Most MySudo users apply that capability to online shopping, selling, dating, and travel. Users can also do <a href="https://mysudo.com/2022/08/this-is-why-you-should-be-careful-how-you-set-up-2fa/">2FA with MySudo</a>, Dr Ashley says.&nbsp;</p>



 
 How does decentralized identity fit into our product roadmap?&nbsp; 
 



<p>Dr Ashley outlines some of the opportunities and challenges in the “nascent space” of <a href="https://anonyome.com/?s=decentralized+identity&amp;et_pb_searchform_submit=et_search_proccess&amp;et_pb_include_posts=yes">decentralized identity</a> (DI), including navigating the complex technology landscape, how to find good problems for decentralized identity to solve first, and how Anonyome Labs’ experience building what some would call a “web2 identity product” (MySudo) is informing the way we tackle the UX of <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">verifiable credentials</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr Ashley says DI is a natural accompaniment to Sudos: “We came at MySudo from the privacy direction—a toolkit of privacy tools. Then we saw decentralized identity come along and we said straight away it’s a tech that’s 100% designed for privacy and safety,” Dr Ashley explains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs has been active in the DI space ever since: helping to run three DI blockchains, actively contributing to DI standards, contributing source code back to the DI open source community, and building DI capabilities into <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a> for enterprises to leverage, including <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/11/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">identity wallets</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“DI is the future-leaning part of the business and we’re 100% behind it,” Dr Ashley says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 
 How will Anonyome Labs take the DI concepts to the people?&nbsp; 
 



<p>Dr Ashley says in the past four years DI has boomed, including around standards and what he calls “<a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/03/verifiable-credentials-the-killer-feature-of-decentralized-identity/">the killer feature of DI</a>, verifiable credentials”, which has led to the need for an <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/11/weve-introduced-the-sudo-platform-decentralized-identity-mobile-wallet-sdk/">identity wallet</a>: “There’s no question that having that stack is correct,” Dr Ashley says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr Ashley then runs through many use cases for DI, including the big one: selective disclosure around digital proof of identity, where “we’re already seeing lots of great government uses such as licenses,” and everyday applications such as gym memberships.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We have got to stop people having hundreds of different passwords in a password manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Even just managing the log-in problem will be a marvelous thing for the world,” Dr Ashley says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Read our whitepaper: <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/01/realizing-the-business-value-of-decentralized-identity/">Realizing the Business Value of Decentralized Identity</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr Ashley told Riley Hughes that <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/05/part-3-how-were-enhancing-sudo-digital-identities-with-decentralized-identity/">Sudos are a bridge</a> between the old and new worlds of identity management: “This technology is absolutely perfect for Anonyome Labs and fits into the Sudo perfectly.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>And interest from enterprise is booming: “All of a sudden there are a lot of organizations wanting to do projects in this area. We have a lot of expertise over four-plus years, plus two years of project experience. A lot of enterprises are saying this tech looks good. The timing is great; the wave is cresting.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“But we’re not looking at boiling the ocean. It’s about making processes more efficient— replacing paper-based systems [with] simpler, cheaper [processes] using verifiable credentials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Enterprises should look for processes where [they’re] using paper or have tricky integration challenges. They should also listen to users through support. Get stuff out to real users; get it in production so you can learn what’s right and wrong,” Dr Ashley advises.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Get more advice on getting started with DI <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2023/01/realizing-the-business-value-of-decentralized-identity/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>



 
 What does the future of identity look like to Dr Ashley?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 



<p>The podcast episode ends with this hope from Dr Ashley: “We have got to put the user back in control and swing the pendulum back. It’s not easy because of the trillion dollar companies like Meta and Google not wanting that. But enterprises are going back to respecting user data and only using what they need.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In the next 10 years, there’ll be a tussle but hopefully the user will win and get their privacy back, and hopefully the big data companies will have just faded away,” he says.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Hi everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m excited to announce the general availability of Microsoft Entra ID multi-tenant organization platform capabilities!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As your organization evolves, you may need to integrate multiple tenants to facilitate collaboration; for example, your organization may have recently acquired a new company, merged with another company, or restructured with newly formed business units. With disparate identity management systems, it can be costly and complex for admins to manage multiple tenants while ensuring users across tenants have access to resources to collaborate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enable application sharing across tenants, many of you have already deployed features like <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/external-id/what-is-b2b">B2B collaboration</a> to grant application access across tenants in your organization, <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/collaborate-more-securely-with-new-cross-tenant-access-settings/ba-p/2147077">cross-tenant access settings</a> to allow for granular access controls, and <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-blog/seamless-application-access-and-lifecycle-management-for-multi/ba-p/3728752">cross-tenant synchronization</a> to manage the lifecycle of users across tenants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further improve employee collaboration across your tenants, many of you have asked for unified chat across tenants in Microsoft Teams and seamless cross-tenant employee engagement and community experiences in Viva Engage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can now use <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/multi-tenant-organizations/overview">Entra ID multi-tenant organizations</a> to improve the cross-tenant collaboration experience in Microsoft Teams and Viva Engage. The capabilities are now generally available with Microsoft Entra ID P1 in the <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/public-sector-blog/understanding-compliance-between-commercial-government-and-dod/ba-p/3258326">M365 commercial cloud</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 Multi-tenant organization capabilities:&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 &nbsp; 
 Get started with Entra ID multi-tenant organizations:&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this example, we’ll follow Contoso EMEA and Contoso APAC, two divisions of Contoso Conglomerate. Employees from Contoso EMEA and APAC are already using Microsoft Entra to share apps across tenants. Now they need to communicate across tenants using <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/announcing-more-seamless-collaboration-in-microsoft-teams-for/ba-p/3901092">Microsoft Teams</a> and <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/viva-engage-blog/what-s-new-for-viva-engage-ignite-edition/ba-p/3981897">Viva Engage</a>. Leaders in the organization need to share announcements and storylines across the organization and employees need to chat using Teams. Let’s look at how the admins at Contoso configure their multi-tenant organization to meet these needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 1 – Form a multi-tenant organization&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tenant administrators of Contoso EMEA and Contoso APAC agree to form an Entra ID multi-tenant organization, facilitated by an invite-and-accept flow between them. The Contoso EMEA admin navigates to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/set-up-multi-tenant-org?view=o365-worldwide">M365 admin center</a> and initiates the process, while the Contoso APAC admin confirms. This results in a mutually agreed upon multi-tenant organization of two tenants in both directories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Teams and Viva Engage applications in Contoso EMEA (APAC) will now interpret any external member users of identity provider Contoso APAC (EMEA) as employees of the multi-tenant organization with corresponding improved collaboration experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Caption] A multi-tenant organization or two tenants in M365 admin center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 2 – Provision external member users at scale&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Teams improved collaboration experience relies on reciprocal provisioning of collaborating users. So, Alice of Contoso EMEA should be provisioned as an external member user into Contoso APAC, while Bob of Contoso APAC should be provisioned as external member user into Contoso EMEA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Viva Engage improved employee engagement experiences rely on centralized provisioning of employees into a central tenant, say Contoso EMEA. As such, Bob of Contoso APAC should be provisioned as an external member user into Contoso EMEA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cross-tenant synchronization is the ideal tool to accomplish this at scale, via the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/multi-tenant-organizations/cross-tenant-synchronization-configure">Entra admin center</a> for complex identity landscapes, or via the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/plan-multi-tenant-org-overview?view=o365-worldwide">M365 admin center</a> for simplified setups. If you already have your own at scale user provisioning engine, you can continue using it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Step 3 – Complete requirements by Microsoft Teams or Viva Engage&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any Microsoft Teams requirements such as using the new Teams clients can be found under <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/plan-multi-tenant-org-overview?view=o365-worldwide">M365 multi-tenant collaboration</a>, while any Viva Engage configuration requirements can be found under <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/Viva/engage/mto-setup">Viva Engage for multi-tenant organizations</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once your requirements for Microsoft Teams and/or Viva Engage have been completed, your employees will be able to collaborate seamlessly across your organization of multiple tenants, with unified chat experiences in Microsoft Teams and seamless conversations in Viva Engage communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 How does multi-tenant organization licensing work?&nbsp; 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Entra ID multi-tenant organization license requirement - Your employees can enjoy the new multi-tenant organization platform benefits with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/multi-tenant-organizations/multi-tenant-organization-overview#license-requirements">Microsoft Entra ID P1 licenses</a>. Only one Microsoft Entra ID P1 license is required per employee per multi-tenant organization. For Microsoft Teams and Viva Engage license requirements, please review the <a href="https://aka.ms/M365MTOBlog">M365 multi-tenant organization announcement</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m very excited for this milestone which helps your multi-tenant organization achieve better collaboration and communication experiences for your employees! Go and plan your multi-tenant organization rollout today. We love hearing from you and look forward to your feedback on <a href="https://feedback.azure.com/d365community">Azure forum</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 Decentralized Identity in the Age of Wearable Technology <p>The rise of wearable technology, as detailed by Luis Quintero in his insightful article on The Conversation, presents an exciting yet daunting evolution in how we interact with digital devices. Wearables now extend beyond fitness trackers to include devices capable of monitoring a broad spectrum of physiological data, from heart rates to brain activity. While these devices promise enhanced personal health monitoring and more immersive digital experiences, they also raise significant privacy concerns. This piece aims to explore how decentralized identity (DID) can provide robust solutions to these concerns.</p><blockquote>Wearable devices are now becoming a more significant element in this discussion due to their ability to collect continuous data, without the wearer necessarily being aware of it. — <a href="https://theconversation.com/a-new-wave-of-wearable-devices-will-collect-a-mountain-on-information-on-us-we-need-to-get-wise-about-the-privacy-implications-226537">Read the full article by Luis Quintero on The Conversation</a></blockquote> Continuous and Invasive Data Collection <p>Quintero adeptly highlights the dual-edged nature of wearable technologies: while they offer personalized health insights, they also pose risks due to the continuous and often non-consensual collection of personal data. This data collection can become invasive, extending into areas we might prefer remained&nbsp;private.</p><p>Decentralized Identity Response:<br>Decentralized identity systems empower users by ensuring they maintain control over their personal data. Through DIDs, users can effectively manage who has access to their data and under what conditions. For instance, they could grant a fitness app access to their workout data without exposing other sensitive health information. This selective sharing mechanism, enforced through blockchain technology, ensures data privacy and security by&nbsp;design.</p> The Exploitation of Sensitive Data <p>The potential for exploiting personal data collected by wearables for commercial gain is a pressing issue. Without stringent controls, companies could misuse this data, affecting user privacy and autonomy.</p><p>Decentralized Identity Response:<br>Implementing DIDs can safeguard against such exploitation. By using encryption and blockchain, each user’s data remains securely under their control, accessible only through permissions that they can grant or revoke at any time. This approach not only secures data against unauthorized access but also provides a transparent record of who accesses the data and for what&nbsp;purpose.</p> Enhanced AI Capabilities and Privacy&nbsp;Risks <p>As AI integrates more deeply with wearable technologies, the scope for analyzing this data expands, leading to enhanced capabilities but also increased privacy&nbsp;risks.</p><p>Decentralized Identity Response:<br>DIDs can mitigate these risks by enabling the creation of anonymized datasets that AI algorithms can process without accessing directly identifiable information. This allows users to benefit from advanced AI applications in their devices while their identity and personal data remain protected.</p> Addressing Emerging Technologies <p>With wearable technologies becoming capable of more deeply intrusive monitoring — such as tracking brain activity or emotional states — the need for robust privacy safeguards becomes even more critical.</p><p>Decentralized Identity Response:<br>The flexibility of DIDs is key here. They allow users to set specific, context-based permissions for data access, which is essential for technologies that monitor highly sensitive physiological and mental data. Users can ensure that their most personal data is shared only when absolutely necessary and only with entities they trust explicitly.</p> Conclusion: Empowering Users Through Decentralized Identity <p>The integration of wearable technology into our daily lives must be approached with a strong emphasis on maintaining and enhancing user privacy. Decentralized identity offers a powerful tool to achieve this by putting control back in the hands of users, thus enabling a future where technology serves humanity without compromising individual privacy.</p><p>As we move forward, it is crucial for policymakers, technology developers, and consumers to come together to support the adoption of decentralized identity solutions. By fostering an environment where privacy is valued and protected, we can ensure that the advancements in wearable technology will enhance our lives without endangering our personal information.</p> Join Us in Shaping the Future with Decentralized Identity <p>Interested in solving the complex privacy challenges such as those posed by wearable technology?

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Alejandro Leal</a></p>The concept of Zero Trust is based on the assumption that any network is always hostile, and thus, any IT system, application, or user is constantly exposed to potential external and internal threats. This Zero Trust philosophy has become increasingly relevant as organizations grapple with the proliferation of remote work, cloud adoption, and the growing sophistication of cyber threats. Within Zero Trust, the concept of ZTNA (Zero Trust Network Access) plays a central role.

  Combating deepfakes and misinformation is commonly framed as an arms race, constantly one-upping each other for more realistic attacks and more sophisticated detection. But is this a game that really needs to be played? Rather than escalating competition, is it possible to disarm deepfakes? Decentralized identity is all about establishing a chain of trust for transactions, building the foundation for proving identity and content authenticity. Is it possible that decentralized systems can fundamentally negate the risk that deepfakes pose?

			<p>Luxembourg, 25 April 2024 – Capital markets technology firms <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, a leader in tokenization technology for capital markets assets, and <a href="https://globacap.com/">Globacap</a>, a world leader in the automation of private markets operational workflow, have partnered to expand the DINO Network and transform the distribution landscape for tokenized private assets.</p>
<p>Private capital markets have witnessed robust growth over the past decade, surpassing global public markets’ expansion by 1.7 times. Tokenization has emerged as a key enabler of accessibility, efficiency, transparency, and liquidity for the private market by providing a unified and programmable infrastructure.</p>
<p>One of the key challenges in tokenized private assets distribution is enforcing post-issuance compliance and ensuring interoperability with distribution platforms. ERC-3643, the token standard for tokenized securities, addresses these issues by restricting token interactions to eligible users while maintaining compatibility with applications supporting ERC-20 tokens.</p>
<p>Globacap is now part of the DINO Network initiative, an interoperable distribution network for digital securities leveraging the ERC-3643 token standard, to expand the reach of its marketplace. Tokeny acts as a connector provider between Globacap and the DINO Network. Combined with Globacap’s workflow automation software, this partnership aims to bring public market-like efficiency to private markets, enabling greater execution capabilities in secondary markets, streamlining workflows, and ensuring robust record integrity.</p>
<p>Globacap digitizes the workflow and execution across the entire private markets journey, from primary raises through vehicle and investor management and the execution and settlement of secondary transactions. Its technology has been used to host over 150+ primary placements, digitize over $20bn in investment vehicles, and execute and settle over $600m in secondary transactions of private assets.</p>
<p>Tokeny, with six years of experience in tokenization and €28 billion in assets tokenized, is the initial creator of the ERC-3643 standard, advancing market standardization in tokenization. After having built a robust tokenization engine for financial institutions, Tokeny is now helping the ecosystem to build blockchain-based distribution rails.</p>

		 
	 
    The DINO Network leverages ERC-3643 to enhance liquidity by ensuring compliance and interoperability across platforms. Together with leading platforms like Globacap, we are revolutionizing private markets distribution, making it efficient, transparent, and liquid.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny       Despite the size and importance of private markets which have over $13 trillion AUM, for years they have lacked the infrastructure and transparency necessary for efficient transactions. Globacap provides rails that accelerate transaction capability in private markets while significantly reducing operational overheads. The combination of our offering with Tokeny is immense and will help to drive private markets innovation and growth forward.  Myles MilstonCo-founder and CEO of Globacap

             April 2024   
	 
		 
			 BlackRock’s Influence and the Future of MMFs 

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p>In the world of finance, innovation acceleration often requires the endorsement of industry giants. BlackRock’s embrace of Tokenized Money Market Funds (MMFs) represents a monumental milestone towards the widespread adoption of tokenized securities.&nbsp;This drives financial institutions to kick off the tokenization of real use cases,&nbsp;fueled by a touch of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out).</p>
<p>By leveraging public blockchains, BlackRock not only demonstrates the viability of blockchain technology in finance but also sets the stage for a transformative shift towards decentralized and open financial solutions. This instills greater confidence in&nbsp;institutions to embrace public blockchains.</p>
<p>Furthermore, BlackRock’s BUIDL fund successfully attracted $245 million in its first week of operations, underscoring&nbsp;the robust appetite from the buy side. This success also indicates the appeal of the&nbsp;24/7/365 availability, a compelling feature for tokenized forms of highly liquid assets like MMFs. For instance, Ondo Finance’s OUSG (Ondo Short-Term US Government Treasuries) token, previously limited to traditional market hours with a T+2 subscription and redemption time, now allows&nbsp;instant settlement&nbsp;by moving $95 million of assets to BlackRock’s BUIDL.</p>
<p>In addition, prominent&nbsp;players in the web3 space are starting to create solutions to support tokenized funds. For example, Circle’s latest smart contract feature allows BUIDL holders to exchange shares for its stablecoin USDC, enabling effortless 24/7 transfers on the secondary market.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, BlackRock initially utilized only one specific marketplace for tokenized MMFs distribution, whereas the future vision for tokenized MMFs and other securities extends far beyond singular centralized platforms.&nbsp;The next frontier is broader distribution across diverse trading platforms and DeFi protocols. As a result, tokenized MMFs can be distributed to any distributor platform and serve as collateral for lending smart contracts or liquidity pool deposits within automated market makers, unlocking accessibility, utility, and ultimately liquidity.</p>
<p>Enabling this expansion requires advanced smart contracts and robust token standards such as&nbsp;ERC-3643 to ensure compliance at the token level. Excitingly, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.erc3643.org/history-of-erc-3643?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ULLY8IV_FhOkMaU2j1GgvwNrhbxwy1OzBIqBbHcxflZYck_CIvRS9tWNT-sexvatm4D7T">ERC-3643 standard has gained significant traction&nbsp;</a>through the push of the community-formed non-profit association. For several years at Tokeny and now with the association, we’ve had the privilege of presenting this standard to several regulators, including the SEC (US), CSSF (Luxembourg), BaFin (Germany), DFSA (Dubai), FSRA (Abu Dhabi), and MAS (Singapore). More and more, the framework’s ability to uphold existing security laws is now recognized globally.</p>
<p>With the market readiness and industry-wise recognition of the standard, top-tier institutions are now approaching us for assistance in tokenizing MMFs. Last month, we announced our partnership with&nbsp;<a href="https://tokeny.com/moreliquid-partners-with-tokeny-to-tokenize-hsbc-euro-liquidity-fund/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_ULLY8IV_FhOkMaU2j1GgvwNrhbxwy1OzBIqBbHcxflZYck_CIvRS9tWNT-sexvatm4D7T">Moreliquid to tokenize the HSBC Euro Liquidity Fund using ERC-3643</a>. This is just beginning, and we’re excited to share major announcements with the market very soon. Stay tuned for more updates!</p>

<p></p> 
<p>Virtual private networks (VPNs) form a staple of the modern work environment. VPNs provide an essential layer of protection for employees working remotely or across multiple office locations, encrypting data traffic to stop hackers from intercepting and stealing information. Usage of VPNs skyrocketed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and remains high — 77% of employees use VPN for their work nearly every day, according to the 2023 VPN Risk Report by Zscaler.</p> 
<p>Their widespread popularity has put VPNs squarely in the crosshairs of malicious actors. The recent ransomware attack on UnitedHealth Group, which disrupted payments to U.S. doctors and healthcare facilities nationwide for a month, has now been linked to compromised credentials on a remote system access application. This follows on the heels of a large-scale brute force attack campaign against multiple remote access VPN services, reported by Cisco Talos.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, these attacks are not an anomaly. The VPN Risk Report found that 45% of organizations experienced at least one attack that exploited VPN vulnerabilities in the last 12 months. So what can organizations do to protect this vulnerable gateway? Here we’ll cover the top VPN security best practices every organization should follow.</p> 
 How Does a VPN Work?  
<p>A VPN creates an encrypted connection between a user’s device and the organization’s network via the internet. Using a VPN, companies can grant remote employees access to internal applications and systems, or establish a unified network across multiple office sites or environments.</p> 
<p>An employee typically initiates a VPN connection through a client application installed on their device, connecting to a VPN server hosted within the organization. This connection creates a secure "tunnel" that encrypts all data transmitted between the employee's device and the corporate network. With the VPN connection established, the user's device is virtually part of the organization's internal network and the employee can access internal applications, databases, file shares, and other resources that are typically only accessible within the corporate network. Authentication between VPN clients and servers occurs through the exchange of digital certificates and credentials, with multi-factor authentication (MFA) a means to provide an additional layer of security.</p> 
<p>While VPNs provide some measure of remote access security, they also make a soft target for attackers. Moreover, VPN attacks pose an outsized risk — once attackers gain entry through a VPN, they often get direct access to&nbsp; a broad swath of an organization's networks and data.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
 Common VPN Attack Vectors  
<p>Before we explore VPN security best practices, it’s important to understand how attackers exploit system vulnerabilities to gain access.</p> 
 Authentication-Related Attacks  
<p>Attacks on VPNs often revolve around authentication and credential-related weaknesses. These include:</p> 
  
  Credential Theft and Brute Force Attacks: Attackers target VPN credentials through phishing, keylogging malware, or brute force techniques to gain unauthorized access.  
  Session Hijacking: Hijacking active VPN sessions by stealing session cookies or exploiting session management vulnerabilities allows attackers to impersonate users and access VPN-protected resources.  
  Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks: Exploiting weak authentication or compromised certificates, attackers intercept and manipulate VPN traffic to eavesdrop or modify data.  
  
 Vulnerability Exploits  
<p>Security flaws in VPN solutions themselves are another common route of attack. A recent analysis by Securin showed that the number of vulnerabilities discovered in VPN products increased 875% between 2020 and 2024. Hackers exploit vulnerabilities in VPN client software or server-side VPN components to gain unauthorized access to VPN endpoints. This can lead to complete compromise of the endpoint or enable attackers to intercept VPN traffic. In fact, the Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA) itself was recently breached by hackers exploiting vulnerabilities in the agency’s VPN systems.</p> 
 Five VPN Security Best Practices  
<p>With the growing assault on VPNs, organizations must adopt proactive security strategies to protect this major point of vulnerability. The following measures are recommended best practices to strengthen your VPN security posture.</p> 
 Regularly Update VPN Software and Components  
<p>Patch management is crucial for maintaining a secure VPN infrastructure. Regularly update VPN client software, servers, gateways, and routers with the latest security patches and firmware to mitigate vulnerabilities and defend against emerging threats. Establish procedures for emergency patching to promptly address critical vulnerabilities and ensure the ongoing security of your VPN environment.</p> 
 Deploy Multi-Factor Authentication  
<p>As one of the primary avenues of attacks on VPN, strong authentication protocols are critical. The remote access application that was breached In the UHG attack lacked multi-factor authentication controls. Massive leaks of stolen credentials, and crude but effective techniques such as password spraying and credential stuffing, make it trivial for attackers to gain entry to VPN when only a username and password stand in the way. Organizations should deploy, at the very least, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-secure-is-mfa">multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA). MFA challenges users to provide something they own (OTP, device, security key) or something they are (face scan, fingerprint) in addition to or instead of something they know (password, PIN).&nbsp;</p> 
 Make It Phishing-Resistant MFA  
<p>VPN security is vastly improved by using passwordless authentication methods that completely remove shared secrets. This makes it impossible for attackers to guess or steal authentication factors and much harder to spoof identity. Specifically, passwordless authentication based on <a href="https://www.hypr.com/resources/guide-fido-authentication">FIDO standards</a> provides robust defense against phishing, <a href="https://blog.hypr.com/how-to-prevent-man-in-the-middle-attacks">man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks</a> and hacking attempts by eliminating insecure methods like SMS or OTPs. Moreover, since it’s based on public-key cryptography, it ensures there are no server-side shared secrets vulnerable to theft in case of a breach.</p> 
 Implement Access Control and Least Privilege:  
<p>Apply granular access control policies to restrict VPN access based on user roles, groups, or individual permissions. Ensure that users have access only to the resources necessary for their job functions (principle of least privilege), reducing the impact of potential insider threats or compromised credentials.</p> 
 Regularly Monitor and Audit VPN Traffic  
<p>Enable logging and monitoring of VPN traffic to detect suspicious activities, anomalies, or potential security incidents. Regularly review VPN logs and conduct security audits to identify unauthorized access attempts, unusual patterns, or compliance deviations. This proactive approach helps maintain visibility into VPN usage and ensures prompt response to security incidents.</p> 
<p>Leverage known IOCs, shared with the community as well by other vendors. VPN-oriented IOCs usually contain source IPs and Hosting providers which you can block.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Monitor logs for employee login behavior changes such as location changes (outside of normal locations for your business), login attempts outside regular business hours, as well as attempts with invalid username and password combinations.</p> 
 Strengthen Your VPN Security With HYPR  
<p>Despite the security concerns, VPNs are not going away any time soon. Adhering to VPN security best practices mitigates the technology’s vulnerabilities to safeguard your employees, systems and data. The most essential defense step is to deploy strong authentication systems. And the most robust systems completely remove passwords and all shared secrets from their VPN authentication.</p>

  <p>We hear much about AI these days, but AI would be of little use without data to power it. Without a good data input the results form AI will disappoint. All businesses generate valuable data from day-to-day activities, much of it unstructured – that is to say it resides inside office documents, PDFs, email inboxes and social media. This type of data already outstrips traditional structured data to be found in database applications, but most organizations have little idea of what or where this data lies. That stuff tends to be already ordered and listed but even here, organizations can benefit from governance to stratify this data further. Such Data Governance platforms exist to do this and make sense of unstructured data too. The best Data Governance platforms will not just make sense of data but reveal if privacy laws are being violated or data has passed the point of being useful. But the real value is when you apply Data Governance to &nbsp;your business goals.</p>
<p>Paul Fisher is a Lead Analyst at KuppingerCole and author of the Leadership Compass report on Data Governance platforms. In this webinar he will explain the growing importance of data governance and how it will assist both business AI and Identity tools in the future. Paul will show this market is characterized by continuous technological advancements and evolving regulatory landscapes. He will take you through some of the key findings of the Leadership Compass and how you can use it to find a Data Governance solution to fit your business needs and how a Data Governance Architecture Blueprint can help maintain data integrity and create business value from any Data Governance platform.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/data-governance"></a>

  The minimum threshold for the FATF Travel Rule in Indonesia is set at USD 1,000, but transactions below this amount still require collecting basic information about the sender and recipient.  Crypto firms in Indonesia must undergo a regulatory sandbox evaluation starting next year, and those failing to comply will be deemed illegal operators.  Indonesia is transitioning its crypto industry regulation from Bappebti to OJK by 2025, aiming to align with international standards and improve consumer protection and education.  <p>Indonesia, the world’s fourth-most populous nation, is also one of the largest cryptocurrency markets globally. In February 2024, it recorded IDR 30 trillion ($1.92 billion) in crypto transactions, and the number of registered crypto investors hit 19 million, according to Bappebti.</p><p>Considering crypto’s growing popularity, the Indonesian government has been taking active steps over the past few years towards crypto regulation, including adopting <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">the FATF Travel&nbsp;Rule</a>.</p> ‍Background of Crypto Travel Rule in Indonesia <p>‍In 2021, Indonesia adopted international FATF standards to enhance the prevention and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/aml-and-kyc-compliance-in-crypto-industry">eradication of money laundering and terrorism financing</a> in the crypto&nbsp;sector.</p><p>Then, in April 2023, <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/publications/Mutualevaluations/MER-Indonesia-2023.html">the FATF assessment of the country’s request</a> for FATF membership found that Indonesia has a robust legal framework to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.</p><p>However, it noted that more needs to be done to improve asset recovery, risk-based supervision, and proportionate and dissuasive sanctions.</p><p>The report further noted that virtual asset service providers (VASPs) have taken steps to implement their obligations but are still in the early stages of implementing AML/CFT requirements.</p> ‍Key Features of Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>‍Crypto transactions above a certain threshold on exchanges registered with Bappebti must comply with the rules requiring the obtaining and sharing of specific sender and recipient information.</p><p>Under Indonesia’s APU and PPT (Anti-Money Laundering and Prevention of Terrorism Financing) programs, a crypto business must meet certain requirements, such&nbsp;as:</p>  Appoint an MLRO or money laundering reporting officer  Developing and implementing internal AML&nbsp;policies  Conduct regular risk assessments.  <p>Moreover, a crypto business&nbsp;must:</p>  Conduct Customer Due Diligence (CDD), which involves collecting and verifying information (customer’s name, address, and other personal&nbsp;data)  Assess associated risks  Conduct Simplified Due Diligence (SDD) and Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD), where applicable.  <p>In addition, crypto businesses are also required to monitor transactions, conduct sanctions screening, report suspicious activity and transactions, and keep&nbsp;records.</p> ‍Compliance Requirements <p>‍In accordance with international standards, Indonesia applies a minimum threshold of USD 1,000 (1,62,15,400 Indonesian Rupiah) for the FATF Travel Rule. However, transactions worth less than USD 1,000 are not entirely excluded, and certain information must still be collected:</p>  Name of both the sender and recipient  The wallet address of both the sender and recipient  <p>For any transactions equivalent to $1000 or more than this amount, the information to be collected is:</p>  Name  Residential address  Wallet address  Identification document  <p>Indonesian citizens must provide identity cards, while foreign nationals must provide passports and identity cards issued by their country of origin or a Limited Stay Permit Card (KITAS) in the case of Crypto Asset Customers (KITAP).</p><p>The recipients, on the other hand, must&nbsp;provide:</p>  Name  Residential address  Wallet address   Global Context <p>‍In its report earlier this month, the FATF noted that <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/almost-70-of-all-fatf-assessed-countries-have-implemented-the-crypto-travel-rule">nearly 70% of its member jurisdictions globally have adopted the FATF Travel Rule</a>. It said that the likes of <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-the-united-states">the US</a>, Austria, France, Germany, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/comprehensive-guide-to-crypto-regulations-and-fatf-travel-rule-in-singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-crypto-travel-rule-compliance-in-japan">Japan</a>, and <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-canada">Canada</a> have fully embraced the Crypto Travel Rule with proper checks and systems in&nbsp;place.</p><p>Meanwhile, Indonesia is among Mexico, Malaysia, Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina, working towards fully adhering to the FATF recommendations. <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/a-guide-to-travel-rule-compliance-in-malaysia">Malaysia</a>, Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina are working towards fully adhering to the FATF recommendations.</p> ‍Concluding Thoughts <p>‍Crypto regulation in Indonesia is rapidly evolving, with authorities updating the regulatory framework to clarify rules and incorporate a sandbox approach for testing products.</p><p>As crypto adoption grows in Indonesia, these regulatory changes, including adherence to the Crypto Travel Rule, aim to manage the expanding market while maintaining compliance with international standards.</p><p>However, all stakeholders, including the government and Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs), must ensure that these regulations have minimal impact on end&nbsp;users.</p> ‍FAQs  ‍Q1: What is the minimum transaction threshold for the FATF Travel Rule in Indonesia? <p>The minimum transaction threshold for the FATF Travel Rule in Indonesia is USD 1,000. However, certain sender and recipient information still needs to be collected for transactions below this&nbsp;amount.</p><p>For transactions exceeding the USD 1,000 threshold, Indonesian citizens must provide their identity cards, while foreign nationals are required to present passports and identity cards issued by their country of origin or a Limited Stay Permit Card (KITAS) in the case of Crypto Asset Customers (KITAP).</p> ‍About Veriscope <p>‍<a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">‍Veriscope</a>, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>I was delighted to appear on the latest <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nabdigitalnext/talking-digital-id-and-verifiable-credentials-with-stephen-wilson">NAB Digital Next podcast</a> in conversation with Alysia Abeyratne, NAB Senior Manager for Digital Policy. We drilled into the history of verifiable credentials and the recent awareness that identification doesn’t need so much identity.<br>
Hence NAB’s terminology has switched from “digital identity” to Digital ID — something that’s much more familiar and concrete.</p>
<p>NAB realises that identification processes need better data — IDs and credentials from the real world packaged in improved digital formats that make them more reliable online than plaintext IDs, and less vulnerable to theft.</p>
<p>The Australian federal government’s Digital ID Bill embodies this paradigm shift.</p>
<p>Individuals don’t need new numbers or any new “digital identity”; they need better ways to handle their existing IDs online. And it’s exactly the same with businesses; the best digital technologies conserve the rules and relationships that are working well in the analogue world.</p>
<p>After reviewing the historical language of “digital identity” and the state of the art in verifiable credentials, I went on to discuss how better verification of all important data is an urgent need, in the broader context of AI and the wicked problems of Deep Fakes.</p>
<p>Here are some edited extracts from the podcast.</p>
 Some History 
<p>At the dawn of ecommerce, in 1995, Australia was leading in e-signatures, e-authentication and PKI (public key infrastructure) even before we were buying much online. Around then Australia passed its technology neutral electronic signature law.</p>
<p>PKI was dominated by Defence thinking thanks to national security perspectives. Led to onerous operational standards, some still with us today in TDIF.</p>
<p>Trying to help people think about new digital concepts, we had naive metaphors for identity, such as “passports”, which we hoped would let us freely go around cyberspace and prove who we are. It turned out to be really hard to have a general-purpose proof of identity.</p>
<p>About 15 years ago, the digital industry got a little more focused, by looking at specific assertions, attributes and claims. These boil down to what do you need to know about somebody, from application to application.</p>
<p>And what do you need to know about a credential?</p>
 Verifiable Credentials and What Do You Really Need to Know? 
<p>Sophisticated verifiable credentials today let you know where a credential has come from, reference its terms and conditions, and can even convey how a credential has been carried (so we can tell the difference, for example, between device-bound Passkeys and synced Passkeys).</p>
<p>Instead of identity, we can ask better design questions, about the specifics that enable us to transact with others. When it’s important and you can’t rely on trust, then you need to know where a counterparty’s credentials have come from.</p>
<p>Provenance matters for devices too and data in general. The subjects of verifiable credentials can be non-humans, or indeed intangible items such as data records.</p>
<p>In almost all cases, we need to ask: Where does a subject come from? How do you know that a subject is fit for purpose? And where will you get these quality signals?</p>
<p>The same design thinking pattern recurs throughout digital credentials, the Internet of Things, software supply chains, and artificial intelligence. We need data in everything we do, and we need to know the story behind the data.</p>
 The importance of language 
<p>We habitually talk about “identity” but what do you really need to know about somebody?</p>
<p>When put it like that, we all know intuitively that the less you know about me, the better!</p>
<p>Technically that’s called data minimisation. In privacy law, it’s sometimes called purpose specification; in security it’s the good old need-to-know principle.</p>
<p>What do you really need to know about me? It’s almost never my identity, as we saw at the first <a href="https://news.nab.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NAB-Digital-Identity-Roundtable.pdf">NAB roundtable (PDF)</a>.</p>
<p>So, if identity is not necessarily our objective, we should not call this thing “digital identity”. It’s as simple as that.</p>
 Digital identity makes uneven progress 
<p>The Digital Identity field is infamously slow moving.&nbsp; The latest Australian legislation is the third iteration in four years, and the government’s <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lockstep-TDIF-DTA-Submission-171020.pdf">“Trusted Digital Identity Framework” (TDIF) dates back to 2016 (PDF)</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve made Digital Identity hard by using bad metaphors – <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/remember-that-digital-identity-is-a-metaphor">especially “identity” itself</a>. There is wider appreciation now that the typical things we need to know online about people (and many other subjects) is not “identity” but instead it’s credentials, specific properties, facts and figures.</p>
<p>But meanwhile we have made great progress on verifiable credentials standards and solutions. White label verifiable credentials are emerging; the data structures can be customised to an enterprise’s needs, issued in bulk from a cloud service, and loaded into different digital wallets and devices.</p>
<p>Enterprises will be able to <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/magnetic-stripe-cards-and-verifiable-credentials">convert their employee IDs from analogue to digital</a>; colleges and training organisations will do the same for student IDs and qualifications. The result will be better security and privacy as users become able to prove exactly what they need to know about each other in specific contexts.</p>
 Governance of Digital ID and beyond 
<p>A major potential game changer is happening at home in Australia. The Digital ID Bill and resulting Australian Government Digital ID System (AGDIS) makes the problem simpler by making the objective smaller. Instead of any new and unfamiliar “digital identity”, AGDIS conserves the IDs we are used to, and introduces a governance regime for digitising them.</p>
<p>The IDs we are familiar with are just database indexes. And we should conserve that. The Australian Digital ID Bill recognises that ID ecosystems exist and we should be able to govern the digitising of IDs in a more secure way. So, the AGDIS is a more careful response to the notorious data breaches in recent years.</p>
 The plaintext problem 
<p>The real problem exposed by data breaches is the way we all use plaintext data.</p>
<p>Consider my driver licence number. That ID comprises six numbers and two letters, normally conveyed on a specially printed card, and codifies the fact I am licensed to drive by the state of New South Wales. My status as a driver in turn is a proxy for my good standing in official government systems, so it has become a token of my existence in the community. Along with a few other common “ID documents” the driver licence has become part of a quasi-standard <a href="https://lockstep.com.au/the-goal-is-identification-not-an-identity/">grammar of identification</a>.</p>
<p>Historically, IDs are presented in person; the photo on a licence card proves the credential belongs to the person presenting it. Relative to the core ID, the photo is a type of metadata; it provides an extra layer of evidence that associates the ID with the holder.</p>
<p>When we moved identification online, we maintained the grammar but we lost the supporting metadata. Online, businesses ask for a driver’s licence number but have none of the traditional signals about the quality of the ID. Simply knowing and quoting an ID doesn’t prove anything; it’s what geeks call a “shared secret”, and after a big data breach, it’s not much of a secret anymore.</p>
<p>Yet our only response to data breaches is to change the IDs and reissue everybody’s driver’s licences. The new plaintext is just as vulnerable as it was before. It’s ridiculous.</p>
<p>But let’s look carefully at the problem.</p>
<p>The driver licence as a proxy for one’s standing is still valid; the licence does provide good evidence that a certain human being physically exists. But knowing the ID number is meaningless. We need to move away from plaintext presentation of IDs — as Lockstep submitted to the government in the <a href="https://www.digitalidentity.gov.au/sites/default/files/2023-11/lockstep_consulting.pdf">2023 consultations on Digital ID legislation</a>.</p>
<p>Crucially, some 15 years ago, banks did just that. The banks transitioned from magnetic stripe credit cards, which encode cardholder data as plaintext, to chip cards.</p>
<p>The chip card is actually a verifiable credential, albeit a special purpose one, dedicated to conveying account details. In a chip card, the credit card number is digitally signed by the issuing bank, and furthermore, every time you dip your card or tap it on a merchant terminal, the purchase details are countersigned by the chip.</p>
<p>Alternatively, when you use a digital wallet, a special secure chip in your mobile phone does the same thing: it countersigns the purchase to prove that the real card cardholder was in control.</p>
 Mimicking modern credit card security for Digital IDs 
<p>That’s the pattern that we now need to pivot from plaintext IDs to verifiable IDs.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/">Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC)</a> has the role of Digital ID regulator. As it did with another important digital regime, the <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/by-industry/banking-and-finance/the-consumer-data-right">Consumer Data Right (CDR)</a>, the ACCC is expected now to convene technical working groups to develop detailed rules and adopt standards for governing Digital ID.</p>
<p>If the rules adopt hardware-based digital wallets and verifiable credentials, then the presentation of any ID can be as secure, private and simple as a modern payment card. That will be a true game changer.</p>

				  From managing deepfakes to creating reusable KYC, decentralized identity’s ability to easily implement verifiable identity and data without direct integration provides a powerful path for improved efficiency, better fraud protection, and a new level of personalized account service and data privacy.  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks Indicio will look at how decentralized identity and verifiable credential technology can transform banking and finance. The unique way this technology handles authentication — such as the identity of an account holder — is a powerful solution to the challenges of identity fraud, while also being a better way to manage customer experience (no more passwords, no need for multi-factor authentication).</p>
<p>But it doesn’t stop there —&nbsp;we can authoritatively know who we are talking to online, and verify the integrity of their data, leading to seamless operational processes and providing a starting point for creating better products and services.</p>
<p>Here’s a taste of what we’ll be looking at.</p>
<p>Re-use costly KYC</p>
<p>To open a checking account at most banks, you need to provide <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040715/what-should-you-bring-bank-open-checking-account.asp#:~:text=To%20open%20a%20checking%20account%2C%20you%20must%20provide%20government-issued,types%20may%20require%20additional%20information">government-issued identification with your photo, your Social Security card or Taxpayer Identification Number, and proof of your address.</a> Gathering this information can be difficult, time consuming, and frustrating. KYC can take anywhere from 24 hours to <a href="https://appian.com/learn/topics/know-your-customer-process/kyc-in-banking-explained.html">three weeks</a>, and costs the average bank <a href="https://seon.io/resources/cost-of-kyc/#:~:text=Here%20are%20their%20key%20findings,bank%20%2460%20million%20per%20year">$60 million per year.</a></p>
<p>How many times should you need to do this? Once, with a verifiable credential. And once you’ve done it the information can easily be shared both internally and with partners, resulting in smoother workflows and more opportunities for customers.</p>
<p>Fraud</p>
<p>In 2023, <a href="https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/identity-theft-credit-card-fraud-statistics/">145,206 cases of bank fraud</a> were reported in the US alone. But the headline loss of money isn’t the only problem here: For every $1 lost to fraud, <a href="https://bankingjournal.aba.com/2022/11/survey-finds-fraud-costs-rising-for-banks/#:~:text=The%20cost%20of%20fighting%20fraud,today%20by%20LexisNexis%20Risk%20Solutions">$4.36 is lost in related expenses</a>, such as legal fees and recovery. This means that the estimated <a href="https://seon.io/resources/global-banking-fraud-index/#h-costs-of-fraud">$1.6 billion</a> lost to fraudulent payments in 2022 cost almost $7 billion.</p>
<p>Decentralized identity provides a better way to tackle this — and it doesn’t require banks to embark on a massive new IAM system.</p>
<p>Phishing</p>
<p>Phishing happens when you think the email or SMS message you just received is from your bank and you absolutely must login to the link provided or face disaster. It works. <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/articles/s/the-history-of-phishing/#:~:text=The%202020%20Verizon%20Data%20Breach,of%20the%20COVID-19%20pandemic">22% of all data breaches involve phishing</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll explain how verifiable credentials provide a way for you to always know —&nbsp;and know for certain — that you are talking to your bank and, if you are the bank, that you’re talking to a real customer.</p>
<p>Frictionless processes keep customers coming back</p>
<p><a href="https://worldretailbankingreport.com/resources/baas-platform-model-is-the-way-forward/">44% of consumers</a> face medium to high friction when engaging with their digital banking platform. This means that almost half of people trying to access online banking have a hard time, and with friction being attributed as the cause for<a href="https://fractal.ai/removing-friction-from-your-digital-banking-experience/"> 70% of abandoned digital journeys</a>, customers are very likely to give up and leave if they face frustration.</p>
<p>We’ll explain how verifiable credentials save customers (and you) from the costs of friction.</p>
<p>Passwordless Login</p>
<p>No one likes passwords. They are the universal pain point of digital experience. And that pain can be costly: <a href="https://www.goodfirms.co/resources/top-password-strengths-and-vulnerabilities">30% of users have experienced a data breach due to weak passwords</a>. Verifiable credentials make all this go away and enable seamless, passwordless login. Imagine, never having to remember or recreate a password again or follow up with multi factor authentication.</p>
<p>We’ll also look at improving financial inclusion and crystal ball the near future —&nbsp;simplified payments, countering buyback fraud and verifiable credentials for credit cards.</p>

			 What is and what is the purpose of digital signature software 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>An electronic signature software is a tool that allows documents and contracts to be digitally signed with full legal validity, manage all signing processes, and affix time stamps to multiple files and folders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By using digital signature software, individuals, professionals and companies can manage signature processes using the latest cryptographic technologies, which guarantee the authenticity and integrity of the document and ensure that it is not subsequently altered by unauthorized modifications. Its use is now widespread due to its ability to facilitate operations and processes that would otherwise require more time and resources. In fact, digital signature applications make it possible to digitize, automate and speed up processes, avoiding the use of paper and decreasing Co2 emissions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Using e-signature software it is possible to sign agreements, transactions, contracts and business documents by managing approval and signing processes more efficiently. These digital solutions also streamline and optimize workflows, eliminating costs related to document printing, mailing and paper filing.</p>						 
				 
				 
				 
			 How electronic signature software works 		 
				 
				 
				 
							<p>These IT solutions integrate advanced encryption and authentication technologies that ensure the security and legal validity of signatures affixed to documents. Initially, it is necessary to choose a signature certificate (simple, advanced, or qualified), which guarantees the identity of the signer and the authenticity of his or her signature.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After completing the personal identity recognition required to obtain the digital certificate, and after installing the electronic signature software, the user follows an authentication procedure, often based on a combination of username, password, and sometimes additional identifying factors. From this point, e-signature software can be used on one’s device: the user loads a document into the software and signs it using the chosen digital certificate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These IT solutions allow documents to be signed in electronic formats (PDF, P7M or XML) and can vary depending on the operating system or the specific needs of the user. In addition, a time stamp can be affixed, providing proof of the exact moment the document was signed, offering an additional level of security and reliability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cutting-edge e-signature software includes features dedicated to document organization, integration with enterprise cloud storage and ERP services, and management of deadlines, urgencies and notification modes. One example is InfoCert’s <a href="https://infocert.digital/gosign/">GoSign</a> the advanced, easy-to-use electronic signature platform that enables the digitization of transactions and approval processes while ensuring the full legal value of signed documents.</p>

 In Fluctuo’s recent European Shared Mobility Annual Review, in which IDnow sponsored and contributed, three significant trends are revealed as to what is driving mobility as seen through city and operator movements based on data collected from 115 European cities. 



<p>One could say 2023 was the year of unexpected surprise within the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/">mobility industry</a> after the <a href="https://www.euronews.com/next/2023/09/01/electric-scooters-what-are-the-rules-across-europe-and-where-are-injuries-highest#:~:text=Bidding%20au%20revoir%20to%20what,the%20first%20to%20adopt%20them.">Paris e-scooter ban</a> turned many heads and required not only cities across Europe but operators as well to re-consider their services and plans. The <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/francois-hoehlinger-the-future-of-micromobility/">Paris ban kicked off a tightening of regulations</a> across Europe within the mobility sector causing cities such as Rome, Berlin and Brussels to significantly reduce the number of operators and e-scooters.</p>



<p>However, before these changes started taking effect, e-scooters were the favorite among <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/safety-shared-mobility-driver-license-verification/">shared mobility</a> services. Between 2019-2022, Fluctuo reported that e-scooters lead the market during this time, overshadowing the use of bikes. But now, the tables, or should we say direction, has turned.</p>



<p>Seeing the need to change direction, within shared and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/micromobility-and-the-future-of-transportation/">micromobility</a> services, both users and operators headed toward the next-best, and perhaps healthier, mode of transport—bicycles.</p>

 Are bikes the new e-scooters? 



<p>With the need to enter new markets, operators spun their wheels and put more time and effort into new offers, specifically dockless bikes. And their efforts were not in vain. 2023 saw dockless bike fleets up 50% and ridership up 54% compared to previous yeas in which e-scooters dominated the market. And it wasn’t only dockless bikes which saw an increase in usage but station-based bikes as well.</p>



<p>The after-effects from Paris made scooter operators realize that city authorities prefer shared bikes rather than e-scooters. This was clearly seen as the city of Paris topped the list at 45 million for station-based bike ridership and came in second after London for dockless bikes. Though it may seem that the two services should complement one another rather than compete, it would appear that dockless bikes are the preferred choice. Despite this, <a href="https://www.here.com/learn/blog/dockless-scooters-bikes">both bike services</a> are expected to grow in 2024, with station-based bikes growing more steadily perhaps due to more affordable end-user pricing.</p>



<p>Even though bike sharing is picking up in Northern Europe, that does not mean scooters have been kicked to the curb. On the contrary, the popularity of scooters remains and grows in Eastern Europe.</p>



 I feel the need, the need for… reduction. 



<p>Okay, it may not have been what you were thinking but unfortunately speed is not the answer here. After Paris decided to go forward with banning e-scooters, many did not know how it would affect other major cities. Most probably thought that it would create a domino effect and other cities would follow suit, banning <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/age-verification-electric-scooters/">e-scooters</a> left and right. But this did not come to pass.</p>



<p>Instead, other cities decided to cut scooter fleet sizes rather than banning them completely. This however, was felt on the operator side who went into survival mode. Seeing the need to make smart economic decisions in order to stay in the game, mobility operators had to reduce costs, exit markets (i.e. scooters) and in some cases merge with another operator as seen with <a href="https://ridedott.com/press-release/tier-dott-merger/">Tier and Dott</a>. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/mobility-travel-reflections-2023/">Consolidation became the name of the game</a>.</p>



<p>Now, with the limited number of spots available in cities for scooter operators, companies must appeal in order to stay active or risk the chance of not being able to operate in that location any longer.</p>



<p>But despite what sounds like grim news, the scooter fleets that have been reduced in major cities due to these new regulations are being moved to smaller cities and other cities without a number cap, resulting in fleet sizes remaining stable. Even better is the fact that fleets have grown 33% in Eastern Europe with Poland being an exceptionally large market for scooters.</p>



 Sharing is caring. 



<p>Bikes and scooters were not the only shared services that saw changes last year. Mopeds, for example, faced challenges due to cases of vandalism and theft in Eastern Europe. Safety concerns also arose in which the <a href="https://interlinex.com/index.php/2022/12/21/safety-first-new-helmet-requirement-for-moped-and-scooter-riders-in-the-netherlands/#:~:text=As%20of%202023%2C%20helmet%20use,from%20moped%20and%20scooter%20accidents.">Netherlands now requires users to wear a helmet on mopeds</a> capped at 25km/h. Nevertheless, the moped market remained stable.</p>



<p>One sharing service which did perform well last year and seems to continue to do so is free-floating carsharing. After a 39% increase in rentals last year, car-sharing is seeing a growing popularity in short-term rentals (2-3 hours) compared to an entire day. Cities leading the way are mostly German to include Berlin, Hamburg and Munich.</p>



<p>As cities and remaining operators start accepting regulations and gaining financial stability within the market, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/change-social-and-shared-mobility/">shared mobility</a> services will continue to develop providing cities and their inhabitants with greater benefits than before.</p>



 Going green. 



<p>As carsharing services gain greater popularity after continual success, this mobility option is one that breathes life into the growing e-mobility movement. With some carsharing operators already providing e-cars, these services not only decrease the volume of vehicles on the road since there is less need for personal vehicles, but also allows for reallocating space in urban areas for public benefit.</p>



<p>Benefitting further from this movement is the integration of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/sebastien-marteau-urban-mobility-and-carsharing/">carsharing services with other sustainable transport options</a> such as public transport, walking, biking, etc. By combining all options, this creates a more ecological way of living and a more <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fueling-demand-convenient-mobility/">convenient</a> and flexible way for people to travel. But in order for this initiative to be successful, operators and cities must work together and invest in the necessary infrastructure.</p>



 IDV—the key to your transport services. 



<p>IDnow jumps on the train here as an important key in this necessary infrastructure. As regulations increase within major cities, safety requirements are implemented and theft rises, operators realize the importance of identifying their customers before allowing them to use their services. From age and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/mobility/driver-license-verification/">driver’s license verification</a> to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/digital-signatures/">digital signatures</a>, our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">automated identity verification solution</a> allow operators to verify their users within seconds.</p>



<p>We drive trust, not frustration, with our services, providing a safe and secure experience for mobility operators and their customers. With fast, 24/7 remote onboarding, transport services can offer their users a frictionless and convenient way to travel while operators can rest-assured that they are meeting regulatory needs and fighting fraud upfront with our use of biometrics.</p>



<p>Thanks to our wide range of document coverage (types of documents and origin) with up to 99% acceptance rate globally as well as a choice of automated or even <a href="https://www.idnow.io/expert-led-verification/">expert-led verification services</a>, operators can scale with confidence.</p>

Verida Announces 200M VDA Token Long-Term Reward&nbsp;Program<p>Check the <a href="https://community.verida.io/verida-token-vda/airdrops-faq">Airdrops FAQ</a> for additional information on the Verida Airdrop&nbsp;program.</p><p>The Verida Foundation is preparing for its upcoming TGE and its related multi-tiered airdrop program. This program is intended to reward early adopters to the network and encourage newcomers to discover Verida’s features and capabilities. Both short and long-term incentives are on offer for participants. Read the previous announcements regarding these programs on <a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-announces-inaugural-early-adopters-airdrop-f1e42399fe91">March 28th</a> and <a href="https://news.verida.io/embark-on-the-journey-to-vda-token-launch-campaign-on-galxe-a1ae18f9bf79">April&nbsp;18th</a>.</p><p>As part of this campaign, Verida is sharing more information on its planned long-term rewards and incentive programs, including details on dedicated funding for those programs. The central element of Verida’s longer-term growth reward programs is a dedicated pool of 200 million VDA tokens, representing 20% of the overall VDA supply, that will be distributed over a multi-year period through several dedicated programs.</p> Network Growth Rewards Explained <p>As described in the <a href="https://verida.network/whitepaper">Verida Whitepaper</a>, <a href="https://www.verida.network/vda-token">Verida’s token economics</a> specifies that 20% of the overall token supply (200M tokens) will be allocated to Network Growth&nbsp;Rewards.</p><p>The Verida Network Growth token pool will be distributed to end users and application developers to incentivize long-term network growth. These token distributions will focus on the following key&nbsp;areas:</p>  Connect your data: Earn tokens by pulling your personal data from web3 applications into your Verida&nbsp;identity  Connect a node: Earn tokens by operating infrastructure on the Verida&nbsp;Network  Connect a friend: Earn tokens by referring friends to join the Verida&nbsp;Network  Connect an app: Earn tokens by building a web3 application that leverages the Verida&nbsp;Network  <p>This Network Growth Rewards pool unlocks monthly over a multi-year period and will allow the foundation to maintain several long-term reward programs backed by more than three million monthly&nbsp;tokens.</p><p>The Network Growth Rewards pool will support ongoing programs including; referral rewards, incentives for members to import additional datasets into Verida, and to connect with dApps built on Verida. Additional reward programs will continue to be developed, and are anticipated to be presented to the Verida community in the months following the token&nbsp;launch.</p> VDA Launch-Related Airdrop and Incentive Programs <p>In addition to the long-term reward allocations from the Network Growth Reward pool, the Verida Foundation has developed a series of targeted near-term airdrops and reward programs coinciding with the launch of the network and the listing of the VDA Storage Credit Token on several centralized and decentralized exchanges.</p><p>This multi-stage airdrop campaign will distribute a minimum of 5 million VDA tokens across a series of targeted reward programs. Although each individual airdrop event within the larger campaign is planned to reward specific activities within the network, it is also expected that many Verida supporters and early adopters will qualify for rewards from several, and in some cases potentially all, of the planned airdrops.</p><p>The Verida Foundation’s strategy of a number of multiple, smaller, targeted airdrops (including its <a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-announces-inaugural-early-adopters-airdrop-f1e42399fe91">inaugural airdrop announced on March 28th</a>) is a deliberate effort to address the shortcomings that often impact hastily conceived airdrop programs, where an excessive portion of the dedicated token reward pool too often finds its way into the hands of casual users and airdrop farmers. Another announcement, from <a href="https://news.verida.io/embark-on-the-journey-to-vda-token-launch-campaign-on-galxe-a1ae18f9bf79">April 21</a> described the second installment of Verida’s planned airdrop campaign, also with a target program focused on a specific group of ecosystem followers.</p><p>By undertaking a series of carefully targeted rewards Verida believes it can increase the percentage of rewards distributed its many enthusiastic supporters. This increases the value of airdrop rewards for actual Verida users, and multiplies the support and incentives for active&nbsp;users.</p><p>Verida looks forward to sharing further announcements related to ongoing and planned community recognition and network growth rewards programs as final details of those programs are&nbsp;settled.</p><p>Stay tuned for more news on our TGE and listing process!

<p>Editor’s note: Thanks to our Customer Success Engineer, Thilina, for authoring this week’s post on the woes (and the solution!) for access management.</p>
<p>I used to sit next to the IT SysAdmin of a small but rapidly expanding organization.&nbsp; I love to people-watch, and one of the things I would see them do–always accompanied by grumbling– (I used to people-listen, too) was handling access requests.</p>
<p>One day after a particularly loud and animated grumble, I asked:</p>
<p>“An access request again hey? What is it this time?”</p>
<p>“Oi! Can’t get enough of my work, eh mate??” (They were British, so they said “Oi” not “Oy.”)</p>
<p>“But yes..it’s another access request for [they mentioned a sensitive system], and it’s the fifth one today – I swear if they ask again…”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually, the profanity stopped, and I understood why it was so upsetting.</p>
 
 The company had a list of applications that required access to be granted (or revoked) in a recorded and auditable way. Auditable is key here. 
 My Admin friend was the admin of all the applications because managing them required tech skills. But the admin was not always not the “owner” or “approver,” the key decision maker who is supposed to vet requests. 
 As a result, when someone wanted access, the admin couldn’t just grant it. They had to pass the request (via email or chat message) to the approver. 
 And then wait. And sometimes, wait. And then wait some more. And nag the approver. And get nagged by the user. 
 And when you get the approval back, they needed to record it to make sure the spreadsheets were up to date for that quarterly compliance nonsense. 
 No fun! 
 
<p>It is the second decade of the 21st century, and people are still doing this. There’s got to be a better way.</p>
<p>And with YeshID – there is!</p>
 1. Enter Your Applications &amp; Their Owners 
<p>With YeshID you can add your applications and specify the application administrators – the owners or approvers I talked about earlier.</p>
<p>When someone wants access or is onboarded or offboarded, or there’s any other activity that concerns the owner’s applications, YeshID notifies them. This means less shoulder tapping on the admin and notifications going to the right place at the right time. And there’s an audit trail for compliance.</p>
<p>To get started quickly with your applications, YeshID provides two ways to add the admin (and login URL):</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you have a lot of apps that you’d like to get imported into YeshID, you can use a CSV file that has your list of apps and their owners.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And upload them to YeshID to quickly import your applications.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Or you can enter them one by one or edit them this way:</p>
<p></p>
 2. Update the Access Grid for your Apps 
<p>Once your applications are added, you can check out the Access Grid to see the current record of app-to-user memberships.</p>
<p>From here, you can go in and quickly check off boxes to mark which users already have access to which apps.</p>
<p></p>
<p>An even quicker way to update an app’s access, especially if you have many users, is to import a CSV of users per app.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you click into an app, you can import a CSV of email addresses and Yesh will take care of the rest.</p>
<p></p>
<p>YeshID will finish by showing you the differences so you can review the changes being made.</p>
<p></p>
 3. Let your Users and App Owners take care of their own Access Requests. 
<p>Now, since you’ve already done the hard work of:</p>
 
 Letting YeshID know of your Apps; and 
 Updating the access for your Apps 
 
<p>You and your users are now able to do the following:</p>
 My-Applications 
<p>Since YeshID is integrated into your Google Workspace, any of your users can navigate to <a href="http://app.yeshid.com/my-applications">app.yeshid.com/my-applications</a> where they will see a grid of applications they already have access to. (No more wondering: “Wait, which URL was it again?”)</p>
<p></p>
 Request Access 
<p>Now, when one of your users requires access to one of your organization’s apps, they can navigate to “All Managed Apps” and Request Access to their app of choice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They can fill in details to provide reasons for their request.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After they submit the request, YeshID will notify the Application Owner about a pending request.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you’re an Application Owner, you’ll be notified with a link to a page where you can see the request and choose to either Confirm or Reject.</p>
<p>If you confirm, YeshID will generate a task will be generated for the admin, and once granted, the user will see the newly granted application the next time they click on their My-Applications grid.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And just like that, a world of shoulder tapping, lost conversations, and requests falling off the side of a desk is avoided through the use of smart technology and engineering by your friends at YeshID.</p>
 4. Use Yesh to Ace your Access Audits 
<p>With YeshID ingrained into your employee lifecycle, audits and Quarterly Access Reviews (QAR’s) become a breeze.</p>
<p>Simply go to your Access Grid and click on “Download Quarterly Report,” which will produce a spreadsheet created for access audits.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Review the details (there’s a sheet per app!), fill in any additional comments, and just like that – your Quarterly Access Review is done.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Ready to reclaim your sanity? By automating access requests and approvals, YeshID empowers admins and users. Users gain self-service access requests, and admins are freed from the time-consuming manual process of nagging app owers and updating spreadsheets.</p>

<p>When blockchain technology was first introduced a decade and a half ago, it made the possibility of a decentralized web seem viable to a mass audience. Since then, blockchains have proven themselves to be a poor solution to the majority of data storage problems outside of bearer assets - i.e. Bitcoin - because blockchains grow continuously without any ability to delete data, which just doesn’t make sense for things like personal data. But ‘blockchain’ isn’t synonymous with decentralization, and just because a blockchain isn’t the best solution for personal data storage doesn’t mean your app can’t be decentralized.</p>
<p>There are two common problems when trying to port a traditional centralized application over to the blockchain: data efficiency and data custody. In this post we’ll discuss why those two problems are blockers for most applications, and how Web5 components allow developers to build performant decentralized applications in a way that wasn't possible before.</p>
 Where Blockchain Doesn’t Fit<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/decentralized-apps#where-blockchain-doesnt-fit" title="Direct link to Where Blockchain Doesn’t Fit">​</a> 
 Data Storage &amp; Efficiency<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/decentralized-apps#data-storage--efficiency" title="Direct link to Data Storage &amp; Efficiency">​</a> 
<p>It’s possible to make the argument that data such as GIS coordinates, historical data, or widely-used and immutable data are good candidates to be stored on the blockchain because there’s no need for deletion and a requirement for complete history. While blockchain isn’t the only storage method that meets the needs of these systems, those systems are the ones best suited to utilize blockchain. Despite that fact that those data are good candidates for blockchain, however, does not mean that blockchain is the best data storage solution for that data.</p>
<p>However, blockchains are continuous ledgers of data that provide the benefit of immutability at the cost of storage inefficiency, which means that they aren’t great for storing large amounts of data or data sets in which there are large subsections of trivial or ignorable data. Firstly, their read times are slower than traditional data storage because the entire blockchain needs to be traversed for a read, and write times require settlement onto the blockchain which is out of an individual’s hands. As a result, the cost per transaction will likely be significantly higher on the blockchain when compared to traditional data storage, and that cost can grow over time.</p>
<p>Imagine an on-chain photo storage app that allows for users to encrypt their data. While this framework would technically allow for the replacement of large-scale cloud-based photo services that are run by centralized corporations, the end user experience would be tarnished by much slower speeds than what users have come to expect. That’s because blockchains are designed to store an immutable ledger of transactions (in this case uploads of photos), and knowing what photos belong to who would involve traversing the entirety of the blockchain. Queries to this kind of data storage are slow and expensive, as would be the proof-of-work or other verification method needed to add new blocks to the chain. As a result, while a photo sharing app, or any app that requires storage of large files, is theoretically possible on-chain, it isn’t very scalable or performant.</p>
 Data Custody<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/decentralized-apps#data-custody" title="Direct link to Data Custody">​</a> 
<p>A key tenant to the decentralized web is the idea of custody, or data ownership. Custody, or the ability to hold an asset in which only you have full access to it, breaks down into a handful of concerns including:</p>
 
 Physical storage ownership 
 Deletion prevention 
 Censorship resistance 
 Speed of use 
 Data interoperability 
 
<p>A truly decentralized web makes it easy for each user to custody their own data, regardless of their reasoning for doing so. No matter a customer’s “why,” however, custody isn’t simply a matter of personal beliefs - it’s a feature that enables better user experience.</p>
<p>With blockchain technology, wallets don’t actually store your data - instead they address to your data on the blockchain via the public/private keys they hold and represent. This means, for example, that a crypto wallet doesn’t actually “store” your Bitcoins; it’s an address that is used as the identifier on transactions recorded on-chain, which can then be used to determine your wallet’s Bitcoin holdings.</p>
<p>In order to take custody of your on-chain data then you would need to run your own node on the blockchain network in question, which may not be a good solution for the average consumer. Additionally, in order to host a wallet that is available on all of your devices, that wallet will likely be hosted on a centralized third party’s servers.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that while the issues of wallet storage and running nodes aren’t unsolvable problems, they are inherently outside of the definitions of what a typical blockchain wallet does today.</p>
 Building With Web5<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/decentralized-apps#building-with-web5" title="Direct link to Building With Web5">​</a> 
<p>Bearing in mind the limitations of custody and efficiency, it becomes clear that not a lot of data makes sense to be stored on-chain. However, just because you might not want to store important, large data like photos, or small, unimportant data like favicon history on-chain doesn’t mean that it isn’t possible to store that data in a decentralized way that offers custody and efficiency.</p>
<p>Key Web5 technologies like Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Decentralized Web Nodes (DWNs), and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) in supplement or in place of blockchain provide a framework for an internet that is both decentralized AND solves the issues we’ve discussed that blockchain alone can’t solve. It’s important to note that while the integration of these technologies with existing blockchain ecosystems isn’t unheard of, they are able to solve the issues with blockchain discussed above. Cumulatively, they offer a way to efficiently address data, store and replicate data in a decentralized manner, and maintain identity.</p>
 Custody<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/decentralized-apps#custody" title="Direct link to Custody">​</a> 
<p>A purely blockchain-focused wallet, as discussed previously, is simply a key pairing with an address that references ownership over transactions on the blockchain but doesn’t actually manage local or cloud storage. This means that any on-chain data, while decentralized, isn’t user-custodied unless they set up a node on the network in which they’re participating, which is something that in a blockchain context should happen in a separate app from the wallet.</p>
<p>In Web5, however, wallets are addressed via DIDs and are able to store data via DWeb Nodes - which can live on device and replicate storage remotely - rather than relying on storing everything on-chain or on the wallet developer’s cloud storage option. Because Web5 wallets are more robust than simply a wallet that connects to a blockchain, your Web5 wallet could theoretically manage running a blockchain node for you in addition to performing more standard “wallet” tasks like you might expect.</p>
<p>Additionally, because DWNs are able to replicate data across instances on different devices, it makes for self-custodying your data across devices much easier than with a blockchain wallet. While blockchain wallets require re-creating the private key pairings on another device and can pose a security risk, DIDs also offer ways to easily and securely port your DID between devices to replicate data and maintain a consistent user experience. You can imagine how great this is in the case of a photo storage app that is backed by a DWN that replicates data across your devices and makes sign-in on those devices easy!</p>
<p>While blockchain wallets and Web5 wallets aren’t mutually exclusive - Web5 wallets can very well interact with blockchains and blockchain wallets may use concepts like DIDs and VCs -, what matters is that when users take advantage of wallet apps using DIDs, DWNs, and VCs, they can self-custody all their off-chain data and even their on-chain data should they be able to run a node locally.</p>
 File Storage<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/decentralized-apps#file-storage" title="Direct link to File Storage">​</a> 
<p>Ledgers like the blockchain don’t make for performant databases in a lot of use cases, which is why DWNs are a breakthrough in combining decentralized web technologies with centralized web performance. While blockchains require ledger consensus and redundant storage to hold any type of data, DWNs are replicable nodes that can run any of the traditionally performant database technologies you’re used to - think SQL, MongoDB, etc. - without being tied to a centralized server.</p>
<p>As mentioned in our discussion about custody, you could run a DWN on your laptop, your phone, on your own server, or on rented server space from a cloud provider, and all of them can be synchronized to provide the kind of redundancy that we love about blockchain. As a result, DWNs are able to solve the problems of large file storage and off-chain storage.</p>
 Final Thoughts<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/decentralized-apps#final-thoughts" title="Direct link to Final Thoughts">​</a> 
<p>A performant decentralized web that offers users custody of their own data has been a tantalizing dream for almost two decades, but in that same timeframe blockchain technology has proven to not be the way to make that vision a reality. If you find yourself or your customers valuing decentralization, privacy, flexibility, and self-custodial apps, then Web5 provides the framework to achieve exactly those goals. Your Web5 app may very well leverage blockchain technology - a participating financial institution on the the tbDEX protocol we’re developing is a great example of an app that uses Web5 tech to connect to blockchains, but there are lots of ways to build dApps with Web5.</p>

<p>The recent ransomware attack on Change Healthcare, a major healthcare technology company, has once again highlighted the critical importance of robust identity verification and authentication measures in safeguarding sensitive data and systems. While the details of the attack are still unfolding, the preliminary investigation has revealed that the root cause was the absence of multi-factor authentication on a remote access application used by Change Healthcare’s staff.</p>
<p>This lapse in security best practices allowed cybercriminals to compromise employee credentials and gain unauthorized access to the company’s networks. The attackers then spent nine days lurking within the systems before launching the ransomware attack, which disrupted critical healthcare services across the United States. To be fair, it is hard to say if properly implemented MFA would have even helped as bad actors are getting increasingly good at attacks like SIM Swapping, social engineering, stealing OTPs, etc. and these attacks have seen a dramatic increases in the last few years.</p>
<p>The Change Healthcare incident is a sobering reminder that even large, well-established organizations can fall victim to cyber threats when they fail to implement the necessary identity and access controls. In an era where remote work and cloud-based services have become the norm, the attack surface for malicious actors has expanded significantly, making it crucial for organizations to re-evaluate their security posture and adopt robust identity management solutions.</p>
<p>This is where the 1Kosmos platform can play a pivotal role in preventing similar breaches. Our solution offers a comprehensive approach to identity verification and authentication, addressing the key vulnerabilities that were exploited in the Change Healthcare attack.</p>
 Robust Identity Proofing 
<p>The 1Kosmos platform provides a secure and frictionless way to verify user identities, ensuring that only legitimate individuals can access sensitive systems and data. Our identity proofing capabilities, which are certified to NIST 800-63-3 and other industry standards, can detect and prevent the use of stolen or synthetic identities, a common tactic employed by cybercriminals.</p>
 Passwordless Multi-Factor Authentication 
<p>The absence of multi-factor authentication was a critical factor in the Change Healthcare breach. The 1Kosmos platform offers a range of passwordless authentication methods, including biometrics, push notifications, and hardware tokens, to provide a robust and user-friendly way to verify user identities and prevent unauthorized access.</p>
 Decentralized Identity Management 
<p>Unlike traditional identity management systems, the 1Kosmos platform leverages a private, permissioned blockchain to store and manage user identities. This decentralized approach eliminates the risk of a centralized “honeypot” of information that can be targeted by hackers, as seen in the Change Healthcare incident.</p>
 Audit Trail and Compliance 
<p>The 1Kosmos platform maintains a detailed, immutable audit trail of all identity-related events, including login attempts, access requests, and data sharing activities. This level of visibility and transparency not only helps organizations detect and respond to security incidents but also ensures compliance with industry regulations and standards.</p>
 Benefits of a Single Authentication Platform 
<p>The lessons learned from the Change Healthcare ransomware attack serve as a stark reminder that even the most well-established organizations are vulnerable to cyber threats when they fail to prioritize identity and access management. By adopting a comprehensive identity management solution like the 1Kosmos platform, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of similar breaches and ensure the security and integrity of their sensitive data and systems.</p>

<p>According to proprietary verification data from Onfido (<a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/learn/entrust-completes-acquisition-of-onfido">now a part of Entrust</a>), <a href="https://onfido.com/press-release/onfido-launches-first-fraud-lab-as-deepfakes-increase/">deepfakes rose 3000%</a> from 2022 to 2023. And with the increasing availability of deepfake software and improvements in AI, the scale and sophistication of these attacks are expected to further intensify. As it becomes more difficult to discern legitimate identities from deepfakes, AI-enabled biometrics can offer consumers, citizens, and organizations some much-needed protection from bad actors, while also improving overall convenience and experience. Indeed, AI-enabled biometrics has ushered in a new era for verification and authentication. So, with such promise, why is biometrics such a flash point in AI regulatory discussions?</p>
<p>Like the proverb that warns “the road to Hell is paved with good intentions,” the unchecked development and use of AI-enabled biometrics may have unintended – even Orwellian – consequences. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has warned that the use of AI-enabled biometrics comes with significant privacy and data concerns, along with the potential for increased bias and discrimination. The unchecked use of biometric data by law enforcement and other government agencies could also infringe on civil rights. In some countries, AI and biometrics are already being used for mass surveillance and predictive policing, which should alarm any citizen.</p>
<p>The very existence of mass databases of biometric data is sure to attract the attention of all types of malicious actors, including nation-state attackers. In a critical election year with close to half the world’s population headed to the polls, biometric data is already being used to create deepfake video and audio recordings of political candidates, swaying voters and threatening the democratic process. To help defend against these and other concerns, the pending <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20240308IPR19015/artificial-intelligence-act-meps-adopt-landmark-law#:~:text=The%20new%20rules%20ban%20certain,to%20create%20facial%20recognition%20databases.">EU Artificial Intelligence Act</a> has banned certain AI applications, including biometric categorization and identification systems based on sensitive characteristics and the untargeted scraping of facial images from the web or CCTV footage.</p>
<p>The onus is on us … all of us</p>
<p>Legal obligations aside, biometric solution vendors and users have a duty of care to humanity to help promote the responsible development and use of AI. Crucial is the maintenance of transparency and consent in the collection and use of biometric data at all times. The use of diverse training data for AI models and regular audits to help mitigate the risk of unconscious bias are also vital safeguards. Still another is to adopt a <a href="https://www.entrust.com/resources/learn/zero-trust">Zero Trust</a> strategy for the collection, storage, use, and transmission of biometric data. After all, you can’t replace your palm print or facial ID like you could a compromised credit card. The onus is on biometric vendors and users to establish clear policies for the collection, use, and storage of biometric data and to provide employees with regular training on how to use such solutions and how to recognize potential security threats.</p>
<p>It’s a brave new world. AI-generated deepfakes and AI-enabled biometrics are here to stay. <a href="https://www.entrust.com/cybersecurity-institute/podcasts/ai-regulation-at-a-crossroads">Listen to our podcast episode on this topic</a> for more information on how to best navigate the flash points in AI and biometrics.</p>

  <p>Hello friends,  &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m pleased to announce General Availability (GA) of the organizational branding role for Microsoft Entra ID company branding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This new role is part of our ongoing efforts to implement Zero Trust network access by enforcing the principle of least privilege for users when customizing their authentication user experience (UX) via Entra ID company branding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previously, users wanting to configure Entra ID company branding required the Global Admin role. This role, though, has sweeping privileges beyond what’s necessary for configuring Entra ID company branding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new organizational branding role limits its privileges to the configuration of Entra ID company branding, significantly improving security and reducing the attack surface associated with its configuration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To assign the role to a user, follow these steps:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Log on to Microsoft Entra ID and select Users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Select and open the user to assign the organizational branding role.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Select Assigned roles and then Add assignments. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Select the Organizational Branding Administrator role and assign it to the user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the settings are applied, the user will be able to configure the authentication UX via Entra ID Company Branding. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Below are my personal highlights from the <a href="https://internetidentityworkshop.com/">Internet Identity Workshop</a> #38, which took place between April 16th and April 18th at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California.</p>
 <br>
#1 – Yet another new DID Method? 
 <p>Image courtesy of James Monaghan</p> 
<p>On day one, I participated in a session hosted by Stephen Curran from the BC government, where we discussed the new DID method they’ve been working on: <a href="https://bcgov.github.io/trustdidweb">did:tdw</a>. </p>
<p>It’s essentially an extension of did:web, drawing on learnings from the Trust over IP did:webs initiative but simplifying it by removing some of the components.</p>
<p>One of the interesting aspects is their ability to incorporate historicity of DID Documents without relying on ledgers. They’ve also developed a linked verifiable presentation (i.e. when I resolve the DID I can get a proof), pre-rotation capability, and portability, which are crucial features for real business applications of DID Web.</p>
<p>They view this method as particularly suitable for public organizations and have indicated that similar implementations could be applied to other DID methods. They already have some running code for this, which is promising.</p>
<p>This session was significant for us because these business features are essential as we deploy DIDs in production with our customers. It also reinforced how our work on <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-carter-high-assurance-dids-with-dns-03.html">High Assurance DID with DNS</a> complements theirs, adding an extra layer of security and integrity. I’m excited about the potential of a proof of concept where we can see both the TDW and the High Assurance DID Web in action together.<br>
</p>
 <br>
#2 – Bootstrapping DIDComm connections through OpenID4VC flows 
<p>I attended a session by Sam Curren who represented some recent <a href="https://github.com/IDUnion/OpenIDIDComm">work done by IDUnion</a> to demonstrate how a DIDComm connection could be bootstrapped through an OpenID4VC flow, in a very light touch manner.</p>
<p>By leveraging OAuth 2.0 authentication in these flows, they’ve developed a method to pass a DIDComm connection request seamlessly. This is particularly interesting because the European Union has decided to use OpenID for verifiable credentials in issuing high assurance government digital credentials, leading to widespread adoption.</p>
<p>However, OpenID for verifiable credentials has limitations that DIDComm can address. DIDComm serves as a bilateral messaging platform between entities, enabling tasks like credential revocation notices that OpenID for verifiable credentials cannot handle. DIDComm also offers greater flexibility and modularity, allowing for secure messaging and interaction with various protocols.</p>
<p>IDUnion in Germany aims to leverage the OpenID for VC specification to establish DIDComm connections between issuers and holders, enabling a broader range of functionalities. They have running code and a demo for this, which we plan to implement at Northern Block in the near future.</p>
<p>The work is under discussion for transfer to the DIF for further work.</p>
<p>I also found out about where to get <a href="https://didcomm.myspreadshop.com/">DIDComm swag</a>!</p>
 <br>
#3 – Apple and Google’s Cross Platform Demo of Digital Credential API 
<p></p>
<p>In the first session of day two, representatives from both Apple and Google held a demo to showcase interoperability between Apple Wallet and Google Wallet with a browser, drawing a large crowd. Demonstrations by major platform players like these always mark significant progress in where we are in the adoption cycle of a new industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My main takeaway is that their demonstration questions the value of third-party wallets. The trend is that government-issued high-assurance citizen credentials are increasingly issued into government-based wallets, both in North America and Europe. While government-provided wallets may be the norm for high-assurance government-issued credentials, for other types of identity credentials, direct exchange from the device via a third-party application seems to offer the best user experience. This raises questions about the future role of vendor wallets, particularly for personal use or specific utility-focused applications.</p>
 <br>
#4 – Content Authenticity 201: Identity Assertion Technical Working&nbsp; 
<p>Content authenticity is a pressing real-world issue, especially with the rise of generative AI, which blurs the lines between human-generated and machine-generated content. This challenge has been exacerbated by the difficulty in tracing the origin of content, leading to concerns about integrity, manipulation, and misinformation. The Content Authenticity Initiative aims to address this problem by bringing together industry partners, including hardware and software providers, as well as media outlets, to establish standards for tagging media. Led by Eric Scouten, founder of the initiative from Adobe, they have successfully developed a standard for tagging media. However, questions remain regarding how to manage identity behind content, which varies depending on the type of content creator involved. Whether it’s media outlets or individual creators, maintaining integrity in the provenance of media assets requires trust in the identity process. Discussions around creator assertions and identity management are ongoing, with active participation encouraged through the initiative’s working group discussions. For those interested, here’s a link to a <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/content-authenticity-combating-deepfakes-misinformation-and-fraud/">podcast</a> where Eric Scouten and I discuss these topics, as well as a link to the Creator Assertions Working Group homepage (<a href="https://creator-assertions.github.io/">here</a>) for further engagement.</p>
 <br>
#5 – Trust Registry FACE OFF!!&nbsp; 
<p></p>
<p>I co-hosted a session with Sam Curren, Andor Kesselman, and Alex Tweeddale on trust registries. The aim was to explore various projects in this space and identify opportunities for convergence or accelerated development. The conversation began with an overview of how X.509 certificates are currently used on the web to establish trust in secure connections. I then introduced Northern Block’s trust registry solution, which offers features to enhance integrity in the trust registry process (<a href="https://trustregistry.nborbit.ca/">https://trustregistry.nborbit.ca/</a>).</p>
<p>We then delved into different standards:</p>
 
 <a href="https://hub.ebsi.eu/get-started/design/trust-chain">EBSI Trust Chains</a>: This standard tracks “Verifiable Accreditations” and is used by cheqd. It involves a governing authority for the ecosystem with a DID on a blockchain, tracking DIDs authorized for specific actions. 
 <a href="https://trustoverip.github.io/tswg-trust-registry-protocol/">Trust over IP Trust Registry Protocol v2</a>: Version 2 is under implementor’s review as of April 2024. It offers a RESTful API with a query API standardizing how to query which entities are authorized to do what in which context. 
 <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-federation-1_0.html">OpenID Federation</a>: This standard, particularly OpenID Federation 1.0, is already used in systems worldwide, including university networks and Brazil’s open banking. It allows each entity to provide trust lists, including common trust anchors with other lists. 
 <a href="https://identity.foundation/credential-trust-establishment/">Credential Trust Establishment 1.0</a>: This standard, part of the DIF Trust Establishment specification, is a data model rather than a protocol or interaction model. It involves creating a document and hosting it behind a URI, with no centralization. It allows roles for each participant and is complementary to VC-based decentralized trust. 
 
<p>The session was dynamic, with significant interest, especially regarding roots of trusts, a topic gaining traction at the Internet Identity Workshop. We’re excited about our ongoing work in this field.</p>
 <br>
#6 – High-Assurance did:web Using DNS 
<p>I hosted a session to showcase our work with the High Assurance did:web using DNS. Jesse Carter from CIRA and Tim Bouma from the Digital Governance Council of Canada joined me in the presentation.</p>
<p>We demonstrated to the group that, without new standards or specifications, but simply by leveraging existing internet infrastructure, we could significantly enhance the assurance behind a decentralized identifier.</p>
<p>The feedback we received was positive, and all of our presentations so far have been well-received. We believe that organizations with robust operational practices around DNS infrastructure can integrate the security and integrity of DNS into decentralized identifiers effectively. This approach should align well with the planned proof-of-concept using the HA DID Spec in conjunction with did:tdw’s verifiable presentation feature, offering both technical and human trust in one process.</p>

<p>#7 – AnonCreds in W3C VCDM Format</p> 
<p>I attended an engaging session led by Stephen Curran from the British Columbia government, discussing their project to align AnonCreds credentials with the W3C verifiable credential data model standard. It was insightful to learn about British Columbia’s commitment to preserving privacy by leveraging AnonCreds, particularly highlighting the unlinkability feature that prevents the generation of super cookies. While acknowledging concerns about potential correlation of unique identifiers in other digital identity programs globally, Stephen addressed market friction from those seeking W3C-aligned verifiable credentials. He outlined the innovative steps taken to ensure compatibility, including leveraging their procurement program to fund multiple companies for various aspects of the project, including implementations. Once again, the British Columbia Government showcased remarkable innovation in the Digital Trust space.</p>

<p>#8 – A Bridge to the Future: Connecting X.509 and DIDs/VIDs</p> 
 <p>Diagram with X.509 and DID/VC comparison</p> 
<p>I participated in a great discussion about the potential connection between X.509 certificates and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). Drummond Reed provided an exceptional overview of what DIDs entail, offering the clearest explanation I’ve encountered. The genesis of this discussion stemmed from the Content Authenticity Initiative’s endeavour to establish a trust infrastructure for content providers, with a notable push for X.509 certificates due to existing investments by large enterprises. We delved into how X.509 certificates are utilized by organizations like the CA/Browser Forum and browsers, as well as their role in trust registries. However, a fundamental distinction emerged between the two: X.509 certificates are intricately woven into a governance process with a one-to-one correspondence, while DIDs can be self-asserted and are not necessarily tied to specific governance structures. This contrast prompted exploration into leveraging current X.509 processes to facilitate linkage with DIDs, enabling broader utility within the same context. Overall, the discussion shed light on the interconnectedness of roots of trust, trust registries, and the evolving landscape of digital trust.</p>

<p>#9 – State of eIDAS&nbsp; + German eIDAS Wallet Challenge</p> 
 <p>Screenshot taken from deck linked below</p> 
<p>In my final session of note before heading to the airport on day three, we engaged in a discussion regarding the state of eIDAS, alongside updates on Germany’s eIDAS wallet consultation project and challenge. While the discussion didn’t introduce anything particularly groundbreaking, the notable turnout underscored the widespread interest in developments within the European digital identity landscape. Throughout IIW, numerous sessions delved into the technical specifications mandated by the European Union’s architectural reference framework to align with eIDAS 2.0. For those interested, I’ve participated in several podcasts covering this topic (<a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/eidas2-and-eu-digital-identity-wallet/">1</a>, <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/eidas2-and-eu-digital-identity-wallet-part-2/">2</a>, <a href="https://northernblock.io/podcasts/eidas-2-0-predicting-its-impact-on-various-ecosystems-with-dominik-beron/">3</a>). The ongoing momentum surrounding eIDAS 2.0 promises to be a focal point in future IIWs.</p>

The previous two, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/finema-official_vlei-demystified-part-1-comprehensive-overview-activity-7149006651126075392-mRZ_">vLEI Demystified Part 1: Comprehensive Overview</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/finema/vlei-demystified-part-2-identity-verification-519102614b8e">vLEI Demystified Part 2: Identity Verification</a>, have explained the foundation of the pioneering verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI) ecosystem as well as its robust Identity Verification procedures. In this part, we will share with you our journey through the Qualification of vLEI Issuers, called Qualified vLEI Issuers (QVIs), including the requirements and obligations that QVIs have to fulfill once they are authorized by GLEIF to perform their roles in the ecosystem.</p><p>The Qualification of vLEI Issuers is the evaluation process conducted by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) to assess the suitability of organizations aspiring to serve as Qualified vLEI Issuers within the vLEI ecosystem. GLEIF has established the Qualification Program for all interested organizations, which can either be the current LEI Issuers (Local Operating Units: LOUs) or new business partners who wish to explore the emerging vLEI ecosystem. The organizations that complete the Qualification Program under the GLEIF vLEI Ecosystem Framework (EGF) are authorized to perform verification, issuance, and revocation of vLEI credentials to legal entities seeking the credentials and also their representatives.</p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@nguyendhn?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Nguyen Dang Hoang Nhu</a> on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral">Unsplash</a> Step 1: Start the Qualification Program <p>To kick start the qualification process, the organizations interested in becoming QVIs must first review <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/the-lifecycle-of-a-vlei-issuer/gleif-qualification-of-vlei-issuers/required-documents">Appendix 2: vLEI Issuer Qualification Program Manual</a>, which provides an overview of the required Qualification Program, and the vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework (vLEI EGF) to make sure that they understand how to incorporate the requirements outlined in the framework to their operations. Once they have decided to proceed, the interested organizations may initiate the Qualification Program by sending an email to <a href="mailto:qualificationrequest@gleif.org">qualificationrequest@gleif.org</a> along with a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) signed by an authorized signatory of the interested organization.</p><p>Unless GLEIF has a mean to verify the signatory’s authority by themselves, the interested organization may be required to submit proof of the signatory’s authority. In the case where the NDA signer’s authority is delegated, the power of attorney may also be required.</p><p>After GLEIF reviews the qualification request, they will countersign the NDA and organize an introductory meeting with the interested organization, now called a candidate vLEI issuer, to discuss the next step of the Qualification Program.</p> Step 2: Implement the Qualification Program Requirements <p>To evaluate if a candidate vLEI issuer has both the financial and technical capabilities to perform the QVI role, the candidate vLEI issuer is required to implement the Qualification Program Requirements, which consist of business and technical qualifications. Throughout this process, the candidate vLEI issuer may schedule up to two meetings with GLEIF to clarify program issues and requirements.</p> Complete the Qualification Program Checklist <p>A candidate vLEI issuer is required to complete <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/the-lifecycle-of-a-vlei-issuer/gleif-qualification-of-vlei-issuers/required-documents">Appendix 3: vLEI Issuer Qualification Program Checklist</a> to demonstrate that they are capable of actively participating in the vLEI ecosystem as well as being in good financial standing. The checklist and supporting documents can be submitted via online portals provided by&nbsp;GLEIF.</p><p>The Qualification Program Checklist is divided into 12 sections from Section A to Section L. The first five sections (Section A to Section E) focus mainly on the business aspects while the last seven sections (Section F to Section L) cover the technical specifications and relevant policies for operating the vLEI issuer Services.</p><blockquote>Note: vLEI Issuer Services are all of the services related to the issuance, management, and revocation of vLEI credentials provided by the&nbsp;QVI.</blockquote><p>Section A: Contact&nbsp;Details:</p><p>This section requires submission of the candidate vLEI issuer’s general information as well as contact details of the key persons involved in the vLEI operation project, namely: (1) Internal Project Manager, (2) Designated Authorized Representative (DAR), (3) Key Contact Operations, and (4) Key Contact&nbsp;Finance</p><p>Section B: Entity Structure</p><p>This section requires submission of the candidate vLEI issuer’s organization structure, regulatory internal and external audit reports, operational frameworks, and any third-party consultants that the candidate vLEI issuer has engaged with regarding their business and technological evaluation.</p><p>Section C: Organization Structure</p><p>This section requires submission of the current organization chart for all vLEI operations and a complete list of all relevant third-party service providers that support the vLEI operations.</p><p>Section D: Financial Data, Audits &amp; General Governance</p><p>This section requires submission of financial and operational conditions of the candidate vLEI issuer’s business, including:</p>  Audited financial statements for the prior&nbsp;year  Financial auditor&nbsp;reports  Formal vLEI Issuer Operation Budget  <p>Section E: Pricing&nbsp;Model</p><p>In this section, the candidate vLEI issuer outlines their strategy to generate revenue from the vLEI operations and ensure that they are committed to managing the funding and monetization of the services they plan to offer. This includes the pricing model and business plan regarding the vLEI issuer&nbsp;services</p><p>Section F: vLEI Issuer&nbsp;Services</p><p>In this section, the candidate vLEI issuer shall outline their detailed plans and processes related to the issuance and revocation of vLEI credentials, including:</p>  Processes for receiving payments from legal entity (LE)&nbsp;clients.  Processes for identity verification in accordance with the vLEI&nbsp;EGF.  Processes for validating the legal identity of official organization role (OOR) persons as well as using GLEIF API to choose the correct OOR&nbsp;code.  Processes for calling the vLEI Reporting API for each issuance of LE and OOR vLEI credentials  Processes for verifying the statuses of legal entity clients’ LEI. The clients must be notified 30 days before their LEI&nbsp;expires.  Processes for revoking all vLEIs issued to the legal entity client whose LEI has&nbsp;lapsed  Processes for monitoring compliance with the Service Level Agreement (Appendix 5)  Processes for monitoring witnesses for erroneous or malicious activities  <p>Section G: Records Management</p><p>In this section, the candidate vLEI issuer provides their internal Records Management Policy that defines the responsibilities of the personnel related to records retention to ensure that the records management processes are documented, communicated, and supervised.</p><p>Section H: Website Requirements</p><p>In this section, the candidate QVI’s websites are required to display the following items:</p>  QVI Trustmark  Applications, contracts, and required documents for legal entities to apply for vLEI credentials.  <p>Section I:&nbsp;Software</p><p>In this section, the candidate vLEI issuer provides their internal policy for the Service Management Process including:</p>  Processes for installing, testing, and approving new&nbsp;software  Processes for identifying, tracking, and correcting software errors/bugs  Processes for managing cryptographic keys  Processes for recovering from compromise  <p>The candidate vLEI issuer must also specify their policies and operations related to management for private keys and KERI witnesses as&nbsp;follows:</p>  Processes and policies for managing thresholded multi-signature scheme, where at least 2 out of 3 qualified vLEI issuer authorized representatives (QARs) are required to approve issuance or revocation of vLEI credentials  Processes for operating KERI witnesses, where at least 5 witnesses are required for the vLEI issuer&nbsp;services  <p>Section J: Networks and Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI)</p><p>In this section, the candidate vLEI issuer describes their network architecture including KERI witnesses and the details of third-party cloud-based services as well as a process monitoring of the vLEI Issuer-related IT infrastructure. The candidate vLEI issuer must also provide the following internal policies:</p>  Disaster Recovery and/or Business Continuity Plan  Backup Policies and Practices  The vetting process for evaluating the reliability of third-party service providers  <p>Section K: Information Security</p><p>In this section, the candidate vLEI issuer provides their internal Information Security Policy that includes, for example, formal governance, revision management, personnel training, physical access policies, incident reports, and remediation from security breaches.</p><p>Section L: Compliance</p><p>QVI candidates must declare that they will abide by the general and legal requirements as a vLEI Issuer&nbsp;by:</p>  Execute a vLEI Issuer Qualification Agreement with&nbsp;GLEIF  Execute a formal contract, of which the template follows the Agreement requirements, with a Legal Entity before the issuance of a vLEI credential  Comply with the requirements for Qualification, vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework, and any other applicable legal requirements   Respond to Remediation (if&nbsp;any) <p>After the candidate vLEI issuer has submitted the qualification program checklist and supporting documents through online portals, GLEIF will review the submission and provide the review results and remediation requirements, if any. Subsequently, the candidate vLEI issuer must respond to the remediation requirements along with corresponding updates to their qualification program checklist and supporting documents.</p> Undergo Technical Qualification <p>After the qualification program checklist has been submitted, reviewed, and remediated, the candidate vLEI issuer then proceeds to the technical part of the qualification program. GLEIF and the candidate vLEI issuer then organize a dry run to test that the candidate vLEI issuer is capable&nbsp;of:</p>  Performing OOBI sessions and authentication  Generating and managing a multi-signature group&nbsp;AID  Issuing, verifying and revoking vLEI credentials  <p>The purpose of the dry run is to make sure that the candidate vLEI issuer has the technical capability to operate as a QVI as well as identify and fix any technical issue that may arise. A dry run may take multiple meeting sessions if required.</p><p>After the candidate vLEI issuer completes the dry run, they may proceed to the official technical qualification, which repeats the process during the dry run. vLEI credentials issued during the official session are official and may be used in the vLEI ecosystem.</p> Step 3: Sign the Qualification Agreement <p>Once the vLEI candidates have completed all of the business and technical qualification processes, GLEIF will notify the organization regarding the result of the Qualification Program. The approval of the qualification application will result in the candidate vLEI Issuer signing the <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/the-lifecycle-of-a-vlei-issuer/gleif-qualification-of-vlei-issuers/required-documents">vLEI Issuer Qualification Agreement</a> with GLEIF. The candidate vLEI Issuer will then officially become a&nbsp;QVI.</p> Beyond the Qualification Program <p>Once officially qualified, the QVI must ensure strict compliance with the vLEI EGF and the requirements that they completed in the Qualification Program Checklist. For example, their day-to-day operations must comply with <a href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/the-lifecycle-of-a-vlei-issuer/gleif-qualification-of-vlei-issuers/required-documents">Appendix 5: Qualified vLEI Issuer Service Level Agreement (SLA)</a> as well as comply with their internal policies such as the Records Management Policy and Information Security Policy. They must also continuously monitor their services and IT infrastructure including the witnesses.</p> Annual vLEI Issuer Qualification <p>The QVI is also subject to the Annual vLEI Issuer Qualification by GLEIF to ensure that they continue to meet the requirements of the vLEI Ecosystem Governance Framework. If the QVI has made significant changes to their vLEI issuer services, IT infrastructure, or internal policies, the QVI must document the details of the changes and update corresponding supporting documentation. GLEIF will then review the changes and request for remediation actions, if&nbsp;any.</p> Conclusion <p>The processes of the QVI Qualification Program are designed to be extensively rigorous to ensure the trustworthiness of the vLEI ecosystems as QVIs play a vital role in maintaining trust and integrity among the downstream vLEI stakeholders. We at Finema are committed to promoting the vLEI ecosystem, and would be delighted to assist should you be interested in embarking on your journey to participate in the ecosystem.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/finema/vlei-demystified-part-3-qvi-qualification-program-59b4eba308f0">vLEI Demystified Part 3: QVI Qualification Program</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/finema">Finema</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Welcome to the latest installment in our ongoing series on Aergo’s strategic advancements and initiatives. In this edition, we’ll explore how Aergo is leveraging its unique features to address the evolving needs of enterprise clients, focusing specifically on its compatibility with the EVM and its structural design.</p><p>In a nutshell:</p><p>Aergo’s integration with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), alongside its hybrid architecture and tailored focus on enterprise requirements, establishes a strong foothold. Particularly attractive to enterprises in the financial sector, Aergo provides inventive ways to simplify blockchain implementation and operation, particularly for RWAs and&nbsp;STOs.</p> Rising Demand and&nbsp;EVM <p>Since 2018, Aergo and Blocko have implemented and sophisticated the idea of a decentralized physical infrastructure network for the customers based on the enterprise-focused blockchain platform, Aergo Enterprise. Various applications have emerged, ranging from shipment asset management to energy-related asset trading systems. These developments formed the foundation of what can be termed as today’s DePin(Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks) model — a decentralized network driven by blockchain technology and incentives. Early implementations had limitations due to restricted participation and minimized token incentives as they were primarily tailored for consortia or affiliates.</p><p>However, Aergo stands out in its ability to engage in diverse projects with major domestic and international companies and public institutions. This is attributed to the need for a player in the market capable of delivering the level of service demanded by enterprise customers. As Ethereum leads the way in blockchain technological standards, demand arises for more adaptable enterprise blockchain solutions. Aergo’s compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) provides enterprises with a robust foundation for constructing decentralized solutions capable of revolutionizing multiple facets of their operations.</p><p>From asset management to financial transactions and data management, Aergo’s integration with the EVM opens doors to transformative possibilities. Furthermore, Aergo accommodates various sizes and industries with its hybrid architecture, gaining traction through EVM integration. Such hybrid structures are crucial in the enterprise market, where participant identity verification and safeguarding sensitive information are paramount. EVM integration holds significance for enterprise clients seeking to transition to web3, especially as private blockchains lose traction, and integration with public ecosystems gains prominence.</p> EVM and&nbsp;STOs <p>When integrating blockchain solutions into various financial projects, including Security Token Offerings (STOs) and Real World Assets (RWAs), project managers and decision-makers inevitably reference the performance and achievements of <a href="https://academy.shrimpy.io/post/what-is-defi-composability-an-introduction-to-money-legos">Ethereum-based DeFi models</a> along with other models built on the EVM. Utilizing open-sourced EVMs from various implementations becomes crucial for effectively meeting clients' needs. We have successfully built and operated multiple projects with Blocko, striving for implementations that recognize the demands and prioritize EVM features essential for enterprises. Simultaneously, our collaboration underscores our dedication to identifying these requirements and pursuing efficient implementations that prioritize the necessary EVM features for enterprise applications. The essential features offered by Aergo Enterprise include tokenization and asset backing, regulatory compliance, and secondary market trading capabilities.</p><p>Despite the recent hype surrounding them, DePin, RWAs, and STOs operate within the same business framework. The key takeaway is the necessity for a platform capable of representing a diverse range of assets through fractional ownership, tailored to various sectors and scales. Aergo’s commitment to enterprise market growth, driven by its hybrid structure and technical adaptability via EVM, positions it favorably. Collaborations with Blocko, including entry into the RWA and STO markets, underscore the ongoing development efforts, while initiatives like Booost expand its business and consumer reach based on geolocation services.</p><p>With STO-related regulations in Korea nearing finalization, we anticipate forthcoming news soon. Also, a detailed article on fee structure will be uploaded if they were any&nbsp;updates.</p>  For further information on Aergo’s emphasis on the enterprise blockchain market and its structure, please refer&nbsp;to:  <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-2-0-a-decentralized-infrastructure-for-web3-4c1e63b597d">Aergo 2.0: A Decentralized Infrastructure for Web3</a></p>  For information on current fee structures and voting rewards, please refer to the articles listed&nbsp;below:    <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergos-fee-2-0-889861b7b247">Aergo’s Fee 2.0</a>  <a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-network-voting-reward-28212d568fc9">Aergo Network Voting Reward</a>   <p><a href="https://medium.com/aergo/aergo-set-to-penetrate-enterprise-blockchain-market-with-its-hybrid-structure-and-evm-integration-c3dd51f660f5">Aergo Set to Penetrate Enterprise Blockchain Market with its Hybrid Structure and EVM Integration</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/aergo">Aergo blog</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Our Chief Architect, Steve McCown, recently compared two of <a href="https://anonyome.com/2023/08/17-industries-with-viable-use-cases-for-decentralized-identity/">decentralized identity’s</a> leading governance models—trust registries (from <a href="https://trustoverip.org/">Trust Over IP</a> or ToIP) and trust establishment (from the <a href="https://identity.foundation/">Decentralized Identity Foundation</a> or DIF)—and published his findings in our latest white paper.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Skip straight to the white paper, <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2024/04/comparing-two-of-decentralized-identitys-leading-governance-models/">“Comparing Two of Decentralized Identity’s Leading Governance Models.”&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>We know that <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/simple-definitions-for-complex-terms-in-decentralized-identity%ef%bf%bc/">decentralized identity</a> (DI) as a new approach to <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/08/whitepaper-innovating-identity-and-access-management-with-decentralized-identity/">identity management</a> on the internet offers many <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/06/part-4-benefits-to-enterprises-from-proactively-adopting-decentralized-identity/">benefits</a> over traditional <a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/08/whitepaper-innovating-identity-and-access-management-with-decentralized-identity/">centralized</a> systems, such as greater privacy, increased security, and better fault tolerance. It also offers a novel approach to system governance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What Steve describes in his comparison of the two leading government models, trust registries and trust establishment, is that while the two approaches appear to compete with each other, their features and capabilities actually make them rather serendipitous, and users may find them mutually beneficial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The trust registry model from ToIP’s <a href="https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/Governance+Stack+Working+Group">Governance Stack Working Group</a> creates a governance framework that guides organizations in creating their own governance model more than specifying exactly what rules and descriptions a governance model must contain. In other words, it is a process for creating a governance model rather than a pre-existing governance model to be applied.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Quite often, teams creating DI systems don’t know where to start when defining governance for their systems and the ToIP model is an excellent roadmap,” Steve says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While ToIP’s governance framework processes appear best suited for enterprise-level ecosystem efforts, the <a href="https://identity.foundation/trust-establishment/">trust establishment</a> (TE) processes that DIF is creating are intended to be much simpler. According to the <a href="https://identity.foundation/trust-establishment/">Trust Establishment 1.0 document</a>, “This specification describes only the data model of trust documents and is not opinionated on document integrity, format, publication, or discovery.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Steve says that rather than presenting a series of processes by which a governance framework can produce a governance model, the DIF specification provides a single “lightweight trust document” that produces a governance data model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since the TE does not require a particular data format, it can be embodied in many formats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In one instance, it can be used through an internet-accessible API as is specified for the ToIP trust registry/governance model solution. However, it is most commonly described as a cryptographically signed and JSON-formatted document that can be downloaded from a website, immutable data source, or a provider’s own service,” Steve says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The TE is a newly emerging specification and will likely undergo many enhancements and updates. See the <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/2024/04/comparing-two-of-decentralized-identitys-leading-governance-models/">whitepaper</a> for more detail of both models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Steve’s comparison of DI governance models is important because enterprises are facing mounting pressure from customers and regulators to rapidly deliver greater security and interoperability in software and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  The minimum threshold for the FATF Travel Rule in Canada is&nbsp;$1000.  Crypto businesses must also mandatorily submit a Large Virtual Currency Transaction Report ($10,000 and above) to&nbsp;FINTRAC.  The country has enacted several laws for crypto transaction transparency and asset protection.  <p>The <a href="https://www.shyft.network/products/veriscope/fatf-travel-rule">FATF Travel Rule</a>, also called Crypto Travel Rule informally, <a href="https://fintrac-canafe.canada.ca/guidance-directives/transaction-operation/travel-acheminement/1-eng">came into force</a> in Canada on June 1st, 2021. It laid out the requirements for a virtual currency transfer to remain under the legal ambit of the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (<a href="https://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/P-24.501/FullText.html#h-398215">PCMLFTA</a>).</p> Key Features of the Canadian Travel&nbsp;Rule <p>In Canada, the FATF Travel Rule applies to electronic funds and virtual currency transfers. The term Virtual Currency has a wider meaning in the Canadian context. It can be a digital representation of value or a private key of a cryptographic system that enables a person or entity to access a digital representation of&nbsp;value.</p><p>The Crypto Travel Rule guides financial entities, money service businesses, foreign money service businesses, and casinos. These institutions must work per the information disclosure requirements inscribed in the Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p> Compliance Requirements <p>In Canada, <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/PDF/SOR-2002-184.pdf">the Travel Rule applies to</a> any virtual currency transactions exceeding $1,000. For these transactions to be compliant, the parties involved must share their personally identifiable information (PII) with the originator and beneficiary exchanges.</p><p>PII to be shared for Travel Rule compliance includes the requester’s name and address, the nature of their principal business or occupation, and, if the requester is an individual, their date of birth. This is consistent whether it is shared with a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) inside or outside of&nbsp;Canada.</p><p>On a related note, entities receiving large virtual currency transactions must report it to FINTRAC. The authorities consider a VC transaction to be large if it is equivalent to US$10,000 or more in a single transaction.</p><p>A similar report is also mandatory when the provider receives two or more amounts of virtual currency, totaling $10,000 or more, within a consecutive 24-hour window, and the transactions are conducted by the same person or entity on behalf of the same person or entity or for the same beneficiary.</p><p>These reports can be submitted to FINTRAC electronically through the FINTRAC Web Reporting System or FINTRAC API Report Submission. The reporting required for a large virtual currency transaction form includes general information, transaction details, and actions from start to completion.</p><p>General information might cover the reporting entity and the review period for aggregate transactions over 24 hours. The remaining sections must include information about how each transaction is being reported, how the transaction started, and how it was completed.</p> Impact on Cryptocurrency Exchanges and&nbsp;Wallets <p>Crypto service providers must have a well-laid-out compliance program with policies and procedures etched out in the smallest details. Ideally, they should have a person to assess the transactions even when an automated system detects when they have reached a threshold amount.</p><p>Merely having a large transaction reporting system in place is not enough. A system capable of reporting suspicious transactions to FINTRAC is also necessary.</p><p>Another set-up that is needed is robust record-keeping. If the provider has submitted a large virtual currency transaction report to FINTRAC, it must keep a copy for at least five years from the date the report was&nbsp;created.</p><p>Providers are also obligated to verify the identity of persons and entities accurately and timely, following FINTRAC’s sector-specific guidance. Identification is also crucial for determining whether a person or entity is acting on behalf of another person or entity. Providers must also be fully aware of requirements issued under ministerial directives.</p><p>FINTRAC emphasizes shared responsibility in compliance reporting. It allows providers to voluntarily self-declare non-compliance upon identifying such instances.</p> Concluding Thoughts <p>The FATF Travel Rule in Canada imposes stringent compliance demands on cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets, emphasizing transparency and security for transactions over $1,000. This regulation aims to mitigate financial crimes, requiring detailed record-keeping and reporting to uphold a secure digital financial marketplace.</p> FAQs on Crypto Travel Rule&nbsp;Canada  Q1: What is the minimum threshold for the Crypto Travel Rule in&nbsp;Canada? <p>Canada has set a $10,000 threshold for providers to submit a Large Virtual Currency Transaction Report to&nbsp;FINTRAC.</p> Q2: Who needs to register with FINTRAC in&nbsp;Canada? <p>Financial Entities, Money Service Businesses, and Foreign Money Service Businesses must register under FINTRAC and report the travel rule information when they send VC transfers.</p> ‍About Veriscope <p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">‍Veriscope</a>, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

 Generative AI (GenAI) represents a significant technological frontier, impacting cybersecurity landscapes in two primary ways. Its advanced capabilities enable malicious actors to craft sophisticated and convincing fraudulent schemes, from phishing attacks to synthetic audio and video content designed to deceive and exploit. Conversely, GenAI also powers robust fraud detection systems, generating synthetic data that mimics complex fraud scenarios and enhances organizational capabilities to identify and neutralize threats proactively. As businesses navigate the duality of GenAI, advancing cybersecurity measures and regulatory frameworks to harness its potential for good while mitigating risks is crucial. 







<p>The widespread availability and affordability of GenAI tools, combined with global macroeconomic instability, are key drivers behind the significant increase in the volume and velocity of fraud attacks targeting consumers and businesses. The rapid adoption of tools like ChatGPT and FraudGPT, accessible relatively cheaply, has facilitated their use in malicious activities such as creating malware and phishing attacks. This surge in fraudulent activities is further exacerbated by economic downturns, which increase financial pressures and lead to cuts in fraud detection resources within organizations. Recent statistics show a drastic increase in phishing incidents and overall fraud complaints, highlighting the growing challenge of GenAI-enabled fraud in an economically unstable environment.</p>



 Insights into the Impact of Generative AI and Related Fraud Attacks 



 
 <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-for-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note/articleshow/97542869.cms?from=mdr">ChatGPT adoption</a> surpassed 1 million users within 5 days of its launch, now boasting approximately 100 million weekly active users. 



 One-third of cybersecurity experts identified the increase in attack volume and velocity as a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/11/16/rethinking-the-framework-around-identity-security/?sh=1cb8ac0c2017">top GenAI-related threat.</a> 



 Malicious emails and credential phishing <a href="https://slashnext.com/state-of-phishing-2023/">volumes have increased</a> more than 12-fold and nearly tenfold in the past 18 months. 



 Fraud complaints rose from 847,000 in 2021 to 1.1 million in 2022, <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2023_IC3Report.pdf">escalating total losses</a> from $4.2 billion to $10.5 billion. 



 FraudGPT, a GenAI tool capable of generating malicious code and designing phishing pages, is available for as low as $90 monthly. 



 93% of financial institutions plan to <a href="https://b2b.mastercard.com/news-and-insights/blog/industry-perspectives-on-ai-and-transaction-fraud-detection/">invest in AI for fraud prevention</a> in the next 2-5 years 
 



 GenAI Market Trends and Challenges&nbsp; 



<p>GenAI’s dual nature significantly influences cybersecurity, with fraudsters using it to enhance their fraudulent schemes, including phishing and social engineering, by creating more convincing and sophisticated attacks. Tools like FraudGPT can write malicious code, generate malware, and create phishing pages, dramatically increasing phishing activities.</p>



<p>Solution providers are also adopting GenAI to strengthen defenses against such threats. Its ability to generate synthetic datasets allows for better training and improvement of risk and decision models, as evidenced by the growing demand among financial institutions planning substantial investments in AI for fraud prevention.</p>



<p>Despite its growing adoption, GenAI faces challenges like the unpredictable nature of new disruptive technologies, accessibility issues, a lack of regulatory oversight, and insufficient education and awareness about its capabilities and risks. These factors complicate the management of GenAI’s impact on fraud detection and prevention.</p>



 Strategies for Strengthening Defenses Against GenAI-driven Fraud

 What is GenAI? 



<p>Generative AI (GenAI) is a type of artificial intelligence that can autonomously create new content such as audio, images, text, and videos. Unlike traditional AI, which follows strict rules or patterns for specific tasks, GenAI uses neural networks and deep learning to produce original content based on patterns in data it has learned. This capability is increasingly integrated into everyday applications. Still, it poses risks, such as enhancing the effectiveness of phishing and social engineering attacks by scammers exploiting GenAI to create convincingly fake communications.GenAI also offers tools for enhancing fraud prevention. It enables the creation of synthetic data samples that mimic real-life fraud scenarios, helping to train and improve fraud detection systems, thus preparing solution providers to better recognize and react to emerging fraudulent techniques.</p>

<p>The KILT team has completed all milestones of the Polkadot Treasury Grant for developing the Decentralized Identity Provider (DIP), and DIP is now ready for use. Using DIP, any chain can become an identity provider, and any parachain (and, in the future, external chains) can integrate KILT and / or other identity providers for their identity&nbsp;needs.</p><p>The Decentralized Identity Provider (DIP) enables a ground-breaking cross-chain decentralized identity system inspired by the functionality of OpenID. This means that parachains requiring an identity solution don’t need to build their own infrastructure. Instead, they can leverage the infrastructure DIP provides. DIP is open-source, and you can integrate it with existing Polkadot-compatible runtimes with minimal changes and without affecting the fee model of the relying&nbsp;party.</p> DIP Actors <p>DIP has three key roles: the identity provider, the relying party or consumer, and the&nbsp;user.</p><p>The identity provider is any blockchain with an identity system that makes it available for other chains, e.g., KILT Protocol, Litentry, etc.</p><p>The relying party or “consumer” is any blockchain that has chosen to delegate identity management to the provider, thus relieving it of needing to maintain its identity infrastructure.</p><p>The user is an entity with an identity on the provider chain and wants to use it on other chains without setting up a new identity on&nbsp;each.</p><p>The process begins with a user setting up their identity on an identity provider chain, for instance, KILT, by making a transaction. Once an identity completes that transaction, they can share that identity with any relying party chain that uses that provider, eliminating the need for further interaction with the identity provider unless changes are made to the user’s identity information.</p><p>Relying parties (e.g., parachains) can choose one or more identity providers. As in the case of accepting multiple social logins such as Google and Facebook, this allows them to access the information graph that each identity provider has previously built.</p> The Tech <p>DIP provides a suite of components available for integration:</p>  A set of pallets for deployment on any chain that wants to act as an identity provider. These allow accounts on the consumer chain to commit identity information, storing such representation in the provider chain’s&nbsp;state.  A set of pallets to deploy on any chain that wants to act as an identity-relaying or consumer party. These take care of validating cross-chain identity proofs provided by the subject and dispatch the actual call once the proof is verified.  A set of support crates, suitable for use within a chain runtime, for types and traits the provider and relying partys can&nbsp;use.  <p>These components enable the use of state proofs for information sharing between&nbsp;chains.</p><p>Identity on KILT is built around W3C-standard decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials. Using KILT as an example, the following is a streamlined version of the process for using&nbsp;DIP:</p><p>Step 1. A user sets up their identity on KILT by generating their unique DID and anchoring it on the KILT blockchain.</p><p>Step 2. Credentials issued to that user contain their DID. The user keeps their credentials on their device, and the KILT blockchain stores a hash of each credential.</p><p>Step 3. To use the services of the relying party (in this example, any chain using KILT as their identity provider), the user prepares their identity via a transaction that results in their identity information committed to the chain state of KILT. After this point, the user doesn’t need to interact with KILT for each operation.</p><p>Step 4. The relying or “consumer” party can verify the identity proofs provided by the User. Once verified, the relaying party can dispatch a call and grant the user access to their services.</p> Advantages of&nbsp;DIP <p>DIP offers several significant advantages, including:</p>  Portability of Identities<br>Traditionally, users would need to create a separate identity for each application. However, with DIP, identities become portable. This means someone can use a single identity across multiple applications or platforms. This simplifies the user experience and maintains consistency of user identity across different platforms.  Focus on core competencies<br>Blockchain networks can focus on their core functionalities and strengths instead of investing resources into developing and maintaining an identity system. Instead, they can delegate identity management to other chains that specialize in it, effectively increasing efficiency.  Simplified Management of Identity for Users<br>Users can manage and update their identity in a single place, i.e., via their identity provider, even though the system is decentralized. This simplifies identity management for users, as they do not have to update their information on each platform separately.  Decoupling of Identities and Accounts<br>With many systems, a user’s identity is closely tied to their account, potentially enabling the tracking or profiling of users based on their account activity. Because DIP is linked to the user’s DID — the core of their identity — rather than their account address, DIP allows for identities to be separate from accounts, increasing privacy and flexibility. The user can then choose which accounts to link their identity to (if any) across several parachains and ecosystems, retaining control over their information disclosure.   KILT as an Identity&nbsp;Provider <p>KILT Protocol is consistently aligned with the latest <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">standards</a> in the decentralized identity&nbsp;space.</p><p>On top of these, additional KILT features such as <a href="https://www.kilt.io/services/web3name">web3names</a> (unique, user-friendly names to represent a DID) and <a href="https://www.kilt.io/services/account-linking">linked accounts</a> make it easier for users to establish a cross-chain identity.</p><p>Users may also build their identity by adding <a href="https://www.kilt.io/identity/verifiable-credentials">verifiable credentials</a> from trusted&nbsp;parties.</p><p>By integrating KILT as an identity provider, the relying party gains access to all the identity information shared by the user while giving the user control over their data. This ensures a robust and comprehensive identity management solution.</p> Start Integrating <p>Relying party:</p>  Decide on the format of your identity proofs and how verification works with your identity&nbsp;provider  Add the DIP consumer pallet as a dependency in your chain&nbsp;runtime  Configure the required Config trait according to your needs and the information agreed on with the&nbsp;provider  Deploy it on your chain, along with any additional pallets the identity provider requires.  <p><a href="https://docs.kilt.io/docs/concepts/dip/what-is-dip">(read KILT pallet documentation</a>)</p><p>Identity provider:</p>  Check out the pallet and&nbsp;traits  Agree on the format of your identity proofs and how verification works with your relying&nbsp;party  Customize the DIP provider pallet with your identity primitives and deploy it on your&nbsp;chain  For ease of integration, you may also customize the DIP consumer pallet for your consumers.   What’s next? <p>Now that DIP is up and running, in the next stages, the team will continue to refine privacy-preserving ways to make KILT credentials available to blockchain runtimes. These will include improvements in proof size and proof verification efficiency and support for on-chain credential verification (or representation thereof). With DIP in the hands of the community, DIP’s users and community will guide future development.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p>KILT is an identity blockchain for generating decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials, enabling secure, practical identity solutions for enterprises and consumers. KILT brings the traditional process of trust in real-world credentials (passport, driver’s license) to the digital world while keeping data private and in possession of its&nbsp;owner.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol/unchaining-identity-decentralized-identity-provider-dip-enables-cross-chain-solutions-ba0baa1e68d0">Unchaining Identity: Decentralized Identity Provider (DIP) Enables Cross-Chain Solutions</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/kilt-protocol">kilt-protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Nitish Deshpande</a></p><p>Oracle Access Governance is a cloud-native IGA solution which runs in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Oracle Access Governance can also run alongside Oracle Identity Governance in a hybrid deployment model to provide identity analytics from the cloud for Oracle Identity Governance customers. It serves as a one-stop shop for identity orchestration, user provisioning, access review, access control, compliance, and multi cloud governance. It offers a mobile-friendly, cloud-native governance solution. It can detect and remediate high-risk privileges by enforcing internal access audit policies to identify orphaned accounts, unauthorized access, and privileges. This helps improve compliance with regulatory requirements. With the capacity to manage millions of identities, Oracle suggests it is suitable for enterprise level organizational needs.</p>
 User Provisioning 
<p>Setting up this governance solution has two options. It can be done through connectors for systems easily accessible and for disconnected applications that cannot directly connect with Oracle Access Governance or are behind firewall systems, Oracle provides a one-time connector which can be downloaded by the administrator. The connector establishes the integration with the target system to securely sends and receives encrypted data to Oracle Access Governance. The connector continuously polls for access remediation decisions from Oracle Access Governance. The user interface provides detailed status updates for each connected system, including data load status and duration. In the latest update, Oracle Access Governance introduces new capabilities that focus on provisioning, identity orchestration, identity reconciliation and prescriptive analytics.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Identity provisioning and reconciliation</p>
<p>Oracle Access Governance’s identity orchestration makes use of identity provisioning and reconciliation capabilities along with schema handling, correlation, and transformations. The update provides comprehensive features for account provisioning by allowing users to create accounts by leveraging outbound transformation rules and assigning them appropriate permissions to access downstream applications and systems. The Access Governance platform can also perform reconciliation by synchronizing user accounts and their permissions from integrated applications and systems. Oracle suggests this will also support handling ownership to reduce orphan and rogue accounts effectively. Oracle suggests business owners can either manually address these orphaned accounts or allocate orphaned accounts to specific identities, followed by regular review cycles for these assigned accounts. Additionally, event-based reviews can be set up to automatically assess rogue and orphaned accounts as soon as they are detected within an integrated application or system.</p>
<p>Oracle’s Access Governance platform can also support authoritative source reconciliation from systems such as HRMS, AD, LDAP for onboarding, updating, and deleting identities through identity reconciliation. This solution combines identity provisioning and reconciliation capabilities, supported by robust integration. Whether it's for on-premises or cloud-based workloads, Oracle Access Governance offers a reliable framework for managing identity and access effectively.</p>
 Access reviews 
<p>Oracle Access Governance offers intelligent access review campaigns using AI and ML driven prescriptive analytics for periodic and micro certifications. These analytics provide insights and recommendations to proactively manage access governance and ensure compliance effectively.</p>
<p>Oracle Access Governance offers a robust suite of features for access review for management of user permissions. The solution has manual access review campaigns that provides admins with a wizard-based interface for campaign creation. Oracle has also leveraged machine learning for managing reviews by providing deep analytics and recommendations. Oracle suggests that this will simplify the approval and denial of access. The platform also offers flexibility of scheduling periodic access review campaigns for compliance purposes. Oracle mentions this will streamline the process of auditing user permissions at regular intervals. Event-based micro certifications are also supported for limiting the certification of affected identities. Oracle has incorporated pre-built and customizable codeless workflows which are based on a simple wizard.</p>
<p>Moreover, administrators can set up ad hoc or periodic access review campaigns. The platform provides a granular approach for selecting criteria for access reviews. The identities can configure workflows according to their requirements or leverage AI and machine learning algorithms to suggest workflows based on certification history of related identities. The user interface for admins is modern and has features to review, download, and create reports on access review campaigns.</p>
 Conclusion 
<p>Oracle Access Governance continues to reinforce its identity and access management capabilities. With the ability to conduct micro-certifications instead of traditional certifications every six months, Oracle suggests their platform is well placed for streamlining governance procedures.</p>
<p>By leveraging cloud infrastructure, Oracle Access Governance is on track to support operations as well as facilitating integration with applications such as Cerner for auditing and compliance purposes. They plan monthly release cycle to their access governance platform &nbsp;with the latest features and enhancements. Oracle wants to provide visibility into access permissions across the enterprise using their dashboards which can be tailored based on requirements of business users. Furthermore, Oracle suggests this platform can be useful for CISOs by offering top-down or bottom-up consolidated views of access permissions across the enterprise.</p>

From personalized recommendations to medical diagnosis, AI’s impact is undeniable. However, alongside its potential lies a looming concern: data privacy. Traditional AI models typically rely on centralized data storage and centralized computation, raising concerns about ownership, control, and potential misuse.</p><p>See part 1 of this series <a href="https://news.verida.io/top-three-data-privacy-issues-facing-ai-today-1503e50b65bd">Top Three Data Privacy Issues Facing AI Today</a>, for a breakdown of key privacy issues which we will explain how web3 can help alleviate these problems.</p><p>The emergence of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) are a linchpin for providing privacy preserving decentralized infrastructure to power the next generation of large language models&nbsp;(LLMs).</p><p>At a high level, DePINs can provide access to decentralized computation and storage resources that are beyond the control of any single organization. If this computation and storage can be built in such a way that it is privacy preserving; ie: those operating the infrastructure have no access to underlying data or computation occurring, this is an incredibly robust foundation for privacy preserving AI.</p><p>Let’s dive deeper into how that would look, when addressing the top three data privacy&nbsp;issues.</p> Privacy of user&nbsp;prompts <p>Safeguarding privacy of user prompts has become an increasingly critical concern in the world of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>An end user can initiate a connection with a LLM hosted within a decentralized privacy-prserving compute engine called a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), which provides a public encryption key. The end user encrypts their AI prompts using that public key and sends the encrypted prompts to the secure&nbsp;LLM.</p><p>Within this privacy-preserving environment, the encrypted prompts undergo decryption using a key only known by the TEE. This specialized infrastructure is designed to uphold the confidentiality and integrity of user data throughout the computation process.</p><p>Subsequently, the decrypted prompts are fed into the LLM for processing. The LLM generates responses based on the decrypted prompts without ever revealing the original, unencrypted input to any party beyond the authorized entities. This ensures that sensitive information remains confidential and inaccessible to any unauthorized parties, including the infrastructure owner.</p><p>By employing such privacy-preserving measures, users can engage with AI systems confidently, knowing that their data remains protected and their privacy upheld throughout the interaction. This approach not only enhances trust between users and AI systems but also aligns with evolving regulatory frameworks aimed at safeguarding personal&nbsp;data.</p> Privacy of custom trained AI&nbsp;models <p>In a similar fashion, decentralized technology can be used to protect the privacy of custom-trained AI models that are leveraging proprietary data and sensitive information.</p><p>This starts with preparing and curating the training dataset in a manner that mitigates the risk of exposing sensitive information. Techniques such as data anonymization, differential privacy, and federated learning can be employed to anonymize or decentralize the data, thereby minimizing the potential for privacy breaches.</p><p>Next, an end user with a custom-trained Language Model (LLM) safeguards its privacy by encrypting the model before uploading it to a decentralized Trusted Execution Environment.</p><p>Once the encrypted custom-trained LLM is uploaded to the privacy-preserving compute engine, the infrastructure decrypts it using keys known only to TEE. This decryption process occurs within the secure confines of the compute engine, ensuring that the confidentiality of the model remains&nbsp;intact.</p><p>Throughout the training process, the privacy-preserving compute engine facilitates secure communication between the end user’s infrastructure and any external parties involved in the training process, ensuring that sensitive data remains encrypted and confidential at all times. In a decentralized world, this data sharing infrastructure and communication will likely exist on a highly secure and fast protocol such as the <a href="https://substack.com/redirect/830eba0d-a598-4471-bb5e-9591163cf98f?j=eyJ1IjoiMWVtbGwwIn0.hH-ixEtng8leUm5PEghR3rkdvO0GQ5tCHF_2mjj2ff4">Verida&nbsp;Network</a>.</p><p>By adopting a privacy-preserving approach to model training, organizations can mitigate the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access while fostering trust among users and stakeholders. This commitment to privacy not only aligns with regulatory requirements but also reflects a dedication to ethical AI practices in an increasingly data-centric landscape.</p> Private data to train&nbsp;AI <p>AI models are only as good as the data they have access to. The vast majority of data is generated on behalf of, or by, individuals. This data is immensely valuable for training AI models, but must be protected at all costs due to its sensitivity.</p><p>End users can safeguard their private information by encrypting it into private training datasets before submission to a LLM training program. This process ensures that the underlying data remains confidential throughout the training&nbsp;phase.</p><p>Operating within a privacy-preserving compute engine, the LLM training program decrypts the encrypted training data for model training purposes while upholding the integrity and confidentiality of the original data. This approach mirrors the principles applied in safeguarding user prompts, wherein the privacy-preserving computation facilitates secure decryption and utilization of the data without exposing its contents to unauthorized parties.</p><p>By leveraging encrypted training data, organizations and individuals can harness the power of AI model training while mitigating the risks associated with data exposure. This approach enables the development of AI models tailored to specific use cases, such as utilizing personal health data to train LLMs for healthcare research applications or crafting hyper-personalized LLMs for individual use cases, such as digital AI assistants.</p><p>Following the completion of training, the resulting LLM holds valuable insights and capabilities derived from the encrypted training data, yet the original data remains confidential and undisclosed. This ensures that sensitive information remains protected, even as the AI model becomes operational and begins to deliver&nbsp;value.</p><p>To further bolster privacy and control over the trained LLM, organizations and individuals can leverage platforms like the <a href="https://substack.com/redirect/830eba0d-a598-4471-bb5e-9591163cf98f?j=eyJ1IjoiMWVtbGwwIn0.hH-ixEtng8leUm5PEghR3rkdvO0GQ5tCHF_2mjj2ff4">Verida Network</a>. Here, the trained model can be securely stored, initially under the private control of the end user who created it. Utilizing Verida’s permission tools, users retain the ability to manage access to the LLM, granting permissions to other users as desired. Additionally, users may choose to monetize access to their trained models by charging others with crypto tokens for accessing and utilizing the model’s capabilities.</p> About Chris <p>Chris Were is the CEO of <a href="http://verida.io/">Verida</a>, a decentralized, self-sovereign data network that empowers individuals to control their digital identity and personal data.

<p>For the past month, we have been working closely with ten customers who have been helping us build something that solves their Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) problems. We call them our Lighthouse customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are smart folks at companies who are either “Unexpected Google Admin”, Solo-IT team, and/or HR. We have been working with them to figure out how they can move away from manual checklists and spreadsheets that manage their: onboarding, offboarding (or provisioning, de-provisioning), and access requests.</p>
<p>(If this sounds like you, you might qualify to climb into the next Lighthouse group.)</p>
<p>We’re working with them to replace their checklists and spreadsheets with something smarter – YeshLists.</p>
<p>A YeshList template is a pattern for a smart checklist. It’s kind of like a task template–the kind that you might create in Asana, Notion, or Google Sheets, but smarter. It does some of the automation and orchestration of getting the task list done for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You make a Yesh template by listing the steps for an activity–say onboarding or offboarding, YeshID can automate tasks within Google Workspaces like ”Create a new Google Account” or “Lock Workspace.” Or they can be automated outside Google Workspaces, like “Send welcome email.” Or they can be delegated, like “Have the Slack Admin set this person up for the Slack channels needed for a new hire in marketing.” Or manual like “Order a Yubikey” or “Send them a welcome swag box.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s an example of an Onboarding template. Notice that the YeshID template is smart enough to make the dates relative to the start date.</p>
<p>Here’s what a YeshList template looks like:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once you’ve got a template customized to your organization–or even to a particular department–and someone is ready to start you put in the person’s name, start date, and some other information, and YeshID will create a YeshList from a template.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then, it will&nbsp; RUN the template for you. If a task is automated (like some of the Google tasks we mentioned above), YeshID will make it happen when it’s supposed to happen. So think “I don’t need to sit in front of the computer at exactly 5 pm and suspend Joe from Google Workspace.” You can trust that YeshID will do it for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If we cannot automate a task–like reclaiming a license or de-provisioning–we route the request to the person responsible for the task and ask them to respond when it is completed. And when they respond, we mark it as done.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But wait, there’s more! In addition to helping you ensure someone is offboarded or onboarded properly, we will automatically update our access grid so that you can use it for compliance purposes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally, we have an end-user view that lets your employees see what applications they have access to and request access to apps they don’t have. This will help you track access for compliance purposes and make sure they are properly offboarded from the apps they have access to upon departure from the company.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We are looking for anyone who:</p>
 
 Uses Google Workspace 
 Works at a company between 10-400 employees 
 Holds the responsibility of IT, Security, HR, compliance (or some combination thereof) in their job description 
 (not requirement, but bonus) Have SOC2 or other compliance requirements 
 
<p>..to work with us to setup YeshID in your environment. We’d love to show you how you can be more efficient, secure, and compliant with us!<br>
</p>
<p>If you are interested, please reach out to <a href="mailto:support@yeshid.com">support@yeshid.com</a>. Of course, you are always welcome to sign up in your own time <a href="http://www.yeshid.com/onboard">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As interdisciplinary designers Che and Ross explain, prevailing technology too often serves narrow corporate interests rather than the empowerment of communities. Yet lessons from diverse, decentralized ecosystems demonstrate that more holistic models for catalyzing economics are aligned with collective thriving.</p><p>Just as living systems are circular, we must redesign digital infrastructure to nurture regeneration rather than extracting from the system.&nbsp;</p><p>In our interview with Che and Ross, we learned that by applying principles of interdependence and circularity, technology can shift from concentrating power to cultivating mutually beneficial prosperity.&nbsp;</p> Ingredients for Regenerative Value Flows <p>To build technology capable of empowering communities, we must look to the wisdom found in living systems that have sustained life on this planet for billions of years. As Ross explains:</p><blockquote>“Regenerative systems are living systems. And living systems tend to be characterized by things like circular value flows. It's like recycling, nutrients and resources, and energy. They tend to be diverse, and there’s a diversity of forms that allows it to adapt to complex, changing environments. And evolution in that, I think, is learning about information and feedback loops.”</blockquote><p>These properties allow ecosystems to be “both intensely resilient and creatively generative at the same time — maintaining integrity through shifts while allowing novelty to emerge.</p><p>Taken together, these key ingredients include:</p>  Diversity: A variety of components and perspectives allows greater adaptability. Monocultures quickly become fragile.  Interdependence: Rather than isolated parts, living systems work through symbiotic relationships where waste from one process becomes food for the next in closed nutrient loops.  Circularity: Resources cycle continuously through systems in balanced rhythms, more akin to the water cycle than a production line. Renewable inputs and outputs avoid depletion.  Feedback loops: Mechanisms for self-correction through learning. Information flows enable adaptation to dynamic conditions.  <p>Technology typically pursues narrow aims without acknowledging the repercussions outside corporate interests. However, by studying ecological patterns and the deeper properties that sustain them, we can envision digital infrastructure aligned with collective prosperity across interconnected systems.&nbsp;</p> Starting the Shift to Regenerative Models <p>The extractive practices prevalent in mainstream economics have fundamentally different outcomes compared to the circular, regenerative flows seen in natural systems. Commons-based peer production is one way to more closely align with natural systems, yet shifting the entrenched infrastructure rooted in exploitation presents an immense challenge.</p><p>As Che recognizes, the tension of, “incubating Commons-oriented projects” lies in “interfacing with a capital-driven system without the projects being subsumed by that system, in a way that suffocates the intuitions of the commons.”</p><p>Technology builders, of course, face a choice: will new solutions concentrate power further into existing hierarchies of control or distribute agency towards collective empowerment? Each application encodes certain assumptions and values into its architecture.</p><p>Creating regenerative systems therefore requires what some refer to as “transvestment” — deliberately rechanneling resources out of extractive systems into regenerative alternatives aligned with the common good.</p><p>As Ross points out:&nbsp;</p><blockquote>“Capital actually needs to be tamed, utilized, because that's where all sorts of value is stored. And that's how we get these projects started and going. But if you're not able to sort of turn them under new Commons-oriented logics, then it escapes.”</blockquote><p>Grassroots projects cultivating local resilience while connecting to global knowledge flows demonstrate this paradigm shift. For example, <a href="https://farmhack.org/tools?ref=blog.holochain.org">Farm Hack</a> uses open source collaboration to freely share sustainable agriculture innovations.</p><p>So as solutions centered on human needs gain traction, the tide may turn towards nurturing collective prosperity.</p> Nurturing Collective Knowledge <p>As Che and Ross explained, extractive technology dumps value into corporate coffers while frequently compromising user privacy and autonomy. In contrast, thriving systems empower broad participation at individual and collective levels simultaneously.</p><p>For instance, public data funneled through proprietary algorithms often fuels asymmetric AI rather than equitably enriching shared understanding. "Data is being locked up,” Che explains. </p><blockquote>“And that puts a lot of power in the hands of a very small group."</blockquote><p>Yet human instincts lean towards cooperation and collective learning. Wikipedia stands out as a remarkable example of voluntary collaboration in service of the commons.</p><p>“It demonstrates how willing and how fundamental it is for humans to share, to share knowledge and information and contribute towards the commons,” Ross notes. Rather than reduce users to passive consumers, it connects personal growth to universal betterment.</p><p>At their best, technologies can thus amplify innate human capacities for cumulative innovation and participatory sensemaking.</p><p>By structuring information as nourishing circulations, technology can shift toward cultivating empathy; from addicting users to advertised products to aligning connectivity with meaning.&nbsp;</p><p>Holochain was built to enable this kind of circular value flow, connecting users, resisting centralizing tendencies, and enabling the Commons.</p><p>We hope our data and digital traces might then grow communal wisdom rather than being captured and used to control.</p>

<p>Traditional identity verification methods show their age, often proving susceptible to data breaches and inefficiencies. Blockchain emerges as a beacon of hope in this scenario, heralding a new era of enhanced data security, transparency, and user-centric control to manage digital identities. This article delves deep into blockchain’s transformative potential in identity verification, highlighting its advantages and the challenges it adeptly addresses.</p>
 
What is Blockchain? 
<p>Blockchain technology represents the decentralized storage of a digital ledger of transactions. Distributed across a network of computers, decentralized storage of this ledger ensures that every transaction gets recorded in multiple places. The decentralized nature of blockchain technology ensures that no single entity controls the entire blockchain, and all transactions are transparent to every user.</p>
 
Types of Blockchains: Public vs. Private 
<p>Blockchain technology can be categorized into two primary types: public and private. Public blockchains are open networks where anyone can participate and view transactions. This transparency ensures security and trust but can raise privacy concerns. In contrast, private blockchains are controlled by specific organizations or consortia and restrict access to approved members only. This restricted access offers enhanced privacy and control, making private blockchains suitable for businesses that require confidentiality and secure data management.</p>
 
Brief history and definition 
<p>The concept of a distributed ledger technology, a blockchain, was first introduced in 2008 by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Initially, it was the underlying technology for the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. The primary goal was to create a decentralized currency, independent of retaining control of any central authority, that could be transferred electronically in a secure, verifiable, and immutable way. Over time, the potential applications of blockchain have expanded far beyond cryptocurrency. Today, it is the backbone for various applications, from supply chain and blockchain identity management solutions to voting systems.</p>
 
Core principles 
<p>Blockchain operates on a few core principles. Firstly, it’s decentralized, meaning no single entity or organization controls the entire chain. Instead, multiple participants (nodes) hold copies of the whole blockchain. Secondly, transactions are transparent. Every transaction is visible to anyone who has access to the system. Lastly, once data is recorded on a blockchain, it becomes immutable. This means that it cannot be altered without altering all subsequent blocks, which requires the consensus of most of the blockchain network.</p>
 
The Need for Improved Identity Verification 
<p>Identity verification is a cornerstone for many online processes, from banking to online shopping. However, traditional methods of identity verification could be more challenging. They often rely on centralized databases of sensitive information, making them vulnerable to data breaches. Moreover, these methods prove identity and often require users to share personal details repeatedly, increasing the risk of data theft or misuse.</p>
 
Current challenges in digital identity 
<p>Digital credentials and identity systems today face multiple challenges. Centralized systems are prime targets for hackers. A single breach can expose the personal data of millions of users. Additionally, users often need to manage multiple usernames and passwords across various platforms, leading to password fatigue and increased vulnerability. There’s also the issue of privacy. Centralized digital identities and credentials systems often share user data with third parties, sometimes without the user’s explicit consent.</p>
 
Cost of identity theft and fraud 
<p>The implications of identity theft and fraud are vast. It can lead to financial loss, credit damage, and a long recovery process for individuals. For businesses, a breach of sensitive information can result in significant financial losses, damage to business risks, reputation, and loss of customer trust. According to reports, the annual cost of identity theft and fraud runs into billions of dollars globally, affecting individuals and corporations.</p>
 
How Blockchain Addresses Identity Verification 
<p>Blockchain offers a fresh approach to identity verification. By using digital signatures and leveraging its decentralized, transparent, and immutable nature, blockchain technology can provide a more secure and efficient way to verify identity without traditional methods’ pitfalls.</p>
 
Decentralized Identity 
<p>Decentralized identity systems on the blockchain give users complete control over their identity data. Users can provide proof of their identity directly from a blockchain instead of relying on a central authority to keep medical records and verify identity. This reduces the risk of a centralized data breach and gives users autonomy over their identities and personal data.</p>
 Transparency and Trust 
<p>Blockchain technology fosters trust through transparency, but the scope of this transparency varies significantly between public and private blockchains. Public blockchains allow an unparalleled level of openness, where every transaction is visible to all, promoting trust through verifiable openness. On the other hand, private blockchains offer a selective transparency that is accessible only to its participants. This feature maintains trust among authorized users and ensures that sensitive information remains protected from the public eye, aligning with privacy and corporate security requirements.</p>
 Immutability 
<p>Once identity data is recorded on a blockchain, it cannot be altered without consensus. This immutability of sensitive, personally identifiable information ensures that identity data remains consistent and trustworthy. It also prevents malicious actors from changing identity data for fraudulent purposes.</p>
 
Smart Contracts 
<p>Smart contracts automate processes on the blockchain. In identity verification, smart contracts can automatically verify a user’s bank account’s identity when certain conditions are met, eliminating the need for manual verification of bank accounts and reducing the often time-consuming process and potential for human error.</p>
 
Benefits of Blockchain Identity Verification 
<p>Blockchain’s unique attributes offer a transformative approach to identity verification, addressing many of the challenges faced by the traditional identity systems’ instant verification methods.</p>
 
Enhanced Security 
<p>Traditional identity verification systems, being centralized, are vulnerable to single points of failure. If a hacker gains access, the entire system can be compromised. Blockchain, with its decentralized nature, eliminates this single point of failure. Each transaction is encrypted and linked to the previous one. This cryptographic linkage ensures that even if one block is tampered with, it would be immediately evident, making unauthorized alterations nearly impossible.</p>
 
User Control 
<p>Centralized identity systems often store user data in silos, giving organizations control over individual data. Blockchain shifts this control back to users. With decentralized identity solutions, individuals can choose when, how, and with whom they share their personal information. This not only enhances data security and privacy but also reduces the risk of data being mishandled or misused by third parties.</p>
 
Reduced Costs 
<p>Identity verification, especially in sectors like finance, can be costly. Manual verification processes, paperwork, and the infrastructure needed to support centralized databases contribute to these costs. Blockchain can automate many of these processes using smart contracts, reducing the need for intermediaries and manual interventions and leading to significant cost savings.</p>
 
Interoperability 
<p>In today’s digital landscape, individuals often have their digital identities and personal data scattered across various platforms, each with its verification process. Blockchain can create a unified, interoperable system where one’s digital identity documents can be used across multiple platforms once verified on one platform. This not only enhances user convenience but also streamlines processes for businesses.</p>
 
The Mechanics Behind Blockchain Identity Verification 
<p>Understanding its underlying mechanics is crucial to appreciating the benefits of the entire blockchain network’s ability for identity verification.</p>
 
How cryptographic hashing works 
<p>Cryptographic hashing is at the heart of the blockchain network’s various security measures. When a transaction occurs, it’s converted into a fixed-size string of numbers and letters using a hash function. This unique hash is nearly impossible to reverse-engineer. When a new block is created, it contains the previous block’s hash, creating a blockchain. Any alteration in a block changes its hash, breaking the chain and alerting the system to potential tampering.</p>
 
Public and private keys in identity verification 
<p>Blockchain uses a combination of public and private keys to ensure secure transactions. A public key is a user’s address on the blockchain, while a private key is secret information that allows them to initiate trades. Only individuals with the correct private key can access and share their data for identity verification, ensuring their data integrity and security.</p>
 
The role of consensus algorithms 
<p>Consensus algorithms are protocols that consider a transaction valid based on the agreement of the majority of participants in the network. They play a crucial role in maintaining the trustworthiness of the blockchain. In identity verification, consensus algorithms ensure that once a user’s identity data is added to the blockchain, it’s accepted and recognized by the majority, ensuring data accuracy and trustworthiness.</p>
 
Challenges and Concerns 
<p>While blockchain offers transformative potential for identity verification, it’s essential to understand the challenges, key benefits, and concerns associated with its adoption.</p>
 
Scalability 
<p>One of the primary challenges facing blockchain technology is scalability. As the number of transactions on a blockchain increases, so does the time required to process and validate them. This could mean delays in identity verification, especially if the system is adopted on a large scale. Solutions like off-chain transactions and layer two protocols are being developed to address this, but it remains a concern.</p>
 
Privacy Concerns 
<p>While blockchain offers enhanced security, the level of privacy depends on whether the blockchain is public or private. In public blockchains, the transparency of transactions means that every action is visible to anyone on the network, which can compromise user privacy. Conversely, private blockchains control access and visibility of transactions to authorized participants only, significantly mitigating privacy risks. This controlled transparency is important in environments where confidentiality is paramount, leveraging blockchain’s security benefits without exposing sensitive data to the public.</p>
 
Regulatory and Legal Issues 
<p>The decentralized nature of blockchain challenges traditional regulatory frameworks. Different countries have varying stances on blockchain and its applications, leading only to a fragmented regulatory landscape; for businesses looking to adopt blockchain for identity verification and online services, navigating this complex regulatory environment can take time and effort.</p>
 
Adoption Barriers 
<p>Despite its benefits and technological advancements, blockchain faces skepticism. Many businesses need help to adopt a relatively new technology, especially when it challenges established processes. Additionally, the need for a standardized framework for blockchain identity management and verification and a complete ecosystem overhaul can deter many from its adoption.</p>
 
Blockchain Identity Verification Standards and Protocols 
<p>For blockchain-based identity verification to gain widespread acceptance, there’s a need for standardized protocols and frameworks.</p>
 
Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) 
<p>The Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) is an alliance of companies, financial institutions, educational institutions, and organizations working together to develop a unified, interoperable ecosystem for decentralized blockchain enables and identity solutions. Their work includes creating specifications, protocols, and tools to ensure that blockchain-based identity solutions are consistent, reliable, and trustworthy.</p>
 
Self-sovereign identity principles 
<p>Self-sovereign identity is a concept where individuals have ownership and control over their data without relying on a centralized database or authorities to verify identities. The principles of self-sovereign identity emphasize user control, transparency, interoperability, and consent. Blockchain’s inherent attributes align well with these principles, making it an ideal technology for realizing self-sovereign digital identity.</p>
 
Popular blockchain identity protocols 
<p>Several protocols aim to standardize blockchain identity verification. Some notable ones include DID (Decentralized Identifiers), which provides a new type of decentralized identifier created, owned, and controlled by the subject of the digital identity, and Verifiable Credentials, which allow individuals to share proofs of personal data without revealing the actual data.</p>
<p>Through its unique attributes, blockchain presents a compelling and transformative alternative to the pitfalls of conventional identity management and verification systems. By championing security, decentralization, and user empowerment, it sets a new standard for the future of digital and blockchain identity and access management solutions. To understand how this can redefine your identity management and verification processes, book a call with us today and embark on a journey toward a more secure security posture.</p>

  <p>We’re excited to announce the general availability of Microsoft Graph activity logs! Microsoft Graph activity logs give you visibility into HTTP requests made to the Microsoft Graph service in your tenant. With rapidly growing security threats and an increasing number of attacks, this log data source allows you to perform security analysis, threat hunting, and monitor application activity in your tenant. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some common use cases include:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 
 Identifying the activities that a compromised user account conducted in your tenant.&nbsp; 
 Building detections and behavioral analysis to identify suspicious or anomalous use of Microsoft Graph APIs, such as an application enumerating all users, or making probing requests with many 403 errors.&nbsp; 
 Investigating unexpected or unnecessarily privileged assignments of application permissions.&nbsp; 
 Identifying problematic or unexpected behaviors for client applications, such as extreme call volumes that cause throttling for the tenant.&nbsp; 
 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’re currently able to collect sign-in logs to analyze authentication activity and audit logs to see changes to important resources. With Microsoft Graph activity logs, you can now investigate the complete picture of activity in your tenant – from token request in sign-in logs, to API request activity (reads, writes, and deletes) in Microsoft Graph activity logs, to ultimate resource changes in audit logs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Figure 1: Microsoft Graph activity logs in Log Analytics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

And how to thwart the asymmetric advantage of the fraudster?</p>

<p>Shyft Network is excited to announce that Giottus, one of India’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, has integrated Shyft Veriscope as its FATF Travel Rule Solution. Giottus’ decision to choose Shyft Veriscope proves once again that Veriscope is one of the most trusted and effective Travel Rule Solutions among VASPs worldwide.</p><p>This strategic partnership establishes Veriscope, the Shyft Network’s one-of-a-kind compliance technology solution, as a leader in the secure exchange of personally identifiable information (PII) for frictionless Travel Rule compliance. The collaboration is timely, aligning with India’s new crypto regulatory measures, which <a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/guide-to-fatf-travel-rule-compliance-in-india">include the FATF Travel Rule</a> that the country implemented in&nbsp;2023.</p> Why did Giottus Choose Veriscope? <p>As an entity already reporting to India’s Financial Intelligence Unit and an Alliance of Reporting Entities for AML/CFT (ARIFAC) member, Giottus must take a more efficient approach to Travel Rule compliance, and Veriscope facilitates this with its streamlined and automated system.</p><p>Moreover, by adopting Veriscope, Giottus is positioned advantageously over other Indian VASPs, which may still rely on manual means to collect Travel Rule information, such as Google Forms and email. These traditional methods are less efficient and user-friendly compared to Veriscope’s automated and privacy-oriented approach.</p><p>Speaking about Giottus’ integration with Shyft Veriscope, Zach Justein, Veriscope co-founder, said:</p><blockquote>“Giottus’ integration of Veriscope as its Travel Rule Solution demonstrates the unique advantages it offers to VASPs with its state-of-the-art compliance infrastructure for seamless FATF Travel Rule compliance. This is a significant development for the entire crypto ecosystem, as with this integration, both Veriscope and Giottus are setting a new standard for unwavering commitment to safety, transparency, and user experience.”</blockquote><p>Vikram Subburaj, Giottus CEO, too, welcomed this development, noting:</p><blockquote>“Since its inception in 2018, Giottus has been at the forefront of innovation and compliance in the Indian VDA space. Our partnership with Veriscope is timely and pivotal to establish us as part of a global compliance network and to strengthen our offering to all Indian crypto enthusiasts. We believe that collaboration and data exchange are crucial in shaping the future of this industry and are thankful to Veriscope for integrating us. We look forward to driving a positive change in the Indian VDA ecosystem.”</blockquote> Conclusion <p>Overall, we expect our collaboration with Giottus to yield positive outcomes not only for Giottus and Shyft Veriscope but also for India’s crypto ecosystem. This partnership sets a new precedent for the country’s VASPs, as they can now comply with the FATF Travel Rule effortlessly while continuing with their privacy and user-friendly developments.</p> About Giottus <p>Giottus, with over a million users, is a customer-centric, all-in-one crypto investment platform that is changing the way Indian investors trade their virtual digital assets. Giottus aims to shed barriers that arise from the complexity of the asset class and the need to transact in English. We focus on building a simplified platform that is vernacular at heart. Investors can buy and sell crypto assets on Giottus in eight languages, including Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and Bengali. Giottus is currently India’s top-rated crypto platform as per consumer ratings on Facebook, Google, and Trustpilot.</p> ‍About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

 New VideoIdent Flex elevates trust with a human touch in the face of rising fraud and the closing of physical bank branches 



<p>London, April 16, 2024 – IDnow, a leading identity verification provider in Europe, has unveiled VideoIdent Flex, a new version of its <a href="https://www.idnow.io/expert-led-verification/">expert-led video verification service</a> that blends advanced AI technology with human interaction. The human-based video call solution, supported by AI, has been designed and built to boost customer conversion rates, reduce rising fraud attempts, increase inclusivity, and tackle an array of complex online verification scenarios, while offering a high-end service experience to end customers.</p>



<p>The company’s original expert-led product, VideoIdent, has been a cornerstone in identity verification for over a decade, serving the strictest requirements in highly regulated industries across Europe. VideoIdent Flex, re-engineered specifically for the UK market, represents a significant evolution, addressing the growing challenges of identity fraud, compliance related to Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) processes and ensuring fair access and inclusivity in today’s digital world outside of fully automated processes.</p>



<p>Empowering businesses with flexible human-based identity verification</p>



<p>As remote identity verification becomes more crucial yet more challenging, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/videoident-flex/">VideoIdent Flex</a> combines high-quality live video identity verification with hundreds of trained verification experts, thus ensuring that genuine customers gain equal access to digital services while effectively deterring <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-mules/">fraudsters and money mules</a>. Unlike fully automated solutions based on document liveness and biometric liveness features, this human-machine collaboration not only boosts onboarding rates and prevents fraud but also strengthens trust and confidence in both end users and organizations. VideoIdent Flex can also serve as a fallback service in case a fully automated solution fails.</p>



<p>Bertrand Bouteloup, Chief Commercial Officer at IDnow, commented: “VideoIdent Flex marks a groundbreaking advancement in identity verification, merging AI-based technology with human intuition. In a landscape of evolving fraud tactics and steady UK bank branch closures, our solution draws on our decade’s worth of video verification experience and fraud insights, empowering UK businesses to maintain a competitive edge by offering a white glove service for VIP onboarding. With its unique combination of KYC-compliant identity verification, real-time fraud prevention solutions, and expert support, VideoIdent Flex is a powerful tool for the UK market.”</p>



<p>Whereas previously firms may have found video identification solutions to be excessive for their compliance requirement or out of reach due to costs, VideoIdent Flex opens up this option by customizing checks as required by the respective regulatory bodies in financial services, mobility, telecommunications or gaming, to offer a streamlined solution fit for every industry and geography.</p>



<p>Customizable real-time fraud prevention for high levels of assurance</p>



<p>VideoIdent Flex has a number of key features and benefits:</p>



  Customizable: Pre-defined configurations to meet specific industry requirements and regional regulations.  Expert-led: High-quality live video verification conducted by trained identity verification experts, ensuring accuracy, reliability, and compliance for high levels of assurance.  Extensive document coverage: Support for a wide range of documents, facilitating global expansion and inclusivity.  Real-time fraud prevention: Advanced fraud detection capabilities, including AI-driven analysis and manual checks, combat evolving fraud tactics and help protect against social engineering fraud, document tampering, projection and deepfakes, especially for high-risk use cases and goods.  Verification of high-risk individuals: Reviewing applications from high-risk persons, such as Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), high-risk countries; or assessing where fraud might be expected with real-time decisions, without alerting suspicion.  



<p>Bouteloup concluded: “Identity verification is incredibly nuanced; it’s as intricate as we are as human beings. This really compounds the importance of adopting a hybrid approach to identity – capitalizing on the dual benefits of advanced technology when combined with human knowledge and awareness of social cues. <a href="https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/closure-of-high-street-banks-impact-on-local-communities/">With bank branches in the UK closing down</a>, especially in the countryside, and interactions becoming more and more digital, our solution offers a means to maintain a human relationship between businesses and their end customers, no matter their age, disability or neurodiversity. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“VideoIdent Flex is designed from the ground up for organizations that cannot depend on a one-size-fits-all approach to ensuring their customers are who they say they are. In a world where fraud is consistently increasing, our video capability paired with our experts adds a powerful layer of security, especially for those businesses and customers that require a face-to-face interaction.”</p>

 We sit down with our Principal Product Manager, Nitesh Nahta and Senior Product Marketing Manager, Suzy Thomas to find out why VideoIdent Flex is all set to become a game changer. 



 



<p>In April 2024, we launched <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/videoident-flex/">VideoIdent Flex</a>, a customizable video identity verification solution aimed specifically at the UK market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our original expert-led product, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">VideoIdent</a>, has been a cornerstone in identity verification for over a decade, serving the strictest requirements in highly regulated industries across Europe. VideoIdent Flex, re-engineered specifically for the UK market addresses the nation’s growing challenges of identity fraud and compliance related <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know-Your-Customer (KYC)</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-aml/">Anti-Money Laundering (AML)</a> requirements. It also ensures <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/identity-verification-services-inclusivity/">fair access and inclusivity</a> in today’s digital world.</p>



 Can you tell us a little more about VideoIdent Flex? 



<p>Nitesh: VideoIdent Flex, from our expert-led video verification toolkit, will revolutionize the onboarding process by focusing on the human touch in KYC onboarding. Our proprietary technology will boost conversion rates while thwarting escalating fraud attempts. What sets it apart? Unlike its predecessors, VideoIdent Flex transcends its origins as a German-centric product. Leveraging years of refinement, insights and unmatched security, we’re extending its capabilities beyond German borders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Suzy: VideoIdent Flex caters to a diverse range of global use cases, including boosting customer conversion rates, reducing fraud attempts, verifying high-risk individuals and onboarding VIPs. It offers a face-to-face service or provides an accessible and personalized alternative to automated identification processes. </p>



<p>Further differentiating IDnow in the market, VideoIdent Flex can also be combined with our digital signature solutions, allowing us to expand into loan and investment use cases from financial services, as well as recruitment, legal and insurance. With its advanced technology and expert-led verification, VideoIdent Flex offers three pre-configured packages tailored to suit different risk levels within organizations.</p>



 



 

 



 How important do you think VideoIdent Flex will be to the UK market? 



<p>Nitesh: Video verification is already a trusted AML-compliant onboarding solution across many European countries. Enter VideoIdent Flex: a versatile product catering to both AML and non-AML needs, boasting a seamless process, high conversion rates, and budget-friendly pricing. This marks a significant shift for IDnow, offering a distinctive value proposition that sets us apart. It’s a game-changer, enticing customers outside of the DACH region who hadn’t previously explored expert-led video verification. </p>



<p>Already embraced by numerous EU clients, this launch signifies our expansion beyond the DACH market, solidifying our foothold across the continent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Suzy: I’m excited about the potential impact of VideoIdent Flex! It not only expands our market reach beyond the DACH and France+ regions, but also allows IDnow to break into new territories, including regulated and unregulated sectors in the UK, and non-regulated markets in DACH, France and beyond. With the UK’s highly competitive document and biometric verification market, VideoIdent Flex serves as a powerful differentiator, offering a face-to-face, fraud busting solution that will drive organizations to better recognize, trust and engage with IDnow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I believe there are three main drivers that make this an excellent time to launch our new solution:&nbsp;</p>



  The economic pressures to close expensive physical branches.  



  Increasing consumer demand for remote digital experiences that can be accessed anytime, anywhere.  



  Societal pressure driving environmental and corporate governance concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;  



<p>We’re excited to launch and see the market reaction. We believe it significantly enhances our value proposition and solidifies our position as industry leaders in identity verification.&nbsp;</p>

 In an increasingly branchless, AI-automated world, offer your customers the VIP premium face-to-face experience they deserve. 



 



<p>Technology – it gives with one hand and takes with the other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Technology, and the internet in particular, has afforded consumers incredible convenience, providing 24/7 access to services, across every industry imaginable. Unfortunately, technology has also <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/work-chatgpt/">empowered criminals to commit fraud</a> with an effortless ease and at an unprecedented level.<br>&nbsp;<br>Discover more about the scourge of fraud in the UK, in our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/uk-fraud-strategy/">blog, ‘UK fraud strategy declares war on fraud, calls on tech giants to join the fight.’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>On average, multinational banks are subjected to <a href="https://www.cosive.com/fraud-detection-in-banking-guide">tens of thousands of fraud attacks</a> every single month, ranging from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/social-media-fraud-investment-romance-scam/">account takeover fraud</a> all the way to <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/red-flags-money-laundering/">money laundering</a>. It is this reason, among many others, that it’s paramount to verify the identity of customers as a preventative measure against fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As businesses scale and the need to onboard customers quickly increases, many banks have implemented AI-assisted <a href="https://www.idnow.io/automated-identity-verification/">automated identity verification solutions</a>. In certain high-risk circumstances, however, the importance of human oversight cannot be overstated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As bank branches continue to close (<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/eb3f99a2-bd4c-4ba1-8cb9-432ecfbf73ab">almost three-fifths of the UK’s bank network closing since 2015</a>), many UK banks are beginning to look for alternatives to data checks and automatic checks and are turning to expert-led video verification solutions.</p>

<p>Our recently launched <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/videoident-flex/">VideoIdent Flex</a>, specially designed for the UK market, works in two ways: full service or self-service, meaning banks can choose to either use our extensive team of multilingual identity experts, or have their bank staff trained to the highest standard of fraud prevention experts. Here’s how VideoIdent Flex can help.</p>



 Tackling fraud, in all 4 forms. 



<p>At IDnow, we categorize fraud into four different buckets. Here’s how VideoIdent Flex can help tackle fraud, in all its forms.</p>



 1. Fake ID fraud. 



<p>We classify fake ID fraud as the use of forged documents or fraudulent manipulations of documents. Common types of <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/document-fraud/">document fraud</a> – the act of creating, altering or using false or genuine documents, with the intent to deceive or pass specific controls – include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Counterfeit documents: reproduction of an official document without the proper authorization from the relevant authority.<br>  Forged documents: deliberate alteration of a genuine document in order to add, delete or modify information, while passing it off as genuine. Forged documents can include photo substitution, page substitution, data alteration, attack on the visas or entry/exit stamp.<br>  &nbsp;Pseudo documents: replicates codes from official documents, such as passports, driver’s licenses or national identity cards.  



<p>How VideoIdent Flex identifies and stops fake ID fraud.</p>



<p>As a first step, IDnow’s powerful automated checks can detect damaged documents, invalid/cut corners, photocopies and much more. As a second step and additional layer of assurance, identity experts, specially trained in fraud prevention request document owners to cover or bend certain parts of documents as a way of detecting fake IDs and document deepfakes.</p>



 2. Identity theft fraud. 



<p>Identity theft fraud is when individuals, without permission, use stolen, found or given identity documents, or when another person pretends to be another person. Although popular among teenagers to buy age-restricted goods like alcohol and tobacco, fake IDs are also used for more serious crime like <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/fintech-spotlight-interview-jinisha-bhatt/">human trafficking</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/identity-theft/">identity theft</a>. There are numerous forms of identity theft, with perhaps the darkest being ‘ghosting fraud’.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Discover more about the fraudulent use of a deceased person’s personal information in our blog, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/ghosting-fraud-dead/">‘Ghosting fraud: Are you doing business with the dead?’</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>How VideoIdent Flex identifies and stops identity theft fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow’s identity verification always begins with powerful automated identity checks of document data. Our identity specialists will then perform interactive motion detection tests like a hand movement challenge to detect deepfakes. To prevent cases of account takeover, VideoIdent Flex can be used to help customers reverify their identity when any changes to accounts (address, email etc) are made.</p>



 3. Social engineering fraud. 



<p>Worryingly, according to our recently published UK Fraud Awareness Report, more than <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/attitudes-awareness-uk-fraud/">half of Brits (54%) do not know what social engineering is</a>. Social engineering fraud refers to the use of deception to manipulate individuals into divulging personal information, money or property and is an incredibly prevalent problem. Common examples of social engineering fraud include <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/social-media-fraud-investment-romance-scam/">social media fraud</a> and <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/exposing-romance-scammers-becky-holmes/">romance scams</a>.</p>



<p>How VideoIdent Flex identifies and stops identity theft fraud.</p>



<p>To help prevent social engineering, in all its forms, our identity experts ask a series of questions specifically designed to identify whether someone has fallen victim to a social engineering scam. There are three different levels of questions: Basic; Advanced; and Premium, with questions ranging from “Has anyone promised you anything in return (money, loan etc) in return for this identification?” to “Has anyone prepared you for this identification?”</p>



 4. Money mules.&nbsp; 



<p>Although many may initially envisage somebody being stopped at the airport with a suitcase full of cash, money mules, like every fraudulent activity, has gone digital, and has now been extended to persons who receive money from a third party in order to transfer it to someone else. It is important to distinguish between “<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-mules/">money mules</a>” and “<a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/social-engineering/">social engineering</a>“. Money mules are involved in fraud scenarios (i.e. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/bank-drop/">bank drops</a>) and cooperate as part of the criminal scheme.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a social engineering scenario, a person is seen as a victim of fraud and are usually unaware that they are breaking the law with their behaviour. They are tricked into opening accounts, e.g. through job advertisements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How VideoIdent Flex identifies and stops money mule fraud.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our fraud prevention tools like IP address collection and red flag alerts of suspicious combinations of data, such as email domains, phone numbers and submitted documents, can go some way to help prevent money mule fraud. However, as an additional safeguard, when combined with VideoIdent Flex, agents can be trained to pick up on suspicious social cues and pose certain questions.</p>

 The handling of user data has become a central concern for businesses worldwide. As organizations navigate increasing regulations, the need for robust privacy and consent management solutions has never been more urgent. The changing landscape of data privacy, the challenges businesses face, and the sophisticated solutions emerging to address these issues are transforming how organizations operate and protect user data. 



 







 



<p>The data privacy landscape is undergoing significant changes globally. With the implementation of regulations like the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) in Europe, businesses are pressured to manage user data responsibly. This regulatory trend is not confined to Europe; it reflects a global shift towards stringent data privacy standards, with 83% of countries now having regulatory frameworks. This change underscores a broader movement towards ensuring consumer data protection and privacy.</p>



<p>Despite the clear directives of these regulations, many organizations need help to meet compliance standards. The main challenge lies in the complexity and speed of these requirements, which are continually evolving. Privacy practitioners on the front lines of implementing these changes feel particularly vulnerable; a staggering 96% report feeling exposed to data privacy risks. This vulnerability stems from the difficulty of adapting to the myriad global privacy laws that differ significantly across jurisdictions.</p>



<p>The complication arises with the global proliferation of GDPR-like privacy frameworks, which amplifies the complexity of compliance. As more countries adopt similar regulations, each with nuances, managing consent and privacy becomes increasingly daunting. Organizations must navigate these waters carefully, as non-compliance penalties can be severe. For instance, the rise in GDPR privacy penalties has highlighted financial and reputational risks related to non-compliance.</p>



<p>In light of these complexities and challenges, the critical questions for business leaders in privacy and consent management include: How can we efficiently manage user consent across different jurisdictions? What technologies and strategies can enhance privacy management while ensuring regulatory compliance? How can leveraging privacy and consent management be a competitive advantage for my company?</p>



<p>A recent survey found that privacy professionals seek sophisticated, automated privacy and consent management solutions to manage these challenges effectively. These tools offer a way to bridge the gap between regulatory demands and effective data management, ensuring compliance across different jurisdictions without sacrificing operational efficiency. Key features of these solutions include automation of consent management, robust data protection measures like encryption and access control, and comprehensive privacy audits.</p>



<p>Automated solutions are not just a compliance necessity; they also offer a competitive advantage by enhancing trust with consumers increasingly concerned about their data privacy. These tools enable businesses to handle data ethically and transparently, thus fostering a stronger relationship with customers.</p>



 



 Key Survey Insights: 



 
 96% of businesses are concerned about non-compliance penalties due to regulatory complexity. 
 



 
 74% of companies seek solutions for legacy systems to ensure compliance with modern privacy regulations. 
 



 
 66% of practitioners use automated privacy and consent management solutions, with an additional 20% planning to adopt them within two years. 
 



 
 72% of businesses consider privacy rights request management a critical feature in solutions. 
 



 



<p>The need for advanced and effective privacy and consent management solutions is clear. Organizations’ ability to adapt will define their success as the regulatory landscape becomes more complex. By leveraging the right tools and strategies, businesses can transform regulatory challenges into opportunities for growth and enhanced customer relationships.</p>



<p>Managing privacy and consent effectively is not just about compliance; it is about gaining and maintaining the trust of your customers. By adopting advanced privacy and consent management tools, businesses can navigate the complexities of global regulations while enhancing their operational efficiency and consumer trust. Access the market and buyer’s guide for detailed insights and information on selecting your organization’s right privacy and consent management tool.&nbsp;</p>

 What is Privacy and Consent Management? 



<p>Privacy and Consent Management refers to the structured processes and practices businesses and organizations implement to ensure they handle personal data ethically, lawfully, and transparently. This involves obtaining consent from individuals before collecting, processing, or sharing their data, managing their preferences, and ensuring their rights are protected throughout the data lifecycle. Privacy management focuses on adhering to data protection laws, such as GDPR, and establishing policies and technologies that safeguard personal information against unauthorized access or breaches. Consent management, a crucial component of this framework, involves documenting and managing the approval given by individuals for the use of their data, including their ability to modify or withdraw consent at any time. Privacy and consent management is critical in maintaining trust between businesses and consumers, mitigating legal risks, and fostering a culture of privacy across the digital ecosystem.</p>

 Veriscope Regulatory Recap — 1st to 15th April&nbsp;2024   With its new crypto regulatory update, Singapore is mandating strict custody and transaction rules.  Brazil, on the other hand, is becoming more crypto-friendly, having started recognizing cryptocurrencies as a valid payment&nbsp;method.  Both countries reflect the dynamic, evolving landscape of global crypto regulation.  <p>In this edition of the Veriscope Regulatory Recap, we examine the latest crypto regulatory developments in Singapore and&nbsp;Brazil.</p><p>Both countries are revising their stand toward cryptocurrencies, which is reflected in their regulatory responses. This shift is clearly evident from their new measures.</p> Singapore Tightening Up Its Crypto Regulations <p>Until a series of failures rocked the crypto industry in 2022, most rankings identified Singapore as the most crypto-friendly country.</p>(<a href="https://twitter.com/raylovescrypto/status/1505565139642290177">Image Source</a>)<p>Even founders who moved to Singapore, drawn by its crypto-friendly measures initiated pre-2022, found themselves questioning their decisions.</p><p>Recently, Singapore’s Central Bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), is rolling out <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/mas-singapore-crypto-regulations-digital-asset-custody/">new updates to the Payment Services Act</a> to tighten its grip on the crypto landscape.</p>(<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-15/singapore-wants-to-play-long-game-in-ai-space-mohanty-says">Image Source</a>)<p>These updates extend to crypto custody, token payments or transfers, and cross-border payments, even if transactions don’t physically touch Singapore’s financial system.</p><p>Key among these regulations is the requirement for service providers to keep customer assets separate from their own, with a hefty 90% of these assets to be stored in cold wallets to enhance security.</p><p>Additionally, the MAS is keen on preventing anyone from having too much control over these assets, favoring multi-party computation (MPC) wallets, which require a collaborative effort for transactions.</p><p>Moreover, the MAS is stepping in to protect retail customers by banning them from certain activities, such as crypto staking or lending, which are gaining attention from regulators worldwide.</p> Brazil Harnessing New Affection for&nbsp;Crypto <p>On Brazil’s part, it was never really considered among the top five crypto-friendly countries. Yet, it has initiated several measures that challenge crypto enthusiasts’ notions about the&nbsp;country.</p>(<a href="https://x.com/viktor_kyrrex/status/1669366040055144448">Image Source</a>)<p>It is also among the major global economies (G20 Member Countries) that have rolled out crypto regulations.</p><p>Continuing with its crypto-friendly measures, President Jair Bolsonaro recently <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/cpi-posts/brazilian-president-signs-bill-creating-crypto-regulations/">green-lit a bill</a> that recognizes cryptocurrency as a valid payment method. Although this law, set to take effect in six months, does not declare cryptocurrencies as legal tender, it does incorporate them into the legal framework.</p><blockquote>“With regulation, cryptocurrency will become even more popular.”</blockquote><blockquote>- Sen. Iraja&nbsp;Abreu</blockquote><p>Under this new law, crypto assets classified as securities will fall under the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission’s watch, while a designated government body will oversee other digital&nbsp;assets.</p><p>In conclusion, Singapore’s and Brazil’s approaches to crypto regulations prove once again that the crypto industry as a whole is a continuously evolving space and can change significantly within a few years, from narrative to various national governments’ approach to&nbsp;them.</p> Interesting Reads <p><a href="https://issuu.com/shyftnetwork/docs/global_crypto_regulatory_outlook_2024_-_shyft_netw#google_vignette">The Visual Guide on Global Crypto Regulatory Outlook&nbsp;2024</a></p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/newsroom/almost-70-of-all-fatf-assessed-countries-have-implemented-the-crypto-travel-rule">Almost 70% of all FATF-Assessed Countries Have Implemented the Crypto Travel&nbsp;Rule</a></p> ‍About Veriscope <p>‍Veriscope, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule.

<p>Exploring the relationship between Google Trends data and the cryptocurrency market…</p> Overview <p>This challenge is not just a platform to showcase one’s data science skills; it’s a gateway to gaining deep insights into one of the most dynamic and rapidly evolving markets. Participants will sharpen their data science expertise by analyzing the relationship between Google Trends data and cryptocurrency prices. They will also contribute to our understanding of how online interest influences financial markets. This knowledge could be a game-changer for investors, businesses, and researchers navigating the complexities of the cryptocurrency landscape. So, join us in this journey of discovery and make a significant impact in the world of data-driven finance!</p> Objective <p>Participants will explore the correlation between Google Trends data and cryptocurrency token prices to uncover patterns and draw significant conclusions. Emphasizing the development of predictive models, the challenge asks participants to navigate the complexities of cryptocurrency trading, discovering insights into how public interest influences market trends. This opportunity evaluates participants’ ability to apply data science skills in real-world scenarios and provides a deeper understanding of cryptocurrency market dynamics, extracting insights through exploratory data analysis and advanced machine learning methodologies.</p> Data <p>The data provided for the challenge is organized into two main categories: ‘trends’ and ‘prices.’ In the ‘trends’ section, participants will find web search interest data sourced from Google Trends for 20 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, BNB, Solana, XRP, Dogecoin, Cardano, Polkadot, Chainlink, Litecoin, Uniswap, Filecoin, Fetch.ai, Monero, Singularitynet, Kezos, Kucoin, Pancakeswap, Oasis Network, and Ocean Protocol. Meanwhile, the ‘prices’ folder is equally important, containing pricing information and trading volume data for the same set of 20 cryptocurrencies. It’s worth noting that the level of interest for each cryptocurrency is normalized on a scale from 0 (representing the fewest searches) to 100 (reflecting the highest number of searches) over a specific period, ensuring uniformity but not providing a basis for direct comparison between cryptocurrencies.</p> Mission <p>Our mission is clear: to explore and understand the relationship between cryptocurrency market trends and public search behaviors. In this challenge, we identify the factors influencing crypto markets through rigorous analysis. We ask participants to create predictive models to forecast token trends and compile detailed reports sharing their insights and discoveries.

   Controlling access to resources and data is a critical priority for organizations. When developers are tasked with introducing a new application, one of the first considerations is the authorization model. How will we control access to features? Will there be limitations on who can perform actions? For too long, the answer has been to custom develop a homegrown solution for each application.

Will there be limitations on who can perform actions? For too long, the answer has been to custom develop a homegrown solution for each application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, this approach often means that developers are repeatedly developing an authorization solution time and time again. This is a hidden cost of application development, where developer time is spent building an authorization framework rather than features and functionality that help drive business outcomes. Furthermore, homegrown authorization frameworks are often limited in the use cases they can solve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the pattern of authentication, developers are now turning to IAM platforms to manage authorization controls. For simple needs, authorization may be easily managed with an application permissions model. As more sophisticated use cases and requirements emerge, this simple model is best extended with fine-grained policies to handle user segmentation and dynamic decisioning.</p>

<p>  They highlight the eIDAS 2.0 regulation in Europe as a driver for decentralized identity adoption and mention the importance of interoperability testing. They also touch on the potential use of decentralized identity in supply chain management and the need for open and interoperable ecosystems.</p>				<br><br><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/reallife-usecases-decentralized-identity"></a>

   In a digital age where the management of identity wallets and credentials is becoming increasingly complex, the W3C's Web Incubator Community Group (WICG) has initiated a pivotal work item called Digital Identities. As co-chair of the newly formed Federated Identity Working Group alongside Wendy Seltzer, I delve into why this project may (or may not!) soon find a permanent home within our group.

<p>About a year ago, a new work item was formed under the W3C’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">Web Incubator Community Group</a> (the WICG). This work item looks at how a browser should behave when it comes to identity wallets and the credentials they hold. While the project has gone through a few name changes, it is currently called Digital Identities; the scope is available in <a href="https://github.com/WICG/digital-identities">GitHub</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why am I writing about it now? Because the W3C is thinking about whether the new working group I’m co-chairing in the W3C with Wendy Seltzer, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/fedid/">Federated Identity Working Group</a>, should be the standardization home for this project.&nbsp;This is definitely a niche post, but IYKYK! </p>



 Background 



<p>Initially, conversations about browsers, wallets, and how individuals are expected to select their credential of choice started in a FIDO Alliance board task force. Given the number of overlapping participants, members of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/fed-id/">Federated Identity Community Group</a> (FedID CG) took up the question as to whether that work should be in scope for the CG. The FedID CG, however, came to the conclusion that they were focused on determining how a different identity architecture, one that covers more traditional federation models via OpenID Connect and SAML, should handle the deprecation of third-party cookies. So, while there was alignment on the problem of “how is an individual supposed to actively select their identity,” the fact that the deprecation of third-party cookies mattered to the federation architecture but not to the wallet architecture suggested a separate incubation effort was necessary. If you don’t have alignment on what problem you’re trying to solve, you’re probably not going to solve the problem.</p>



 A Different Set of Stakeholders 



<p>That wasn’t necessarily a bad thing, that rejection from the FedID CG. The work item there is relatively simple when compared to what needs to come into play for an entirely new identity architecture. There are fewer stakeholders involved in a ‘traditional’ federation architecture. When considering wallet interactions, the number of interested parties goes well beyond a SAML or OIDC federation’s Identity Providers and Relying Parties and the browser. </p>



<p>With a digital identity wallet, we see requirements coming in from operating system developers, browser developers, and privacy advocates, as well as wallet and credential issuers and verifiers. This diversity of needs results in some confusion as to what problem the group is trying to solve. There are several layers to making a digital wallet function in a secure, privacy-preserving fashion; the group is not, however, specifying for all layers.</p>



<p>The WICG’s Digital Identities work may be a good fit for a more structured working group format than it was for a community group focused on incubation; that’s part of what has inspired this post.</p>



 Protocol Layers 



<p>The WICG Digital Identities work item did not start with a single problem statement the way the FedID CG did. Instead, their mission is described in their charter&nbsp;“to specify an API for user agents that would mediate access to, and representation of, verifiably-issued digital identities.”</p>



<p>To understand the totality of the effort to bring digital wallets and credentials to the web, which is a broader scope than that of the Digital Identities work item, you need to understand the many <a href="https://github.com/WICG/digital-identities/blob/main/resources/DigitalCredentialsAPI-Layering-v20240301.pdf">layers</a> involved in enabling an identity transaction on the web and/or across apps.&nbsp;</p>



 Our Layers 



 
 Standardized API (W3C) = Digital Credentials Web Platform API (this is us) 



 Standardized API (Other) = currently FIDO CTAP 2.2 (hybrid transport; a phishing-resistant, cross-device link is already in place for passkeys/WebAuthn) 



 Platform-specific web translation API = platform abstraction of web platform APIs for verifiers* 



 Platform-specific function API = independent platform native API* 



 Protocol-specific = Protocol or deployment-specific request/response 
 



 Digital Credentials Web Platform API 



<p>The output of the WICG Digital Identities work item is the Digital Credentials Web Platform API from that first layer in the stack. In incubating that API, the specification editors are relying on the existence and behavior of other APIs either already in place or being developed by their respective platforms. Having the developers of those other APIs involved to make sure that the end-to-end flow of wallet and credential selection works as anticipated by the Digital Credentials Web Platform API is critical. Requiring change to those other APIs is out of scope for the Digital Identities work item (though we can ask nicely).&nbsp;</p>



 An FAQ 



 
 Should the browser see the details of the request for what’s in a wallet?
 
 That’s not in scope for the W3C (though the question still comes up when people join the group). 
 
 



 Should the OS see the details of what’s in a wallet?
 
 That’s not in scope for the W3C, either, so while of interest to many, it’s not something this group can or should resolve.&nbsp; 
 
 



 Should the API be protocol agnostic when it comes to verifiable credentials?
 
 Some say yes, some say no. The more protocols you have to support, the more expensive maintenance gets. So, while on the one hand, being protocol-agnostic supports the largest number of use cases, it’s also the most expensive thing to do.&nbsp; 
 
 



 What does protocol-agnostic look like in practice when different credentials format similar information differently?
 
 That’s one of the things we talk about.&nbsp; 
 
 



 At what point(s) does the individual consent to the information being requested from a wallet? being requested to be added to a wallet?
 
 We’re still talking about that, too. 
 
 



 Is the use case under consideration primarily remote presentation or in-person presentation?
 
 The scope is online presentation, so the work is focused on the remote use case.&nbsp; 
 
 



 Is the payload of requests in scope for this group, or is the group only concerned with communication channels (leaving payload handling up to the platforms)?
 
 Here’s another area of contention. Of course, the browser wants to prevent bad traffic. But this stuff is encrypted for a reason, and making everything (most things? some things?) viewable to the browser isn’t necessarily the right answer either from a privacy and security perspective.&nbsp; 
 
 



 Is the question of what signal must exist (and who provides that signal) for a wallet to be trusted by the browser in scope for the group? If not, where can those discussions be directed?
 
 This is not in scope as the web platform does not directly communicate with the wallet in this architecture. 
 
 
 



 Wrap Up 



<p>So what happens now? Conversations are happening at the OAuth Security Workshop, within the W3C Advisory Committee, and soon at the Internet Identity Workshop. By the time those wrap up, the Federated Identity Working Group will start meeting and will have its own say as to whether this work belongs in scope or not. If you’re interested in participating in the conversation, there is a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/450">GitHub issue</a> open where we are collecting input on the topic. You are welcome to chime in there, or just grab some popcorn and watch the story unfold!</p>

  India amended its anti-money laundering law to include cryptocurrencies, requiring KYC checks and reporting of transactions.  The FATF Travel Rule has been effective in India since&nbsp;2023.  It mandates crypto exchanges in India to collect and report detailed sender and receiver information to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.  <p>As India continues to gain prominence in the crypto market, the government has been providing clarity on various related issues, including the application of anti-money laundering (AML) and FATF Travel Rule for crypto transactions.</p><p>To bring crypto under the ambit of the Act and reign in Virtual Digital Assets Service Providers (VDASPs), the Indian government amended <a href="https://fiuindia.gov.in/files/AML_Legislation/notification.html">the PMLA 2002</a> (Prevention of Money Laundering Act).</p> Key Features <p>Per the guidelines, a designated service provider in India must have policies and procedures. India’s Ministry of Finance considers those involved in the following activities to be ‘reporting entities’:</p><p>- Transfer of crypto<br>- Exchange between fiat currencies and crypt<br>- Exchange between one or more types of crypto <br>- Participation in financial services related to an issuer’s offer and sale of crypto<br>- Safekeeping or administration of crypto or instruments enabling control over&nbsp;crypto</p><p>These VDPA entities need to ensure compliance with the following:</p><p>- The reporting entities must register with the Financial Intelligence Unit and provide transaction details to the agency within the stipulated period.</p><p>- Crypto exchanges must verify the identities of their customers and beneficial owners, if&nbsp;any.</p><p>- Platforms have to perform ongoing due diligence on every client. In the case of certain specified transactions, VDASPs have to conduct enhanced due diligence (EDD) on their&nbsp;clients.</p><p>- In addition to identifying the customers, exchanges have to maintain records of updated client identification and transactions for up to five years after the business relationship between the two has ended or the account has been&nbsp;closed.</p><p>- VDASPs are also required to appoint a principal officer and a director who will be responsible for ensuring that the entity complies with rules. Their details, which include name, phone number, email ID, address, and designation, must be submitted to the Financial Intelligence Unit — India (FIU-IND).</p><p>Meanwhile, FIU’s guidelines further require VDASPs to conduct counterparty due diligence and have adequate employee screening procedures. These entities must also provide instruction manuals for onboarding, transaction processing, KYC, due diligence, transaction review, sanctions screening (which must be done when onboarding and transferring crypto), and record&nbsp;keeping.</p> ‍<br>Compliance Requirements <p>In line with global efforts to regulate crypto assets, the Indian government has introduced AML guidelines similar to those already followed by&nbsp;banks.</p><p>Per the guidelines, a designated service provider in India must have policies and procedures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. This includes verifying customer identity, for which VDASPs must obtain and hold certain information that must be made available to appropriate authorities on request. Moreover, this applies regardless of whether the value of the crypto transfer is denominated in fiat or another crypto.<br> <br>For the originating (sender) VDASP, the following information must be acquired and&nbsp;held:</p><p>- Originator’s full verified name.<br>- The Permanent Account Number (PAN) of the sending person.<br>- Originator’s wallet addresses used to process the transaction.<br>- Originator’s date and place of birth or their verified physical address.<br>- Beneficiary’s (receiver) name and wallet&nbsp;address.</p><p>For the beneficiary (receiver) VDASP, the following information must be acquired and&nbsp;held:</p><p>- Beneficiary’s verified name.<br>- Beneficiary’s wallet address used to process the transaction.<br>- Originator’s name<br>- Originator’s National Identity Number or Permanent Account Number (PAN).<br>- Originator’s wallet addresses and physical address or date and place of&nbsp;birth.</p><p>When it comes to reporting obligations, the entity must report any suspicious transactions within a week of identification. Reporting entities are further prohibited from disclosing or “tipping off” that a Suspicious Transactions Report (STR) is provided to the&nbsp;FIU-IND.</p><p>However, the minimum threshold for Travel Rule compliance is unclear, as the Indian government hasn’t mentioned it in the circular. However, a few Indian exchanges are requesting Travel Rule data for compliance even when the transaction amount is less than&nbsp;$1000.</p><p>Unfortunately, instead of adopting a fully automated, privacy-oriented, frictionless Travel Rule solution like <a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">Veriscope</a>, a few exchanges in India depend on manual methods to collect personally identifiable information from users (i.e., Google forms, emails,&nbsp;etc).</p><p>When it comes to unhosted or non-custodial wallets, the FIU classifies any crypto transfers made to and from them as “high risk” as they may not be hosted on an obligated entity such as an exchange. As per the guidelines, P2P transfers also fall into this category, given that one of the wallets is not&nbsp;hosted.</p><p>Hence, when crypto transfers are made between two wallets where at least one of them is a hosted wallet, the compliance responsibility falls on the entity where the wallet is&nbsp;hosted.</p><blockquote>“Additional limitations or controls may be put in place on such transfers with unhosted wallets,” according to FIU — IND.</blockquote> ‍<br>Concluding Thoughts <p>The implementation of the Crypto Travel Rule shows that India is gradually regulating the crypto sector and requiring businesses dealing with crypto to adhere to the same AML requirements as registered financial institutions like&nbsp;banks.</p><p>While it may lead to some short-term challenges, India’s crypto businesses believe this is expected to create a more trustworthy environment in the long&nbsp;run.</p> ‍<br>About Veriscope <p>‍<br>‍<a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope">‍Veriscope</a>, the compliance infrastructure on Shyft Network, empowers Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) with the only frictionless solution for complying with the FATF Travel Rule. Enhanced by User Signing, it enables VASPs to directly request cryptographic proof from users’ non-custodial wallets, streamlining the compliance process.</p><p>For more information, visit our<a href="https://www.shyft.network/veriscope"> website</a> and<a href="https://www.shyft.network/contact"> contact</a> our team for a discussion.

How DePINs Can Disrupt Tech Monopolies and Put People Back in&nbsp;Control<p>Written by <a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/chriswere">Chris Were</a> (Verida CEO &amp; Co-Founder), this article was originally published on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/04/37798095/how-depins-can-disrupt-tech-monopolies-and-put-people-back-in-control-chris-were">Bazinga</a>.</p><p>Decentralized Infrastructure Physical Networks — DePINs — have the potential to transform how we access and use real-world services.</p><p>Potential use cases are only restricted by your imagination.</p> What if…   Internet hotspots could be established in rural areas where there is little coverage?  Homeowners could be rewarded by selling excess solar energy back to the&nbsp;grid?  Consumers could share unused storage space on their devices with&nbsp;others?  Entrepreneurs could unlock peer-to-peer microloans to build local projects?  <p>Underpinned by blockchain technology, DePINs make all of this possible — at a time when the infrastructure powering the global economy is experiencing seismic change. Figures from Statista <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/">suggest</a> 33.8% of the world’s population don’t use the internet, with people in low-income countries most likely to be shut out of the modern information society. The International Energy Agency <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/approximately-100-million-households-rely-on-rooftop-solar-pv-by-2030">estimates</a> that 100 million households will depend on rooftop solar panels by 2030, and enhancing economic incentives will be a crucial catalyst for adoption. And let’s not forget that the rise of artificial intelligence means the need for storage and computation is booming, with McKinsey <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/investing-in-the-rising-data-center-economy">projecting</a> demand for data centers will rise 10% a year between now and the end of the decade. DePINs have the power to cultivate a cloud storage network that’s much cheaper than traditional players including Google and&nbsp;Amazon.</p><p>DePINs mount a competitive challenge to the centralized providers who dominate the business landscape. Right now, most of the infrastructure we use every day is controlled by huge companies or governments. This creates a real risk of monopolies where a lack of choice pushes up prices for consumers and businesses — with the pursuit of profits stymying innovation and shutting out customers based on geography and&nbsp;income.</p> The need for&nbsp;change <p>Blockchains are at the beating heart of these decentralized networks. That’s because individuals and businesses who contribute physical infrastructure can be rewarded in crypto tokens that are automatically paid out through smart contracts. Consumers can also use digital assets to unlock services on&nbsp;demand.</p><p>This approach isn’t about modernizing access to infrastructure, but changing how it is managed, accessed and owned. Unlike centralized providers, the crypto tokens issued through DePINs incentivize all participants to get involved. Decentralized autonomous organizations (known as DAOs for short) play a vital role in establishing the framework for how these projects are managed. Digital assets can be used to vote on proposals ranging from planned network upgrades to where resources should be allocated. Whereas big businesses are motivated by profit, community-driven projects can focus on meeting the needs of underserved areas. The issuance of tokens can also provide the funding required to build infrastructure — and acquire the land, equipment and technical expertise needed to get an idea off the&nbsp;ground.</p><p>Web3 has been driven by a belief that internet users should have full control over their data, and tech giants should be stopped from monetizing personal information while giving nothing in return. DePINs align well with these values, all while reducing barriers to entry and ensuring there’s healthy competition. Multiple marketplaces for internet access, data storage and energy will result in much fairer prices for end users — and encourage rivals to innovate so they have compelling points of difference. It also means an entrepreneur with a deep understanding of what their community needs can start a business without large capital requirements. Open access and interoperability are the&nbsp;future.</p> Challenges on the&nbsp;road <p>Certain challenges must be overcome for DePINs to have a lasting global impact. There’s no denying that multibillion-dollar corporations currently benefit from economies of scale, vast user bases, and deep pockets. That’s why it’s incumbent on decentralized innovations to show why their approach is better. Reaching out to untapped markets that aren’t being served by business behemoths is a good first step. Another obstacle standing in the way of adoption concerns regulatory uncertainty, which can prevent investors and participants from getting involved. Careful thought also needs to be paid to the ramifications that DePINs can have on data privacy. Unless safeguards are imposed, someone who accesses an internet hotspot through blockchain technology could inadvertently disclose their particular location.</p><p>Ecosystems have been created that allow DePINs to be established while ensuring that user privacy is preserved at all times — championing data ownership and self-sovereignty. As well as reducing the risks surrounding identity theft, they have been built with the evolving nature of global regulation in mind — with measures such as GDPR in the EU forcing companies to rethink how much data they hold on their customers.</p> DePINs and the future of the&nbsp;internet <p>Zooming in on Europe as a use case, and how these regulatory headwinds will affect more than 400 million citizens on the continent, gives an invaluable insight into how DePINs — and the infrastructure they’re built on — can have an impact in the years to&nbsp;come.</p><p>For one, the current internet landscape means that we need to create a new digital identity every time we want to join a website or app — manually handing over personal information by filling out lengthy forms to open accounts. Users are then confronted by lengthy terms and conditions or privacy notices that often go unread, leaving people in the dark about how their data is going to be used in the future. That’s why the EU has proposed singular digital identities that could be used for multiple services — from “paying taxes to renting bicycles” — and change the dynamic about how confidential information is shared. This approach would mean that consumers are in the driving seat, and decide which counterparties have the right to learn more about who they&nbsp;are.</p><p>The European Union’s approach is ambitious and requires infrastructure that is fast, inexpensive and interoperable — allowing digital signatures, identity checks and credentials to be stored and executed securely across the trading bloc. Another element that must be thrown into the mix is central bank digital currencies, with the European Central Bank <a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2023/html/ecb.pr231018~111a014ae7.en.html">spearheading</a> efforts to create an electronic form of the euro that is free to use and privacy preserving — all while enabling instant cross-border transactions with businesses, other consumers and governments.</p><p>High-performing and low-cost infrastructure will be essential if decentralized assets are going to be used by consumers across the continent — not to mention regulatory compliance. Privacy-focused wallets need to support multiple blockchains — as well as decentralized identities, verifiable credentials and data storage. A simple, user-friendly mobile application will be instrumental in guaranteeing that DePINs gain momentum.</p><p>The future is bright, and we’re yet to scratch the surface when it comes to the advantages decentralization can bring for all of us. But usability and efficiency are two key pillars that must be prioritized if this new wave of innovation is to match the unparalleled impact of the internet.</p> About Chris <p>Chris Were is the CEO of <a href="http://verida.io">Verida</a>, a decentralized, self-sovereign data network that empowers individuals to control their digital identity and personal data.

<p>Pete Corke's love for nature, nurtured through his walks in the coastal rainforests of British Columbia, Canada, inspired him to find ways to invest in the preservation of these precious ecosystems. </p><p>As the Director of Vision &amp; Leadership at <a href="http://www.kwaxala.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kwaxala</a>, an Indigenous-led and majority owned organization focused on protecting at-risk forests, Pete brings a unique perspective to the challenges and opportunities of creating a regenerative economic system.</p><p>With a background spanning technology, brand marketing, and supply chain management, Pete recognized that traditional conservation methods often left local economies poorer, relying heavily on philanthropy and government programs. He saw the need for a new approach that could generate sustainable economic value while protecting the environment.</p><p>Regenerative economics offers a solution by providing a for-profit orientation to conservation, benefiting communities and promoting biodiversity. However, accounting for the value of ecosystem services and ensuring the reliability of carbon credit markets can be complex. This is where Web3 technologies play a crucial role, providing tools to create transparency, trust, and custom solutions for documenting nature's value and connecting it to global markets.</p> Problems With the Current Extractive Economic System&nbsp; <p></p><p>The current economic system primarily focuses on removing resources from the earth — creating a world that often overlooks the value of living nature.</p><p>As Pete Corke explains, "Living nature isn't represented in [our economy]. It's all dead and extracted from nature. And in fact, the only way of creating value-flows from the current system into protected nature is by literally burning the transactional medium, burning money through philanthropy."</p><p>In other words, the current economic system only recognizes the value of nature when it is extracted and sold, and the only way to direct money towards conservation is through philanthropic donations, which do not generate any economic returns or retain asset value.</p><p>This approach has led to a lack of ways to recognize the value of ecosystems and the services they provide. Remote communities, like those in British Columbia, Canada, face a tough choice between participating in the resource extraction that makes up most of the local economy or supporting conservation efforts that often lack economic incentives.</p><p>Additionally, the established laws and structures around land use are deeply rooted in this resource-focused economic system, making it difficult to create change. So how can one aim to operate within the current structure and transform the economics?</p><p>Pete emphasizes that "Traditional conservation makes British Columbia poorer. It's giving up tax revenues, it's giving up export revenues. And that's at a provincial level. At a local level, they're giving up jobs in remote communities."</p><p>The extractive industry's control over these structures poses a significant challenge to those seeking to create a regenerative economic system. As Pete points out, "It's not about replacing extractive economics. It's about creating an economic counterbalance to it."</p><p>Achieving this balance requires not only developing new economic models but also navigating complex laws and governance frameworks that have long prioritized resource extraction over regeneration.</p> Opportunities for Regenerative Economics <p></p><p>Despite the challenges posed by the current extractive economic system, there are significant opportunities for regenerative economics to create a counterbalance. Specifically, regenerative economics would be creating incentive-based conservation efforts that spur economic growth while protecting nature.</p><p>As Pete Corke explains, "The whole point of the regenerative economics space is, hey, we need a two polled [economic] world here to create a counterbalance."</p><p>One key opportunity lies in generating value flows to conserve natural areas and the local communities that support these ecosystems. Pete emphasizes the importance of creating "an economic activity that's based on regeneration [which] counteracts extractive economic value."&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://www.kwaxala.com/?ref=blog.holochain.org">Kwaxala</a> is building a global network of protected forest areas that, at scale, generate economic markets for natural systems. Their projects demonstrate on-going returns for both forest communities and mindful investors.&nbsp;</p><p>Most resource extraction happens on public lands, with companies buying the rights (to log, mine, or drill for oil) that give them use of that land. By buying these rights and safeguarding them, managing the land appropriately, and documenting the revitalization of these ecosystems, it’s possible to demonstrate the value of conservation in a global market.&nbsp;</p><p>These thriving ecosystems provide numerous benefits to the people, industries, and municipalities who interact with them. They clean the air and water, offer mental health benefits to individuals, provide educational opportunities and recreational spaces for children, and attract tourism to communities.&nbsp;</p><p>This only scratches the surface of the economic and social benefits of rich, site specific ecosystems, on both local and global levels, but we don’t have great ways to account for these benefits within our economy. One market tool is high quality carbon credits, which can be produced through the act of conservation to start accounting for these benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>By developing mechanisms that allow individuals and businesses to invest in and hold value in living natural assets, regenerative economics can provide a viable alternative to extractive industries. Whilst carbon offsets and biodiversity credits represent an economic mechanism for recognising the services provided by nature, there are very few mechanisms that enable you to hold equity/investment value in the supply side of that value flow. But that is changing and Kwaxala is leading in that space.</p> The Next Economic Mechanism <p></p><p>Web3 tools, such as blockchain and smart contracts, offer promising solutions for creating transparency, provenance, and liquidity in regenerative economic systems.&nbsp;</p><p>As Pete points out, "Web3 is so powerful because we're not trying to just build regenerative products, we're trying to build an entire regenerative stack and entire economic ecosystem that counterbalances the extractive ecosystem."</p><p>These tools enable the creation of new financial products and value flows that can be quickly prototyped and scaled, providing a more efficient means of realizing the potential of regenerative economics.&nbsp;</p><p>Web3 technologies can help ensure the authenticity and on-the-ground truth of regenerative assets, such as carbon offsets, by embedding due diligence and provenance information directly into the digital tokens representing these assets.&nbsp;</p><p>These technologies also allow transparent value redistribution back into the communities on the ground, ensuring that the regenerative economy is built from the foundations up in a far more equitable way than the extractive/colonial economy ever was.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, the success of regenerative economics hinges on shifting mindsets and creating a new paradigm that recognizes the inherent value of nature. As Pete states, "Nature doesn't just need a seat at the economic table, we need to acknowledge that it is the table and it's also the air in the room! The human economic system is a subsidiary of the natural economic system."</p><p>As the world faces mounting environmental challenges, the need for a regenerative economic system has never been more pressing. Pete Corke and Kwaxala's work in partnering with Indigenous communities, protecting at-risk forests, and generating regenerative returns through innovative financial mechanisms that allow anybody to hold equity value in a living forest serves as a powerful example of how we can begin to create a true counterbalance to the extractive economy.</p><p>By leveraging Web3 tools such as Holochain, regenerative projects can create a trustworthy data layer that ensures transparency and trust in regenerative economic systems. Holochain's architecture allows for the distributed storage and processing of vast amounts of data, essential for documenting ecosystem interactions and ensuring the integrity of regenerative assets.</p><p>Centralized solutions have often proved untrustworthy, with instances of carbon credit markets failing to deliver on their promises due to lack of oversight and accountability. These examples highlight the need for trustable solutions that provide transparent, verifiable, and tamper-proof records of regenerative assets and their associated impacts. Holochain's distributed data layer creates a system resistant to manipulation and greenwashing, ensuring the value generated by regenerative economics is genuine and long-lasting.</p><p>Recognizing the intrinsic worth of healthy ecosystems can create a new economic paradigm that prioritizes the well-being of both human communities and the natural world. The path forward requires collaboration, innovation, and a willingness to challenge entrenched structures. </p>

			 Fedor Bolotnov is QA&nbsp;Engineer at Tokeny.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Tell us about yourself! 
<p>Hi, my name is Fedor, and I’m a QA Engineer at Tokeny. I prefer the QA Engineer position over Tester because QA involves more than just testing. While testing is a significant aspect, QA also encompasses communication, processes, and creating an error-prone environment.</p>
 What were you doing before Tokeny and what inspired you to join the team? 
<p>Before joining Tokeny, I held various QA roles, ranging from QA to Team Lead, in several companies in Russia. However, in 2022, I unexpectedly relocated to Spain and had to restart my QA career.</p>
<p>The concept of revolutionizing the traditional finance sector intrigued me, prompting my decision to join Tokeny. As a QA professional, part of my role involves “ruining” someone else’s code, but only to enhance its quality and resilience. Essentially, we strive to challenge the current system to pave the way for a newer and superior one.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny? 
<p>Fun, educational, and collaborative. With a diverse team, each member brings their unique life and career experiences and expertise, fostering continuous learning and knowledge sharing every day.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Sleep, haha! I cherish a good 10-11 hours at least once a week. But on a serious note, learning something new is what really motivates me to get out of bed every morning. Of course, I also adore spending time with my wife and our cat (fortunately, she can’t read, so she won’t find out she’s second on the list!). Additionally, I’m a bit obsessed with sports, both playing and watching American football.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>To borrow from Archimedes: “Give me a point that is firm and immovable, and I will fall asleep.” So, I don’t have a single ultimate dream, but rather an endless list of tasks to accomplish to ensure my family’s happiness.</p>
 What advice would you give to future Tokeny employees? 
<p>Don’t be afraid to experiment and never give up.</p>
 What gets you excited about Tokeny’s future? 
<p>The borderlessness of it all. It opens up endless possibilities beyond any limits we can currently dream or imagine.</p>

<p>This is the transcript to my <a href="https://youtu.be/1eX7_3sqLxM">YouTube explainer video</a> on why privacy and personalization are so hard to balance. Likes and subscriptions are always welcome!</p>



<p>Welcome to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheDigitalCowNetwork">Digital Cow Network</a>! I’m your host, Heather Flanagan. In today’s explainer, we’re going to look at some of the challenges of balancing privacy with the desire for personalization on the web. This is important because the standards and regulations under development today are trying to do this, too.&nbsp; Sneak preview: asking for user consent is not particularly helpful here. Think of it as necessary but not sufficient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we surf the web, we want to see more of what’s of interest to us, and we also want to know that our privacy is being protected. Let’s look at this dichotomy—the desire for privacy versus the desire for personalization—that’s at the heart of our digital lives. How much are we willing to share for a tailored online experience?</p>



 The Personalization Phenomenon 



<p>Personalization is everywhere – from your social media feed to shopping recommendations. Millennials and Gen Z in particular expect a level of personalization that older generations aren’t quite used to. But ever wondered how it works? Websites and apps collect data about our preferences, activities, and more to create a custom experience. Sometimes that is as simple as optimizing for whatever web browser you use (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or something else). Other times it’s a lot more invasive.</p>



 The Data Behind Personalization 



<p>Let’s break down the data journey. It starts with what you click, what you search, and even how long you linger on a page. This data forms a digital profile, which then guides the content you see.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s where the magic of Real-Time Bidding comes in! Real-time bidding only works because the Internet is blindingly fast for most, especially compared to the days of old-school dial-up connections. It works like this:&nbsp;</p>



 
 You visit a website.&nbsp; 



 The website has a space on it for an ad.&nbsp; 



 That space includes a piece of code that says “go to this ad exchange network, and take information about this website AND information about the user (either via cookies, or their browser fingerprint) AND the physical location of the user because their device probably knows that and send it all to the ad exchange.”&nbsp; 



 The ad exchange has a list of advertisers who have preloaded information on what they’re willing to pay to promote their ad based on specific criteria about the website, the user, and even who the user is physically close to.&nbsp; 



 The ad exchanger immediately figures out who wins the auction and returns the winning ad to be embedded in the website.&nbsp; 
 



<p>All this takes milliseconds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Real-time bidding: the Internet is fast enough to stream movies… and to collect information about you, where you are, what you’re looking at, and even where you focus your attention on the screen in real-time.</p>



 Privacy in the Personalized World&nbsp; 



<p>And there’s the catch: this level of personalization requires access to a lot of personal data. That’s where privacy concerns come in. How do companies ensure our data is safe? How much control do we have over what’s collected?</p>



<p>Thanks to laws and regulations like the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), individuals do have some ability to control this flow of information. For example, there are cookie banners on many websites that are supposed to let you decide what type of information you’re willing to share. There are also authenticated ids for when an individual has logged in and provided consent to be tracked. Google’s Privacy Sandbox has several mechanisms they’re testing out, like the Protected Audience API and the Topics API to help with ethical advertising.</p>



 Navigating the Trade-offs 



<p>But ultimately, accommodating privacy, personalization, and legal requirements around both is a trade-off, both for advertisers and for individuals. Personalization can make people’s online life more convenient and enjoyable. The increase in regulatory pressure, though, means that every entity involved in serving up a website and its associated ads to an individual needs to be a part of the consent process. It’s a barrage of “are you ok with us collecting data? How about now? Is now ok? What about over here? And here? And here, too?” This is a terrible user experience.</p>



 Best Practices for Users and Developers&nbsp; 



<p>So, what can we do? For individuals, it’s about making informed choices, understanding privacy settings, and being patient with the barrage of consent requests. For developers, the challenge is to respect user privacy while providing value. This is all still a very new space, which is why there is so much activity within the W3C and the browser vendors to find a path forward that satisfies the business requirements while still keeping on the right side of privacy law. The best thing organizations that are in the business of benefiting from tracking need to get involved in the standards process to test out those APIs under development and offer feedback the API developers can use.&nbsp;</p>



 Wrap Up: The Future of Privacy and Personalization&nbsp; 



<p>Looking ahead, the landscape is ever-evolving. New technologies, stricter privacy laws, and changing user attitudes are reshaping this balance. If you’re looking at the One True Way for your business to thread this needle, I’m afraid you’ve still got some waiting around to do. The browser vendors are trying different things at the same time lawyers are trying to find different ways to interpret the legal requirements into technical requirements. If it were easy, it would have been solved already.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Neuenschwander</a></p>The nascent identity threat detection and response (ITDR) market is gaining tremendous momentum in 2024. Cisco and Delinea recently jumped into the market with their recent acquisitions of Oort and Authomize, respectively. Top cybersecurity companies BeyondTrust, CrowdStrike, and SentinelOne continue to make substantial investments in ITDR. Microsoft has leaned into ITDR by blending technologies from its Entra and Defender XDR products. Other vendors, such as Gurucul, Securonix, and Sharelock are attempting to broaden the definition of ITDR in various ways. 
Given these developments, the market remains difficult to quantify. Arguably, there isn’t even a real “ITDR market,” because it’s ultimately more like an activity or an identity protection platform. Many of these vendors don’t even use the term ITDR in their products’ names. But what is clear is that ITDR is a banner under which enterprise identity and access management (IAM) and security operations center (SOC) teams must unite. 
So, what’s your organization’s best route to protecting identities and IAM infrastructure? This Leadership Compass evaluates the market dynamics for ITDR in 2024 and provides guidance on how your organization can take advantage of these critical technologies.

<p>Bem-vindo ao aplicativo Bluesky! Este é um guia do usuário que responde a algumas perguntas comuns.</p>
<p>Para perguntas gerais sobre a empresa Bluesky, por favor, visite nosso FAQ <a>aqui</a>.</p>
 Entrando no Bluesky 
<p>Como faço para me juntar ao Bluesky?</p>
<p>Você pode criar uma conta em <a href="https://bsky.app/">bsky.app</a>. (Não é necessário código de convite!)</p>
<p>Você pode baixar o aplicativo Bluesky para <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bluesky-social/id6444370199">iOS</a> ou <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=xyz.blueskyweb.app&amp;hl=en_US">Google Play</a>, ou usar o Bluesky via <a href="https://bsky.app/">desktop</a>.</p>
 Moderação 
<p>Qual é a abordagem do Bluesky para a moderação?</p>
<p>A moderação é uma parte fundamental das redes sociais. No Bluesky, estamos investindo em segurança de duas formas. Primeiro, construímos nossa própria equipe de moderação dedicada a fornecer cobertura contínua para manter nossas diretrizes comunitárias. Além disso, reconhecemos que não existe uma abordagem única para a moderação — nenhuma empresa pode garantir a segurança online corretamente para todos os países, culturas e comunidades do mundo. Portanto, também estamos construindo algo maior — um ecossistema de moderação e ferramentas de segurança de código aberto que dá às comunidades o poder de criar seus próprios espaços, com suas próprias normas e preferências. Ainda assim, usar o Bluesky é familiar e intuitivo. É um aplicativo simples à primeira vista, mas por baixo do capô, habilitamos uma verdadeira inovação e competição nas mídias sociais ao construir um novo tipo de rede aberta.</p>
<p>Você pode ler mais sobre nossa abordagem para moderação <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation">aqui</a>.</p>
<p>O que a função de silenciar faz?</p>
<p>Silenciar impede que você veja quaisquer notificações ou postagens principais de uma conta. Se eles responderem a um tópico, você verá uma seção que diz "Postagem de uma conta que você silenciou" com uma opção para mostrar a postagem. A conta não saberá que foi silenciada.</p>
<p>O que o bloqueio faz?</p>
<p>O bloqueio impede a interação. Quando você bloqueia uma conta, tanto você quanto a outra conta não poderão mais ver ou interagir com as postagens uma da outra.</p>
<p>Como eu denuncio abuso?</p>
<p>Você pode denunciar postagens clicando no menu de três pontos. Você também pode denunciar uma conta inteira visitando o perfil dela e clicando no menu de três pontos lá.</p>
<p>Onde posso ler mais sobre seus planos para moderação?</p>
<p>Você pode ler mais sobre nossa abordagem para moderação <a href="https://bsky.social/about/blog/03-12-2024-stackable-moderation">aqui</a>.</p>
 Feeds Personalizados 
<p>O que são feeds personalizados?</p>
<p>Feeds personalizados é um recurso no Bluesky que permite escolher o algoritmo que define sua experiência nas mídias sociais. Imagine querer que sua linha do tempo exiba apenas postagens dos seus contatos mútuos, ou apenas postagens com fotos de gatos, ou somente postagens relacionadas a esportes — você pode simplesmente selecionar seu feed preferido de um mercado aberto.</p>
<p>Para os usuários, a capacidade de personalizar seu feed devolve o controle de sua atenção para si mesmos. Para os desenvolvedores, um mercado aberto de feeds proporciona a liberdade de experimentar e publicar algoritmos que qualquer um pode usar.</p>
<p>Por exemplo, experimente <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:z72i7hdynmk6r22z27h6tvur/feed/hot-classic">este feed</a>.</p>
<p>Você pode ler mais sobre feeds personalizados e escolha algorítmica em nosso <a>post no blog aqui</a>.</p>
<p>Como eu uso feeds personalizados?</p>
<p>No Bluesky, clique no ícone de hashtag na parte inferior do aplicativo. A partir daí, você pode adicionar e descobrir novos feeds. Você também pode explorar diretamente os feeds através <a href="https://bsky.app/feeds">deste link</a>.</p>
<p>Como posso criar um feed personalizado?</p>
<p>Desenvolvedores podem usar nosso <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/feed-generator">kit inicial de gerador de feeds</a> para criar um feed personalizado. Eventualmente, forneceremos ferramentas melhores para que qualquer pessoa, incluindo não desenvolvedores, possa construir feeds personalizados.</p>
<p>Além disso, <a href="https://skyfeed.app/">SkyFeed</a> é uma ferramenta criada por um desenvolvedor independente que possui um recurso de Construtor de Feeds que você pode usar.</p>
 Domínios Personalizados 
<p>Como posso configurar meu domínio como meu identificador?</p>
<p>Por favor, consulte nosso tutorial <a>aqui</a>.</p>
<p>Posso comprar um domínio diretamente pelo Bluesky?</p>
<p>Sim, você pode comprar um domínio e definí-lo como seu nome de usuário pelo Bluesky <a href="https://account.bsky.app/">aqui</a>.</p>
 Privacidade de Dados 
<p>O que é público e o que é privado no Bluesky?</p>
<p>O Bluesky é uma rede social pública. Pense nas suas postagens como postagens de blog – qualquer pessoa na web pode vê-las, mesmo aquelas sem um código de convite. Um código de convite simplesmente concede acesso ao serviço que estamos executando e que permite publicar uma postagem você mesmo. (Desenvolvedores familiarizados com a API podem ver todas as postagens, independentemente de terem ou não uma conta própria.)</p>
<p>Especificamente:</p>
 
 Postagens e curtidas são públicas. 
 Bloqueios são públicos. 
 Silenciamentos são privados, mas as listas de silenciamento são listas públicas. Suas assinaturas de lista de silenciamento são privadas. 
 
<p>Por que minhas postagens, curtidas e bloqueios são públicos?</p>
<p>O Protocolo AT, no qual o Bluesky é construído, foi projetado para suportar conversas públicas. Para tornar as conversas públicas portáteis em todos os tipos de plataformas, seus dados são armazenados em repositórios de dados que qualquer pessoa pode visualizar. Isso significa que, independentemente de qual servidor você escolher para se juntar, você ainda poderá ver postagens em toda a rede, e se escolher mudar de servidor, poderá facilmente levar todos os seus dados com você. É isso que faz com que a experiência do usuário do Bluesky, um protocolo federado, seja semelhante a todos os outros aplicativos de mídia social que você usou antes.</p>
<p>Posso definir meu perfil para ser privado?</p>
<p>Atualmente, não existem perfis privados no Bluesky.</p>
<p>O que acontece quando eu excluo uma postagem?</p>
<p>Depois de excluir uma postagem, ela será imediatamente removida do aplicativo voltado para o usuário. Qualquer imagem anexada à sua postagem também será imediatamente excluída em nosso armazenamento de dados.</p>
<p>No entanto, leva um pouco mais de tempo para o conteúdo de texto de uma postagem ser completamente excluído no armazenamento. O conteúdo do texto é armazenado de forma não legível, mas é possível consultar os dados via API. Realizaremos periodicamente exclusões no back-end para apagar completamente esses dados.</p>
<p>Posso obter uma cópia de todos os meus dados?</p>
<p>Sim — o Protocolo AT mantém os dados do usuário em um <a href="https://github.com/web3-storage/ipfs-car">arquivo endereçado por conteúdo</a>. Este arquivo pode ser usado para migrar dados de conta entre servidores. Para desenvolvedores, você pode usar <a href="https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/blob/main/lexicons/com/atproto/sync/getRepo.json">este método</a> para exportar uma cópia do seu repositório.

				  Indicio recently released its European Central Cloud Scale Mediator to provide better latency and service to local users. Here’s what you need to know to build an effective decentralized identity solution in Europe.<br>  
			  
				
				
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Faster mediation, happier customers</p>
<p>Indicio recently unveiled its dedicated European cloud scale mediator. Now, customers across Europe have access to better latency and faster service when sending messages through a decentralized network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those not familiar, a mediator plays a key role in delivering messages in a decentralized network. You can think of it almost like a post office: the mediator receives messages and can find and deliver them to the correct recipient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is important because in a decentralized network there is no direct connection between you and the party you are trying to communicate with. Having a faster mediator allows a decentralized identity solution to process more messages and provide a better experience to the end user.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The European Cloud Scale Mediator is part of Indicio’s commitment to helping customers in Europe build powerful and fast identity solutions. Interest in the technology has been growing as the European Union looks to allow for easier travel and better identity management for its citizens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>European Identity Standards</p>
<p>If you are looking to build identity technology or processes in Europe, there are a number of regulations and standards to keep in mind. The two that are most important are the “electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services” (eIDAS) and OpenID Standards. If you’re not familiar with them, here’s a quick overview.</p>
<p><a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/eidas-regulation">eIDAS&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>The goal of eIDAS Regulation is to ensure that electronic interactions are safer, faster and more efficient, regardless of the European country in which they take place. The net result of the regulations is a single framework for electronic identification (eID) and trust services, making it more straightforward to deliver services across the European Union.</p>
<p>eIDAS2 (New!)</p>
<p>eIDAS was a good start, but as the technology has evolved, the European Union has recognized some issues and problems that the original regulations didn’t address. Namely, eIDAS does not cover how certificates or professional qualifications are issued and used (for example medical or attorney licenses), making these electronic credentials complicated to implement and use across Europe. More worryingly for the individual, it does not allow the end user to control the data exchanged during the verification process.</p>
<p>eIDAS2 proposes creating a European digital identity that can be controlled by citizens through a European Digital Identity Wallet (EDIW) that anyone can read to verify the identity of citizens.</p>
<p><a href="https://openid.net">OpenID</a></p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation was created to “lead the global community in creating identity standards that are secure, interoperable, and privacy-preserving.” This group is a non-profit standards body that you don’t technically need to be compliant with, but building along their guidelines will add interoperability to your project and allow more people to make use of it easier.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://openid.net/sg/openid4vc/">OpenID for VC or OID4VC</a></p>
<p>The OpenID Foundation also provides some specifications specifically for verifiable credentials and their issuance, presentation and how they are stored. You can learn more at the above link.</p>
<p>Indicio makes building easy</p>
<p>Indicio offers a full package of support to our European customers. Not only do we have all the pieces to help you put together the decentralized identity solution to best meet your needs, we make it our priority to offer solutions that are universal in accommodating current and emerging protocols and standards.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Martin Kuppinger</a></p><p>Only a bit more than two months to go until the global Digital Identity and IAM community gathers again at the European Identity and Cloud Conference (<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024">EIC</a>) in Berlin. From June 4th to 7th, we will spend four days packed with interesting sessions. More than 230 sessions, more than 250 speakers – this again will become a great event and the place to be.</p>
<p>When looking back at EIC 2023, I remember the Closing Keynote where I have been talking about three main topics and trends I had observed during that edition of EIC:</p>
 
 Decentralized Identity becoming a reality: My observation has been that decentralized identity started to shift from a discussion about early protocol developments and concepts to the real-world impact, on enterprise IAM and consumer business. 
 AI and Identity: Intensely discussed as a challenge we need to tackle. 
 Policy-based Access Controls: Not a new thing, but coming back with strong momentum, for instance in the development of modern digital services. Back in the spotlight. 
 
<p>So, where do we stand with this?</p>
<p>With the recent approval of eIDAS 2.0 by the European Parliament, which involves the EUDI Wallet (EU Decentralized Identity Wallet), the momentum for decentralized identity has experienced a massive leverage. It is the topic in Digital Identity and IAM of today, with many sessions around this at EIC.</p>
<p>AI and Identity also has also got its own track now. For a good reason. It is such an important topic with so many facets: the identity of AI and autonomous components powered by AI, AI empowering IAM, and so on. We started the discussion in 2023 and will continue in 2024.<br> <br> Policy-based Access Controls still is evolving. We see more and more traction, also in the conversations we have on both the research and the advisory side. More and more organizations are looking at how to make PBAC a reality.</p>
<p>Looking forward to EIC 2024: What can we expect from the next edition? Let me try a prediction of what I will cover on June 7th in the closing keynote:</p>
 
 Decentralized Identity again: With the momentum in the EU and beyond, it becomes increasingly clear what we already can do and where we need to join forces to meet the needs of businesses, consumers, citizens, and, last but not least, governments. 
 AI and Identity or “AIdentity”: I expect the conversations increasingly shift from discussing the challenge (as in 2023) to discussing the solutions. 
 Identity Security: There is Digital Identity. There is Cybersecurity. There is Identity Security, which is about the identity impact on cybersecurity. With the ever-increasing threats, this is a topic that will be covered in many sessions. 
 
<p>While you may argue that two out of three will be the same as in 2023, this is not entirely true. On one hand, this demonstrates what the mega-trends are. On the other, we will look at the next level of evolution for these areas. What does it need for the perfect EUDI wallet that everyone wants to use? How will we deal with the identities of autonomous agents or bots acting on our behalf? So many questions. There will be many answers at EIC, but also a lot of food for thought for 2024 and beyond.</p>
<p>But with more than 230 sessions covering such a broad range of topics, from running your IAM well and modernizing it towards an Identity Fabric to Decentralized Identity and the future of CIAM (Consumer IAM), it is hard to predict what finally will be the hottest topics that are not only discussed during sessions throughout the conference, in the breaks, in the evening events, and on all the other occasions EIC provides.</p>
<p>See you in Berlin. Don’t miss booking your individual time with the KuppingerCole Analysts and Advisors early. Looking forward to meeting you in person.</p>

			<p>9th of April, Luxembourg – <a href="https://silcgroup.com/">The SILC Group</a> (SILC), a leading alternative assets solutions provider based in Australia with more than $2 billion in funds under supervision, announced today it will partner with <a href="https://tokeny.com/">Tokeny</a>, the leading institutional tokenization solution provider. Together, they aim to realize SILC’s ambitious digitalization vision by upgrading alternative assets onto blockchain through tokenization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The collaboration begins with a pilot project aimed at tokenizing a test fund using Tokeny’s unique tokenization infrastructure. The pilot project will assess the potential of blockchain to ultimately replace the various legacy centralized systems that are used to administer funds used by SILC to unite investors and capital seekers within the alternative assets industry.</p>
<p>By combining both parties’ deep expertise, it is intended they will be able to offer the compliant tokenization of alternative assets in Australia and across the region, by delivering institutional-grade solutions in the issuance and lifecycle management of real-world asset tokens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The announcement marks a transformative step within the alternative assets industry as institutional involvement across blockchain begins to ramp up and significant players enter the market. The traditional way of issuing financial products is time-consuming, multi-tiered and involves many steps using cumbersome systems and processes. Through blockchain technology, parties can benefit from using one single and global infrastructure that can compliantly improve transaction speeds, utilize automation, and is accessible 24/7/365 days a year.</p>
<p>By using the ERC-3643 token smart contract standard, SILC will have the ability to automate compliance validation processes and control real-world asset tokens while preserving typical features of a blockchain like immutability and interoperability.</p>

		 
	 
    Blockchain technology offers a potential paradigm shift in the efficiency of capital markets, with The SILC Group seeking to pass these efficiency and service improvement gains along to our clients. We are excited to be working with Tokeny on this pilot as we explore ways to further support our clients and enhance risk management activities, as well as increase the velocity and scalability of the solutions we provide.  Koby JonesCEO of The SILC Group       Alternative assets are one of the most suitable assets to be tokenized to make it transparent, accessible, and transferable, which has been historically hard to do. Our collaboration with The SILC Group underscores the growing recognition among regulated institutions of tokenization's tremendous potential. It's no longer a question of if tokenization will occur, but rather, when it will fundamentally transform the financial landscape.  Luc FalempinCEO Tokeny

<p>Last month, the world got a preview of a looming catastrophe: the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to bypass antiquated identity and security systems. The news outlet 404 Media reported the discovery of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.404media.co/inside-the-underground-site-where-ai-neural-networks-churns-out-fake-ids-onlyfake/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">an “underground” service called OnlyFake</a>&nbsp;that created and sold fake IDs for 26 countries through Telegram, and one of 404’s reporters used one of OnlyFake’s IDs to bypass the “KYC,” or “know your customer,” process of crypto exchange OKX.</p><p>There’s nothing terribly new there, except that OnlyFake claims it uses AI to create the bogus documents. 404 wasn’t able to confirm OnlyFake’s claim to use AI, but OnlyFake’s deep-discount pricing may suggest the claims are real.</p><p>Either way, this should be a wake-up call: It’s only a question of when, not if, AI tools will be used at scale to bypass identity controls online.</p> New AI-Enabled Tools for Online Identity Fraud <p>The scariest thing about AI-generated fake IDs is how quickly and cheaply they can be produced. The OnlyFake team was reportedly selling AI-generated fake driver’s licenses and passports for $15, claiming they could produce hundreds of IDs simultaneously from Excel data, totaling up to 20,000 fakes per day.</p><p>A flood of cheap, convincing fake physical IDs would leave bars, smoke shops and liquor stores inundated with fake-wielding teenagers. But there would be some chance at detection, thanks to anti-fraud features, like holograms, UV images, and microtext, now common on physical ID cards.</p><p>But OnlyFakes’ products are tailored for use online, making them even more dangerous. When a physical ID is used online, the holograms and other physical anti-fraud measures are rendered useless. OnlyFakes even generates fake backdrops to make the images look like photos of IDs snapped with a cell phone.</p><p>One tentative method of making online identity more secure is video verification, but new technologies like OpenAI’s Sora are already undermining that method. They’re frighteningly effective in one-on-one situations, such as when a finance staffer was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/04/asia/deepfake-cfo-scam-hong-kong-intl-hnk/index.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">tricked out of $25 million by ‘deepfake’ versions of their own colleagues</a>.</p><p>With critical services moving online en masse, digital fraud is becoming even more professionalized and widespread than the offline version.</p> The Numbers Don’t Add Up, But They Don’t Have To <p>You might wonder how those generative fakes work without real driver’s licenses or passport numbers. If you submit an AI-generated driver’s license number for verification at a crypto exchange or other financial institution, the identity database would immediately flag it as a fake, right?</p><p>Well, not exactly. Police or other state entities can almost always directly access ID records, but those systems don’t give third parties easy access to their database—partly out of privacy concerns. Therefore, many verification systems simply can't ask the issuing agency if a driver’s license or ID is valid, hence why 404 Media was able to use an AI-generated card to fool OKX.</p><p>A KYC provider might instead rely on third-party data brokers for valid matches or pattern-based alphanumeric verification—in other words, determining whether or not an ID number is valid by whether it matches a certain pattern of letters and numbers used by issuers.</p><p>This would make such systems particularly vulnerable to AI fakes since detecting and reproducing patterns is where generative AI shines.</p><p>The OnlyFakes instance is just one example of a growing fraud problem that exploits flaws in our identity systems. The U.S. estimated losses&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106696?ref=blog.spruceid.com#:~:text=Fast%20Facts,benefits%20paid%20during%20the%20pandemic.">between $100-$135 billion</a>&nbsp;in pandemic unemployment insurance fraud, which is often perpetuated by false identities. Even scarier, there has been a rise in fake doctors, whether&nbsp;<a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-06-significant-threat-world-doctors-impersonators.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">selling fake treatments online</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/he-delivered-their-babies-and-examined-their-bodies-now-patients-are-suing-after-learning-he-used-a-fake-name-and-stolen-social-security-numbers-for-credentials/2017/12/30/b2732232-e43a-11e7-ab50-621fe0588340_story.html?ref=blog.spruceid.com">practicing in American hospitals</a>, enabled by identity fraud.</p><p>We can do better.</p> How Do We Fight AI Identity Fraud? <p>It’s clearly time to develop a new kind of identification credential—a digital ID built for the internet, and resistant to AI mimicry. An array of formats and standards are currently being adopted for this new kind of digital ID, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/california-rolls-out-digital-drivers-licenses-for-phones-how-to-sign-up-for-pilot-program/?ref=blog.spruceid.com">mDLs (mobile driver’s licenses)</a>&nbsp;and digital verifiable credentials.</p><p>At the core of these digital credentials are counterparts to the holograms and other measures that let a bartender verify your physical ID. That includes cryptographic security schemes, similar to what the<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/white-house-cryptographically-verify-official-communications-ai-deep-fakes-surge-2024-2?ref=blog.spruceid.com">&nbsp;White House is supposedly considering</a>&nbsp;to distinguish official statements from deepfakes. These cryptographic attestations use unique codes as long as 10 to the 77th power, making it computationally impossible for an AI to mimic.</p><p>However, new approaches are not without new risks. While digital ID systems may promise to prevent fraud and provide convenience, they must be implemented carefully to enshrine privacy and security throughout our infrastructure. When implemented without consideration for the necessary policy and data protection frameworks, they may introduce challenges such as surveillance, unwanted storage of personal information, reduced accessibility or even increased fraud.</p><p>Fortunately, many mitigations exist. For example, these digital IDs can be bound to physical devices using security chips known as secure elements, which can add the requirement for the same device to be present when they are being used. This makes digital IDs much harder to steal than just copying a file or leaking a digital key from your cloud storage. The technology can also be paired with privacy and accessibility laws to ensure safe and simple usage.</p><p>This new kind of ID makes it easier for the user to choose what data they reveal. Imagine taking a printed ID into a liquor store and being able to verify to the clerk that you’re over 21—without sharing your address or even your specific birthday. That flexibility alone would greatly increase privacy and security for individuals and society as a whole.</p><p>Privacy-preserving technology would also make it safer to verify a driver’s license number directly with the issuer, potentially rendering OnlyFake’s AI-generated fake ID numbers useless.</p><p>We’ve already sacrificed too much—in safety and in plain old dollars—by sticking with physical IDs in a digital world. Transitioning to a modernized, privacy-preserving, digital-first system would be a major blow to fraudsters, money launderers and even terrorists worldwide. It’s time.</p> <p>About SpruceID:&nbsp;SpruceID is building a future where users control their identity and data across all digital interactions.</p>

Private storage infrastructure is an important growth area for web3, and the Verida network is creating a decentralized and hyper-efficient tokenized data economy for private&nbsp;data.</p><p>Last year Verida <a href="https://news.verida.io/verida-storage-node-tokenomics-part-1-storage-node-economic-model-overview-780385fddac1">issued a Request for Proposals (RFP)</a> to progress the development and implementation of the Verida Network tokenomic modelling. The RFP called for independent parties to bid on the delivery of analysis, design, modelling, and implementation recommendations for the economic aspects of the protocol.</p><p>A very competitive bidder process resulted in 11 bids being received from vendors globally. After an extensive evaluation process we are excited to announce that Trout Creek Advisory was successful in their bid. They will be working closely with the Verida team as we open network access to storage providers, launch of the VDA token and its&nbsp;utility.</p><p><a href="https://www.troutcreekadvisory.com/">Trout Creek Advisory</a> is a full service cryptoeconomic design and strategy consultancy serving web3 native and institutional clients around the globe.

We’re delighted to now be able to leverage our own expertise towards the development of their token ecosystem, and to create a sustainable structure that will help ensure the protocol’s growth and most effectively enable private, distributed storage infrastructure for the broader community, ” said Brant Downes, Trout Creek Co-Founder.</p><p>“Verida’s Tokenomics RFP process resulted in many high quality submissions. Ultimately we chose Trout Creek given their strong proposal, and deep engagement they demonstrated through the process. They identified and addressed the specific needs for Verida cryptoeconomics, and through the evaluation process came out as best aligned to engage for this service.” Ryan Kris, COO &amp; Co-Founder.</p><p>We would like to thank <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcostenaro">Dave Costenaro</a> from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/build-well-consulting/">Build Well</a> who managed the bid process in conjunction with the Verida team. Dave previously worked at the CryptoEconLab at Protocol Labs, focusing on token incentives, tokenomics, mechanism design, and network monitoring for Filecoin.</p><p>We deeply thank all the teams who took time to submit bids for the RFP.

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Osman Celik</a></p>The landscape of cybersecurity is continually evolving, with new threats and technologies reshaping the way organizations protect their digital assets. In order to understand the significance of these changes, it is crucial to understand the evolving cyber threat landscape, which acts as the driving force behind cyber risk framework improvements. In this Advisory Note, we explore the latest revisions and updates to prominent cyber risk frameworks, including NIST CSF 2.0, ISO/IEC 27000 series, SOC 2, CIS, PCI-DSS 4.0, and CSA CCM. Investigating these frameworks and their adaptations enable practitioners to gain valuable insights into the emerging practices and standards that are essential to mitigating risk and ensuring the security of sensitive data.

<p>On top of that, the financial services industry is becoming increasingly regulated, particularly when it comes to verifying customer identities and incorporating anti-money laundering protocols.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Establishing mutual trust between customers and financial institutions goes a long way in preventing bank fraud. With the right practices in place, users enjoy a frictionless experience while financial institutions can prevent multiple types of consumer fraud using increased identity verification and monitoring — all while staying compliant with federal regulations.</p>

See <a href="https://news.verida.io/how-web3-and-depin-solves-ais-data-privacy-problems-4eff92a175f2">Part 2: How Web3 and DePIN Solves AI’s Data Privacy Problems</a>.</p><p>AI (artificial intelligence) has caused frenzied excitement among consumers and businesses alike — driven by a passionate belief that LLMs (large language models) and tools like ChatGPT will transform the way we study, work and&nbsp;live.</p><p>But just like in the internet’s early days, users are jumping in without considering how their personal data is used — and the impact this could have on their&nbsp;privacy.</p><p>There have already been countless examples of data breaches within the AI space. In March 2023, OpenAI temporarily took ChatGPT <a href="https://openai.com/blog/march-20-chatgpt-outage">offline</a> after a ‘significant’ error meant users were able to see the conversation histories of strangers.</p><p>That same bug meant the payment information of subscribers — including names, email addresses and partial credit card numbers — were also in the public&nbsp;domain.</p><p>In September 2023, a staggering 38 terabytes of Microsoft data was inadvertently <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/microsoft-ai-employee-accidentally-leaks-38tb-of-data">leaked</a> by an employee, with cybersecurity experts warning this could have allowed attackers to infiltrate AI models with malicious code.</p><p>Researchers have also been able to <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5aceb7a6-9d5a-4f1f-af3d-1ef0129b0934">manipulate</a> AI systems into disclosing confidential records.</p><p>In just a few hours, a group called Robust Intelligence was able to solicit personally identifiable information from Nvidia software and bypass safeguards designed to prevent the system from discussing certain&nbsp;topics.</p><p>Lessons were learned in all of these scenarios, but each breach powerfully illustrates the challenges that need to be overcome for AI to become a reliable and trusted force in our&nbsp;lives.</p><p>Gemini, Google’s chatbot, even admits that all conversations are processed by human reviewers — underlining the lack of transparency in its&nbsp;system.</p><p>“Don’t enter anything that you wouldn’t want to be reviewed or used,” says an alert to users&nbsp;warns.</p><p>AI is rapidly moving beyond a tool that students use for their homework or tourists rely on for recommendations during a trip to&nbsp;Rome.</p><p>It’s increasingly being depended on for sensitive discussions — and fed everything from medical questions to our work schedules.</p><p>Because of this, it’s important to take a step back and reflect on the top three data privacy issues facing AI today, and why they matter to all of&nbsp;us.</p> 1. Prompts aren’t&nbsp;private <p>Tools like ChatGPT memorize past conversations in order to refer back to them later.

<p></p>
<p>Digital identity shapes every facet of our online interactions. The quest for a system that balances decentralization, scalability, security, and user experience has been relentless. Today, I'm thrilled to share that TBD has birthed a new solution: the DID DHT method. This leap forward is not just a technical achievement; it's a foundational component for the more inclusive and trust-based digital world we want for tomorrow.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://did-dht.com/">specification</a> is nearing its first major version, and our team has produced client software in all of our <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/">open source SDKs</a> in more than five languages. We have also built and deployed a publicly-available developer gateway, which has already registered many thousands of DIDs, with staging and production-ready gateways coming soon.</p>
<p>Some of you may already be <a href="https://youtu.be/23lCRO2CIIY?si=R-a79TEKQQmv6Vj_">familiar with DID DHT</a> and why we’ve chosen to make it our default DID method, but if not, or if you’re curious to find out more, read on to learn more about how the method was created, and how we’ve ended up here today.</p>
 What Makes a Good DID Method?<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-dht#what-makes-a-good-did-method" title="Direct link to What Makes a Good DID Method?">​</a> 
<p>Our vision for a superior DID method hinged on several critical features:</p>
 
 Sufficient Decentralization — a foundational principle to mitigate censorship and enhance user autonomy. 
 Scalability and Accessibility –&nbsp;making digital identity accessible to billions, without a prohibitive cost barrier. 
 Comprehensive Feature Set — supporting multiple cryptographic key types, services, and other core DID properties. 
 Reliable and Verifiable History — enabling trust through transparency historical data. 
 Global Discoverability – facilitating easy access and independent verification of digital identifiers. 
 
 The Evolution of Our DID Strategy<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-dht#the-evolution-of-our-did-strategy" title="Direct link to The Evolution of Our DID Strategy">​</a> 
<p>Historically our software has supported <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">did:key</a>, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">did:web</a>, and <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec">did:ion</a>, and some other methods within certain segments of our stack. Recognizing the impracticality of a "one-size-fits-all" approach, we embraced a multi-method strategy. Today that strategy incorporates three key DID methods: <a href="https://github.com/quartzjer/did-jwk/blob/main/spec.md">did:jwk</a>, <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-web/">did:web</a>, and <a href="https://tbd54566975.github.io/did-dht-method/">did:dht</a>, each catering to specific scenarios with their unique strengths.</p>
<p>Within our SDKs, JWK replaces did:key, a simple and widely adopted method that uses standard JSON Web Keys (JWKs), limiting complexity over did:key’s approach to using multi-formats. DID Web is an obvious choice for entities with existing brands, as trust can be easily linked to existing domains without the use of any special or complex technology. DID DHT is a new method that we view as a replacement for ION, which has strong decentralization characteristics, a robust feature set, and a simpler architecture.</p>
 Leaping Beyond ION<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-dht#leaping-beyond-ion" title="Direct link to Leaping Beyond ION">​</a> 
<p>The biggest change we’ve made is going from ION to DID DHT.</p>
<p>ION is a <a href="https://identity.foundation/sidetree/spec/">Sidetree-based DID method</a> that is a L2 on the Bitcoin blockchain. ION is a fully-featured DID method, and one of the few that supports root key rotation and discoverability of all DIDs with complete historical state. However, there are three main reasons that led us to move away from using ION — architectural complexity, centralization risk, and a sub-optimal user experience.</p>
<p>While ION presented a robust DID method with admirable features, its complexity, centralization risks, and user experience challenges prompted us to explore alternatives. DID DHT stands out as our choice for a new direction, offering simplicity, enhanced decentralization, and a user-friendly approach without compromising on the core features essential for a comprehensive DID method.</p>
 Enter DID DHT<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-dht#enter-did-dht" title="Direct link to Enter DID DHT">​</a> 
<p>DID DHT is built upon <a href="https://github.com/Nuhvi/pkarr">Pkarr</a>, a community-created project. Pkarr stands for Public Key Addressable Resource Records and acts as a bridge between our DID method and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainline_DHT">Mainline Decentralized Hash Table</a>, overlaying DNS record semantics and providing a space-efficient encoding mechanism for DID Documents. The choice of Mainline DHT, with its over 20 million active nodes and a 15-year successful run, guarantees exceptional decentralization out of mainline nodes, but can also leverage Pkarr nodes and DID DHT gateways for additional functionality.</p>
<p>DID DHT trades off use of a blockchain for immediate decentralization, fast publishing and resolution, and trustless verification. That’s right — the DID Document’s records are signed by its own key before entering the DHT — there’s no need to trust nodes, as you can verify payloads yourself client-side. Similar to ION, DID DHT documents support multiple keys, services, type indexing, and other DID Document properties.</p>
<p>DID DHT, however, is not without its limitations. The main three being: a need to republish records to nodes regularly to prevent them from expiring from the DHT and reliance on a non-rotatable Ed25519 key called the “identity key,” as is required by the DHT and <a href="https://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0044.html">BEP44</a>, and historical DID state not being shared between nodes. Our ongoing development and the community-driven enhancements aim to address these challenges, refining DID DHT's architecture for broader applicability and reliability.</p>
 DID DHT Opportunities<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-dht#did-dht-opportunities" title="Direct link to DID DHT Opportunities">​</a> 
<p>One of the most interesting opportunities we have identified for DID DHT is <a href="https://did-dht.com/#interoperability-with-other-did-methods">interoperability</a> with existing single-key methods like <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-method-key/">did:key</a> and <a href="https://github.com/quartzjer/did-jwk/blob/main/spec.md">did:jwk</a>. Essentially, you can continue to use single-key methods as you do today, with an optional resolution step to the DHT to extend the functionality of these methods, like adding additional keys or service(s) to a DID Document. We have begun to define this interoperability in the <a href="https://did-dht.com/registry/index.html#interoperable-did-methods">method’s registry</a>.</p>
<p>Another interesting opportunity for DID DHT is with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/did-wg/WorkMode/">W3C DID working group</a>, which is currently going through a rechartering effort to focus on interoperability and DID Resolution. Depending on how the charter ends up, there could be an opportunity to promote the DID DHT method as one that is broadly interoperable, decentralized, and does not necessitate the use of a blockchain — a common critique of DIDs by community members in the past.</p>
<p>We have additional ideas such as associating human-readable names with DIDs, tying DIDs into trust and discoverability services, and supporting gossip between DID DHT gateways. We encourage you to <a href="https://github.com/TBD54566975/did-dht-method/">join us on GitHub</a> to continue the discussion.</p>
 Looking Forward<a href="https://developer.tbd.website/blog/did-dht#looking-forward" title="Direct link to Looking Forward">​</a> 
<p>The introduction of DID DHT represents a significant milestone in our journey toward a more decentralized, accessible, and secure digital identity landscape. We believe DID DHT has the characteristics to make it widely useful, and widely adopted. <a href="https://developer.tbd.website/docs/web5/build/decentralized-identifiers/how-to-create-did/">Try it out</a> for yourself, and let us know what you think.</p>
<p>As we continue to refine and expand its capabilities, we invite the community to join us in this endeavor, contributing insights, feedback, and innovations to shepard DID DHT toward becoming your default DID method.</p>

<div class='wrap'>

<p>I’ve recently started to explore the world that is non-human identity. Coming out of <a href="https://youtu.be/zIadPdCQsJE?si=9S-KrcbOCYsM22tU">IETF 119</a>, where some of the best (and most terrifying) hallway conversations were about physical and software supply chains, I realized this was a space that didn’t look like what I’d experienced early in my digital identity career.</p>



<p>When I was first responsible for the group managing digital identity for a university, our issues with non-human identity centered around access cards. These were provisioned in the same system that provisioned employee badges: the HR system. Having entities that were not people in a people-driven system always involved annoying policy contortions. It was fitting a square peg in a round hole.</p>



<p>That kind of non-human identity has nothing to do with what I learned at IETF 119. Personally, I blame cloud computing.</p>



 Cloud Computing 



<p>Depending on the person you’re talking to, cloud computing is often seen as the answer to a company’s computing cost and efficiency problems. Rather than paying for a data center, equipment, network capacity, and all the staff that goes with it, the company can buy only the computing power it needs, and the rest magically disappears. IT staff tend to look at cloud computing another way: the same headaches, just more complicated to manage because they are on someone else’s computers.</p>



<p>However, cost and some dimensions of efficiency are the driving force behind business costs, and cloud computing has become even more attractive. Companies regularly purchase cloud computing services from a variety of vendors. A cloud here via Microsoft for Azure, a cloud there at Amazon Web Services for database computing, and another cloud there at Google for storage. It looks fantastic on paper (or at least on a monitor), but it’s introduced big identity problems as a result.</p>



 Authorization in the Cloud 



<p>Processes and APIs are not people. They don’t get hired and fired over the course of years like people do. They may never be associated with a person at all. And yet, they usually have a start and an end. They need to be constrained to access or accomplish only the specific things they are supposed to do. They may delegate specific tasks to other processes. They need authorization and access control at a speed and scale that makes human authorization look like a walk in the park.</p>



<p>If all authorizations happen in one environment, it’s not too bad. Everything gets their data from the same sources and in the format they expect. It might be like those old key cards managed via a people system, even when they aren’t themselves people, but it is a simple enough model.</p>



 Authorization in Many Clouds 



<p>However, if the authorization has to happen across environments, things get hairy. The format of the code may change. The source of truth may vary depending on where the process started. There may be hundreds, thousands, millions more of these processes and APIs than there are people in the company. And these processes are almost entirely independent of any human involvement.</p>



<p>This new kind of non-human identity operates in ways human identities don’t. Batch processing is a great example since the process does not necessarily act on behalf of a user. Training an AI model is batch processing that runs for a week and has no human involved. Batch transactions in the bank, such as payroll, run unsupervised and aren’t handled as a person. Furthermore, a human may be flagged by a computer’s security system as showing strange behavior when they are logging in from both Brisbane and Chicago simultaneously. An application, in all its glory, may suddenly expand to be in data centers around the world because it’s dealing with a Taylor Swift concert sale. What would be anomalous for a person is just another day in cloud computing.</p>



<p>Sorry, HR badge system, you’re just not suited for managing authorization here.</p>



 DevOps, IT Admins, and IAM Practitioners 



<p>Developing and deploying code in a cloud environment is generally in the hands of the DevOps and IT teams. DevOps traditionally move quickly to develop and manage the applications a company needs to deliver its products or services. IT teams deal with the applications that have been developed and deployed. The staff in these groups often specialize in one cloud computing environment or another; it’s not easy to be a generalist in this space.</p>



<p>DevOps is often the fastest in terms of getting new code in place, and the IT admin tries to deal with the symptoms of what’s been developed and deployed. Neither group tends to think in terms of identity management; most IAM teams are focused on people. This is a problem.</p>



<p>Identity administrators are beginning to understand there is an authorization problem, but solutions are sparse. DevOps teams also realize they have an identity problem (ask your favorite DevOps person how much fun it is to manage API permissions without leaking a password or private key). But the DevOps team is not going to the IAM people and say, “Create all these millions of identities and manage them for us, kthxbai.” For one thing, it wouldn’t occur to them. For another, the IAM staff would have a nervous breakdown.</p>



 Standards to the Rescue! 



<p>And here’s where the hallway conversations at IETF 119 enter the story. The whole reason I learned about the authorization-in-the-cloud problem was because of discussions around two working groups and an almost-working group:</p>



 
 <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/scitt/about/">Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust (scitt)</a> 



 <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/wimse/about/">Workload Identity in Multi System Environments (wimse)</a> 



 <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/spice/about/">Secure Patterns for Internet CrEdentials (spice)</a> 
 



 SCITT 



<p>The big picture here is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_supply_chain">software supply chain</a>. A software supply chain is the collection of components, libraries, tools, and processes used to develop, build, and publish software. Software is very rarely one monolithic thing. Instead, it’s made up of lots of different components. Some may be open-source libraries, and some may be proprietary to the company selling them.</p>



<p>Just like a physical bill of materials is required when importing or exporting physical goods, there is also a software bill of materials (SBOM) that is supposed to list all the components of a software package. Now, wouldn’t it be fantastic if, based on a computer-readable, standardized format of an SBOM, a computer could decide in real-time whether a particular software package was safe to run based on a quick check for any severe security vulnerabilities associated with any of the components listed in the SBOM?</p>



<p>It’s an entirely different way of looking at authorization, and that’s what scitt is working on.</p>



 WIMSE 



<p>Workload identity is a term that’s still struggling to find a common, industry-wide definition (not an unusual problem in the IAM space). I do like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_supply_chain">Microsoft’s definition</a>, though: “an identity you assign to a software workload (such as an application, service, script, or container) to authenticate and access other services and resources.”</p>



<p>I mentioned earlier that there can be a ridiculous number of applications and services running across multiple cloud environments. DevOps gets to develop and deploy those, but IT admins need to keep track of all the signals from all the services to make sure everything is running as expected and uninfluenced by hackers. There needs to be a standardized format for the signals all these workloads will send, regardless of any particular cloud environment.</p>



<p>Enter WIMSE. WIMSE is standardizing secure identity presentation for workload components to enable least-privilege access and obtain signals from audit trails so that IT admins get visibility and exercise control of over workload identities. To make it more challenging, this must be platform agnostic because no one is deploying single-platform environments.</p>



 SPICE 



<p>Sometimes, processes and APIs have nothing to do with humans. But sometimes, they do. They might run as a person in order to do something on that person’s behalf. In those cases, it would make life a lot easier to have a credential format that is lightweight enough to support the untold number of workload identities out there AND the human identities that might exist in the same complex ecosystem.</p>



<p>Here is where the proposed working group, spice, sits. Personally, I think it might have the hardest job of the three. While standardizing a common format makes a lot of sense, we can’t ignore that with human identities, issues like privacy, identity verification and proofing, and revocation are an incredibly big deal. Those same issues, however, either don’t apply or don’t apply in the same way for workload identities. If you insist on constraining the credential to be entirely human in its concerns, it’s too burdensome for the millions of apps and processes to handle at the speeds necessary. If you don’t constrain the credentials, security problems may creep in if the developers misuse the credentials.</p>



<p>So, of course, this is the group I volunteered to co-chair. I’m insane.</p>



 Wrap Up 



<p>Non-human identity is identity at an unprecedented scale. It’s a whole new world because there are many more workload instances than users. The same tooling and standards for human identity are not designed to operate at this new scale or velocity.</p>



<p>I have a lot more to learn in this space, and one person I follow (literally, I will chase him down in hallways) who knows a LOT about this stuff is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pieter-kasselman-0259862/">Pieter Kasselman</a> (Microsoft). He and several others are engaged within the IETF and the broader world to make sense of this complicated and anxiety-inducing space. If you work in IAM and you default to only thinking about the people in your organization, I’m afraid you need to start thinking much more broadly about your field. If you need a place to start, come to <a href="https://identiverse.com/">Identiverse 2024</a> or <a href="https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/120/">IETF 120</a> and hang out with me as we all learn about the non-human identity landscape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As society becomes more reliant on technology, the protection of confidential data increases. One innovative way organizations are keeping information safe is through fingerprint biometrics. In this article, we will explore the science of fingerprint biometrics and highlight its potential for security. We will analyze how security biometrics can be utilized and how this technology shapes our present and future security landscapes.</p>
 Key Takeaways 
 
 Fingerprint Uniqueness: The patterns of an individual’s fingerprints are uniquely influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. They serve as an effective and dependable identification method. 
 Scanner Diversity: Different fingerprint scanners (optical, capacitive, ultrasonic, and thermal) address diverse security requirements. These scanners differ in cost, accuracy, durability, and spoofing resistance. 
 Biometrics Future: Despite the powerful security advantages of fingerprint biometrics, issues like potential data theft and privacy violations demand continuous technological evolution and robust legal safeguards. Future prospects for the field include 3D fingerprint imaging, AI integration, and advanced anti-spoofing techniques. 
 
 What Are Fingerprint Biometrics? 
<p>Fingerprint biometrics is the systematic study and application of unique physical attributes inherent in an individual’s fingerprints. Representing a more dependable identification method than traditional passwords or identity cards, fingerprint biometrics eliminates the issues of misplacement, forgetfulness, or theft. The distinctive nature of each person’s fingerprint ensures a robust barrier against unauthorized access to secure data.</p>
 The Science of Uniqueness: Fingerprints Origins 
<p>Fingerprints are nature’s signature of a person’s identity. Using fingerprints as a biometric identification tool dates back to ancient Babylon and has roots in our evolutionary biology. The friction ridges on our fingertips that comprise these prints have been crucial to human survival, helping us grip and touch objects.</p>
 Genetics and Environmental Factors: The Roots of Fingerprint Uniqueness 
<p>Fingerprints are formed during the embryonic stage and remain unaltered throughout an individual’s life. No two individuals, not even identical twins, share the same fingerprint. The basis for this uniqueness can be traced back to the genetic and environmental factors that influence the development of fingerprints.</p>
<p>Aspects of fingerprints that are analyzed include:</p>
 
 Patterns: The general pattern or type of fingerprint (arch, loop, or whorl) is inherited through genetics. 
 Minutiae: The precise details of the ridges, known as minutiae, are influenced by random and unpredictable factors such as pressure, blood flow, and position in the womb during development. 
 Ridges: Each ridge in a fingerprint contains several minutiae points, which can be bifurcations (where one ridge splits into two) or ridge endings. 
 
<p>The distribution and layout of minutiae points vary in every individual, contributing to the specific characteristics of each fingerprint. It is these characteristics that biometric systems analyze when comparing and matching fingerprints.</p>
 Behind the Screen: How Fingerprint Biometrics Work 
<p>Fingerprint recognition is achieved through three steps.</p>
 
 A fingerprint scanner captures the fingerprint, converting the physical pattern into a digital format. 
 The automated recognition system then processes this image to extract distinctive features, forming a unique pattern-matching template. 
 Finally, the facial recognition system matches this template against stored identification or identity verification templates. 
 
<p>Depending on the exact type of fingerprint scanner a business uses, the scanner may use optical, capacitive, ultrasonic, or thermal technologies. Each fingerprint technology has its strengths and weaknesses and will vary in cost, accuracy, and durability.</p>
<p>While the efficacy of biometric scanners is unquestionable, questions about their safety often arise. Potential challenges of fingerprint and facial recognition systems include false acceptance or rejection and biometric data theft.</p>
<p>Although rare, false acceptance of biometric technology can lead to unauthorized access, while false rejection can deny access to legitimate users. Furthermore, if biometric data is compromised, the repercussions can be severe, given that fingerprints cannot be changed, unlike passwords.</p>
<p>However, continuous technological advancements aim to mitigate these risks. Enhanced encryption techniques, anti-spoofing measures, identity verification, and continuous authentication are ways technology addresses these concerns. Together, these enhancements can improve the reliability and security of fingerprint biometrics.</p>
 In-depth Look at Fingerprint Scanners: Optical vs. Capacitive vs. Ultrasonic vs. Thermal 
<p>There are various types of fingerprint scanners, each with strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Optical scanners are the most traditional type. They take a digital fingerprint picture using a light source and a photodiode (a device that turns light into electrical current). Optical scanners are simple to use but can be easily fooled with a good-quality fingerprint image.</p>
 Capacitive scanners 
<p>Commonly found in smartphones, capacitive scanners use electrical current to sense and map the ridges and valleys of a fingerprint. They offer higher resolution and security than optical scanners but can be sensitive to temperature and electrostatic discharge.</p>
 Ultrasonic scanners 
<p>Ultrasonic scanners are considered more secure than optical and capacitive scanners. They use high-frequency sound waves to penetrate the epidermal layer of the skin. This allows them to capture both the surface and sub-surface features of the skin. This information helps form a 3D image of the fingerprint and makes the scanner less prone to spoofing.</p>
 Thermal scanners 
<p>This type of scanner is the least common of the four. Thermal scanners detect minutiae based on the temperature differences of the contact surface. However, their high costs and sensitivity to ambient temperature make them less popular choices.</p>
 Protecting Biometric Identities: Emerging Methods 
<p>As different biometric authentication technologies become more prevalent, safeguarding these identifiers from data breaches has become increasingly crucial. Biometric data, once compromised, cannot be reset or altered like a traditional password, making its protection paramount.</p>
<p>One of the most cost-effective methods for protecting biometric identities is liveness detection. This technology helps differentiate between a live biometric sample from a synthetic or forged one. These systems can differentiate between a live finger and a spoof by analyzing properties of live skin, such as sweat pores and micro-texture.</p>
<p>By detecting bodily responses or using AI to analyze input data for anomalies, liveness detection can add another layer of security to our biometric identification systems.</p>
<p>Decentralized storage methods, such as blockchain technology, are another avenue for safeguarding biometric data. Instead of storing the data in a central database, it’s dispersed across multiple nodes. These numerous locations make it nearly impossible for hackers to access the entire dataset. While this technology is promising, it’s still nascent and faces scalability and energy efficiency issues.</p>
 Potential Issues with Fingerprint Biometrics and Solutions 
<p>Fingerprint biometrics has its challenges; a common issue users face is the quality of the scanned fingerprint. Poor-quality images can deny legitimate users access to facilities, databases, or other secure locations.</p>
<p>Factors that can affect a person’s fingerprint quality include:</p>
 
 A person’s age 
 Substances on an individual’s hand 
 Skin conditions like dermatitis 
 Manual labor 
 
<p>Furthermore, some systems can be fooled by artificial fingerprints made from various materials like silicone or gelatin, a practice known as spoofing.</p>
<p>Multi-factor authentication, which requires more than one form of identification, is an increasingly used method to enhance security.</p>
 Securing Biometric Data: Ethical and Legal Considerations 
<p>While biometric authentication offers many significant benefits, it presents unprecedented privacy and data security challenges. Biometric data, unlike other forms of personal data, is intimately tied to our physical bodies. This makes its theft or misuse potentially more invasive and damaging.</p>
<p>The legal landscape for biometric data is still evolving. In many jurisdictions, existing privacy laws may not be sufficient to cover biometric data. This leaves gaps in protection. Stricter regulations and law enforcement may be necessary to ensure that all biometric information is collected, stored, and used in a manner that respects individual privacy.</p>
<p>Biometric data security isn’t just about preventing unauthorized access to biometric identifiers. It also involves ensuring that the biometric data, once collected, isn’t used for purposes beyond what was initially agreed. This could include selling the data to third parties or using it for surveillance.</p>
 Fingerprint Biometrics in Action: Real-world Applications and Impact 
<p>Fingerprint biometrics extends beyond personal devices and is a cornerstone of modern security across various sectors.</p>
<p>Fingerprints provide irrefutable evidence for law enforcement and forensics teams by helping identify and track suspects. Moreover, businesses and institutions leverage fingerprint biometrics for physical access control, ensuring that only authorized personnel can enter certain premises.</p>
<p>The advent of smartphones equipped with fingerprint sensors has furthered the customer experience and fortified personal device security. Users can unlock their phones, authenticate payments, and secure apps by simply touching a sensor. This biometric authentication offers convenient access control and security while remaining cost effective.</p>
<p>Smart ID cards incorporating fingerprint biometrics are increasingly used in various sectors</p>
 
 Not surprisingly, government and military operations make frequent use of this type of biometric security. 
 However, an automated fingerprint identification system can also be employed in the healthcare industry to allow individuals to gain access to restricted areas. 
 Employees in the education sector can use fingerprint biometrics to enter schools and universities. 
 The corporate world can use this technology to prevent identity theft. 
 Financial systems also integrate fingerprint biometrics, adding a layer of protection over transactions and access to financial services. It helps reduce fraud and ensure customer trust, making it a valuable tool in banking and financial security. 
 
<p>As these real-world case studies illustrate successful implementations of fingerprint identification and other security biometrics. These include visa applications and the distribution of government benefits. Whether securing a company’s computer systems and premises or identifying criminals, fingerprint biometrics have proven their value and substantially impacted security.</p>
 Beyond the Horizon: Future Trends and Innovations in Fingerprint Biometrics 
<p>Fingerprint biometrics, like all technologies, continues to evolve. Several trends and innovations promise to enhance the capabilities and applicability of this technology.</p>
<p>The most recent advancements include 3D fingerprint imaging, which provides a more detailed fingerprint representation that enhances accuracy. Anti-spoofing techniques are also being developed to combat attempts at tricking fingerprint sensors with fake digital fingerprints too.</p>
<p>Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning offers immense possibilities. These technologies can help improve voice recognition algorithms, making them more highly accurate and adaptable.</p>
<p>Despite these advancements, it’s essential to acknowledge that striking a balance between security and privacy with fingerprint technologies remains challenging. As biometric techniques evolve, unfortunately, so will privacy concerns.</p>
 Diversifying Biometric Security: Face and Iris Recognition 
<p>While fingerprints are common biometric security, they aren’t the only biometric technology method available. For instance, facial recognition technology and iris scanning add more layers of protection.</p>
 Facial recognition 
<p>Facial recognition technology uses machine learning algorithms to identify individuals based on their facial features. This technology has seen an increase in use in recent years, especially in surveillance systems and mobile devices. Despite concerns about privacy and misuse, facial recognition is undeniably a powerful tool in biometrics and homeland security.</p>
 Iris scanning 
<p>Another form of biometric identification is iris scanning. This technique scans a person’s irises using infrared technology and analyzes their individual patterns. Iris scans offer a higher level of security due to the iris’s complex structure, which remains stable throughout an individual’s life. However, it can be more expensive and more complicated to implement than other forms of biometrics.</p>
<p>Integrating these methods with fingerprint biometrics can create a multi-modal biometric system, providing businesses with businesses more reliable and robust security.</p>

 Although Peru has a long-standing relationship with gambling and is one of a few South American countries to have allowed local and international companies to operate online casinos and betting sites, recent regulations have changed the game. Here’s what domestic and international operators need to know. 



 



<p>Hot on the heels of Colombia, Argentina (Buenos Aires, Mendoza and Córdoba), and, most recently, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">Brazil</a>, Peru has decided to introduce new regulations and gaming licenses for local and international operators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prior to October 2023, although online gambling in Peru was permitted by the constitution, it operated within a rather relaxed regulatory framework.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Peruvian market has grown exponentially in the last few years and from the point of view of the customers, the operators and the government, it was mandatory to be on the regulated side of the industry. Recent changes will attract investors, generate an increase in government collection, protect players from responsible gaming and reduce illegal operators,” said Nicholas Osterling, Founder of Peru gaming platform, Playzonbet.</p>



 Brief history of gambling in Peru. 



<p>Peru’s gambling industry has undergone significant changes since it legalized land-based casinos in 1979. Key milestones over the past four decades have included tax regulations and ethical guidelines for casinos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Online gambling regulations emerged later, with the first online casino license issued in 2008. Unlike other South American countries, Peru has never explicitly banned offshore or local online casinos, as long as they met the established domestic standards for any company. This relatively open market approach has attracted numerous international and local brands.</p>



 Clearing the regulatory path for operators. 



<p>MINCETUR is the national administrative authority in charge of regulating, implementing, and overseeing all aspects of online gaming and sports betting in Peru.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Responsibilities include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  Issuing licenses to qualified operators.<br>  Monitoring operator activities for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/gambling-compliance/">compliance</a> with regulations.<br>  Enforcing fines, sanctions, or criminal proceedings for non-compliance.<br>  Fostering a safe gambling environment especially for players.&nbsp;  



<p>Within MINCETUR, the Directorate General of Casino Games and Gaming Machines (DGJCMT) is an important executive body that is particularly instrumental in ensuring player protection, improving game quality, and enforcing regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In August 2022, Peru passed Law No. 31557 and its amendment, Law No. 31806, which established a comprehensive legal framework for most gambling activities. These laws were further clarified in 2023 by <a href="https://img.lpderecho.pe/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Decreto-Supremo-005-2023-Mincetur-LPDerecho.pdf">Supreme Decree No. 005-2023</a>, which provided detailed regulations for online sports betting and other real-money gaming services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under these new regulations, international online casino operators must obtain a license from the DGJCMT to operate legally. The decree also outlines the process for obtaining and maintaining a license. Penalties for non-compliance include hefty fines and possible exclusion from the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>MINCETUR set a pre-registration phase from February 13 – March 13 for domestic and international gambling operators already active in the market. During this phase, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/">remote gaming</a> and sports betting operators, certification laboratories, and service providers could register their interest for preliminary consideration of their applications. Juan Carlos Mathews, Peru’s Minister of Foreign Trade and Tourism, confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamesbras.com/english-version/2024/3/21/peru-receives-145-licence-applications-for-online-gambling-in-30-days-43638.html">145 requests had been received</a> from both national and international companies and for both casino and sports betting business units. Although this stage is now closed, newcomers to the Peru market can continue to apply.</p>

 Objectives of the new Peru gaming license. 



<p>The new Peru gambling license places safety and consumer protection at the forefront of its objectives. With a focus on ensuring a secure environment for players, promoting responsible gambling practices, and formalizing online gaming and sports betting activities, these regulations aim to create a robust and transparent framework for the Peruvian gambling industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, the Peruvian government is opting for a more simplified approach compared to the <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/brazilian-gambling-license-structure/">complex structure of the Brazilian gambling license.</a></p>



 Secure gaming environment for consumers. 



<p>The regulations prioritize security by implementing measures to protect consumers. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/age-verification/">Age verification</a> requirements and participation restrictions ensure that only adults engage in gambling activities, while strict measures will be in place to prevent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/money-laundering/">money laundering</a> and fraud, fostering a safe and secure environment for players. A <a href="https://www.idnow.io/regulation/what-is-kyc/">Know Your Customer (KYC)</a> process must also be in place to verify the age, <a href="https://www.idnow.io/gaming/?utm_term=&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;hsa_acc=5234001163&amp;hsa_cam=21059765194&amp;hsa_grp=&amp;hsa_ad=&amp;hsa_src=x&amp;hsa_tgt=&amp;hsa_kw=&amp;hsa_mt=&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gad_source=1">identity, and nationality of players</a>.</p>



<p>Registration and verification.</p>



<p>To create an account on a gaming platform, players must register with the following data:&nbsp;</p>



<p>i. Full name(s) and surname(s);</p>



<p>ii. Type of identification document;</p>



<p>iii. Identification document number;</p>



<p>iv. Date of birth;</p>



<p>v. Nationality;</p>



<p>vi. Address (address, district, province, and department); and</p>



<p>vii.Statement regarding their status as a Politically Exposed Person (PEP).</p>



<p>Promotion of responsible gaming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new Peruvian regulations promote responsible gaming practices by encouraging operators to implement self-exclusion tools and support programs for players struggling with problem gambling. By raising awareness of the potential risks, the regulations aim to mitigate harm and promote responsible behavior within the industry.&nbsp;Only individuals of legal age (18 years) can register and access a user and gaming account. Gaming accounts will be blocked when the verification of the person’s identity is unsuccessful or is determined the player is registered on any exclusion list.</p>



<p>Preparing for compliance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the application process, certification laboratories, remote sports betting and gaming operators, and service providers will be asked to enter their details on the <a href="https://extranet.mincetur.gob.pe/extranet2/Home/Inicio">MINCETUR website</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although the website is only available in Spanish, international operators are advised to devote the necessary resources to enter information correctly. Accurate information provided during pre-registration is critical to avoid delays and ensure the smooth processing of license applications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operators must also ensure they have the necessary technical infrastructure in place, such as robust <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/kyc-check/">KYC checks</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operators who do not have a license or fail to comply will face:</p>



  Significant fines.<br>  Revocation of licenses.<br>  Potential criminal charges.  



 Fines for non-compliance in the Peru gambling market. 



<p>Operators who fail to obtain a license while continuing to offer remote gaming could face fines of up to 990,000 Sol, which amounts to approximately £207,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If a licensee fails to verify the identity, age, and nationality of players as required by MINCETUR regulations, a fine of between 50-150 Peru tax units will be imposed, which amounts to between £53,500-160,600. It is therefore crucial for operators to implement solid KYC procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Article 243-C of the new law also imposes prison sentences of up to four years for those found to be operating online casino games or sports betting without a proper license.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Operating in the Peruvian market without a license may result in exclusion from the market and possible prosecution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Peru aims to generate more revenue from the new Peruvian gaming license by introducing a special gaming tax. The tax rate is set at 12% of the net profits from online gambling activities, to be paid by licensed operators, both domestic and foreign alike.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The government estimates that the new regulations will generate tax revenues of approximately 162 million Sol (£33.9 million) per year, putting the total size of the Peru gambling market at around £1 billion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Full enforcement of the new regulations, including licensing requirements and potential penalties for non-compliance, began on April 1, 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All companies, both domestic and foreign, operating in the Peruvian online gaming market must comply with the new regulations. Failure to obtain a license while continuing operations will result in fines, exclusions, and criminal charges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To be eligible for a Peruvian gambling license, operators must adhere to security protocols, implement KYC processes to verify player identity and age, and have sound responsible gaming policies in place. Provisions of around £1.2 million must also be in place to prevent money laundering and financial <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/fraud/">fraud</a>.</p>



 The future of gambling in Peru. 



<p>Implementing a licensing regime will obviously have an impact on the profitability of gaming operators in the market. However, the online gaming market in Peru is also expected <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/dmo/eservices/online-gambling/peru">to grow at a minimum rate of 6.4% per annum.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A regulated online gambling market ensures a clear legal framework for operators to conduct their business and reduces potential legal risks. Increased consumer confidence also leads to higher revenues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Peru is a very traditional market when it comes to sports betting. We Peruvians love soccer, and we are very passionate about betting. The industry here has had several years of growth and now that it will become a regulated market it will be even more attractive for vendors and operators that are only interested in these types of jurisdictions,” added Nicholas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With a stable economy and a growing middle class among its 33 million inhabitants, Peru is considered one of the most attractive markets for international gaming operators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Peru emerges as a key player in the Latin American gaming market, operators must quickly adapt to the new regulatory landscape to ensure sustainable growth and success in this dynamic industry.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/people/">Mike Small</a></p><p>When an organization uses a cloud service, it must make sure that it does this in a way that is secure and complies with their obligations. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) provides a broad set of integrated cloud security services to help its customers achieve these objectives. Oracle continuously innovates to improve these services and Oracle Cloud Guard has now been enhanced to provide a complete Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) for OCI.</p>
 Complementary User Entity Controls 
<p>To meet their security and compliance obligations when using OCI the tenant must implement the appropriate controls. The American Institute of CPAs® (AICPA)&nbsp;provides attestations of the security and compliance of cloud services. OCI has a Service Organization Controls (SOC) 2 type 2 attestation that affirms that controls relevant to the&nbsp;AICPA Trust Services Security and Availability Principles&nbsp;are implemented effectively within OCI. This includes a consideration of the <a href="https://us.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/research/standards/auditattest/downloadabledocuments/au-c-00402.pdf">Complementary User Entity Controls</a> (CUECs) that the OCI tenant is expected to implement as well as the capabilities provided by OCI to support these.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: Complementary User Entity Controls</p>
<p>OCI offers a full stack of cybersecurity capabilities to help the tenant prevent, protect, monitor, and mitigate cyber threats and control access and encrypt data.&nbsp; These include Oracle Cloud Guard that was first launched in 2020 and enhanced in 2022 to provide Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) for OCI. This detects misconfigurations, insecure activity, and threat activities and provides visibility to triage and resolve cloud security issues.</p>
<p>Oracle Cloud Guard CSPM, together with the other OCI security services, helps the OCI tenant to demonstrate how their CUECs meet their security and compliance objectives.</p>
 Oracle Cloud Guard for CSPM 
<p>Oracle Cloud Guard is an OCI service that helps OCI tenants to maintain a strong security posture on Oracle Cloud.&nbsp; The tenant can use the service to examine their OCI resources for security weakness related to their OCI configuration and monitor their OCI administrators for risky activities. When Cloud Guard detects weaknesses, it can identify appropriate corrective actions and assist in or automate implementing these.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 2: OCI CSPM Storage Bucket Risks Example</p>
<p>Cloud Guard detects security problems within a tenant OCI environment by ingesting activity and configuration data about their resources in each region, processing it based on detector rules, and correlating the problems at the reporting region level. Identified problems can be used to produce dashboards and metrics and may also trigger one or more inbuilt responders to help resolve the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oracle Cloud Guard works together with Oracle Security Zones to provide an always-on security posture. With Security Zones&nbsp;and Cloud Guard the OCI tenant can define policy compliance requirements for groups of resources. Security Zones and Cloud Guard can then enforce these policies to automatically correct and log any violations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cloud Security Posture Management is a valuable tool for organizations to ensure that they use OCI in a secure and compliant manner. OCI provides a very comprehensive range of capabilities for the tenant to secure their use of the services.&nbsp; Oracle Cloud Guard CSPM is one of these and is backed by the expertise and experience of Oracle’s technical teams.&nbsp;</p>
 Cloud Guard for CNAPP 
<p>The distinctive feature of CNAPP is the integration of several capabilities that were previously offered as standalone products. These most often include Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) for identifying vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in cloud infrastructures, Cloud Workload Protection Platforms (CWPP) that deal with runtime protection of workloads deployed in the cloud (such as virtual machines, containers, and Kubernetes, as well as databases and APIs), and Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) for centralized management of rights and permissions across (multi-) cloud environments. Cloud Service Network Security (CSNS) is sometimes included as well, combining such capabilities as web application firewalls, secure web gateways, and DDoS protection. OCI Security Services include many of these capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cloud Guard has provided CSPM capabilities since its launch in 2020.&nbsp; It has now been enhanced to offer further cloud native application security capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cloud Guard Log Insights Detector</p>
<p>Cloud Guard Log Insights Detector, which is not yet generally available, provides a flexible way to capture specific events from logs available in the OCI Logging service. It allows customers to mine all their logs, augmenting out of the box controls to cover all resources and services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It continuously monitors audit, service, and custom logs from Oracle IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS across all subscribed regions, and can be used to detect malicious events that may indicate a threat or a risk that needs to be investigated based on user-defined queries. Data from all services (like VCN flow logs, Object Storage or WAF), the OCI event audit trail and custom application logs can be accessed in every region, and results be centralized for consolidated alerting.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 3: OCI Log Insights Detector</p>
<p>Cloud Guard Instance Security</p>
<p>This provides controls to manage risks and exposures at the compute server, microservices instance / container level. It detects suspicious runtime activities within OCI VMs based on MITRE ATT&amp;CK and creates alerts in real time. It also monitors the integrity of critical system and application files. It comes with a range of predefined detection recipes, based on Oracle’s knowledge and OCI recommended best practices. These can be supplemented with ad hoc and custom scheduled queries.</p>
<p>Cloud Guard Container Security</p>
<p>Cloud-Native Applications are built using a microservices architecture based on containers. Microservices, containers, and Kubernetes have become synonymous with modern DevOps methodologies, continuous delivery, and deployment automation and are seen as a breakthrough in the way to develop and manage cloud-native applications and services.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 4: Examples of container related risks.</p>
<p>However, this approach brings new security challenges and attempts to repurpose existing security tools to protect containerized and microservice-based applications have proven to be inadequate due to their inability to adapt to the scale and ephemeral nature of containers. Static security products that focus on identifying vulnerabilities and malware in container images, while serving a useful purpose, do not address the full range of potential risks.</p>
<p>Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) is an OCI platform for running Kubernetes workloads. Oracle Cloud Guard has been extended to include Kubernetes Security Posture Management (KSPM) for OKE. This helps to protect the DevOps pipeline processes and containers throughout their lifecycle from security vulnerabilities.&nbsp; It includes out-of-the-box configuration policies based on Oracle best practices.&nbsp; The rules also align with industry accepted best practices like CIS benchmarks and regulatory frameworks like US FedRAMP.</p>
 From CSPM to CNAPP 
<p>Since its inception in 2020 Oracle Cloud Guard has enabled OCI tenants to measure their security posture for OCI. These new capabilities extend Cloud Guard beyond CSPM to proactively manage the security of cloud native applications developed and deployed in OCI. This supports Oracle’s vision to make OCI the best platform for enterprises to develop and deploy secure and compliant applications.&nbsp; Organizations using OCI should review these new capabilities and adopt them where appropriate.</p>
