<p><a href="https://www.bio-key.com/">BIO-key</a> has released a pair of surveys that capture the gap between cybersecurity awareness and cybersecurity posture in the modern corporate environment. The surveys were carried out in collaboration with <a href="https://ostermanresearch.com/">Osterman Research</a>, and reflect the opinions of employees and IT decision makers at mid-to-large-sized enterprises.</p>



  



<p>The first survey looked at Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and passwordless security. It revealed that while most IT professionals are aware of security best-practices, the organizations they work for have not yet integrated them into their own workflows. In that regard, the vast majority (85 percent) of organizations are still using passwords for employee access control, even though a mere 26 percent of the respondents view passwords as a secure authentication method.</p>



<p>Thankfully, there is some evidence to suggest that that will change in the near future. Most organizations (63 percent) are planning to spend more money on MFA in the next five years, while 40 percent want to introduce passwordless authentication for employees. However, only 23 percent have any plans to do the same for customers.</p>



<p>Some of those investment dollars will likely be earmarked for biometric solutions. Sixty percent of the respondents view biometrics as one of the more secure forms of MFA, though uptake currently remains low for both employees (27 percent) and customers (13 percent) alike.</p>



<p>In the meantime, BIO-key’s second survey looked at Zero Trust security. It found that Zero Trust is a top priority for most (73 percent) IT professionals, many of whom are searching for better ways to protect confidential documents. Just over half (51 percent) of the respondents cited ransomware attacks and the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/entrust-survey-shows-growing-support-hybrid-work-model-wake-covid-19-090107/">rise of the hybrid workforce</a> as primary motivations for their interest in Zero Trust technology. Fifty-three percent took that a step further and referenced the high-profile attacks against companies like <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/biden-seeks-establish-clear-cybersecurity-standards-with-executive-order-051807/">Colonial Pipeline</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/solarwinds-hackers-guessed-passwords-cisa-701081/">SolarWinds</a>.</p>



<p>Other motivating concerns include credential theft (45 percent) and digital transformation in the wake of COVID-19 (38 percent). BIO-key itself is perhaps <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/portalguard-drives-core-business-of-bio-key-in-q3-update/">best-known for its PortalGuard solution</a>, which provides organizations with comprehensive <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-extends-portalguard-coverage-with-new-sso-concierge-062306/">Single Sign-on</a> and <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/bio-key-upgrades-portalguard-with-new-palm-authentication-feature-051003/">MFA capabilities</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/">MarketsandMarkets</a> continues to forecast strong growth for the global Identity Verification Market. <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/identity-verification-market-178660742.html#utm_source=PRNewswire&amp;utm_medium=Refferal&amp;utm_campaign=PaidPR">The firm’s latest report</a> predicts that the Identity Verification Market will double in the next five years, climbing from $8.6 billion in 2021 to $18.6 billion in 2026.</p>



  



<p>Those numbers represent a CAGR of 16.6 percent, and are consistent with MarketsandMarkets’ prior Identity Verification report. In 2020, the firm predicted that the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/identity-verification-market-expected-reach-15-8-billion-2025-report-102003/">market would hit $15.8 billion by 2025</a>, while growing at a slightly more modest CAGR of 15.6 percent.</p>



<p>MarketsandMarkets credited the <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/remote-identity-verification-market-goode-intelligence-710143/">expanding digital ecosystem</a> for the anticipated growth. Organizations that offer digital services need a secure way to verify the identities of customers who sign up online, which in turn helps guard against identity theft and other forms of fraud. Some of those procedures will be government-mandated or otherwise incentivized through various digital transformation initiatives, while others will be prioritized in an effort to provide customers with a better user experience.</p>



<p>The non-biometric identity verification segment is expected to outstrip the biometric segment in the forecast period. The non-biometric segment covers document verification solutions, which help confirm the authenticity of passports, driver’s licenses, and payment cards. Such solutions are often used to enable automation and customer onboarding, and can be <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idemia-leverages-selfie-onboarding-traveler-screening-biometrics-7/">deployed alongside biometric solutions</a> in many cases.</p>



<p>The cloud segment, meanwhile, will display the highest CAGR. MarketsandMarkets indicated that cloud solutions will be especially popular with small and medium-size enterprises because cloud solutions are both cheap and easy to use, and therefore make secure identity services more accessible to organizations with limited resources. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, the North American identity verification market is expected to generate the lion’s share of the revenue. That can be attributed to the large number of vendors and early adopters in the region, and to the proliferation of <a href="https://mobileidworld.com/idemia-brings-mobile-drivers-licenses-mississippi-111907/">digital driver’s licenses</a> and other digital identity programs. US police departments also use identity verification technology in criminal investigations.</p>



<p>MarketsandMarkets listed Mitek, Thales, Trulioo, IDEMIA, Jumio, AU10TIX, Innovatrics, and iDenfy as some of the leading players in the digital identity space. <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/event-recap-findbiometrics-enterprise-online-summit-092903/">Investment in digital identity has skyrocketed</a> in the past few months, though analyst Maxine Most has warned that many providers will struggle to survive in an <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/maxine-most-warns-about-rough-waters-ahead-surging-idv-marketplace-111903/">increasingly competitive identity verification landscape</a>.</p>

<p>A subsidiary of MTS, Russia’s largest mobile network operator, is acquiring facial recognition specialist VisionLabs in a deal valued at 7 billion roubles, or about $95.4 million USD. The final value of the deal will depend on VisionLabs’ performance over the next three years.</p>



<p>The acquisition is being conducted by Intema, a subsidiary of MTS AI, via a 100 percent equity stake from VisionLabs’ existing shareholders. That includes the roughly <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/visionlabs-sberbank-biometric-platform-411246/">25 percent stake held by Sberbank</a>, which first announced a partnership with VisionBox aimed at building a multimodal authentication platform back in November of 2017.</p>



<p>It will also include a sizeable stake <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/russian-facial-recognition-startup-307122/">taken by Sistema Venture Capital</a> back in 2016, which was evidently impressed at the time by VisionLabs’ Luna facial recognition and computer vision platform.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/russias-mts-acquire-biometrics-firm-visionlabs-95-million-2021-12-13/">Reuters</a> reports, both Sberbank and MTS have been escalating business activities beyond their core businesses (of banking and mobile network services, respectively). Biometric technologies are increasingly being used in financial services and payments applications in Russia, as illustrated in the Moscow metro system’s <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/moscow-metro-moves-forward-with-launch-face-pay-naked-payments-system-101805/">face-based fare payment</a> system; and Sberbank has a controlling interest in <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/speech-technology-center-offers-speech-analytic-services-small-businesses-042705/">Speech Technology Center</a>, which offers its own biometric technologies including facial recognition and voice biometrics.</p>



<p>For its part, MTS indicated in announcing the acquisition that the deal is aimed at enhancing its artificial intelligence portfolio.</p>

<p>Taiwan-based AI and facial recognition <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/cyberlinks-faceme-tech-appear-network-optix-vms-solution-020406/">tech company CyberLink</a> and Japanese startup Bitkey have announced they are once again teaming up in a partnership that will see CyberLink’s FaceMe facial recognition solution integrated into Bitkey’s Workhub connected smart office platform.</p>



  



<p>The integration means that Workhub will now have artificial intelligence and facial recognition capabilities, allowing for a more seamless and contactless workplace experience for its customers.</p>



<p>Founded in 2018, Bitkey has grown in recent months to become a top smart lock provider in the Japanese domestic market, with its Workhub platform now operational at both Bitkey’s headquarters as well as the Tokyo Square Garden building complex.</p>



<p>Workhub is a multimodal platform with support for a number of different authentication methods in addition to face biometrics including IC cards and QR codes. </p>



<p>Along with allowing for contactless access control into offices, Bitkey’s platform also can manage individual workspaces within an office, granting or denying permission to specific meeting and conference rooms to registered workers, while also being able to control the allocation of individual booths and cubicles. </p>



<p>Additionally, Workhub is able to use CyberLink’s FaceMe facial recognition algorithm to monitor the occupancy of shared spaces and conference rooms in real time in order to ensure proper safety measures are being followed — a feature with added utility as the world continues to struggle with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>This is the second collaboration between<a href="https://findbiometrics.com/cyberlink-provides-face-recognition-japanese-access-control-startup-073101/"> Bitkey and CyberLink</a>, following the initial integration of the latter’s facial recognition tech in July of 2020.</p>

				  As you build, as you implement decentralized digital health credential systems, keep these broad points in mind  
			  
				
				
				 <p>By Tim Spring</p>
<p>Indicio is a leading developer of decentralized digital health credentials and leads the <a href="http://cardea.app/">Cardea </a>community group at Linux Public Health Foundation. When it comes to building and using decentralized digital health credentials for managing Covid testing and vaccination, there’s a lot to consider. We want to share what we’ve learned through successful development and trials, and hope these eight rules will be a useful guide if you’re a policy or decision maker thinking about implementation and a helpful reminder if you’re an engineer focused on building a system.</p>
<p>1. The thing just has to work — This may sound like a no-brainer, but from our experience, this can be often overlooked. Want broad adoption? Your application must be fast and functional. If it causes too much friction people either won’t use it or they’ll look for ways around it.</p>
<p>2. When in doubt throw it out — Don’t include a data point unless you have a strong use case for that information. This keeps the data to a minimum, requiring less load time and storage, and provides fewer chances for the information to be misused or data lost.</p>
<p>3. Don’t reinvent the wheel — If you are making a passport, driver’s license, certification, or form, make the credential a digital twin of that form so people will find it easier to recognize it and adopt.</p>
<p>4. Go with open source over proprietary — Open-source products lead to easier fixes, upgrades, and competition to keep the price down. There’s a community of expert developers backing the product — and interoperability is built in. Proprietary often means expensive upgrades or expansions, or obsolescence and replacing an entire system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. There must be a backup plan — Ideally you have multiple backup plans. If the technology isn’t available what happens? You need to maintain some kind of offline option or option for people without access to a phone or unable to use a phone.</p>
<p>6. Test across a wide range of devices — Compatibility and accessibility go hand in hand: What works on Apple might not work on android — or any other phone people might have access to. The same goes for internet browsers. The best thing you can do is break it first—so you can fix it before people rely on it.</p>
<p>7. Partner with businesses for the rollout — To drive adoption, people will need some sort of incentive to use the credential along with places to use it. People will go with the option that requires the least amount of effort; but if they are turned away when trying to use your credential, they will be unlikely to use it again.</p>
<p>8. Start now — No technology is perfect; some bugs will always need to be worked out; but those who build early will see the most benefits. Implementation is a teacher. They will be able to improve their systems, learning from experience, while everyone else is still working on their first attempt.</p>
<p>Interested in learning more about digital health credentials, self-sovereign identity, and trusted data ecosystems? <a href="https://indicio.tech/contact/">Get in touch with our team</a> at Indicio to discuss the use case you are looking for and a tailored assessment and plan for its implementation. </p>

<p>13 December 2021, Grand Cayman and Berlin — SpiderDAO and BOTLabs GmbH, the company that initially developed KILT Protocol, today announced that identities composed of DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and VCs (Verifiable Credentials) using the KILT Protocol will be integrated into SpiderDAO’s range of&nbsp;routers.</p><p>KILT is a decentralized blockchain protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous verifiable credentials. KILT provides a way to represent your identity without revealing things you prefer to keep private. KILT brings the old process of trust in real-world verifiable credentials (passport, driving license) to the digital world, while keeping your data private and in your possession.</p><p>KILT can also be used for machine identity to create identifiers for machines, services and anything that identities can be built on — such as routers. SpiderDAO’s developers will be working closely with BOTLabs GmbH to enable integration of DIDs into the firmware of their military-grade VPN routers. The combination of a world-class VPN router and a fully decentralized way of issuing, holding and verifying credentials, all in one piece of hardware, will create a powerful tool for consumer protection and privacy. This integration will also combat identity theft and loss of control of personal&nbsp;data.</p><p>SpiderDAO has developed a multi-layered governance setup based on hardware and software tools built on Polkadot, providing a “one router one vote” approach. Users could verify themselves via a combination of the MAC address and serial number of the router, and the DID that uses the KILT Protocol. The DID would be implemented as an additional middleware layer, bonded to the hardware, making it difficult to copy or spoof a user’s identity and governance votes.</p><p>Quote from Nathan Vary, CEO SpiderDAO:</p><p>“SpiderDAO is delighted to work with BOTLabs GmbH as they build out their extensive roadmap. We look forward to being able to provide our clients with industry-leading security and offer further protection of their online privacy by utilizing KILT Protocol within our SpiderVPN routers. As more and more users demand decentralized and secure personal data ownership, we anticipate an exciting long-term collaboration.”</p><p>Quote from Ingo Rübe, Founder of KILT Protocol and CEO of BOTLabs&nbsp;GmbH:</p><p>“We were interested in collaborating with SpiderDAO due to their unique approach to governance through machine identity. SpiderDAO has the potential to democratise internet access and we are happy to be part of this journey. KILT Protocol became a fully decentralized blockchain in November, and we look forward to testing new tools that advance governance initiatives in the Polkadot ecosystem.”</p> About BOTLabs&nbsp;GmbH <p>BOTLabs GmbH is a Berlin-based research and development company focusing on blockchain. It was founded in January 2018 by Ingo Rübe and German publishing house Burda GmbH, for whom he served as CTO from 2012 to 2017; Swiss publisher Ringier AG later joined as a shareholder. BOTLabs is the initial developer of KILT Protocol, now a decentralized blockchain network. The SocialKYC identity verification service, Sporran wallet and Stakeboard platform were developed by a subsidiary of BOTLabs called B.T.E. BOTLabs Trusted Entity GmbH. BOTLabs is a founding member of the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA) and a member of the Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) and Blockchain for&nbsp;Europe.</p> About KILT&nbsp;Protocol <p><a href="http://kilt.io/">KILT</a> is a decentralized blockchain identity protocol for issuing self-sovereign, anonymous and verifiable credentials. KILT’s mission is to return control over personal data to its owner, restoring privacy to the individual. Developers can use KILT’s open-source Javascript SDK to quickly build applications for issuing, holding and verifying credentials and create businesses around identity and privacy. KILT Protocol was initially developed by BOTLabs&nbsp;GmbH.</p><p>Reach KILT Protocol&nbsp;on:</p><p><a href="https://t.me/KILTProtocolChat">Telegram</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/Kiltprotocol">Twitter</a> | <a href="https://kilt-protocol.medium.com/">Medium</a> |&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kilt.io/">Website</a></p> About SpiderDAO <p>SpiderVPN provides a decentralized router-based VPN service for its users by using a dual-governance model which brings together hardware and software tools with on-chain elements.

<p>Wylie is a large suburb in Collin County in northeast Texas. Located just shy of 25 miles from downtown Dallas, there’s nothing particularly striking about this relatively small community (by American standards) of around 50,000 people. Named after Col. W.D. Wylie, a railway engineer who, according to historians, was rather keen on having a town named after him. His wish was granted in 1887.</p>

 What is the SmartWallet 2.0 and what does it do?&nbsp; 



<p>The main purpose behind Jolocom’s SmartWallet, first and foremost, is to give the user more control over his or her data in a privacy preserving way. In a nutshell, the SmartWallet therefore merges the SSI world in one single application. Compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the SmartWallet 2.0 is unique because it is built off the blockchain, giving EU citizens the right to opt-out of companies collecting personally identifiable information. In this way, SmartWallet 2.0 is&nbsp; the first of its kind because it represents a successful GDPR-compliant self-sovereign identity solution.&nbsp;</p>



 Planning and Creating&nbsp; 



<p>Planning started back in 2019. The previous Smartwallet 1.x.x. was in need for a remaking; especially the camera and settings screen needed improvement. It was soon to be decided that instead of a new update, what the SmartWallet actually needed was a complete new refactoring. So, instead of amending changes, the Wallet should be build from scratch as something new. July 2021 saw the first release of the new SmartWallet 2.0. The main focus hereby layed on the improvement of user experience, visual aspects and also functionality. Some aspects of the previous Wallet were kept, however, if only a few, for instance the first screen images and parts of the onboarding. Overall, a new SmartWallet was created.&nbsp;</p>



 Why it’s special&nbsp; 



<p>It is often overlooked, the way we share identity data. Jolocom’s SmartWallet 2.0 therefore wants to ensure that the data that we store today remains safe tomorrow. By this forward-looking approach to identity management, Jolocom helps individuals, enterprises, and governments to employ identity solutions for a digitally native world. Moreover, the SmartWallet 2.0 is adaptable to fit future use cases like eID, Covid passports, or gym memberships, for example, by being GDPR-compliant. No one – not even Jolocom – can access the info with out permission from the holder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A major Japanese systems integrator and corporate solutions provider is leveraging technology from IDEMIA and Genetec to offer a new security system to clients.</p>



<p>Founded in 1965, Shoden engages in a number of business activities in service of its corporate clients, including the manufacturing of electrical and communications safety equipment, earthquake-resistant infrastructure solutions, and fiberoptic cabling, as well as the installation of electrical and air conditioning systems and offering consulting services pertaining to various safety and infrastructure concerns.</p>



<p>Now, the company has added to its portfolio a physical access control solution based on IDEMIA’s facial recognition technology and Genetec’s software. </p>



<p>The biometric tech in question comes in the form of VisionPass, a biometric terminal launched by IDEMIA in early 2020. The solution features 2D, 3D, and infrared cameras and a face recognition algorithm that can match 30 individuals per minute, enabling high-throughput. Soon after its launch, VisionPass took <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idemias-visionpass-receives-sia-new-product-award-biometrics-071502/">the top prize</a> in the Biometrics category of the SIA New Product Showcase Awards. Earlier this year, Bosch Building Technologies <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/idemia-provides-biometric-access-control-scanners-bosch-building-technologies-071301/">added support for VisionPass</a> to its Building Integration System.</p>



<p>In the new partnership, VisionPass is being integrated along with the Genetec Security Center access management system into Shoden’s secure infrastructure solution, with Genetec’s system delivering the interface for centralized identity and access management.</p>



<p>“Shoden’s mission is to enhance the business continuity of our prospects by maximising reliability and minimising operational downtime, particularly in the face of crisis,” explained Takuya Kato, the head of Shoden’s Data &amp; Telecom Systems Engineering Division. “Contactless biometrics such as 3D facial recognition have immense potential to become the new access control standard, and IDEMIA’s established track record and expertise in the field made them an excellent partner as we provide robust security solutions that are relevant to the current times.”</p>



<p>Shoden already has plans to deploy the solution for one client, described in a statement as “a large Japanese utilities company.” At the same time, it’s showcasing the biometric security system at its Solution Lab in Tokyo, which could help to drive further market interest going forward.</p>

<p>Turkey’s Garanti BBVA has become the latest bank to embrace the selfie onboarding trend, and has selected <a href="https://www.aware.com/">Aware</a> as its vendor for the biometric technology.</p>



<p>In collaboration with domestic partner DVA Bilgi Teknolojileri A.S., Aware is providing its Knomi solution, which revolves around the use of facial recognition. An end user is asked to submit a selfie image along with pictures of their official identity documents, and the biometric technology matches them together, thereby enabling remote identity verification.</p>



<p>It’s an approach to authentication that has <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/year-in-review-biometric-onboarding-goes-viral-701289/">surged in popularity</a> in recent years, particularly in the wake of a pandemic that has rapidly accelerated digital transformation and, in the financial services sector, prevented customers from doing business at physical branches.</p>



<p>For its part, Knomi is distinguished form a number of other selfie onboarding solutions with its <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/awares-knomi-platform-can-now-recognize-voice-biometrics-905201/">support for voice recognition</a>, which can be used to add an extra layer of security. It also features built-in liveness detection capabilities and is capable of reading more than 6,000 government-issued identity documents.</p>



<p>Garanti BBVA will use the solution to let customers open new bank accounts remotely via its mobile app, with no need for an in-person interaction.</p>



<p>“Knomi is an ideal solution to incorporate into our mobile application, providing our customers with a simple and secure method to open new accounts and verify their identities from the convenience of their own homes,” said Garanti BBVA Retail Digital Solutions Director Burçin Bıkmaz. “We had a tight timeframe and a number of local regulations to overcome with this partnership, and we are happy to have successfully addressed them with help from Aware and DVA.”</p>



<p>The Garanti BBVA partnership builds on Aware’s growing business in the financial services sector, where <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/multiple-latin-american-banks-embrace-awares-knomi-authentication-902173/">a number of banks</a> have embraced the Knomi solution. Part of its success may be attributed to its customizability, with DVA Managing Partner Gokhan Gozutok asserting that “Aware made a huge customization in the workflows to comply with expected Turkish regulation.”</p>



<p>Aware recently showcased the Knomi solution at <a href="https://findbiometrics.com/aware-brings-knomi-connectid-100605/">this year’s Connect:ID conference</a> in Washington, D.C.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Anne Bailey</a></p><p>Avast, a cybersecurity and privacy company, announced on December 9th 2021 their intent to acquire Evernym.</p>
<p>Founded in 1988 in Prague, Czech Republic, <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80508/endpoint-protection-detection-and-response">Avast</a> focuses both on meeting both consumer and enterprise use cases. On the enterprise side it offers endpoint protection such as patch management, internet/email/web gateway, and content filtering. For consumers, Avast provides a range of security protections and privacy measures for individual devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/research/mc80521/providers-of-verified-identity">Evernym</a> was founded in 2013 in Salt Lake City, UT, USA. It provides blockchain-based decentralized identity solutions that enable organizations to issue and request Verifiable Credentials, and individuals to establish identity wallets and personal control over identity information.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/avast-to-acquire-evernym-301440885.html">Avast CEO’s statements</a> have centered primarily on the consumer aspect: “Consumer trust in the online world has been critically compromised...Our vision for a digital freedom is to enable people to manage and retain control over their personal data so that they can interact and transact safely, privately and with confidence. Decentralized digital identities are a key component of that vision.” This seems to indicate a focus on the individual with future products based on the Evernym technology, perhaps to further interrupt digital tracking, online surveillance, and identity fraud. Indeed, a stated goal at this time is to enable a secure, portable, reusable identity that are universally and globally available.</p>
<p>The acquisition is projected to close in mid-December with products based on Evernym technology to be available in 2022.</p>
<p>A Promising Pairing</p>
<p>There is a natural pairing between the goals of a consumer cybersecurity company and a decentralized identity company: they both work to empower the individual to take control of and protect their online presence.</p>
<p>Avast’s product suite ranges from VPNs, antivirus, anti-tracking, monitoring of personal information potentially affected by data breaches, and so on. Evernym enables user-centric identity, where the individual user holds, controls, and shares their identity data in a privacy-preserving way.</p>
<p>Adding a decentralized identity function to Avast’s arsenal of personal privacy tools is a natural step to empower individuals to keep their information from being stockpiled in the many siloes of the many service providers they interact with.</p>
<p>The Pathway to Mass Adoption?</p>
<p>Decentralized identity has been striving for adoption beyond flashy Proof of Concepts for a few years now. Acquisitions like Avast of Evernym could be the way to product maturity and mass adoption. Since the inception of decentralized identity, its biggest selling points have been the capacity to protect the privacy of individuals and put control into their hands (literally, by storing their identity information in the secure element of their mobile devices and with proofs stored in the blockchain instead of in enterprise identity siloes). Combining the privacy aspect with user-centricity, a company like Avast who serves individual consumers could equip their customers with exactly that.</p>
<p>But there is the other perspective to consider. Individuals, equipped with identity wallets and Verifiable Credentials will need service providers who accept this type of credential; in addition to individual buy in, enterprises need to participate as well. Decentralized identity has been thus far unsuccessful in gathering a large, consolidated following of individual users to create the draw that enterprises need to build support for decentralized identities into their systems. A continuing challenge of decentralized identity is that although individuals can create a secure, validated, and reusable identity, there are very limited places to use this identity – the enterprise side has not yet provided the opportunities to issue, use, transact, verify, authenticate, exchange these identities on the sites and with the service providers that users interact with most. That is to say, decentralized identity will need a place to be used before it becomes useful to individuals. It is possible that Avast’s ability to create a cohesive decentralized identity user base may bring enough attention and attractiveness for other service providers to integrate such capabilities.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This acquisition has piqued the curiosity of KuppingerCole Analysts, and we will certainly be watching how Avast’s decentralized identity products evolve in the coming months. Closer integration with their anti-tracking and monitoring of exposure in data breaches may be vehicle enough for end users to find utility in their decentralized identity solutions, without relying on enterprises to adjust their onboarding procedures to accept decentralized identity credentials. In any case, it is a promising time in the evolution of decentralized identity.</p>

<p>In Europe, the rapid trend toward digitalization in daily life and banking has maintained pace with the rest of the world. Remote verification services such as IDnow provide a primary entry point to remote account opening, online banking, robo-advising, InsurTechs, and other products and services. Such digital trends represent a natural and organic disruption of traditional market offerings and services.</p>



<p>FinTech research revealed that nearly 71 percent of users prefer digital financial products over traditional banking. Such trends show no sign of slowing. McKinsey consultancy suggests that the COVID -19 pandemic pushed us seven years ahead in digital transformation.</p>



<p>The European verification ecosystem has developed a distinct flavor that favors customer privacy, security/trust and convenience. It is clear to all parties that new identification methods have the potential to increase risks of fraud as traditional processes are expanded. Knowing this, regulators mandate that electronic verification processes must be “at least or more secure than a traditional face-to-face procedure.”</p>



<p>This mandate has been the bedrock of IDnow’s work and actions.</p>



<p>As a top-tier software solution provider, IDnow offers identification products that surpass the highest levels of security and fraud detection requirements within strictly regulated digital markets in finance and banking, insurance, telecoms, mobility and other sectors. </p>



<p>As such, we feel that we have set a benchmark for security and accuracy standards. </p>



<p>Through this benchmark in our industry, we feel that we have a unique ability to support new legislation. This includes our participation in setting new technical specifications such as our work on ETSI TS 119-461 and continual work on identity verification standards with ETSI, FIDO Alliance, the W3C and other global organizations. Our collaboration and exchanges further support robust regulations and smart growth, which leads us to say:</p>



<blockquote><p>Innovative technologies must not offer a false sense of assurance when it comes to pushing for greater cross-border interoperability.</p>Rayissa Armata, Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow</blockquote>



 Blocking the Identity Fraud Gates with state-of-the-art verification technologies 



<p>We have witnessed <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/idnow-trend-report/">relentless growth in fraudulent activity</a> and increasing sophistication around it. Our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">AI-powered ID verification solution AutoIdent</a> is based on optical technology, using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technology to ensure secure identity verification.</p>



<p>AutoIdent provides access to the person who was identified in a seamless process, and there is no separate “Issuance, delivery and activation” process necessary. </p>



<p>The system verifies that the video stream of the ID document has not been manipulated and captures a photographic record of the user with a “selfie.” The biometric verification confirms the document’s rightful owner, comparing the user to the ID document picture, enabling subsequent face comparison and checking that a natural person is in front of the camera through a “liveness detection.” The option exists to include an identification specialist to verify and review the data and results gathered from the AutoIdent solution.</p>







 Evolution of identity verification and regulation 



<p>Identity verification techniques and regulatory requirements for the application of remote proofing have evolved a great deal over the past 6 to 7 years. </p>



<p>More automated solutions gradually replace or support traditional manual onboarding and verification processes. Generally, video-based solutions, which came first, are now shifting to more automated biometric-based solutions. </p>



<p>Take, for instance, France, Switzerland and Austria. These countries have introduced new legislation this past year, permitting more automated processes using AI and ML to support digital Know Your Customer (KYC) applications for their <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/anti-money-laundering-directive-amld/">Anti Money Laundering (AML) laws</a>.</p>



 Harmonizing regulations in the EU while closing technical and regulatory gaps 



<p>While the rapid evolution of digital applications in both the public and private sectors has taken off, the need for regulatory harmonization within this changing landscape is essential across the EU and the Member States. </p>



<p>The EU issued recent regulations that address digitization, including The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2019/881/oj">EU Cybersecurity Act</a> (EU 2019/881) and the <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/GA/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016L1148">EU NIS directive</a> (EU 2016/1148), amongst other regulations. </p>



<p>The EU released two new draft proposals that further take these rules into account. These include the latest draft proposal for the EU regulation&nbsp;910/2014&nbsp;on electronic identification and trust services (eIDAS) and the draft proposal for a new European AML Regulation presented earlier this year.</p>



<p>While the existing eIDAS regulation provides groundbreaking rules on electronic identification and trust services, technical and regulatory gaps result in fewer notified electronic ID schemes and fragmented cross-border interoperability across Europe. </p>



 The new proposal (EU regulation&nbsp;910/2014 + new European AML Regulation) aims to address these gaps: 



  The regulation offers EU citizens the choice of a digital identity that can be stored in a digital wallet.   A user will be able to select which attributes they want to present for access to a specific product or service with the ability to store new attested attributes like a university degree.   The Commission is preparing the technical and regulatory framework so users are able to access online and offline services with the wallet option.  



<p>Additionally, AML Regulations are foreseen at the EU level in the future. The Commission aims to harmonize better national AML regulations and better address fraud and enforcement criteria. It is expected that there will be a European AML Authority, new EU regulations on customer <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/due-diligence/">due diligence</a> and beneficial ownership, and new rules concerning national supervisors and Financial Intelligence Units. These regulations will go into effect in the next few years.</p>



 Looking ahead towards a European digital ecosystem 



<p>Many of these regulations are part of a longer-term goal, the evolution and implementation of a European digital ecosystem. They are elaborate and set several ambitious objectives in the realm of digital services, markets and application.</p>



<p>At the same time, Digital identity proofing for Know Your Customer (KYC) and AML onboarding, or account processes, is still a relatively new practice. Though so much seems to have happened in this sphere, we must remind ourselves that it was only 2014 when <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/bafin/">Germany’s Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin)</a> permitted VideoIdent for KYC use.</p>



<p>As such, this industry hasn’t yet achieved the collective presence in our minds as it will in the coming years. Identity proofing remains a fragmented concept operating under different definitions of digital identity, variations to national regulations and competing technologies.</p>



&nbsp;



  
<p></p>
  



 Developing AutoIdent to meet changing regulations 



<p>Using a solution that meets and keeps up to date with changing regulations is vital. </p>



<p>IDnow has moved to develop and expand <a href="https://www.idnow.io/platform/">its platform</a>, offering a wide range of products. The experience and expertise we gained from <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">VideoIdent</a> has allowed us to develop new solutions with increased functionality. This includes products that offer fully automated biometric identity verification, the use of NFC technology and electronic signatures, and in development of a digital wallet for KYC screening for AML and non-AML requirements.</p>



<p>Let’s look at the Financial Services Industry. We can confidently claim that our KYC platform offering with AutoIdent in its core can serve even the most highly regulated markets and industries.</p>



<blockquote><p>IDnow’s AutoIdent solution offers a range of use cases within the financial services industry – including customer onboarding, opening an account or signing a loan agreement. </p>Rayissa Armata, Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow</blockquote>



<p>AutoIdent meets EU regulations for these use cases in many ways. The key areas include:</p>



  Fully automated onboarding, with video backup. AutoIdent offers fully automated biometric identification of users, but also offers a hybrid (manual) alternative. This can be handled by internal or third-party staff. Regulations differ between countries regarding whether they allow verification to be fully automated or to have manual involvement. AutoIdent allows both – and its solution meets regulations in many countries, including Germany, Austria, Spain, the UK and the UAE.  Meeting 5AMLD and 6AMLD regulations for Anti-Money Laundering. Improving AML regulations have brought many new requirements. 5ALMD added a new focus on sources of finance, including pre-paid cards and cryptocurrencies. Earlier regulations introduced the concept of beneficial ownership, where the ultimate owners of legal entities are recorded centrally. AutoIdent fully meets the KYC and data collection requirements for this.  AML screening functionality. Many financial services use cases also require AML screening. AutoIdent can be expanded to add fully compliant AML Screening &amp; Monitoring. This includes checking Politically Exposed Person (PEP) and Sanction Lists. The identification of PEPs and carrying out enhanced due diligence and monitoring was a feature of 5AMLD.  Issuing QES (Qualified Electronic Signature) as part of document signing. AutoIdent is certified by a conformity assessment body and is approved by an EU Member State National Regulator for issuing QES according to eIDAS Regulation Article 24 (1)d.&nbsp;This is standard across Europe and regulations are similar in the UK.  Use of NFC technology. AutoIdent has the functionality to read biometric data from NFC chips. This is currently used to read German identity cards, but the solution can be easily expanded as it fully meets the global ICAO 9303 standard.  



 Differing regulations across Europe 



<p>The use of a fully automated verification solution differs considerably across jurisdictions. </p>



<p>To meet this, AutoIdent provides various modules to the product. At IDnow, we are fully aware of different regulations in use across the EU and the UK. While some areas are set at the EU level, there are many country-specific differences. </p>



<p>As just one example, to meet German AML laws to verify the identity of customers, an automated solution must include a <a href="https://www.idnow.io/glossary/qualified-electronic-signature-qes/">Qualified Electronic Signature (QES)</a> and a one-cent-bank transfer for remote onboarding.</p>



<p>European regulators’ adoption of automated or hybrid identity verification has expanded significantly in past years. </p>



<p>There is growing evidence that automatic techniques are more secure than manual ones in some areas (especially facial recognition, for example). The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recently issued digital identity guidelines that support the use of automated identity verification.</p>



<p>Some of the leading countries allowing automated solutions include The Netherlands, Austria, Spain (with an element of video review) and Sweden (with manual review). </p>



<p>Germany has long been the most regulated market and it has now accepted an element of automation combined with a manual review (and the use of qualified electronic signatures). France allows the use of QES for bank account opening and stand-alone use of AutoIdent for verification – IDnow is currently undergoing approval.</p>



<p>IDnow believes that such a trend will be for more countries to permit automated biometric verification and AutoIdent is ready to handle this.</p>



 Meeting UK regulations 



<p>Since the UK is no longer part of the EU, it has different regulations. AutoIdent maintains compliance with each set of regulations. The UK has always taken a more deregulated approach and generally supports automated solutions. It is also one of the only countries that allow the use of biometric processes without the end user’s consent.</p>



<p>After withdrawal from the EU, the EU eIDAS Regulation was adopted into UK law, with a few differences. The UK introduced <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/89/made">The Electronic Identification and Trust Services for Electronic Transactions Regulations in 2019</a>.</p>



<p>One significant difference in the UK is the lack of a national identity card. If any solution is offered in the future, private providers will be more likely to be used. UK regulations guide states that these should follow ICAO 9303 NFC standards, which will allow adoption into the AutoIdent solution.</p>



 Moving to a digital future 



<p>As mentioned earlier, trends are moving to portable identity to be reused in other domains and even into a form of self-sovereign identity. Technology companies will seize these opportunities to develop sector-specific solutions, products, and relationships with customers that allow for greater ownership of a user’s identity and its reuse.</p>



<p>New amendments in regulation, such as eIDAS, presents game-changing possibilities and lay the foundation for a truly portable identity. </p>



<p>It is now incumbent upon businesses to work more actively with the EU, its member states and regulators to bring the advantages of eIDAS into the private sector. Our understanding of this can be summarised as follows:</p>



<blockquote><p>IDnow fully supports the call for building an EU framework that considers identification for its reuse across borders and sectors with appropriate levels of assurance and reliance on open standards.</p>Rayissa Armata, Head of Regulatory Affairs at IDnow</blockquote>



 The future of digital identity is based on trust, reliability and security 



<p>As we move closer to a person-centric digital identity, safety and accessibility will require initial identity verification grounded in trust, reliability and the ability to meet a minimum level of security.</p>



<p>The Commission recognizes the complexities around one aspect of the digital identity, namely digital onboarding. Part of producing the regulatory and technical framework ahead addresses interoperability, security and innovation. Rapidly, digital identity is evolving beyond digital national identity schemes and best practices in customer KYC regulations.</p>



<p>IDnow supports and prepares for future evolutions in digital identities stored in wallets and their verification and authentication. It is equally essential to IDnow that we best serve the market’s current requirements and user expectations. </p>



<p>AutoIdent has been developed alongside these regulation changes and remains ready to support all current and future shifts. IDnow strives to be the best, offering innovative, competitive and secure platforms. </p>



<p>Ultimately, digital identities and automated verification make things safer for verifying institutions and individuals. </p>



<p>Alongside offering security, creating a user experience with less friction and challenges is very important for financial institutions to increase conversion rates and maintain their brand. IDnow is at the forefront of development.</p>



<p>For a more in-depth look at AutoIdent, how it has evolved, and how it offers a well-thought-out balance between security and user experience, take a look at IDnow’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHcpM_dj4x8">recent webinar</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, we can help in discussions addressing interoperability, innovation, and, most importantly – security frameworks. </p>



<p>Employing the most robust practical security measures is a strategy through which we believe the growth of our market segment will be achieved. The achievement will be based on trust.</p>

<p>After building software at a major global ocean carrier for about half a decade, I decided this year to switch to a technology startup company. I had come across a particular set of emerging technologies, and the more I dug into them the clearer it became to me that they would define and revolutionize the future of digital supply chains. Passion took over; I just had to be part of driving these revolutionary technologies forward.</p><p>This article aims to explain to supply chain participants the future which these technologies will enable. In particular, we will explore what they do, what brought them about, how they fit together, and how they can be applied to our industry.</p> The Present <p>Today, supply chain operations are largely based on manually handled documents: PDFs, pictures, Excel sheets and even physical paper. These require human processing — vast amounts of emails are exchanged to enable the flow of&nbsp;goods.</p><p>EDI messaging is also very prevalent for automatic data processing. However, EDI connections have generally been over-customized for decades, which shifts the manual burden from business processing to EDI maintenance. EDI is the technological legacy of the industry: we are forced to respect it, but we all wish it would go&nbsp;away.</p><p>In recent years, we’ve made steps towards HTTP-based API integration, exchanging JSON-encoded data. Forward thinkers have exposed their business services this way, allowing customers to integrate with modern tooling and prevalent programming languages. Industry standard groups such as IATA, DCSA, UN/CEFACT play an important role guiding the industry&nbsp;ahead.</p> The Future <p>The macro trend towards API adoption is clear, but technologies continue to evolve. Particularly, Linked Data, Verifiable Credentials, and Decentralized Identifiers are emerging standards which will revolutionize all industries of&nbsp;trade.</p> Linked Data <p>Let me start with a real example from two of my favorite ocean carriers’ developer portals: what CMA-CGM calls `voyageCode` on their schedules APIs, Maersk calls `voyageNumber` on theirs. Humans can infer that `voyageCode` and `voyageNumber` both mean the same thing, but computers need very explicit instructions and can only connect these terms with human assistance. This puts the interpretation burden on the developer tasked to integrate to these APIs. Interpreting two APIs doubles the risk of making incorrect interpretations.</p><p>Adding more carriers means the complexity and risk increases further. When we multiply that risk by the thousands upon thousands of customers integrating these APIs we come to a sad conclusion: every developer is doing the same costly repetitive work. And since we all have different backgrounds, language, cultures and skills, we invariably interpret API intention and meaning differently.</p><p>This is the challenge which <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/">JSON Linked Data</a> addresses. JSON-LD is a W3C standard which acts as a “layer” on top of JSON and literally adds context to the data. The context defines web Unique Resource Identifiers (URIs) for each of the terms used in the&nbsp;API.</p><p>The common meaning behind the above voyage example is in fact formally defined by UN/CEFACT. The URI for this definition looks like this: <a href="https://service.unece.org/trade/uncefact/vocabulary/uncefact/#scheduledIdentificationId.">https://service.unece.org/trade/uncefact/vocabulary/uncefact/#scheduledIdentificationId.</a> This URI is not exactly sexy, but computers love (unsexy) unique identifiers. Now, using JSON-LD CMA-CGM can define `voyageCode` by pointing at the UN/CEFACT URI. Maersk, in turn, can point their `voyageNumber` to the same UN/CEFACT URI. Now there’s no interpretation left for the developer. Both terms are explicitly defined and can be directly consumed by computer&nbsp;code.</p><p>JSON-LD switches the responsibility of determining meaning from the many consumers to the one single provider — where it&nbsp;belongs!</p><p>Linked Data deals with semantics: the meaning of the exchanged data. Ensuring that we “speak the same language” is the very essence of standards.</p> Verifiable Credentials <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> is a W3C standard for cryptographically signing JSON data. Explained very briefly, encryption means mathematically signing a chunk of data with a private key known only by you. Subsequently, using your public key anyone can verify that the chunk of data indeed comes from&nbsp;you.</p><p>Cryptography is nothing new, but it is traditionally applied on the transport layer (HTTPS, for example); Verifiable Credentials bring cryptography to the data-layer. Instead of keeping track and remembering “I received this piece of data from that party via this channel”, at any point in the future you can verify where data came from and trust that it hasn’t been tampered&nbsp;with.</p><p>There is a reason why traditional paper-based contracts are printed on letterhead paper and are signed: it’s so that the agreement can be proven in the future. The idea of just jotting down contractual data on a white piece of paper and trusting its validity based on the courier who carried it is absurd. Nonetheless, that is exactly what happens with a standard API call over HTTPS. This also explains why paper (physically as well as PDFs) is still so widely used in supply chains. The fundamental requirements remain while technology is catching&nbsp;up.</p><p>A Verifiable Credential is a container for data, which can be whatever the API call requires to support a business use case. The container adds `issuer` and `proof` elements. `issuer` captures the identity of the entity issuing the data, typically in the form of a Decentralized Identity (more on that in the next section). `proof` contains the cryptographic material needed to verify the data, particularly the “signature” string which is generated based on the data and the issuer’s private key. Anyone receiving this “contained” data will know who it came from and can verify that the data is how the issuer intended it to&nbsp;be.</p><p>Again, the paper analogy is useful: `issuer` corresponds to the pre-printed company letterhead on paper contracts while `proof` corresponds to the analogue signature. This analogy falls short, however, since a cryptographic signature is many times more secure than an analogue signature on&nbsp;paper.</p><p>I do want to quickly mention what Verifiable Credentials are not: a Verifiable Credential does not deal with data access management. Sensitive data still needs to be securely handled when sent (in transit) and stored (at rest). Also, a Verifiable Credential does not deal with originality. Verifiable Credentials can be copied and distributed just like any other JSON file, every copy is tamper-proof and can be verified.</p><p>Verifiable Credentials couple trust with&nbsp;data.</p> Decentralized Identifiers <p>The third and final aspect deals with identity. Managing who is who is a massive undertaking all over supply chains. Every organization keeps registries of customers, suppliers, contractors, and employees. Essentially, everyone maintains a model of everyone else. This is an exponentially complex problem, computer science-wise. The total amount of effort that goes into keeping customer master data up-to-date is staggering, and costly mistakes are a standard part of operations.</p><p>Traditional digital identity is based around identity providers which lends out tokens that represent you. The identity provider typically knows nothing more about you than verifying a working email and checking that “you’re not a robot.” This falls way short of knowing and trusting a supply chain counterpart on a foreign continent.</p><p><a href="https://w3c.github.io/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers</a> turn the identity solution inside out. DIDs can be generated freely and can represent anyone or anything. They are trustless, meaning they don’t pretend to represent any sort of objective vetting; rather, trust is built from Verifiable Credentials. A DID is just an identity. DIDs are controlled by the holder of a private key, and additional keys can be associated with it to perform actions like authentication or signing Verifiable Credentials. Keys and DIDs are related, but clearly distinct aspects. So again: DIDs only represent identity.</p><p>There is no limit to what a DID can identify. The obvious examples are organizations and people, as explained above. They can also represent assets such as shipping containers, seals, boxes, vessels, or locations, and intangible concepts like bookings, agreements, transactions, or documents.</p><p>Here is an example of a DID: `did:web:transmute.industries`. DIDs are strings which always start with `did:`. What comes after depends on its type, its so-called DID Method. Just like a URL resolves a web page, DIDs resolve a DID Document. That DID Document carries public information relevant to the DID, notably its associated public keys. This way, anyone in the world can verify that someone claiming to control a DID indeed does hold its private key, or that a Verifiable Credential was indeed issued by the controller of the `issuer`&nbsp;DID.</p><p>There are a number of different DID Methods to choose from serving a range of requirements such as availability, confidentiality, censorability, and affordability, just to name a few. Some examples include `did:key` where the DID and its keys are consciously hard coupled (self contained, fast, simple), `did:web` where the DID Document is kept on a web server (tangible, transparent), and `did:elem` where the DID Document is kept on Ethereum (immutable, censorless).</p><p>So, an organization may control many DIDs. One could represent the organization itself and its geographic subsidiaries (`did:web` would likely be a suitable choice for these). But the same organization could also control DIDs representing, say, owned shipping containers and the seals applied to them (`did:key` would be a good choice here). As the DID controller, the organization can perform all corresponding actions such as proving ownership of assets and issue claims on behalf of legal entities.</p><p>Decentralized Identifiers put the digital identity of every supply chain actor in their own hands. It is the only globally scalable solution to a challenge faced by this truly global industry.</p> Bringing It All&nbsp;Together <p>Let’s bring together Linked Data, Verifiable Credentials, and Decentralized Identifiers to more closely examine the future of supply chain data flows. When combined, these three emerging technologies lead to semantically unambiguous data, well-managed identities, and claims based on trusted sources. Let’s imagine what the future would look&nbsp;like.</p><p>As a domestic buyer, I can remotely establish a trusted relationship with a foreign supplier. The risks inherently present in intercontinental trade are largely mitigated by the credentials which the supplier presents. These credentials prove government-issued company legality, long standing relationships with several known carrier brands, and show ethical and environmental certificates issued by established NGOs. I may not know the exact issuer of the environmental inspector, but I am also presented with an agency credential issued to that inspector from a global NGO which I do know. So, all the needed claims are issued by DIDs which I know and trust, or through a “trust chain”, which links back to trusted entities.</p><p>The products I purchase are given precise DIDs and their quality is inspected on-site by a trusted 3rd party. The manufacturer is also able to present credentials proving a degree of recycling and sustainable materials sourcing.</p><p>Since all documentation is completely digital, the carrier booking and export documentation processing is completely automated. Product DIDs are linked to a carrier consignment DID which cryptographically proves they have taken ordered goods into custody. I have chosen “slow steam, low emission” transport, so the consignment gets issued a reduced carbon-footprint credential which in turn links back to my products.</p><p>Upon arrival, Customs can easily build a holistic model of origin, commodity, provenance, transport routing risks, and factor in backgrounds of every party involved from the presented credentials. Fully automated, Customs can make near real-time risk assessments, duties calculations, and release determinations.</p><p>With the goods landed, I can flaunt the exact certificates of the ethical and low carbon premium choices which I made during production and transportation. Selective disclosure allows me to cryptographically prove this to my customers without revealing any other data elements from, say, the commercial invoice or bill of lading documents.</p><p>Linked Data, Verifiable Credentials, and Decentralized Identifiers are standards, comparable to the likes of HTTP or JSON. All these advanced use cases are cross-vendor interoperable, and each actor can freely choose whichever tool or software provider they&nbsp;fancy.</p><p>All data will eventually become verifiable. After all, why would you ever again settle for ambiguous data from vaguely identified sources?</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk/the-digital-supply-chain-of-the-future-79e9431aaa0d">The Digital Supply Chain of the Future</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/transmute-techtalk">Transmute</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

			<p>9th December, Luxembourg – <a href="https://tokenchampions.com/">Tokenchampions</a> is the first investment fund that tokenizes debts for the acquisition and management of international football players’ image rights. Partnering with tokenization platform provider Tokeny, Tokenchampions makes this asset accessible for retail investors in Europe for as little as €100. Furthermore, a secondary market solution will be offered to improve liquidity.</p>
<p>The selection of the football players is headed by Josep Maria Minguella, who discovered and developed talents like Maradona, Messi, Stoichkov and Guardiola, among others. In this first issuance, Tokenchampions is incorporating young football stars on the rise with enormous growth potential, including Nicolò Zaniolo (Roma), Rúl Moro (Lazio), Bobby Adekanye (Lazio) and David Navarro (Atlético de Madrid Youth A Sub-19).</p>

		 
	 
    If we add the use of blockchain technology to the knowledge amassed over all these years of experience with players, we are in a position to tackle the challenges posed by the future of football business management with a greater likelihood of success.  Josep Maria MinguellaHonorary Sport President at Tokenchampions    
	 
		 
			<p>As an investor, it has traditionally been difficult to invest in the football business, either because the minimum investment amount is very high or because there is simply no access to such investment opportunities. In addition, this type of asset is notoriously illiquid, further complicating the investment in the field.</p>
<p>Tokenchampions aims to change that through tokenization, the process to digitize assets on the blockchain. Assets can be programmed and fractionated with this technology, allowing for smaller investments and automated compliance.</p>

		 
	 
    Tokenchampions democratizes the football business by combining the latest technology with an unrivaled experience in the management of sports talent, and thanks to financial strength allowing all football fans to participate, regardless of whether they are small or large investors.  Carlos SalasCEO of Tokenchampions    
	 
		 
			<p>By using Tokeny’s Billboard, Tokenchampions also provides a secondary market for investors, enabling them to meet other eligible counterparts and make compliant peer-to-peer transactions prior to the maturity date.</p>

		 
	 
    The Tokenchampions team is a pioneer in using tokenization to make football investment more accessible and liquid for a wider range of investors. By providing them with a compliant infrastructure, we bridge the technology gap and enable them to concentrate on their core business. Our end-to-end tokenization platform helps them to achieve rapid onboarding of investors, cost-efficient management, and rapid transfer of securities in a compliant manner.  Luc FalempinCEO of Tokeny    
	 
		 
			<p>Tokenchampions has been structured in Luxembourg, as Bill 7637 gives clear regulatory status to blockchain as the underlying technology for the issuance and circulation of securities. This is yet another demonstration that Luxembourg is the hub for asset tokenization, attracting more serious and promising projects. Both token issuers and investors will benefit greatly from the tokenization ecosystem that is being developed and completed here.</p>

 About Tokeny&nbsp; 
<p>Tokeny allows financial actors operating in private markets to compliantly issue, transfer and manage securities using distributed ledger technology, enabling them to improve asset liquidity.</p>
<p>Due to disconnected and siloed services that are currently used to enforce trust, private markets experience poor asset transferability with little to no liquidity. By applying trust, compliance and control on a hyper-efficient infrastructure, Tokeny enables market participants to unlock significant advancements in the transferability and liquidity of financial instruments. Tokeny is the leader in its field and in 2020 was named one of the top 50 companies in the blockchain space by CB Insights. The company is backed by Euronext.</p>

  <p>by <a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/team/">Paul Fisher</a></p><p>We know that the way forward for business IT is to use multi-hybrid architectures for long term agility of operations. Such architectures will include multiple clouds for new services, on-prem stacks, edge devices, OT integration and much more. But while the need for multi-hybrid is clear, the resulting complexity of ad hoc deployment of multi-hybrid architectures can lead to serious security holes.</p>
<p>Unmanaged complexity will invariably result in an enlarged attack surface that will encourage attackers to take a pick and mix approach to find and exploit vulnerabilities within your operating environment. Attackers will find holes to deposit new malware or ransomware and then mix these with malicious tools that they may already be deploying on your networks – all without your knowledge. Unlike the Pick ‘n’ Mix counter at the sweetshop, such malign confectionery will taste sweet only to the attackers.</p>
 So why don’t we just make everything simpler? 
<p>Good point, and we will get to that but unless your organization was built yesterday, from the ground up, with a cloud native architecture that so far does not extend much beyond your own employees – a kind of cloud first perimetered structure, it is likely your IT stacks will be complex and challenging to audit and manage as part of a multi-hybrid architecture.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 1: An expanding infrastructure will inexorably get more complex as it grows beyond its original state. The spheres represent resources such as multi-clouds, on premise stacks, databases, date centres, tools and applications etc. The swirling dots represent machine and human identities (Source: KuppingerCole).</p>
<p>No, like the Universe, today’s typical IT infrastructure is constantly expanding as demand shifts and change and unplanned and unsanctioned mini galaxies are created in the form of clouds purchased at departmental level and DevOps groups, among others.</p>
<p>Because, of course, IT is complex, it’s a fact – even that seemingly simple cloud native architecture will take trained and qualified people to construct – and the same level of expertise to maintain. Now consider the more typical scenario that we see every day. Older organizations will consist of the old and the new – usually not working together in perfect harmony. There will be (possibly) old mainframes, legacy stacks on premises, private clouds, public clouds, third party networks, remote workers, endpoint devices, edge devices, IOT, unauthorised devices and more.</p>
<p>And of course, within all that will be the reason why the architecture can be become a deadly attack surface. It’s all those identities – your people, your devices - flowing in and around the architecture looking for access to services, applications and more. And this is key. If IT ran without identities acting with agency, then the attack surface would be minimal. Unfortunately, nothing can be created, nothing can be done without human and machine identities doing something and using applications.</p>
<p>Our new multi-hybrid world is geared expressly around the notion that the quicker employees and others get access to resources, the more efficient the business will be and the more competitive – and this is mostly true is the IT architecture is engineered well. But multi layered IT stacks engineered for a business outcome will not solve the security and risk equations the architecture poses on its own. IT architecture can only be simple to a certain degree so we need to look at how organizations can simplify the policies and processes needed for the business outcome and harden the identity and access management protocols. For this, organizations need to take their own pick and mix approach to the stuff happening inside their multi-hybrid infrastructure.</p>
 So, how to simplify what happens within the multi-hybrid infrastructure. 
<p>First off, this is not a quick process and trying to outline every step you should take to reduce your attack surface in a multi-hybrid infrastructure is impossible in a blog, but we can do themes and high-level options. And of course, KuppingerCole analysts are always available for advisory services on digital transformation.</p>
<p>In short, you need to reduce complexity by focusing on processes and outcomes – mostly around managing identities and access to resources. The chart below, by KuppingerCole’s Principal Analyst, Martin Kuppinger, shows at least some options that may be useful to an organization created in that way. But this is just one example, every organization – yours most importantly – will be different. Your universe will be expanding in different ways – you may be running AWS but you may not use VMs. You may process financial information, but you don’t use edge devices or IoT. And so on, bearing in mind that may all change in the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Figure 2: How to start thinking about managing complexity in multi-hybrid environments.</p>
<p>Therefore, before you can simplify operations inside your infrastructure the three key questions to ask are:</p>
 
 What is the desired outcome? How can you deliver, run and secure the services the business needs? 
 What are the components in your IT environment needed to deliver that outcome? Look at what makes up your infrastructure, the data, the applications, and the policies that control usage. 
 Who or what needs access to those components? Choose from data, people, machine identities, third parties, digital things, devices etc. 
 
<p>So that’s a very simple chart we have created to illustrate what, in reality, looks more like the expanding universe infrastructure in the first diagram. But it’s a start and one that will focus minds on reducing complexity within, and from a user identity viewpoint – that is critical. You need to reduce vulnerability from identity management failings and determine how a complex environment can be made simpler and reduce the attack surface at the same time.</p>
<p>A Pick ‘n’ Mix mentality should be something that works for you – you choose what you need, who gets access to what and what the outcome is. This is good, but without rationalising identities and access management within and outside of your multi-hybrid architecture, you will never overcome the inevitable complexity of the physical architecture because you have no view on what is happening across it. And it will reduce the risk of attackers picking unmanaged identities to find their way in across your multi-hybrid infrastructure.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago we wrapped up our first public test of Holochain + the Holo hosting infrastructure, and in my opinion, it went wonderfully. For those of you who weren’t involved, we used a proof-of-concept app called Elemental Chat to collect insights on what was and wasn’t working. Five thousand of you signed up and eagerly attacked it, sending each other about 30,000 messages in English, Turkish, Dutch, French, Greek, and other languages.</p><p>(Note: I realise this isn’t really news anymore, and I apologise for the gap in Dev Pulse publication. My attention was unexpectedly taken away from work for a couple weeks.)</p><p>The most important finding was that Holochain is already working pretty well. In fact, it exceeded our expectations. When we told the Holo dev team about how many people we hoped to invite, one team member was concerned about pushing it past 300 concurrent users. Well, you all helped us blow past that by more than 3× without any visible problems.</p><p>This was exciting, partly because there are a bunch of improvements that didn’t even make it into this test. Sharding was still turned off, none of the recent database work was included, and there are many more optimisations we could explore. Given that sharding is part of our strategy for achieving near-infinite scalability, it looks like performance can only get better — by orders of magnitude.</p><p>We also discovered bugs and slowdowns. As Holo wrote in their <a href="https://press.holo.host/205474-elemental-chat-public-test-success-amp-learnings">most recent update</a>, that was the purpose of this test. So even though this might seem like a bad thing, it was really just another marker of success.</p> Kinda special <p>When you’ve been immersed in the development of a project for a few years, it’s easy to forget what’s different about it. But as I lay awake in bed a few weeks ago, thinking about our plans to open testing up to the whole world, I started remembering why what we have is special.</p><p>Usually, when you want to access a P2P network, you have two options:</p>  Become a full participant, which means downloading the software, connecting to peers, and replicating their data. For non-blockchain networks, this is often <a href="https://github.com/holochain/launcher/releases">as</a> <a href="https://github.com/h-be/acorn/releases">easy</a> <a href="https://beakerbrowser.com/">as</a> <a href="https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork">downloading</a> <a href="https://www.bittorrent.com/downloads/">an</a> <a href="https://aether.app/">app</a> — as long as your computer’s permissions allow it. (Don’t even try this on a public library computer.) But for blockchain networks, this is nearly impossible — the hardware demands are too high, and installing the software can be a challenge.  Access a centralised ‘gateway’, which handles all the P2P stuff for you. If you want to write things to the network, depending on the nature of the gateway, you either need to install a ‘wallet’ browser plugin for your cryptographic keys (most blockchain dApps work this way) or trust the gateway to handle your keys for you (most cryptocurrency exchanges work this way).  <p>I prefer the first option. I get to take charge of my participation in the network, I can work offline if I like, and I get the happy feeling that comes from supporting something that matters to me. While I’ve never tried installing a blockchain node on my machine, I’ve tried other P2P apps, and they’re quite nice. My only frustration is that I can’t easily switch my work to another computer.</p><p>The second option lets me work from any machine I like, but I have to be connected to the internet all the time. And if the gateway goes down, good luck getting anything done. To me, this doesn’t seem very decentralised. And besides, I have a really hard time figuring out how crypto wallets work — even after four years in the business. If this is what my experience is like, what’s it going to be like for my dad?</p><p>Holochain + Holo hosting can blend the offline-friendliness of self-run nodes with the portability of web access, all while maintaining users’ sovereignty and making their experience pleasant and familiar. I know of <a href="https://datdot.org/">very</a> <a href="https://fission.codes/">few</a> other projects doing that.</p> What’s next? <p>During the test, the dev teams identified some areas of work. You already know about some of them — the last few releases have included bugfixes that came directly from this test. Here are some others:</p>  Database optimisations that increase efficiency. One of these, which permitted asynchronous database queries, arrived in Holochain <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md#holochain_sqlite-0015">0.0.115</a>. The other, a large <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1130/files">database refactor</a>, was completed in 0.0.117 (see below).  Gossip algorithm improvements and other bug fixes to issues discovered during testing, to reduce overhead and make gossip sustainable over time. One issue in particular involves gossip of historical DHT data. When two nodes sync with each other, they compare the data they’re holding using something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom filter</a>. It’s a small data structure, kind of like a hash, meant to quickly compare approximate differences between two data sets. Currently Holochain calculates it on every round of sync, which results in a lot of database I/O, causing the sync to time out and restart. We believe this is one cause of the slowdowns, and we’re investigating ways to make historical gossip more efficient. Some of this work has already landed in recent releases.  And of course sharding. This will likely give us the biggest improvements. Overall efficiency will get better, because fewer nodes to gossip with = less gossip = more time and space to work on other things. ‘Convergence time’ will also improve. In distributed systems speak, convergence is the moment when all nodes agree on the data they’re holding. In Holochain terms, this means that newly published data will become available more quickly, new nodes will sync more quickly with their peers when they first become part of the DHT, and old partitions will heal more quickly.  <p>Now that you know where we’re heading, let’s take a look at what happened with Holochain the past four weeks.</p> Four new Holochain releases  Holochain 0.0.116: Dependency cleanup <p>This was a very small release: some unused dependencies were removed, which sped up compilation time. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1116">#1116</a>)</p> Holochain 0.0.117: Database refactor <p>The biggest change in this release is that gossip is shared between all cells on a conductor which share a DNA, which allows Holo-hosted cells to gossip more efficiently.</p>  Breaking: DHT shard and authored databases are shared among all cells that share a DNA. There’s no breaking changes to the HDK, but your conductor will have to start over with a fresh database. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1130">#1130</a>)  Breaking: Wire messages have been changed to support shared gossip, which means that this version’s gossip protocol breaks compatibility with earlier versions. Again, no HDK changes. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1091">#1091</a>)  Breaking: The <code>db_sync_level</code> directive in the conductor config has been renamed to <code>db_sync_strategy</code> and can accept the values <code>Fast</code> and <code>Resilient</code>. This directive handles how SQLite writes are flushed to storage. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1130">#1130</a>)  Bugfix: Some databases can handle corruption by wiping and recreating the database. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1039">#1039</a>)   Holochain 0.0.118: Small gossip change <p>This release brings one breaking change to gossip: nodes now keep metrics on each other based on their agent key, not TLS certificate. This once again breaks the gossip protocol’s compatibility with earlier versions of Holochain. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1114">#1114</a>)</p> Holochain 0.0.119: Performance improvements <p>This release brings a bunch of small changes that increase performance.</p>  Breaking: when syncing the DHT ops they’re holding, two nodes can send the data in batches rather than in one huge message. Again, this breaks gossip protocol compatibility. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1143">#1143</a>)  A few cleanup sweeps have been done over the entire codebase, catching database queries that weren’t made async in 0.0.115 (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1145">#1145</a>) and various outstanding todos (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1150">#1150</a>, <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1152">#1152</a>).  A small database change results in faster <code>get</code> queries. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1143">#1143</a>)  Agent info entries are published, not just gossiped. (<a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/1115">#1115</a>)  <p>Read the <a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.119/CHANGELOG.md#20211208091009">release notes for the last four versions</a>.</p> Wait, where’s HDK 0.0.119? <p>You may have noticed that, while Holochain is now at version 0.0.119, the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/hdk/versions">HDK is still at 0.0.115</a>. What happened to the four newest versions?</p><p>Based on feedback from hApp developers, the release team has decided to only bump HDK release numbers when there are actual changes. This does cause a mismatch between a HDK version and the Holochain version(s) it works with, but it also means you don’t have to update and rebuild your zomes with every Holochain release.</p><p>To find the HDK version that matches the Holochain version you want to use, we’ll be introducing some tools and documents. In the meantime, you can visit this URL (using Holochain 0.0.119 as an example release; you’ll need to change that number to the release you actually want):</p><p><a href="https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.119/crates/hdk/Cargo.toml">https://github.com/holochain/holochain/blob/holochain-0.0.119/crates/hdk/Cargo.toml</a></p><p>In this case, you can see that the HDK version is at 0.0.115:</p> A first-time hApp creation tutorial <p>Today I came across this tutorial by <a href="https://github.com/wimpheling">wimpheling</a>, a new hApp developer, documenting their recent learnings as a tutorial. This guide takes you through setting up the Holochain dev tools, building a hApp backend, and creating a web-based UI for it. I found it easy to read and follow — and I’m grateful they wrote it, since we don’t currently have a good beginner tutorial that takes you all the way to a running app.</p><p>If you haven’t yet built a hApp but you’d like to give it a try, <a href="https://blog.without.hosting/posts/holochain-getting-started/">follow the tutorial</a> and see what you think! (Note: it says it’s written for 0.0.117, but it should work for 0.0.119 just fine. One other thing to keep in mind is that, while the blog says to use <code>https://nightly.holochain.love</code> to download the latest dev tools, you should use the non-nightly URL <code>https://holochain.love</code> instead.)</p> Playground: now with real DHT data! <p>Long-time readers will remember the Holochain Playground, a simulator that helps you understand how all the agents and data in a DHT relate to each other. You could create cells and watch how their source chains and the shared DHT data grew as they made zome calls.</p><p>Now, Playground’s creator Guillem has added a ‘connected’ mode, which hooks up to a real conductor and shows you exactly what’s going on in a real DHT! Because I’m not much of a hApp dev myself, I’ll let others describe what they think:</p><blockquote>This is amazing, Guillem. Really awesome. [...] Everybody will benefit from using this.<br>— Eric Harris-Braun, Holochain co-creator</blockquote><blockquote>To me, as a hApp developer, this is game-changing. Really next-level in terms of being able to learn as I go and more deeply understand all the mechanics that are going on — and understand bugs and ways to optimise.<br>— Harlan Wood, hApp developer</blockquote><p>Even Guillem discovered fun <a href="https://youtu.be/rA_SvneAhQE?t=1100">surprises</a> as they played with a copy of Eric’s Where app.</p><p>If you’d like to understand a bit more about why this could be useful to you, watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/rA_SvneAhQE">Holochain in Action demo</a>. When you’re ready to try it out, download it from the <a href="https://github.com/holochain-playground/holochain-playground">GitHub repo</a> and watch the video again for usage instructions.</p> Holochain In Action: countersigning <p>If, like me, you’ve been enjoying the entertaining, explorative, and educational Holochain In Action videos, there are four or five new ones since last Dev Pulse. They cover interesting topics like test-driven design with Sweettest, creating a minimum viable NFT implementation, and more. I thought this one looked particularly educational: countersigning and multi-party signatures. Since countersigning will be an important part of any sort of transactional app, it seems important to get a good grounding in how it works.</p><p>You can find all the other videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJwIuwkCI5HMSzHJpKys-RQ/videos">here</a>.</p><p>Cover photo by<a href="https://unsplash.com/@mphotographym?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Moritz Mentges</a> on<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/hammer?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"> Unsplash</a></p>

 A Public&nbsp;Q&amp;A <p>In October Caribou Digital convened a discussion around the use of geospatial technology and data for humanitarian crises. We were privileged to be joined by UKHIH Caribou Space fellows<a href="https://geog.umd.edu/facultyprofile/nakalembe/catherine"> Catherine Nakalembe</a> (Associate Research Professor, University of Maryland),<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mapmakerdavid/?originalSubdomain=nz"> David Garcia</a> (PhD candidate at University of Canterbury, Christchurch looking at geospatial technologies) and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stella-chelangat-22a1a8177/?originalSubdomain=ke"> Stella Chelangat</a> (Geospatial and remote sensing expert) as well as over forty people from different backgrounds and organisations.</p><blockquote>A recording of the session <a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/rec/share/wETYmRqtFQkc6XTjz2AMB1wLi56FcTCmZ2_9Shvi7Kv4t5nUXUpuA22s1mRchzT4.mL8YWvGtTU1X9B2U">is available here</a>.</blockquote><p>The discussion focused on the Fellows’ cutting edge research and their work on mapping the geospatial technology for humanitarian crises sector, and covered a wide range of topics from Catherine’s insights into the application of technologies and data, David’s deep understanding of community uses of geospatial data and Stella’s rich experience of using satellite technology and geospatial data for humanitarian response. Amongst others, one underlying theme that ran through much of the discussion was the importance of the bridges and connections between the technical dimensions of satellite technologies and geospatial data and the users and impact of these innovative data&nbsp;sources.</p> The data is out&nbsp;there <p>Stella described the importance of satellite data for humanitarian response, saying ‘It allows us to understand the hazards, the services and the needs prior to humanitarian event after humanitarian event.’ but that it also played an important role in anticipatory humanitarian action — ‘particularly in areas that face conflict in Eastern Africa, including South Sudan and Ethiopia’. Stella went on to describe in Kenya, satellite data is available, but it’s application always depends on the use and their knowledge. Catherine went on to describe how at a macro level resources such as the Google Earth Engine and the Sentinel hub, which provides detailed data and analysis exist — as she put it, ‘the resources are out there. You just have to know how to find them’&nbsp;.</p> From data to application <p>But the existence of data does not necessarily translate into application. Catherine went on to describe her perception of the gap between the advanced technical research work producing data and the application of geospatial data, and a sense that ‘nobody wants to do the in-between work. And that in-between work is really important when engaging with different stakeholders’. This is particularly striking from field experience, where she described ‘the chaos of setting up, you know, buildings and structures, giving people support and aid has no relationship with a geographical interface because sometimes there’s even no power or no internet’. This leads to a sense that there is ‘this in-between void between the satellite application and the practical implications on the&nbsp;ground’.</p><p>David, drawing on his experience of working with communities, elaborated on this, and how important he found it to view mapping in a social and technical way — ‘So for example, I deal with shapefiles and rasters. At the same time, I have to face the community’. David shared three keywords that helped illustrate the challenge of applying geospatial data in practice: It’s about accuracy, it’s about accessibility and about accountability: accuracy in terms of making sure that information is accurate in response to people’s needs, describing how as needs changed the data didn’t — ‘the imagery focused on the buildings, so we couldn’t trace the reefs, an important part of our long long-term resilience’. Accessibility refers to the presence of really easy to use open geospatial tools — ‘One of my favourites is Field Papers. I just go to the website and then select an area of interest. I select how many A4 papers I want to spread the map over. And then the website generates a map layout based on OpenStreetMap. After printing the PDF, I could lay the maps side by side and tape them together. Our mapping team can then go to do fieldwork without the need for a large-format printer, especially in rural areas’. Finally, accountability connects to the importance of maintaining relationships and accountability to people on the ground, especially given the temporary nature of humanitarian funding — ‘And then funding goes, but it’s the same people that’s doing the&nbsp;work’.</p> The use of data: ethics in&nbsp;practice <p>A second theme of the discussion was around the ethical use of data, which is increasingly a concern, particularly to the application of satellite and geospatial data in ways that uphold humanitarian principles.</p><p>All three Fellows emphasised the importance of incorporating ethics into the use and application of geospatial technologies and data. David illustrated this with an account of involvement in one of the OpenStreetMap pilot projects in 2013, and how he had to translate the complex concept of ethics ‘in an ordinary way, in an everyday level’ in engaging with both international diplomats and village leaders because ‘people like me who are both international and local, we have to translate this at the local level’. He went on to describe how, faced with a government that was reluctant to share detailed mapping data, the OpenStreetMap community embarked on a community mapping exercise — but in the process came up against opposition from local community to including certain spiritually and culturally significant sites and locations on the map, and had to negotiate the ‘humanitarian imperative’ of saving lives against the local concerns and values around protecting certain sacred spaces. This negotiation highlighted the challenge of translating high level, at times abstract concepts such as ‘ethics’ and ‘humanitarian principles’ into practice — and the importance of negotiating these issues with people themselves — as David concluded, ‘So I suppose there is the focus on ordinary ethics. That is one key phrase. We had to negotiate to have opportunities for both geospatial refusal and knowledge equity.’</p><p>The discussion covered a broad range of topics, from specific data availability to the challenges of applying and translating technical data into usable formats to the application of geospatial data for anticipatory humanitarian response — this is a select, edited summary of some key themes. The Beyond Borders programme continues, and will produce a report providing an overview mapping of key issues and opportunities in the sector in early 2022, while the Fellows own research complementing this programme will also be completed at the same time — and we look forward to a second public discussion around these findings. Watch the <a href="https://www.caribou.space">Caribou Space website</a> and social media channels for more&nbsp;details.</p><p>Beyond Borders is funded and supported by the UK Humanitarian Innovation Hub (UKHIH), an initiative working to overcome long standing humanitarian challenges through strategic collaborations, networks, and evidence. The UK Humanitarian Innovation Hub is funded by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and hosted by Elrha, a global charity that finds solutions to complex humanitarian problems through research and innovation.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital/satellite-and-geospatial-tech-for-humanitarian-crises-b90b670aba46">Satellite and geospatial tech for humanitarian crises</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/caribou-digital">Caribou Digital</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>The Rise of Privacy Tech (<a href="https://www.riseofprivacytech.com/">TROPT</a>) organization recently surveyed key players in privacy tech to bridge the gaps between tech, capital and expertise in finding technological solutions to privacy problems. The results are published in the newly release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.riseofprivacytech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/TROPT-Defining-the-Privacy-Tech-Landscape-2021-v1.0-1.pdf">whitepaper</a>,&nbsp;Defining the Privacy Tech Landscape 2021: The Rise of Privacy Tech – A Foundational Whitepaper to Help Fuel Privacy Innovation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We were particularly interested in what B2B privacy tech buyers and consumers had to say about the privacy tech space: the privacy problems they’re trying to solve, and what they want from solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This group put forward a list of areas where they need most help from privacy tech: data minimization, retention, vendor management, de-identification, accountability tools, and what’s called “shift left privacy” tools for developers. Does your organization also need support in these areas? (Go straight to our solution,&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>, or read on.)</p>



 Data minimization 



<p></p>



<p>Organizations increasingly need to adopt&nbsp;<a href="https://www.experian.co.uk/business/glossary/data-minimisation/">data minimization</a>, which is both a privacy principle and held up in legislation (such as the GDPR) as a technique that helps organizations comply with the regulation. Data minimization&nbsp;<a href="https://www.experian.co.uk/business/glossary/data-minimisation/">means</a>&nbsp;that organizations should not hold or further use data collected and processed unless it is essential for reasons that they clearly state in advance to support data privacy. The GDPR defines minimal data as data that is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which it is processed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many organizations want automated data minimization tools that function at earlier stages in both the data and development lifecycles to help minimize privacy risks and to force them to only process relevant data. Another aspect of data minimization is cultural. The organization needs to be willing to make and maintain an inventory of the data they collect and process, how they use it and how long they keep it – and then be willing to challenge their status quo on every aspect of the inventory.</p>



 Data retention and disposition 



<p></p>



<p>End-of-life data retention and disposition can be a difficult privacy challenge to solve because holding onto data has become a default mindset for many organizations; it’s not a customer-facing function so tends to be given lower priority; it must be addressed under most data protection regulations; and shadow IT systems make retention and deletion technically difficult to solve. Shadow IT refers to IT systems that the organization doesn’t know about at the enterprise level, such as copies of data that live in other places in the organization that aren’t part of the known inventory.</p>



 Vendor and third party management 



<p></p>



<p>Organizations are seeking solutions in this area since regulators and the public are increasingly interested in how enterprises are sharing customer data with their vendors and other third parties.&nbsp;</p>



 DevPrivOps (or Shift Left privacy tools for developers) 



<p></p>



<p>Pleasingly, there’s a trend towards organizations wanting to solve privacy problems earlier on in the data lifecycle. TROPT calls this the “shift left privacy” trend and it’s extending to even before the start of the data lifecycle (before an organization begins to collect customer data) to the privacy product development stage.&nbsp;<br><br>TROPT found privacy tech buyers and consumers want to see how code and algorithms affect privacy and are hunting for code governance tools for their developers. The new goal here is to stop the privacy problems before they’re created.&nbsp;</p>



 How Sudo Platform solves these privacy concerns 



<p></p>



<p>Sudo Platform, our business toolkit of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-enhancing_technologies">privacy enhancing technologies</a>,&nbsp;is founded on Privacy by Design. We apply its 7 principles to designing, building and operating&nbsp;our products so our brand partners&nbsp;can move easily to a more data minimal culture. (Read&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/how-we-apply-the-7-principles-of-privacy-by-design/">How We Apply the 7 Principles of Privacy by Design</a>.)</p>



<p>We designed&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;with data minimization and data retention and disposition in mind from the outset. Our consumer facing capabilities (platform, SDKs for safe browsing, VPN, password manager, etc.) preempt the potential issues privacy tech buyers and consumers described to TROPT. But not only do we provide these consumer privacy solutions, we’ve got the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/about/">expertise</a>&nbsp;to build them in a way that adheres to privacy principles from inception.</p>



<p>For vendor and third party management, the challenge for organizations is really about knowing where they put their data. We have business processes in place to take heavy scrutiny of our suppliers. And while Sudo Platform is not a general purpose DevPrivOps tool, for the specific privacy and cybersafety&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">features</a>&nbsp;we offer in Sudo Platform, by choosing our products and the benefits of our deep engineering, privacy and security experience, our brand partners are taking a shift left approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Finally, the TROPT whitepaper reveals that privacy tech buyers and consumers look for certain features when buying privacy tech tools: product effectiveness, automation, efficiency, budget, scalability, vendor trust, and ROI.</p>



<p>Sudo Platform is not a ubiquitous or general purpose data management toolkit, but we provide significant benefits. For our brand partners, using the existing capabilities in Sudo Platform delivers a time-to-market and ROI advantage over building the same capabilities themselves. They also gain from the efficiency of integrating with Sudo Platform once to pick up multiple services, rather than going to multiple vendors and going through a vendor evaluation, selection and integration time-after-time. The more Platform products our brand partners license, the greater the efficiency benefit.</p>



<p>We’re saying to the priv tech consumer market, Sudo Platform is a great choice from a budget, efficiency and ROI perspective. Learn more about it&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">here</a>.</p>

 Highlights <p>In a relatively new industry like blockchain, change is a constant state. When Ontology launched at the end of 2017, Bitcoin was putting crypto on the map through continuous price surges, before crashing at the end of 2018. Since this time, in an uncharted landscape that at times seemed dominated by speculation, Ontology strove to be a lighthouse in a sea of confusion, providing clear and reliable blockchain use cases that put users’ interests first. To celebrate Ontology’s 4th anniversary, Ontology and community members jointly designed the anniversary special event “Cyberspace 4 Philosophers”.</p><p>At the same time, the new version of our official website <a href="https://ont.io/">ont.io</a> was launched. The new architecture and multi-language version will bring users a better experience. With a continued focus on decentralized identity and data solutions, Ontology will bring better trust, privacy, and security to the new&nbsp;web3.</p> Latest Developments  Development Progress   We have completed the launch of Ontology’s EVM TestNet and are 97% finished with testing. At the same time, the “<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-evm-testnet-officially-deployed-now-opening-evm-compatible-public-beta-to-developers-6dddc2bdd764">Security Vulnerabilities and Threat Intelligence Bounty Program</a>’’ launched by Ontology and SlowMist is in progress.  We have finalized Ethereum RPC support and have completed internal testing. The TestNet has been synchronized online; we are 98% done with&nbsp;testing.  We have completed Ontology’s Ethereum account system development and the TestNet has been synchronized online; we are 97% done with&nbsp;testing.  The EVM/OEP-4 asset seamless transfer technical solution, which facilitates the efficient conversion between OEP-4 assets and EVM assets, is complete and the TestNet has been synchronized online; we are 100% done with&nbsp;testing.  We are 100% done with the survey on the improvement of the decimals of ONT and ONG and we are 20% done with&nbsp;testing.  The ontology-go-sdk and ontology-java-sdk support ONT and ONG decimals&nbsp;updates.  We are 40% done with the survey on the RISCV’s simplified instruction set architecture.   Product Development   ONTO App v4.1.2 was released, optimizing the NFT management function.  ONTO hosted a campaign with <a href="https://medium.com/onto/trade-vote-with-onto-x-babyswap-2000-in-baby-usdt-up-for-grabs-485631fd8e77">BabySwap</a>, the top 20 participants who stake the most will receive the highest tier of rewards. The event successfully concluded, with more than 300 participants.

Community Growth   814 new members joined our global community this week, and <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1463809689775329284?s=20">Polaris</a> from the English community officially became a Ontology Harbinger. This excellent community member has always been an active supporter and will bring more new energy to our community, and also welcome more new members to <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">join&nbsp;us</a>.  Ontology published the next couple of interviews in its Harbinger Series. <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-harbinger-interview-series-polaris-31234dc4c1dd">Polaris</a> from our English community said that Ontology uses blockchain technology to continuously promote the development of the smart economy on the basis of protecting user privacy, making it fairer and more transparent, so he has become a supporter of Ontology.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1466489847217020932?s=20">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, led by Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community. He focused on how OScore promotes a fairer blockchain; There needs to be a system that allows us to quickly determine the authenticity or credibility of a person in the blockchain world. OScore is an onchain credit score for programmable creditworthiness, OScore can present one’s credit standing in DeFi and is calculated using many different pieces of on-chain transaction data.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1465606533480259588?s=20">Telegram weekly Community Call</a>, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He discussed with community members about Ontology’s 4th anniversary NFT event and recent popular NFTs and games. Community members expressed their great anticipation for this extraordinary commemorative event.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a> where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Global News   Ontology’s Chief of Global Ecosystem Partnerships, Gloria Wu, published the article “<a href="https://forkast.news/why-decentralized-metaverse-is-web3-new-frontier/">Why a decentralized metaverse is Web 3.0’s new frontier</a>” in Forkast. She said decentralized networks built on blockchain can help to ensure no single entity has monolithic control over a given technology. Blockchain will be essential for creating a thriving metaverse and providing the decentralized infrastructure needed.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Verdict — 《<a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/web2-web3-blockchain/">Web3: A fundamentally different kind of internet?</a>》</p><p>“Blockchain has come a long way in recent years and, due to the massive hype surrounding it, it can be easy to forget that the nascent technology has not been around for long. Web3 has gained traction throughout 2021 due to the rise of blockchain-based technologies including cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), DeFi, and decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs).”</p><p>In such an environment, we need to have a unique identity-decentralized identity. Based on this, we can log in to countless applications in Web3, manage our own data, and prove our credibility. In order to achieve this goal&nbsp;, Ontology intensively cultivates decentralized identity and data solutions, carefully polishes existing products, and puts user identity privacy and data security at the core. In September 2021, the number of users who manage their digital identity using Ontology’s Decentralized Identity Application, ONT ID, is over 1.5 Million. To date, ONT ID has been integrated into a number of leading products through partnerships with Mercedes Benz manufacturer Daimler Mobility, Microworkers, ROCKI and many&nbsp;more.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

  <p>Businesses have unique and complex needs. In addition to the user or organization-specific data to show, there might be a need to display different views and content conditionally. The conditions might include the user’s role or which department they belong to.  The information about a user might be part of the authenticated user’s <a>ID token as a profile claim</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://angular.io">Angular</a>, you can show different components or even parts of templates conditionally using built-in directives such as <code>*ngIf</code>. Using <code>*ngIf</code> works when the amount of conditional template changes are small, but what if the view has a lot changes, or if the number of conditions to evaluate increases? Managing the correct view only by using <code>*ngIf</code> becomes difficult. These types of scenarios are where <a href="https://angular.io/guide/dynamic-component-loader">dynamic components</a> are helpful. Angular has the mechanics to load components at runtime so you can dynamically display content.</p>

<p>After following the instructions in this post, you’ll have an Angular app using <a href="https://material.angular.io">Angular Material</a> UI controls that displays unique content based on an authenticated user’s claim value.</p>

<p>The main flow for the application is after initially launching a welcome page; you’ll log in using Okta from a button in the toolbar and redirect to the guarded content. The toolbar now displays your name, and you’ll see a rotation of dynamically created components based on a user claim from your ID token.</p>

<p></p>

<p>In this post, we’ll</p>
 
   Set up an Angular application with routing and lazy-loaded modules 
   Create an OIDC client in Okta 
   Add authentication to the Angular application 
   Capture authenticated user information and user claims 
   Simulate an external server call and implement the dynamic components 
   Complete displaying the dynamic components using the user claim value 
 

<p>We’ll be covering a lot in this post to build out a non-trivial Angular application. As a result, this post assumes some Angular knowledge. We’ll be blazing through some basics to focus on working through the dynamic components and user profile information.</p>

<p>If you are new to Angular, check out the following fantastic resources and guides first:</p>
 
   <a href="https://angular.io/guide/what-is-angular">Angular Quickstart</a> 
   <a>A Quick Guide to Angular and GraphQL</a>

   <a>Format the dynamic components</a> 
   <a>Add claim in Okta dashboard</a> 
   <a>Use claims in the application</a> 
   <a>Learn more</a> 
 

<p>Prerequisites</p>
 
   A valid version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> for Angular v13, such as Node.js 14.15 
   <a href="https://cli.angular.io">Angular CLI</a> 
   <a href="https://cli.okta.com/">Okta CLI</a> 
 

 Scaffold the Angular application 

<p>The <a href="https://cli.angular.io">Angular CLI</a> automates creating Angular apps quickly. It makes the project folder and scaffolds the application shell. We’ll pass in the parameters to</p>
 
   add routing 
   use scss for styles 
   use inline templates 
   use inline styles 
   skip tests (The code repo includes tests to show working tests with testbed setup and authentication service spies, so feel free to include tests if you want to try that yourself.) 
 

<p>We’ll have a lot of small components in this application, so inline templates and styles will allow us to minimize the number of files to touch.</p>

<p>Run the following command to create an Angular v13 app.</p>

   <code>npx @angular/cli@13 new dynamic-components --routing --style=scss --inline-template --inline-style --skip-tests
</code>   

<p>You now have a directory named <code>dynamic-components</code> with a working application skeleton. All CLI commands in the rest of this post should be run inside the project directory.</p>

<p>Next, we’ll add the Angular Material component library to the application using their schematic. We’ll pass in the parameters to</p>
 
   set the theme 
   add typography 
   enable animations 
 

<p>Run the following command with preset values to add the Angular Material v13 library and affirm that you will proceed with the installation.</p>

   <code> ng add @angular/material@13 --theme=custom --typography=true --animations=true
</code>   

<p>Feel free to serve the app using <code>ng run</code> or <code>npm start</code> in a second terminal so you can view the changes as you progress through this post.</p>

 Create components for the initial view 

<p>With our application scaffolded and libraries added, we can now add our code. Start by creating three components: a <code>Home</code> component that contains the application’s default view, a <code>Menu</code> component to handle logging in, and a <code>Profile</code> component to display your name after authentication by running the following code.</p>

   <code>ng generate component home
ng generate component menu
ng generate component profile
</code>   

<p>We can update what we’ll first see when loading the application with these components. Open the project in your favorite IDE and open the <code>src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code> file to add <code>HomeComponent</code> as a default route, as shown below.</p>

   <code>const routes: Routes = [  
 { path: '', component: HomeComponent }  
];
</code>   

<p>Next open <code>src/app/app.module.ts</code>. We need to add some modules for the Material components we’ll use.</p>

<p>In the <code>NgModule</code> <code>imports</code> array, add the following Angular Material component modules:</p>
 
   <code>MatToolbarModule</code> from <code>@angular/material/toolbar</code> 
   <code>MatIconModule</code> from <code>@angular/material/icon</code> 
   <code>MatButtonModule</code> from <code>@angular/material/button</code> 
   <code>MatMenuModule</code> from <code>@angular/material/menu</code> 
 

<p>Now we can update the templates. Open <code>src/app/app.component.ts</code> and replace the entire component with the following code.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-root',  
  template: `  
    &lt;mat-toolbar color="primary" class="toolbar"&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;My favorite work app&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;app-profile&gt;&lt;/app-profile&gt; 
        &lt;app-menu&gt;&lt;/app-menu&gt; 
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/mat-toolbar&gt;
    &lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt; 
  `,  
  styles: [`  
   .toolbar { display: flex; justify-content: space-between; }
 `]  
})  
export class AppComponent { }
</code>   

<p>We added a Material toolbar that displays text, along with the contents of the <code>Profile</code> and <code>Menu</code> components. We’ll update the template of those components in a bit. Below the toolbar, the <code>&lt;router-outlet&gt;&lt;/router-outlet&gt;</code> shows the view for the current route. You should see the output of the <code>Home</code> component when you serve the app.</p>

<p>Open <code>src/app/home/home.component.ts</code>, which is your welcome landing page. Feel free to change the template and styles to whatever suits you.</p>

<p>I added text, an illustration, and styles like below for my tastes.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-home',  
  template: `  
    &lt;div class="welcome"&gt;
      &lt;h2 class="mat-display-1"&gt;Welcome! Log in to get started.&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;img src="assets/welcome.svg" alt="welcome illustration" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt; `,  
  styles: [`  
    .welcome {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      align-items: center;  
 
      h2 { margin: 3rem; }  
      img { width: 40%; } 
    } 
  `]  
})  
export class HomeComponent { }
</code>   

 Create module for dynamic components 

<p>Next, we’ll create a new module, <code>Protected</code>, to hold the view guarded by authentication. We can pass in the parameters for routing, creating the default component, and lazy-loading, by running the following command.</p>

   <code>ng generate module protected --routing --route=protected --module=app
</code>   

<p>This module also contains the dynamic components, interfaces, and directives for dynamic loading, which holds most of the app’s business logic.</p>

<p>There’s a directive for the component view reference named <code>DynamicDirective</code>, and a component to house the dynamic component view and orchestrate the loading called <code>DepartmentComponent</code>.</p>

<p>We’ll put all the code in the same folder by running the following code.</p>

   <code>ng generate component protected/department
ng generate directive protected/department/dynamic
</code>   

<p>Now on to the dynamically created components themselves. There’s a base interface for all dynamically created components that contains component data named <code>DynamicComponent</code>. We’re being a little tricky for the CLI here, so we need to rename the interface after we generate it manually. First, create the interface by running the following command.</p>

   <code>ng generate interface protected/department/dynamic --type=component
</code>   

<p>Open the <code>src/app/protected/department/dynamic.component.ts</code> file and rename the interface from <code>Dynamic</code> to <code>DynamicComponent</code> to help us better keep track of what the interface provides.</p>

<p>We have three dynamically created components to display content: <code>Clawesome</code>, <code>Pawesome</code>, and <code>Smiley</code>.</p>

   <code>ng generate component protected/department/clawesome --flat
ng generate component protected/department/pawesome --flat
ng generate component protected/department/smiley --flat
</code>   

<p>Let’s get the main view for the <code>Protected</code> module set up. The default view in this module shows <code>ProtectedComponent</code>, which displays a task list and the <code>DepartmentComponent</code> dynamic component loader. First, we’ll import the Material component modules, then update the <code>Protected</code> component template and styles, and populate the task list.</p>

<p>Open <code>src/app/protected/protected.module.ts</code> and add the following Material component modules to the imports array:</p>
 
   <code>MatCardModule</code> from <code>@angular/material/card</code> 
   <code>MatListModule</code> from <code>@angular/material/list</code> 
 

<p>Next open <code>src/app/protected/protected.component.ts</code>. First, we’ll set up the tasks. Create a public array for task items in the component and set the values to whatever you want. Here’s my task list.</p>

   <code>public tasks: string[] = [
  'Respond to that one email',
  'Look into the thing',
  'Reply to their inquiry',
  'Set up the automation'
];
</code>   

<p>For the <code>ProtectedComponent</code>’s template, we’ll use Material’s List component. Update the inline template and styles code to look like the following.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-protected',  
  template: `  
    &lt;div class="dashboard"&gt;
      &lt;main&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;My tasks&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;mat-selection-list #todo class="task-list"&gt;
          &lt;mat-list-option *ngFor="let task of tasks"&gt;  
            {{task}}  
          &lt;/mat-list-option&gt;
        &lt;/mat-selection-list&gt;
      &lt;/main&gt;
      &lt;app-department&gt;&lt;/app-department&gt;  
   &lt;/div&gt;
   `,  
  styles: [`  
    .dashboard { 
      margin-top: 2rem; display: flex;  
      main { 
        width: 75%;
        h2 { text-align: center; }
        .task-list { width: 80%; margin: auto; }
        mat-selection-list { max-width: 800px; }
      }
    }
  `]  
})
</code>   

<p>If you want to check out your work by running the application, you’ll need to manually type in the route for the <code>Protected</code> module as part of the URL.</p>

 <code>localhost:4200/protected
</code> 

<p>When we add authentication, we’ll automatically route to it.</p>

 Dynamic component loading 

<p>Next, let’s get into this exciting dynamic component loading part! Here’s how this works. The <code>Department</code> component is the container for the dynamic components, and controls which component to show. The <code>Department</code> component HTML template contains an <code>ng-template</code> element with a helper directive to identify where to add the dynamic component to the view.</p>

<p>Angular v13 included updates to the <code>ViewContainerRef</code> API to make working with dynamic components more straightforward. We could use Angular Component Development Kit (CDK) <a href="https://material.angular.io/cdk/portal/overview">Portals</a> instead since it has extra helper functionality, but let’s take the updated API out for a spin. 😁</p>

<p>Each of the dynamic components needs the same base component interface. In our case, the base component interface is the <code>DynamicComponent</code> interface. Open each dynamic component file, <code>Clawesome</code>, <code>Pawesome</code>, and <code>Smiley</code>, and implement the <code>DynamicComponent</code> interface to the class. The interface is empty now, but we’ll add members later. Feel free to remove the <code>OnInit</code> lifecycle hook too. The <code>Clawesome</code> component class looks like the following example, and the <code>Pawesome</code> and <code>Smiley</code> component classes should look similar.</p>

   <code>export class ClawesomeComponent implements DynamicComponent {
   // ...remaining scaffolded code here
}
</code>   

<p>Open <code>src/app/protected/department/dynamic.directive.ts</code> to inject the <code>ViewContainerRef</code>. Your code will look like the following.</p>

   <code>@Directive({  
  selector: '[appDynamic]'  
})  
export class DynamicDirective {  
  constructor(public viewContainerRef: ViewContainerRef) { }  
}
</code>   

<p>Now on to the container component. Open <code>src/app/protected/department/department.component.ts</code>. First, we’ll update the template and styles. Update the inline template to include the template reference with the <code>Dynamic</code> directive. I added text, so my template and styles look like the following.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-department',  
  template: `  
   &lt;h3 class="mat-headline"&gt;Relax, you got this&lt;/h3&gt;
   &lt;ng-template appDynamic&gt;&lt;/ng-template&gt;
  `,  
  styles: [`  
    h3 { text-align: center; } 
  `]  
})
</code>   

<p>In the component class code, we have a bit to do. We need to load the dynamic components and rotate the components to display. We’ll hard-code the list of components to show for now, but later we’ll add a service and add in the logic for handling the user claim value.</p>

<p>We use the <code>ViewChild</code> decorator on the <code>Dynamic</code> directive to access where to insert the component. When creating the component, we pass in the component <code>Type</code>. Copy the following class code and replace your <code>DepartmentComponent</code> class code.</p>

   <code>export class DepartmentComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {  
  @ViewChild(DynamicDirective, {static: true}) private dynamicHost!: DynamicDirective;  
  private interval: number|undefined;  
  private currentIndex = 1;  
  
  private messages: { type: Type&lt;DynamicComponent&gt; }[] = [  
    { type: ClawesomeComponent },  
    { type: PawesomeComponent },  
    { type: SmileyComponent }  
  ];  
  
  public ngOnInit(): void {  
    this.loadComponent();  
    this.rotateMessages();  
  }  
  
  public ngOnDestroy(): void {  
    clearInterval(this.interval);  
  }  
  
  private loadComponent(): void {  
    if (this.messages.length === 0) return;  
    this.currentIndex = (this.currentIndex + 1) % this.messages.length;  
    const message = this.messages[this.currentIndex];  
  
    const viewContainerRef = this.dynamicHost.viewContainerRef;  
    viewContainerRef.clear();  
  
    const componentRef = viewContainerRef.createComponent&lt;DynamicComponent&gt;(message.type);  
  }  
  
  private rotateMessages(): void {  
    this.interval = window.setInterval(() =&gt; {  
      this.loadComponent();  
    }, 10000);  
  }  
}
</code>   

<p>Let’s talk through the <code>loadComponent</code> method in a little more detail. First, we make sure we’re rotating through the messages sequentially by keeping track of where in the array we are, then clearing out the previous component. To dynamically load the component, we use the directive as an anchor and create the component into its position in the DOM. The <code>createComponent</code> method requires the component type, not the instance. We use the base interface as a generic type for all the components, and use concrete component type in the method parameter.</p>

<p>If you look at your app, you’ll see the components rotating!</p>

 Add authentication 

<p>Now we can start customizing based on the user information.</p>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Single-Page App and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>http://localhost:4200/login/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and set the Logout Redirect URI to <code>http://localhost:4200</code>.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Single-Page App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. It will also add a trusted origin for <code>http://localhost:4200</code>. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-spa/angular/create-okta-application/">Create an Angular App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>Make a note of the <code>Issuer</code> and the <code>Client ID</code>. You will need them in the following steps.</p>

<p>We can use the Okta-provided Angular SDK to connect to the OIDC client quickly. Add the two packages by running the following command.</p>

   <code>npm install @okta/okta-angular@4 @okta/okta-auth-js@5.8 --save
</code>   

<p>Open <code>srcs/app/app.module.ts</code> and create an <code>OktaAuth</code> instance by adding the following before the <code>NgModule</code> and replacing the placeholders with the <code>Issuer</code> and <code>Client ID</code> from earlier.</p>

   <code>import { OKTA_CONFIG, OktaAuthModule } from '@okta/okta-angular';
import { OktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-auth-js';

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth({
  issuer: '/oauth2/default',
  clientId: '{yourClientID}',
  redirectUri: window.location.origin + '/login/callback'
});
</code>   

<p>Next, add <code>OktaAuthModule</code> to the <code>imports</code> array and configure the provider for the <code>OKTA_CONFIG</code> token, as shown below.</p>

   <code>@NgModule({
  ...
  imports: [
    ...,
    OktaAuthModule
  ],
  providers: [
    { provide: OKTA_CONFIG, useValue: { oktaAuth } }
  ],
  ...
})
</code>   

<p>Okta has a component for the login callback, but we need to add the route. Open <code>src/app/app-routing.module.ts</code> and add the following to your routes array.</p>

   <code>{ path: 'login/callback', component: OktaCallbackComponent }
</code>   

<p>We also want to guard the <code>Protected</code> component route to authenticated users. Okta has a guard we can use. Open <code>src/app/protected/protected-routing.module.ts</code> to add a <code>canActivate</code> guard to the default route. Your routes array will look like the code snippet below.</p>

   <code>const routes: Routes = [{ path: '', component: ProtectedComponent, canActivate: [OktaAuthGuard] }];
</code>   

<p>For the actual logging in, open <code>src/app/menu/menu.component.ts</code> to add a menu with login and logout buttons. We’ll use some Okta-provided code to log in, log out, and identify the authenticated state. Update the component code to match the code below.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-menu',  
  template: `  
    &lt;button mat-icon-button aria-label="Button to open menu" [matMenuTriggerFor]="menu"&gt;  
      &lt;mat-icon&gt;menu&lt;/mat-icon&gt; 
    &lt;/button&gt; 
    &lt;mat-menu #menu="matMenu"&gt;  
      &lt;button mat-menu-item *ngIf="!isAuthenticated" (click)="login()"&gt;  
        &lt;mat-icon&gt;login&lt;/mat-icon&gt; &lt;span&gt;Login&lt;/span&gt; 
      &lt;/button&gt; 
      &lt;button mat-menu-item *ngIf="isAuthenticated" (click)="logout()"&gt;  
        &lt;mat-icon&gt;logout&lt;/mat-icon&gt; &lt;span&gt;Logout&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;/button&gt; 
    &lt;/mat-menu&gt;
  `
})
export class MenuComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {  
  public isAuthenticated = false;  
  private _destroySub$ = new Subject&lt;void&gt;();  
  
  constructor(private _oktaAuth: OktaAuth, private _authStateService: OktaAuthStateService, private _router: Router) { }  
  
  public ngOnInit(): void {  
   this._authStateService.authState$.pipe(  
     filter((s: AuthState) =&gt; !!s),  
     map((s: AuthState) =&gt; s.isAuthenticated ?? false),  
     distinctUntilChanged(),  
     takeUntil(this._destroySub$)
   ).subscribe(
     (authenticated: boolean) =&gt; this.isAuthenticated = authenticated
   );  
  }  

  public ngOnDestroy(): void {
    this._destroySub.next();
  }
  
  public async login(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {  
    await this._oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect().then(  
      _ =&gt; this._router.navigate(['/protected'])  
    );  
  }  
  
  public async logout(): Promise&lt;void&gt; {  
    await this._oktaAuth.signOut();  
  }  
}
</code>   

<p>Now that you can log in let’s get your name displayed in the toolbar. Open <code>src/app/profile/profile.component.ts</code>.  Okta’s auth state has user info. Notice it’s also available through a claim. Replace the <code>Profile</code> component code with the following.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-profile',  
  template: `  
    &lt;ng-container *ngIf="name$ | async as name "&gt;
      &lt;span class="mat-body-1"&gt;{{name}}&lt;/span&gt;  
    &lt;/ng-container&gt; 
`})  
export class ProfileComponent {  
  public name$: Observable&lt;string&gt; = this._authStateService.authState$.pipe( 
    filter((s: AuthState) =&gt; !!s &amp;&amp; !!s.isAuthenticated),  
    map((s: AuthState) =&gt; s.idToken?.claims.name ?? '')  
  );  
  
  constructor(private _authStateService: OktaAuthStateService) { }  
}
</code>   

<p>Now you see your name when you log in to the application.</p>

 Format the dynamic components 

<p>All the messages have data to display. The data always includes an URL plus other content that is unique to each component. Let’s define the interface to support the message data. Run the following command to create the interface.</p>

   <code>ng generate interface message
</code>   

<p>There’ll be three different message formats, one for each dynamic component. So we’ll define a message type, standardized data properties, and a class that holds the type and data properties. Open <code>src/app/message.ts</code> and replace the contents with the following code.</p>

   <code>export type MessageType = 'Pawesome' | 'Clawesome' | 'Smiley';  
  
export interface MessageData {  
  url: string;  
  content?: any;  
}  
  
export class MessageItem {  
  constructor(public type: MessageType, public data: MessageData) { }  
}
</code>   

<p>When we created the dynamic components earlier, they all implemented the same base interface, <code>DynamicComponent</code>. Since all the dynamic components have some data, we need to update the <code>DynamicComponent</code> interface to reflect this shared property that all the components will implement.</p>

<p>Open <code>src/app/protected/department/dynamic.component.ts</code> and add a property named <code>data</code> of type <code>MessageData</code> to it. The interface now looks like the following.</p>

   <code>export interface DynamicComponent {  
  data: MessageData;  
}
</code>   

<p>Because we have separate components specifically designed to handle each message type, we keep the logic very straightforward. We’ll apply template updates to each component and implement all the interface members by adding an input property to accept the data.</p>

<p>Start by opening <code>src/app/protected/department/clawesome.component.ts</code>. This component’s data has an URL to an image and string content.  Update the component to the following.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-clawesome',  
  template:  `  
    &lt;mat-card class="card"&gt;
      &lt;img mat-card-image src="{{data.url}}" alt="Photo of a clawesome creature" &gt;  
      &lt;mat-card-content&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;{{data.content}}&lt;/p&gt;  
      &lt;/mat-card-content&gt;
    &lt;/mat-card&gt;
  `,  
  styles: [` .card { max-width: 300px; } `]  
})  
export class ClawesomeComponent implements DynamicComponent {  
 @Input() data!: MessageData;  
}
</code>   

<p>Each component is a Material card control with an image to display. Next open <code>src/app/protected/department/pawesome.component.ts</code>. In addition to the URL, content contains the properties <code>name</code> and <code>about</code>. Update the component to the following.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-pawesome',  
  template: `  
    &lt;mat-card class="card"&gt;
      &lt;mat-card-header&gt;
        &lt;mat-card-title&gt;{{data.content.name}}&lt;/mat-card-title&gt;  
        &lt;mat-card-subtitle&gt;Good doggo&lt;/mat-card-subtitle&gt;
      &lt;/mat-card-header&gt;
      &lt;img mat-card-image src="{{data.url}}" alt="Photo of a pawesome creature" &gt;  
      &lt;mat-card-content&gt;
        &lt;p&gt; {{data.content.about}} &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/mat-card-content&gt;
    &lt;/mat-card&gt;
  `,  
  styles: [` .card { max-width: 300px; } `]  
})  
export class PawesomeComponent implements DynamicComponent {  
 @Input() data!: MessageData;  
}
</code>   

<p>Finally, open <code>src/app/protected/department/smiley.component.ts</code>. The only data in this message type is the URL. Update the component to the following.</p>

   <code>@Component({  
  selector: 'app-smiley',  
  template: `  
    &lt;mat-card class="card"&gt;
      &lt;img mat-card-image src="{{data.url}}" alt="Photo of a smiley creature" &gt;  
      &lt;mat-card-content&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;SMILE!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/mat-card-content&gt;
    &lt;/mat-card&gt; `,  
  styles: [` .card { max-width: 300px; } `]
})  
export class SmileyComponent implements DynamicComponent {  
 @Input() public data!: MessageData;  
}
</code>   

<p>The rotating components look a little goofy now and you’ll see a lot of errors in the console, but we’ll get it fixed up soon.</p>

 Add claim in Okta dashboard 

<p>Next, we need to add the claim. We’ll assign a department to the user and create a claim that pulls in the department value. We can do this in the Okta dashboard. Navigate to Directory &gt; People and click the user you’ll log in with.</p>

<p>Navigate to the Profile tab and press Edit. Scroll down to Department and enter the number <code>1</code>. We’ll label the department names as either <code>1</code> or <code>2</code> for ease of coding.</p>

<p>Since we see different content by user claim, it’s helpful to have more than one user. If you have a second user, update their department name to <code>2</code>, but you can also edit the department value between logging in.</p>

<p>For the claim, navigate to Security &gt; API and select your Authorization Server to edit in the Okta dashboard. If you are using a Developer Account, you’ll have one named “default”. In your “default” Authorization Server, navigate to the Claims tab. Press the Add Claim button to create a new claim. Name your claim “department”, always include it in the “ID Token”, and set its value to <code>user.profile.department</code>. Your inputs should look like the image below.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The ID token now contains the new claim with the value of the user’s department.</p>

<p></p>

 Use claims in the application 

<p>The dynamic components are cool, but they don’t do anything yet. The value of dynamic components is that the component contents change, and we can show whatever data in the component we want. Let’s add the code to see how flexible dynamic components are. We need a service that emulates a server response to return messages. Run the following command to create the service.</p>

   <code>ng generate service message
</code>   

<p>The <code>MessageService</code> returns messages the company wants to display to its users. All messages have a URL, and some have additional content to display. Open <code>src/app/message.service.ts</code> and add the following code to fake out message responses as a private class property.</p>

   <code>private messages: MessageItem[] = [  
  {

</code>   

<p>There’s one more property to add. A real server call should only return the messages relevant to the department of the caller. Users of department “1” shouldn’t see the messages for department “2” by inspecting the network response. We’ll handle this within the service by creating a mapping for message types by the department. Add the <code>departmentMapping</code> property and update the constructor for the service as shown below.</p>

   <code>private departmentMapping: Map&lt;number, MessageType[]&gt; = new Map&lt;number, MessageType[]&gt;();  
  
constructor() {  
  this.departmentMapping.set(1, ['Smiley']);  
  this.departmentMapping.set(2, ['Pawesome', 'Clawesome']);  
}
</code>   

<p>Now let’s add a method to get the messages. Add the following code to filter the hard-coded messages.</p>

   <code>public getMessages(department: number): MessageItem[] {  
  const messageTypes = this.departmentMapping.get(department) ?? [];  
  return this.messages.filter(m =&gt; messageTypes.includes(m.type));  
}
</code>   

<p>Next, we need to call this service method. To do so, we’ll read the claims values of the authenticated user and pass in the department to the <code>getMessages</code> method. We’ll access the claim through the ID token from Okta’s auth state subject. Even though we’re in a guarded route, we’ll still add the safety measures to verify the user authentication, and to return a default value if the claim isn’t on the ID token for some reason. Open <code>src/app/protected/protected.component.ts</code> and update to the following code.</p>

   <code>export class ProtectedComponent implements OnInit {  
  // ... task list property here don't delete 
  
  public messages: MessageItem[] = [];  
  
  constructor(private _authStateService: OktaAuthStateService, private _messageService: MessageService) { }  
  
  public ngOnInit(): void {  
    this._authStateService.authState$.pipe(  
      filter((s: AuthState) =&gt; !!s &amp;&amp; !!s.isAuthenticated),  
      map((s: AuthState) =&gt; +s.idToken?.claims['department'] ?? 0),  
      take(1)  
    ).subscribe(  
      (d: number) =&gt; this.messages = this._messageService.getMessages(d)  
    );  
  }
}
</code>   

<p>We now have a list of messages to display to the user. We’ll pass this to the dynamic component’s container component to action. In the inline template for <code>ProtectedComponent</code>, update the <code>&lt;app-department&gt;</code> element to pass in <code>messages</code> as an input property. You’ll see an error in the IDE since we haven’t created the input property in the Department component yet. The element in the inline template will look like the code below.</p>

   <code>&lt;app-department [messages]="messages"&gt;&lt;/app-department&gt;
</code>   

<p>You can probably see where this is going. Now we’ll update the Department component to support the input property. Open <code>src/app/protected/department/department.component.ts</code>. Replace the hardcoded private <code>messages</code> property into a public input property like the code snippet below.</p>

   <code>@Input() public messages: MessageItem[] = [];
</code>   

<p>You’ll have a new error in the app because our code in the <code>loadComponent</code> method expects a component type. We’ll add a factory method to return the component type to create by matching the <code>MessageType</code> to the component type like the following example.</p>

   <code>private componentTypeFactory(type: MessageType): Type&lt;DynamicComponent&gt; {  
  let comp: Type&lt;DynamicComponent&gt;;  
  if (type === 'Pawesome') {  
    comp = PawesomeComponent;  
  } else if (type === 'Clawesome') {  
    comp = ClawesomeComponent;  
  } else {  
    comp = SmileyComponent;  
  }  
 return comp;  
}
</code>   

<p>Then we can update the <code>loadComponent</code> method to use the factory method. We also have message data to pass into the components, although the dynamic components can’t support the input property. Update the code and add the new line of code to pass data to the components like the code block below.</p>

   <code>const componentRef = viewContainerRef.createComponent&lt;DynamicComponent&gt;(this.componentTypeFactory(message.type));  
componentRef.instance.data = message.data;
</code>   

<p>Now everything should compile, and you should have a working app that displays a rotating set of cute animals images to help you power through working on that task list. Try logging in as a user with a different department (or change the department value for yourself in the Okta dashboard) to see the various dynamic components at work.</p>

 GiD Report#189 — Crypto takes over Art&nbsp;Basel <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-188-squares-web3-identity-ambitions-b37e3c05d820">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>ICYMI: <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/episode-15-olympic-hopeful-lila-lapanja-is-a-globalid-ambassador-5033a4ca65f6">EPISODE 15 — Olympic hopeful Lila Lapanja is a GlobaliD ambassador</a></p><p>This week:</p>  Crypto takes over Art&nbsp;Basel  Tweet of the week — Winklevoss edition  A crypto Bill of&nbsp;Rights  Stuff happens   1. Crypto takes over Art&nbsp;Basel Wynwood District, in Miami, preparing for Art&nbsp;Basel.<p>A few of us just returned from Miami this past week — where blockchain converged with the art crowd. Early in the week saw multiple crypto, DeFi, and NFT conferences competing for patrons but even that flush supply of events was able to meet surging demand. One attendee at Dcentral Miami told us he had waited over three hours in line — one that snaked all the way out the door and around the parking lot of the convention center.</p><p>The week eventually transitioned into Art Basel proper — with popup events all across Miami. As one veteran Basel-ite who had an exhibition at Design Miami explained to me — and I’m dutifully paraphrasing here — Art Basel is the one major art festival (or really, marketplace) where you’ll see world class contemporary art sitting side by side next to world class clickbait.</p><p>(You all remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comedian_(artwork)">the infamous banana</a> that made headlines pre-COVID.)</p><p>That clickbait — perhaps unsurprisingly — emerged in the form of all things crypto this&nbsp;year:</p>  <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/04/1061539871/nft-art-craze-hits-miami-art-basel">NFT art craze hits Miami Art&nbsp;Basel</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-nft-collector-hit-art-basel-miami-beach-for-a-crash-course-we-tagged-along-11638626828">A Day in the Life of an NFT Collector at Art Basel Miami Beach — Told Through&nbsp;Photos</a>  <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2021/12/french-montana-nft-jean-michel-basquiat-art-basel-miami">French Montana Leaks A Rare NFT Featuring Jean-Michel Basquiat</a>  <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/12/04/star-trek-creator-gene-roddenberrys-signature-becomes-first-living-nft/">Signature of ‘Star Trek’ creator Gene Roddenberry becomes first living NFT at Art&nbsp;Basel</a>  <a href="https://pagesix.com/2021/12/05/artist-narine-arakelian-sells-her-eggs-as-an-nft-at-art-basel/">Artist sells her eggs as an NFT at Art&nbsp;Basel</a>  <p>Art and money have always existed hand in hand so modern art’s natural symbiosis with new age money and value frameworks makes plenty of sense. Today, Art Basel’s home in Miami has crypto&nbsp;fever.</p><p>And boy were things feverish. Enthusiasm, alcohol, and money flowed freely throughout the week. Artists and entrepreneurs abound, promoting their projects. VCs diligently scampering from dinners to afterparties in search of the next big&nbsp;thing.</p><p>While crypto insiders, builders, and investors are rallying around the promise of DeFi, NFTs have brought in a whole new demographic to the space — further fueled by Facebook’s recent Metaverse pivot, providing a new form of energy centered around engagement.</p><p>There’s plenty of hype, speculation, and easy money at the moment, which leads to plenty of&nbsp;noise.</p><p>One thing was clear. It’s buzzy to talk about things like web3 and the metaverse, but these are very early days and much of the hard work is yet to be&nbsp;done.</p><p>It reminded me a bit of Bitcoin 2013 in San Jose, a formative moment in crypto’s history. There was plenty of energy and money (relatively speaking) then, too. People were already talking about concepts like smart contracts and how they might fuel a new chapter for decentralized finance — and this was before Vitalik Buterin had even published his Ethereum white paper. (That would come out later that&nbsp;year.)</p><p>But that was all it was back then. A lot of talk and some really compelling concepts. We’ve only started seeing the fruits of those labors in the last couple of&nbsp;years.</p><p>We’re going through that same process today with web3 and the metaverse.</p><p>Just as the rise of Bitcoin did back then, the prevalence of NFTs and DeFi has given us a taste of what’s possible for this next&nbsp;chapter.</p><p>Now, it’s time to&nbsp;build.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/12/at-art-basel-nft-fans-say-no-thanks-to-facebooks-metaverse.html">The Future of the Internet May Be Happening in Miami.

A crypto Bill of&nbsp;Rights <p><a href="https://yourcryptorights.com/">Courtesy of Binance</a>, the world’s largest crypto exchange:</p>  Every human being should have access to financial tools, like crypto, that allow for greater economic independence.  Industry participants have a responsibility to work with regulators and policymakers to shape new standards for crypto assets. Smart regulation encourages innovation and helps keep users&nbsp;safe.  Responsible crypto platforms have an obligation to protect users from bad actors and implement Know Your Customer (KYC) processes to prevent financial crimes.  Privacy is a human right, and personally identifiable information (PII) data should be subject to strict levels of protection.  Crypto users have the right to access exchanges that keep their funds secure, in safe custody with comprehensive deposit insurance.  Healthy markets should maintain a robust level of liquidity to ensure a stable and frictionless trading environment.  Regulation and innovation are not mutually exclusive. Crypto users deserve safe access to emerging technologies and practices, including NFTs, stablecoins, staking, yield-farming, and&nbsp;more.  Closing the knowledge gap is essential when it comes to crypto. Users have the right to accurate information on crypto assets, without fear of falling victim to unfair or deceptive advertising.  Marketplaces that offer derivative instruments should be subject to the appropriate regulations. This ensures all users meet eligibility requirements and that their transactions are fairly&nbsp;settled.  Crypto regulation is inevitable.* Users have the right to share their voice on how the industry should evolve with their blockchain platform of&nbsp;choice.   4.

<p>Open banking technology is responding to the demands of an expanding market, creating new payment choices for consumers within the ACH network. Electronic payments are growing at an exponential rate, quarter by quarter. In<a href="https://www.nacha.org/news/ach-network-sees-record-growth-2020-268-billion-payments"> 2020 alone</a>, 26.8 billion payments were initiated, moving $61.9 trillion, up 10.8% from 2019. Internet-initiated consumer payments for bills, account transfers and other payments increased 15% to more than 7.7 billion. It’s clear that open banking payment apps and services are a major factor contributing to the increased ACH volume, and they are gaining mass adoption due to the added value of digital enablement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The transition to convenient digital payments and banking services is picking up speed. Friction-hampered, outdated account validation processes are increasingly unacceptable to consumers. Remember when borrowers faxed in voided checks to set up ACH payments? While ridiculous today, clunky account validation processes persist. Loan servicers need accurate data to confirm account ownership. Finicity’s open banking platform simplifies this and expands possibilities for both lenders and borrowers through the FinicityPay solution set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Using ACH transactions, Financial Institutions can set up a new account, fund a loan, retrieve closing costs and origination fees, or set up recurring payments across mortgage, auto, small business and personal loans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;FinicityPay serves up rich data sets in seconds, verifying account details, account owners and balances to enable accurate, confident payments. Our real-time retrieval of account financial data helps mitigate fraud risk, reduce payment failures and fees, enable onboarding and aid in maintaining compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’re excited to announce the launch of the Dock Wallet on mobile, the app is now available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dock-crypto-wallet/id1565227368">App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dockapp">Play Store</a>. This is a significant milestone for Dock, as not only can community members now store, send, receive, and manage Dock tokens from their mobile device, it will serve as an important gateway to a number of planned Dock innovations. </p><p>The Dock team has been developing the app since March 2021 with a vision to provide a safe, secure and convenient mobile wallet for storing and transacting with Dock tokens. Importantly, Dock’s Wallet App gives the token holder full control over their DOCK tokens as the wallet enables them to control and manage their own private keys, allowing them to send and receive tokens without the involvement of any third party.</p><p>Dock Wallet App vs. Crypto Exchanges</p><p>Existing centralised crypto exchanges are in control of the tokens held on their platforms; to send, receive, lock, or withdraw cryptocurrency, the network must first approve of this transaction. With these so-called custodial wallets, there are many security considerations including; (1) them being hacked or (2) blocking your access to your account for a certain reason if they feel it’s necessary.</p><p>With Dock’s Wallet App, and as previously mentioned, the token holder is in control of the private key, can send, receive, withdraw, and manage their tokens without the permission or input of any third party. The user creates their own recovery phrase and can create several accounts on the App. </p><p>Work before the launch</p><p>Developing the App began on the 29th March, and engineering came into play around the 10th June. Full steam ahead, Dock relied on the community to help with beta testing which took place on and after the 22nd September. After getting some great feedback and suggestions from the community, our expert engineers worked out the bugs and took the suggestions into consideration. In mid October, the Dock team submitted the App to the App Store and Play Store - the Play Store had approved of the App within a few days, followed by the App Store a week later. By the 22nd October, the App has been approved to go live on both Apple and Android devices. </p><p>Shortly after, the app was audited by Oak Security. We’ve published the <a href="https://github.com/docknetwork/dock-app/blob/master/audit-reports/OakSecurity-AuditReport-Wallet-v0.1.pdf">full report here</a>. We are happy to announce that all discovered issues have been resolved. The audit was completed on the 6th December. </p><p>This is just the start</p><p>As mentioned above, the wallet not only represents a much improved user experience for the Dock community today, but it will also be a building block for new features. Future iterations will include the ability for individuals to receive, store and send verifiable identity and credentials, as well as staking and governance features. Watch this space...</p><p>Download</p><p>Download the Dock Wallet App from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dock-crypto-wallet/id1565227368">AppStore</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dockapp">PlayStore</a> here.</p>

<p>As more and more people are turning to working from home, with a vast majority of those people living in huge epicenters around Europe, we are seeing a few growing trends within the mobility industry. The major trend is the versatility in which people are getting from A to B and the conveniency it offers.</p>



<p>A study from McKinsey expects the annual growth rate for shared-mobility solutions to exceed 20 percent through 2030. With this prediction, the way in which mobility is seen, used and offered will change and the requirements will need to be met.</p>



<p>Aspects such as flexibility, price, conveniency and sustainability must be incorporated in order to stay relevant and competitive. But what exactly are consumers using and why are we seeing these trends? Let’s have a look:</p>



 Top Trends: 



  Micro-mobility: The first trend we are seeing is an increase in popularity of what has come to be called micro-mobility. This includes all small vehicles used by an individual such as a bike, e-bike, e-scooter, moped, etc. It is a very practical solution for those that don’t have a far commute or reside in large cities where smaller modes of transportation are easier and more convenient.  Car-sharing/car-hailing: A somewhat new phenomena for getting around is a concept known as car-sharing/car-hailing. Easily book a car for a short period of time or order a ride to take you where you need to go. This type of traveling is better when the distances are greater between destinations and is just as accessible as micro-mobility.  



 Reasons for the rise in shared-mobility in a digitized on-demand world 



<p>Both of these somewhat new mobility trends change the way of how we view transportation due to the fact that there isn’t a need to personally own a vehicle. But why are we seeing these trends coming into the mobility market?</p>



  Home Office. With the majority of people working from home these days, there is no longer the necessity to own a personal vehicle. Why waste time and money on something that you don’t need every day? Car-sharing or car-hailing becomes more practical and is as simple as a click on your smartphone.  Global Pandemic. The Corona virus has changed many aspects of our lives and one of those would be the urgent need to get from A to B. Instead, there’s less of a demand for constant or immediate transportation. Plus, micro-mobility is more appealing due to the fact that there is minimal contact with other people when traveling.  Sustainable. When comparing micro-mobility and car-sharing/hailing to other forms of transportation, these two new trends are far more eco-friendly. Many of the smaller vehicles are sustainable and there are even options for electric vehicles. The future of mobility is greener with the help of these rising trends.  Cheaper. When considering the costs of owning a personal vehicle, around half of the people underestimate the total amount. Car ownership is not to be taken lightly, as unexpected costs can arise. Both car-sharing/hailing and micro-mobility offer a less expensive option based on traveling needs.  Convenient. The conveniency is extremely desirable with these up-and-becoming trends since living in larger cities can pose obstacles for personal autos. Instead, e-scooters, e-bikes, car-sharing and other options are readily available without wasting any time.  Flexible. When owning your own vehicle, there aren’t many options for switching to a different model and trying something new. However, with micro-mobility and car-sharing, the choice is yours whenever you want. The options are there to fit your lifestyle and not the other way around.  







 Convenience through Security 



<p>As mobility becomes more flexible and diverse, security plays a major role in leading the future of mobility. Companies and consumers want to know they can trust one another because safety is everyone’s concern. End users of these services are not only looking for convenience, but also secure mobility options. They need to trust that they are getting exactly what they are looking for in a transportation service.</p>



<p>In return, mobility providers want to deliver on that because they know that the more convenient and secure their service is the higher the conversion rate. Therefore, security is a two-way street for both the consumers and the companies because when convenience is met by providing a secure and reliable service, conversions rates rise.</p>



<p>Furthermore, when automated ID verification is integrated into the onboarding process it increases the confidence of users in using a certain mobility provider. Onboarding feels safe, robust, straightforward and convenient for consumers while also being flexible to the services through easy integration into a mobility app with different languages in the interface.</p>



<p>IDnow is there to assist in this endeavor with products such as AutoIdent or AutoIdent with e-sign add-on. With an onboarding process of only a couple of minutes, consumers have the conveniency they are searching for, while companies meet KYC needs. Trust is our top priority and we wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>



 Why conveniency and security should be at the top of your priority list 



<p>Not only have we mentioned that the right balance of conveniency and security will increase your conversion rates, but it will give you a step-up from your competitors. Because users are looking for these two main aspects in a mobility service, if you don’t provide it, or aren’t fast enough, they will easily find the next scooter or car that does provide what they are looking for. Looking ahead gives you the benefit of knowing what consumers want and need, and they will thank you for it by choosing you every time.</p>

<p>For further information on the subject with more insights into the new driver experience, our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/mobility-report/">Mobility eBook</a> is a great resource for delving further into the trends we are seeing within the industry. The tools you need to grow your service are also described in more detail. We are there for you by providing you with all your digital identification needs.</p>



<p>So, as transportation starts to head in a different direction compared to what we’ve seen in the past, one thing remains the same: people want a solution that fits their lifestyle. And these two trends we are seeing fit to the lifestyles today’s generations are living. Thus, adapting to these new requirements is essential for the mobility industry and ID verification is there to support in those needs. Security and trust are the platforms for the mobility of the future and IDnow is there for you every step of the way.</p>

<p>The UK Government plans to ‘reform’ data protection law to replace citizen data rights with corporate data&nbsp;rights.</p><p>The paper containing its proposals, Data: A New Direction, has 51,503 words. But you only need 58 of them to get to its essence (if you can find&nbsp;them).</p><p>The Government, says the paper, intends to “create a limited, exhaustive list of legitimate interests for which organisations can&nbsp;… process personal data without unnecessary recourse to consent.” [Paragraph 57]. One of these ‘legitimate interests’ (where no consent is required) would be “Managing or maintaining a database to ensure that records of individuals are accurate and up to date, and to avoid unnecessary duplication.” [Paragraph 58&nbsp;(i)]</p><p>The “bold new data regime” created by this carefully crafted wrecking amendment (supported by many others) would replace today’s core principle for data protection legislation — that organisations should only process individuals’ data for ‘specified, explicit purposes’ — with a new general corporate right to data surveillance: the right to maintain databases about individuals without their&nbsp;consent.</p><p>The Government’s stated reason for these reforms is its wish to “usher in a new golden age of growth and innovation” [Ministerial Foreword] by creating “​​a better balance” between data protection and data use. [Paragraph 59] In other words, it’s based on the idea that there is an unavoidable trade-off between data protection rights and innovation and&nbsp;growth.</p><p>This narrative is flawed from start to finish. Everything the Government says it wants to achieve could be achieved without major changes to existing legislation and by enhancing rather than abolishing citizens’ control over their data. The Government wants a ‘new direction’ for personal data, but it has chosen the wrong direction.</p><p>This blog, the second in a series prompted by the UK Government’s proposals, shows why — and in doing so also shows why a practical, positive, citizen-empowering alternative to what the Government is suggesting already exists and is ready and waiting to be implemented.</p> The ‘trade-off’ myth <p>The thinking behind the Government’s proposals goes something like&nbsp;this:</p><p>“1. Personal data can play a huge role in enabling innovation that drives economic growth that benefits both citizens and businesses.</p><p>2. But organisations’ ability to access and use this data is being constrained by data protection regulations such as&nbsp;GDPR.</p><p>3. Therefore, to unleash personal data’s innovation and growth potential, citizens’ rights need to be curtailed.”</p><p>Some other sub-narratives go along with this story. They include the ideas&nbsp;that:</p>  The innovations we’re talking about will take the form of ‘products’ that will be sold for money in ‘markets’ (where ‘amount of extra money made’ is the best or only way to measure the resulting ‘growth’)  By definition, this innovation and growth will be generated by the private&nbsp;sector.  <p>Let’s start with the sub-narratives first.</p> Myth #1: ‘Innovation takes the form of products that generate growth by being sold in&nbsp;markets’ <p>This may be true on some occasions. But not always. In our last blog we showed that data’s <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-data-valuable-59bd63e1a09f">biggest source of value lies in its reliability</a> — that if you can be confident that the data you are using is correct, you can use it without the costs and risks of making mistakes or having to invest time and effort ensuring that these mistakes are not&nbsp;made.</p><p>This being case, the most important form of innovation made possible by data lies&nbsp;in:</p>  better processes for making reliable data available — not separate ‘products’&nbsp;…  primarily relating to the more efficient, effective administration by which stuff gets done — not selling a product, or data, in ‘markets’&nbsp;…  resulting in cost reductions — not the ‘new revenue streams’ by which ‘growth’ is usually measured. (In fact, by enabling system-wide reductions in friction, effort, risk and cost, better uses of reliable data could result in a reduction of GDP because it involves less money being spent: GDP measures money spent not real value created.)  enabled by new data logistics infrastructure that helps people and organisations to get exactly the right (reliable, up-to-date, accurate, complete) data to and from the right parties in the right formats at the right times — not a separate, additional activity called ‘new product development’.  <p>Developing such infrastructure is a hugely important arena of innovation because it supports all the monitoring, decision-making, planning, organising, coordinating, implementation and administration that is needed wherever services are delivered to individuals across all industries and sectors — and it does not need to compromise citizens’ data protection rights in any&nbsp;way.</p><p>To the contrary, its best achieved by enhancing them, by providing individuals with their own personal data stores which enable them to collect and share their own data under their control. This approach is already being pursued in the public sector by the Scottish Government with its <a href="https://digitalscot.net/courses/digital-government/lessons/digital-identity/topic/digital-identity-scotland-scottish-attribute-provider-service/">Scottish Attribute Provider Service</a> (and by Mydex CIC). But it is ignored by the UK Government in its proposed ‘reforms’.</p> Myth #2: ‘The private sector is the source and driver innovation’ <p>Again, this may be true. But not&nbsp;always.</p><p>Developing the infrastructure needed for improved availability of reliable data is an innovation that can (and needs to) take place everywhere: in the private sector and the public sector and the third sector (charities, social enterprises and so on). Yet, by focusing its attention on the private sector the Government’s proposals miss this opportunity.</p> Myth #3: ‘To innovate better, organisations need access to more&nbsp;data” <p>As ever, this may be true. But not&nbsp;always.</p><p>The story told by ‘Big Data’ enthusiasts is that organisations always need more data, because more data means they can generate better ‘insights’. But if the biggest economic benefits come from better administrative processes using reliable data, the key source of added value is not ‘insights’ made available by ‘more data’, but efficiencies made possible by the ability to access exactly the right data at the right&nbsp;time.</p><p>It’s worth exploring this a little more because of all the myths behind the Government’s disastrous proposals, this is probably the biggest&nbsp;one.</p><p>The vast majority of organisations that collect and use personal data to provide services do not need ‘more’ data. They need the right data for their specific&nbsp;service.</p><p>An online retailer doesn’t need to know your blood type. A doctor doesn’t need to know your bank balance. Whatever the service we are talking about, whether it is diagnosing an illness, assessing eligibility to a loan or a benefit, purchasing a product or ticket online, switching an energy supplier etc, delivery of the service in question depends on the availability of the exact data needed to complete that particular operation.</p><p>In such scenarios, which account for the vast majority of real life uses of data, ‘more data’ doesn’t drive value. To the contrary, it drives waste. A product manufacturer who has to handle a wide range of components that are not needed to make its product simply incurs extra unnecessary costs. Likewise, a service provider processing extra&nbsp;data.</p><p>Yes, service quality, timeliness and efficiency is compromised if any key data points are missing. To that degree, service providers may need to get hold of data that they don’t currently hold. But the key issue here is not accessing ‘more data’ in general. It is about being able to access the right data, which takes us back to data logistics infrastructure.</p><p>In fact, ‘more data’ is only needed in a very small proportion of activities. They boil down to two categories. Activities such as research and the use of training data in AI do indeed need ‘more data’ to get better results, but they don’t need personal data. That’s because they are using data for statistical analysis where anonymised data does the job just as&nbsp;well.</p><p>The only industry that always wants more personal data is ad-tech. The inner logic of data-driven advertising targeting flies directly in the face of data protection. To achieve perfect targeting (e.g. to eliminate waste and error in targeted messaging) you need a perfect profile, and to achieve a perfect profile you need to know all there is to know about the individual concerned. People may argue about the social and economic pros and cons of advertising itself. But the ad-tech industry is a different kettle of fish. It is an intrinsically totalitarian project.</p><p>Advertising accounts for around 1.5% of all economic activity. Basing a wholesale re-write of 25 years’ worth of regulatory fine-tuning on the needs of a tiny, toxic offshoot is not a sound way forward. But that is what the Government appears to be&nbsp;doing.</p> Myth #4: “Growth comes from helping organisations to improve their operations” <p>At first sight, this seems obvious. Who else is going to ‘innovate’?</p><p>But what this statement actually articulates is an innovation-constraining organisation-centric assumption. The organisation-centric mindset assumes that the only entities that can (and therefore should) collect and use personal data are organisations — not people themselves, because it is only organisations that do stuff with data. According to this view, individuals are (and always should be) treated as data subjects (as they are called under the GDPR data protection regulations).</p><p>Data subjects are not empowered to collect and use their own data for their own purposes. Rather, organisations collect data about these data subjects and use this data for their own organisations’ purposes (which may be benign or malign: see Myth #5&nbsp;below).</p><p>But what would happen if individuals were able to collect and use their own data to manage their lives better (just as organisations collect and use data to manage their operations better)? What would happen if individuals could become the point where information about themselves is aggregated and integrated, directly under their control, rather than having their data dispersed across hundreds of separate and different organisational data&nbsp;silos?</p><p>Answer: an explosion of innovation focused on improving citizens’ lives by helping them use their own data to make better decisions and get stuff done in their lives. This is a whole new dimension of innovation — a vast new continent of opportunity — that is still waiting to be explored. And, far from creating a trade-off between data protection rights and innovation and growth, it relies on the opposite: on empowering citizens with their&nbsp;data.</p><p>Given this enormous untapped opportunity for innovation and growth, you would think the UK Government would be bending over backwards to promote it. But no. None of its proposals address this opportunity. Instead, they all reinforce the organisation-centric assumption that charges in exactly the opposite direction — of disempowering citizens, minimising their ability to control their own data&nbsp;… and ignoring opportunities for innovation that don’t fit its preconceptions.</p> Myth #5: “All ‘innovation’ is, by definition, a good&nbsp;thing” <p>Usually, when people talk about innovation, the unquestioned underlying assumption is that all innovation is a good thing, by definition. This is the assumption behind the UK Government’s proposed&nbsp;reforms.</p><p>But it is palpable nonsense. Nuclear bombs were an innovation. Fraudsters are constantly innovating: coming up with new, better ways to con people out of their money. Cambridge Analytica was profoundly innovative. So it is simply not true that all innovations make peoples’ lives better. Many do the exact opposite.</p><p>In fact, a recent research review of the history of innovation and entrepreneurship* concluded that throughout history there have been two types of entrepreneurship, resulting in two types of innovation: productive and unproductive/parasitic, with unproductive innovators “seeking to obtain a larger slice of the pie for themselves, rather than increasing the size of the pie for everyone”.</p><p>Here is the study’s conclusion:</p><blockquote>“How the entrepreneur acts at a given time and place depends heavily on the rules of the game, the reward structure in the economy, that happen to prevail&nbsp;… It is the set of rules and not the supply of entrepreneurs or the nature of their objectives that undergoes significant changes from one period to another.”</blockquote><p>By depriving citizens of most of their current rights under data protection law, the UK Government is trying to change ‘the rules of the game’ to recast ‘the reward structure in the economy’ in ways that incentivise the wrong sorts of innovation. What it is proposing would not benefit citizens or bona fide service providers. Instead, it would create a breeding ground for dozens more different types of unproductive, parasitic Cambridge Analyticas.</p> Conclusion <p>The rationale behind the UK Government’s data protection ‘reforms’ is flawed, made up of a bundle of myths, misconceptions and mistaken assumptions. It misunderstands what makes personal data valuable in the first place, where the biggest opportunities for innovation and growth lie, and the role data has to play in unleashing these opportunities.</p><p>This blog has shown that the route to innovation and growth lies in an entirely different direction to the one assumed by the Government: empowering citizens with personal data store-based data logistics infrastructure that enables the right, reliable data to get to and from the right people at the right times, while keeping citizens in control of their&nbsp;data.</p><p>The same infrastructure can enable individuals to aggregate data about themselves that is currently dispersed across hundreds of separate organisational data silos, to create new-to-the-world citizen-centric data assets that act as engines of privacy protecting innovation.</p><p>Current data protection law does nothing to hinder these — the right sorts of innovation and growth. What the law does hinder is the collection and use of personal data without individuals’ consent for purposes that individuals have not asked for — i.e. ‘innovative’ Cambridge Analytica-style business models. Government proposals would sweep these protections — now called “impediments” — away, thereby ushering in ‘a new golden age’ of surveillance capitalism.</p><p>As far as economy boosting innovation and growth goes, it is a wild goose chase. Another wild goose chase that the Government is pinning excessive hopes on is so-called Artificial Intelligence. That is the subject of our next&nbsp;blog.</p><p>*The invention of enterprise: entrepreneurship from the ancient Mesopotamia to modern times, Princeton University Press, 2010, edited by David S Landes, Joel Mokyr, &amp; William J&nbsp;Baumol</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/five-myths-about-data-innovation-and-growth-e966b94496cf">Five Myths about Data, Innovation and Growth</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 Rennes and Munich, Dec. 7, 2021, AutoIdent+QES is an all-in-one solution with qualified electronic signature (according to eIDAS v1) paired with remote identity verification, compliant with the AML-CFT Directive, available on the French market and a real alternative to a PVID service. 
<p>IDnow and ARIADNEXT, who recently joined forces (June 2021) with the purpose of becoming the KYC leader in Europe, introduce a qualified electronic signature solution paired with automatic and manual identity verification: AutoIdent+QES complies with KYC requirements of French companies under the European AML/CFT Directive.</p>
<p>As a reminder, many sectors are subject to the AML/CFT Directive: banks, insurance companies, fintech and neobanks, online gambling, etc. As part of their onboarding process (KYC), they are required to implement measures such as verification of the person’s identity document, micro-payment, identity verification by a Remote Identity Verification Provider (PVID) or qualified electronic signature. These measures can be considered as constraining, in the integration of the solution but especially in their impact on the onboarding process for end users, looking for smooth experiences.</p>
<p>The AutoIdent+QES solution, certified by an accredited body, effortlessly orchestrates a hybrid identity verification completed by a qualified electronic signature according to eIDAS. Easily integrated, it enables regulated companies to address their services in full compliance to all types of audiences (even non-banked) and delivers a complete, fluid and fast user experience, with a less than 10 minute onboarding process during which the user proves their identity.</p>
<p>A significant advantage of the AutoIdent+QES onboarding process is its total flexibility: depending on the customer’s needs, the eSign module for digital contract signing can complete the journey by enabling the signing of a contract, paving the way for other use cases, such as taking out a consumer loan in a fully digital process.</p>
<p>“With AutoIdent+QES, our customers, who operate in an ever-changing environment, have the peace of mind and flexibility to choose the solution that best meets their needs,” says Andreas Bodczek, CEO of IDnow.</p>
<p>Marc Norlain, co-founder of ARIADNEXT and IDnow Board Member adds “this certified solution, already available on the European market, offers a real alternative to the upcoming PVID certification in the French landscape. The AutoIdent+QES solution completes our product offering for companies required to comply with AML-CFT regulations and anticipates the upcoming certification of our PVID solution by offering a service that can be deployed by financial institutions”.</p>

  <p>Electron is one of the most popular desktop frameworks today. Electron uses HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for its front end and Node.js for its backend. This design enables developers to quickly write and easily maintain cross-platform applications between their desktop and web applications. Since Electron uses Node on the backend, it also has access to the entire npm ecosystem that Node developers have come to rely on.</p>

<p>Even though it is built on Node, Electron is used for desktop applications rather than web applications. This can present a new set of challenges. For example, one of the most common and popular ways to interface with Okta from a Node.js application is to use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@okta/oidc-middleware">Okta NodeJS OIDC Middleware</a>. The middleware takes some configuration and connects with Okta. This process is super simple to set up and use securely.</p>

<p>Matt Raible wrote a blog post <a>about using Electron with Okta</a> in 2018. In his example, he used <code>AppAuth</code> with its PKCE extension to secure his Electron application.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Both of these approaches require a callback path where Okta can send the authentication code to be processed by your application. For some companies, allowing <code>localhost</code> to receive the response from Okta may pose a security concern. There are many ways to handle this, but in this article, you will use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@okta/okta-auth-js">Okta’s Auth JS SDK</a>. This SDK exposes a <code>signInWithCredentials()</code> method that you can use to authenticate your users.</p>

 Create an OpenID Connect application 

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need a free Okta developer account. Install the <a href="https://cli.okta.com">Okta CLI</a> and run <code>okta register</code> to sign up for a new account. If you already have an account, run <code>okta login</code>.
Then, run <code>okta apps create</code>. Select the default app name, or change it as you see fit.
Choose Native and press Enter.</p>

<p>Use <code>com.okta.dev-133337:/callback</code> for the Redirect URI and the Logout Redirect URI 
    (where <code>dev-133337.okta.com</code> is your Okta domain name). Your domain name is reversed to provide a unique scheme to open your app on a device.</p>


  What does the Okta CLI do?
<p>The Okta CLI will create an OIDC Native App in your Okta Org. It will add the redirect URIs you specified and grant access to the Everyone group. You will see output like the following when it’s finished:</p>
   <code>Okta application configuration:
Issuer:    https://dev-133337.okta.com/oauth2/default
Client ID: 0oab8eb55Kb9jdMIr5d6
</code>   
<p>NOTE: You can also use the Okta Admin Console to create your app. See <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/sign-into-mobile-app/-/create-okta-application/">Create a Native App</a> for more information.</p>



<p>You can leave the redirect URI at the default as you won’t be using it for this project. If you have multiple authorization servers you will need to pick one. For this application, the <code>default</code> server is fine.</p>

<p>Once your application is configured, the Okta CLI will return the issuer and client-id. Make note of these as you will need them when you build your application.</p>

<p></p>

 Build an Electron app 

<p>Now you’re ready to build an Electron application. First, open a new folder using your favorite IDE. In the console, type <code>npm init</code> and complete the setup presented to you. Accepting all the defaults is fine. Once you are done with the setup, install the following dependencies:</p>

   <code>npm i -D electron@16.0.3 @okta/okta-auth-js@5.8.0
</code>   

<p>Next, add a <code>start</code> script to your <code>package.json</code> file.</p>

   <code>"scripts": {
  "start": "electron .",
  ...
},
</code>   

<p>Create a new file called <code>main.js</code> and add the following code to it. Make sure to replace <code>{yourOktaDomain}</code> and <code>{yourClientId}</code> with the settings from the OIDC app you created earlier.</p>

   <code>const { app, BrowserWindow } = require("electron");
const path = require("path");
const OktaAuth = require("@okta/okta-auth-js").OktaAuth;

const { ipcMain } = require("electron");

let mainWindow;
let user;

var config = {
  // Required config
  issuer: "/oauth2/default",
  clientId: "{yourClientId}",
};

var authClient = new OktaAuth(config);

ipcMain.on("user:login", (event, data) =&gt; {
  authClient
    .signInWithCredentials(data)
    .then(function (res) {
      console.log(res);

      if (res.data.status != "SUCCESS") {
        event.reply("login-failed", err.errorSummary);
        return;
      }

      user = res.user;
      openHome();
    })
    .catch(function (err) {
      console.log(err);
      event.reply("login-failed", err.errorSummary);
    });
});

ipcMain.handle("user:get", (event) =&gt; {
  return user;
});

ipcMain.on("user:logout", (event) =&gt; {
  user = null;
  openIndex();
});

function createWindow() {
  mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    webPreferences: {
      preload: path.join(__dirname, "preload.js"),
    },
  });
}

function openIndex() {
  mainWindow.loadFile("index.html");

  // Open the DevTools.
  mainWindow.webContents.openDevTools();
}

function openHome() {
  mainWindow.loadFile("home.html");
}

// This method will be called when Electron has finished
// initialization and is ready to create browser windows.
// Some APIs can only be used after this event occurs.
app.whenReady().then(() =&gt; {
  createWindow();
  openIndex();

  app.on("activate", function () {
    // On macOS it's common to re-create a window in the app when the
    // dock icon is clicked and there are no other windows open.
    if (BrowserWindow.getAllWindows().length === 0) createWindow();
  });
});

// Quit when all windows are closed, except on macOS. There, it's common
// for applications and their menu bar to stay active until the user quits
// explicitly with Cmd + Q.
app.on("window-all-closed", function () {
  if (process.platform !== "darwin") app.quit();
});
</code>   

<p>This file serves a few different functions. First, it is the main entry point for the application. Because of this, it also handles creating the window as well as the close function.</p>

<p>The <code>main.js</code> file also serves to navigate between the unsecured <code>index.html</code> page and the secured <code>home.html</code> page. When the user is authenticated you will direct them to the <code>home.html</code> page. After the user logs out, direct them to the <code>index.html</code> page which contains the login logic.</p>

<p>The file also contains handlers for the main process and communication back to the renderer process. In Electron, these processes are isolated from each other for security. The appropriate way to communicate between the two is to use the <code>contextBridge</code> and the <code>ipcRenderer</code> or <code>ipcMain</code> modules, depending on which way you are trying to communicate. In <code>main.js</code> you are receiving communication from the renderer process when the user attempts to log in or requests to log out. There is also a handler for <code>user:get</code> that will return the user stored by the main process to the renderer process.</p>

<p>Finally, the <code>main.js</code> file will also handle the authentication logic from the Okta SDK. You will need to configure your client first, using your issuer and the client ID obtained during the setup process above. Next, you can create a <code>login()</code> method that makes use of the <code>signInWithCredentials()</code> method provided by the SDK. This method will return a result that you can parse. If the message is a success then you can redirect the user to <code>home.index</code>, otherwise you can return an error message and handle that on your renderer side as you see fit.</p>

<p>Next, add a file called <code>preload.js</code> with the following code.</p>

   <code>const { contextBridge, ipcRenderer } = require("electron");

contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld("electron", {
  login: (data) =&gt; ipcRenderer.send("user:login", data),
  getUser: async () =&gt; {
    const user = await ipcRenderer.invoke("user:get");
    return user;
  },
  logout: () =&gt; ipcRenderer.send("user:logout"),
});

ipcRenderer.on("login-failed", (event, message) =&gt; {
  document.getElementById("error-message").innerHTML = message;
});
</code>   

<p>The <code>preload.js</code> file is where you will mediate the communication between the main and the renderer process. <code>contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld</code> allows you to define an API, in this case, called <code>electron</code>, that your renderer can invoke. This file has access to both the renderer and main process and can delegate messages from the renderer to the main process. When the renderer calls <code>electron.login</code>, the <code>ipcRenderer</code> will send the message and payload through the <code>contextBridge</code> to be handled in the <code>main.js</code> page you saw earlier.</p>

<p>Next, add two HTML files. Start by adding <code>index.html</code>.</p>

   <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;

&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;A Brief Electron demo with Okta&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Electron and Okta&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class="container"&gt;
  &lt;h4&gt;Please Login&lt;/h4&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;label&gt;Username&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" name="username" id="username"/&gt;

    &lt;label&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="password" name="password" id="password"/&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;button id="login-button"&gt;Login&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;label id="error-message"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;style&gt;
  .container {
    width: 60%;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  document.querySelector("#login-button").addEventListener("click", () =&gt; {
    const username = document.getElementById("username").value;
    const password = document.getElementById("password").value;

    const data = {
      username: username,
      password: password,
    };

    window.electron.login(data);
  });

&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
</code>   

<p>The <code>index.html</code> page is for users who are not authenticated yet. You are presenting the user with a login screen that collects a username and password and calls <code>window.electron.login</code>. As you learned earlier, this function is added in the <code>preload.js</code> file.</p>

<p>Finally, add a <code>home.html</code> file and provide a landing page for authenticated users.</p>

   <code>&lt;h1&gt;Home&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Congratulations &lt;span id="username"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;, You've made it to a secure page using Okta.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;button id="logout-button"&gt;Logout&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
  window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () =&gt; {
    window.electron.getUser().then((user) =&gt; {
      document.getElementById("username").innerHTML = `${user.profile.firstName} ${user.profile.lastName}`
    });
  });

  document.getElementById('logout-button').addEventListener('click', () =&gt; {
    window.electron.logout();
  });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>The logout button calls your <code>electron</code> API from the <code>preload.js</code> file. You are also displaying the user’s name from Okta. This helps verify that the user is logged in and who they signed in as.</p>

<p>This page has been left intentionally simple for a very good reason. Electron doesn’t care what frontend you use. This could be a full-fledged React application or could have very little JavaScript at all. How you handle managing the application and user state is up to you. But, by using the Okta SDKs you can securely authenticate your users, and push them into the application state you need.</p>

<p>With your application ready, you can use the command <code>npm start</code> or run your debugger to see the application. You will see a warning in your console when starting:</p>

   <code>[okta-auth-sdk] WARN: Memory storage can only support simple single user use case on server 
side, please provide custom storageProvider or storageKey if advanced scenarios need to be 
supported.
</code>   

<p>For development, this isn’t an issue; in production you may want to consider implementing a custom storage provider for your application. You can find <a href="https://github.com/okta/okta-auth-js#node-js-and-react-native-usage">more usage information here</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Once the application starts up, you can use your Okta credentials to log in and see the <code>home.html</code> page.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Wolf McNally’s <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lifehash">LifeHash</a> is one of Blockchain Commons’ interoperable specifications intended to make digital infrastructure open, interoperable, secure, and compassionate. A LifeHash takes a cryptographic objects such as a seed or a key (or really, any sort of data) and turns it into a beautiful and easily recognizable image.</p>

<p>You can now play with LifeHashes at <a href="http://lifehash.info/">LifeHash.info</a>. This <a href="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/lifehash-web/">C++ implementation compiled to WebAssembly</a> allows you to enter an arbitrary text string or a SHA-256 digest and view the corresponding LifeHash — using one of a few different LifeHash variants. (We recommend v2 as the “official” LifeHash.) Because it’s compiled into Webassembly, LifeHash.info does all the work in your browser, ensuring your secrets stay safe!</p>

<p>A similar idea called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethereum-blockies">Blockies</a> already exists to identify Ethereum addresses. They’re a great addition to the Ethereum ecosystem, but LifeHashes incorporate a few additional features. Because each one is built from an iteration of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a>, they’re more detailed. They also have been carefully formatted to display well on grayscale screens and low-resolution screens, with our <a href="https://www.blockchaincommons.com/quarterlies/Q1-2021-Report/">LetheKit offering a proof of concept</a>.</p>

<p>So why use LifeHashes? They ensure that any time that you see a key or seed in a different environment, you’ll be able to recognize it through the visual hash (and now you can use <a href="http://lifehash.info/">LifeHash.info</a> to display the LifeHash derived from the SHA-256 hash of an object, even if your app doesn’t support LifeHashes). As an adjunct to existing computer and human examinations of digital hashes, LifeHashes can improve your security.</p>

<p>LifeHashes are particularly important for Blockchain Commons given our focus on resilient and independent airgapped architectures: a LifeHash allows for the easy comparison of a cryptographic object on either side of the gap, so that you know that you received what you were expecting. Transferred a seed? Asked to sign a PSBT for a specific account? LifeHashes can help you avoid costly errors.</p>

<p>Our explainer video talks more about LifeHash and demonstrates how it works:</p>





<p>Blockchain Commons is dedicated to improving the human aspects of the digital world; LifeHash does that by considering the human experience of cryptographic hashes and providing visual cues to replace (or at least supplement) the long strings of letters and numbers that we can’t easily differentiate.</p>

				  The emergence of a global pandemic has driven the digitalization of services making reliable authentication online a critical need, says Charlyn Ho, a privacy and technology expert at international law firm Perkins Coie, in a new white paper.   
			  
				
				
				 <p>We caught up with Charlyn to learn more about her paper, <a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/images/content/2/4/247949/2021-Perkins-Coie-LLP-Health-Passport-White-Paper.pdf">COVID-19 as a Catalyst for Advancement of Digital Identity</a>,&nbsp;and to talk about&nbsp; the future of decentralized identity. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and length.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio: &nbsp;Tell us about yourself and your work and how it led you to write this paper. </p>
<p>Charlyn Ho (CH): Perkins Coie has a long history with self-sovereign identity beginning in 2016 when we were approached by a pro-bono client that was looking to use digital identity to empower refugees to control their own national papers to help mitigate the risk of physical papers being lost or stolen. These efforts started the Blockchain Technology group’s passion for self-sovereign identity.</p>
<p>In 2017, the Blockchain Technology group authored “<a href="https://www.virtualcurrencyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/35/2017/05/Perkins-Coie-LLP-Legal-Aspects-of-Smart-Contracts-Applications.pdf">Legal Aspects of Smart Contract Applications</a>” a white paper that provided an initial analysis of the legal aspects of five prominent smart contract use cases that included self-sovereign identity. Later that year, Perkins Coie became the first law firm to be selected as a <a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/en/news-insights/perkins-coie-selected-as-a-founding-steward-in-self-sovereign.html">Founding Steward</a> by the Sovrin Foundation, which is when I began my work in this space. In 2018, I co-authored a white paper addressing self-sovereign identity and Distributed Ledger Technology titled “<a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/images/content/2/1/v3/218495/Perkins-Coie-Self-Sovereign-Identity-and-Distributed-Ledger-Tech.pdf">Self-Sovereign Identity and Distributed Ledger Technology: Framing the Legal Issues</a>.” The paper outlined the high-level legal issues and technological challenges that must be addressed ahead of mass adoption of self-sovereign identity. Also in 2018, Perkins Coie began representing Sovrin with whom we co-authored a white paper titled “<a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Sovrin-Protocol-and-Token-White-Paper.pdf">A Protocol and Token for Self-Sovereign Identity &amp; Decentralized Trust</a>.”</p>
<p>As we watched the COVID-19 pandemic unfold, we became convinced that flimsy paper cards and quick-fix health passes would not provide sustainable solutions. So, we decided to put pen to paper and draft “<a href="https://www.perkinscoie.com/images/content/2/4/248113/2021-Perkins-Coie-LLP-Health-Certificate-White-Paper.pdf">COVID-19 as a Catalyst for Advancement of Digital Identity</a>,” which we believe lays out the fundamental principles underlying self-sovereign identity. We hope our paper can serve as a framework upon which governments and institutions can build digital identity systems in a way that is both privacy-preserving and widely adoptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio: &nbsp;How did you land on the three pillars of digital identity? You mentioned Christopher Allen’s paper “The Path to Self Sovereign Identity,” how influential was that material to the direction of the paper?</p>
<p>CH: Any comprehensive digital identity system is unlikely to garner widespread acceptance without being able to convincingly assuage your average user’s (understandable) concerns about how their data is stored, used, shared, and accessed. Such skepticism can be healthy—it’s your data after all. But if we also believe that digital identity systems hold the potential to not only provide users enhanced security and efficiency of their data but also the ability for nations and institutions to respond quickly to disasters, pandemics, and other threats, then we need to prioritize systems that are crafted with users’ needs and interests in mind if we are to reap these rewards.</p>
<p>One of our primary objectives in writing this paper was to ascertain the fundamental building blocks of any healthy digital identity system. While any number of desirable features may be present in a successful digital identity system, from our review of the relevant literature and existing digital identity systems we determined that trust, user-centricity, and data security are the pillars for any comprehensive system to function effectively and secure users’ confidence.</p>
<p>While many thought leaders influenced this project, Christopher Allen is certainly a pioneer in this space, so his work had a particularly important influence us. I think he put it best when he wrote, “You can’t spell identity without an ‘I.’” Digital identity starts and ends with the user — a concept that was vital to our work, particularly our second pillar (user-centricity). Hopefully we’ve been able to build on the foundation that Mr. Allen has laid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio: You mention paper vaccination cards and plastic drivers licenses as examples of physical identification cards and cite the problems in offline identification systems being not fully inclusive — with 1.1 billion people being “invisible, discounted, or left behind.” Is a trustworthy, secure, user-centric digital credential system a necessity that governments should pursue with more urgency? What are your thoughts on the urgency of adoption of digital identity at the government-level?</p>
<p>CH: Paper and plastic provide a veneer of security — you can see, touch, and physically move a driver’s license or birth certificate. But those same characteristics create a double-edged sword. If paper and plastic can be seen and touched, they can also be forged. If they can be moved, they can also be lost or stolen. For those fleeing conflict or born into poverty, physical credentials are scarce, which makes proving that you are who you say you are all the more challenging.</p>
<p>For these reasons (and many others), governments absolutely should be exploring trustworthy and secure digital credential systems. Governments around the world have been slow to develop comprehensive digital identity systems, which became all-too-apparent during the somewhat disjointed and on-the-fly approach that various nation states and institutions took to developing credentialing systems during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio:&nbsp; In the paper, you describe Indicio’s digital identity system with SITA as being in Phase ‘3.5’ in evolution for user control of identity. Can you talk about what a Phase 4 system would look like in relation to health credentials? Would a more comprehensive digital identity system need to be adopted at a government level for user-centric digital identity to catch on or will private use cases help push us to Phase 4 evolution?</p>
<p>CH: A Phase 4 (self-sovereign) digital identity system is more of a journey than a destination. As the name implies, Phase 4 is true self-sovereignty, but whether or not true self-sovereignty can ever exist in practice is debatable due to countervailing state interests in having some measure of control over or access to one’s data. A Phase 4 system requires that users be vested with autonomy or sovereignty with respect to their credentials, which would apply to health credentials or otherwise. But what that looks like and the friction that may exist when such a system is put into practice remains to be seen. Without moving through Phase 3.5 (user-centric) we only have limited ways to conceive of what a Phase 4 system could look like in a practical sense. Putting the pieces of the puzzle together remains murky because we are only at the very nascency of Phase 3.5.</p>

  &nbsp; EU Advances on Travel Rule Negotiations  
<p>On November 29th 2021, <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/12/01/anti-money-laundering-council-agrees-its-negotiating-mandate-on-transparency-of-crypto-asset-transfers/">ambassadors to the Council of the EU agreed</a> on a mandate to negotiate with the EU Parliament on regulating the information accompanying cryptoasset transfers. Currently, payment service providers dealing in fiat currency must collect and share information on the sender and beneficiary of each wire transfer they process. This is what the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) refers to as the Travel Rule (FATF Recommendation 16). In June 2019, the <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfgeneral/documents/outcomes-plenary-june-2019.html">FATF updated its guidance</a> to apply its Travel Rule standards to cryptoassets. <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-14259-2021-INIT/en/pdf">With this proposal</a>, the EU is advancing to expand the scope of regulation to apply to cryptoassets.</p> 
<p>EU ambassador Andrej Šircelj, said “this agreement is an important step towards closing the gaps in our financial systems that are malevolently used by criminals to launder unlawful gains or finance terrorist activities. Crypto-assets are more and more at risk of being exploited for money laundering and criminal purposes, and I’m glad the Council could make swift progress on this urgent proposal.”</p> 
<p>In practice, cryptoasset business will need to provide originator and beneficiary information which will accompany cryptoasset transfers. This also applies to cryptoasset business which process transfers from the EU to outside the Union. This information will be submitted “before or at the moment the transaction is completed” by the customer of the cryptoasset business.</p> 
<p>If the parties involved in a transaction are suspicious or are the subject of sanctions, the proposal highlights that: “payment service providers of payers and of payees, as well as intermediary payment service providers, take appropriate action to freeze certain funds or that they comply with specific restrictions concerning certain transfers of funds.” The document highlighted that personal data collected to comply with this regulation should not be processed for commercial purposes. Furthermore, negotiations should include requirements regarding data protection and sharing.</p> 
<p>The proposal also clarifies exemption for a number of blockchain network participants.&nbsp; Indeed, “persons that are merely ancillary participants, which do not provide or actively facilitate the transfer of crypto-assets, such as persons that provide only Internet services, cloud services, a gateway to connect to a distributed ledger network (for example a so called ‘unhosted wallet’) or nodes that help validate the transactions, should not fall within the scope of this Regulation.” However, when a cryptoasset business receives or transfers funds from or to a private address not linked to a business, the cryptoasset business “will have to obtain information both on the originator and the beneficiary, usually from their customer.”</p>

  Reports From India Suggest the Government Will Regulate Rather Than Ban Cryptoassets  
<p>A bill seeking to prohibit all private cryptoassets in India was presented for consideration to the Lok Sabha, India’s parliament, as<a href="http://loksabhadocs.nic.in/bull2mk/2021/23.11.21.pdf"> announced in the official bulletin</a> on November 23rd 2021. A week later, the creator of this bill, former Finance Secretary Subhash Gard,<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/india-misinterpreted-private-crypto-ban-says-crypto-bill-creator"> said</a> it was misinterpreted by observers. In fact, he believes that “the future of currency is in digital currencies.”<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/cabinet-note-suggests-india-will-regulate-rather-than-ban-crypto"> Local reports</a> suggest that investors will have to declare their cryptoasset holdings and will be given time to transfer their funds to soon-to-be regulated exchanges. In parallel, the Reserve Bank of India is working on a framework to<a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbi-backed-digital-currency-soon/articleshow/87977223.cms"> experiment launching its central bank digital currency</a> (CBDC). This would also be covered by the bill pending introduction to the Lok Sabha as detailed in the bulletin. These announcements follow two significant cryptoasset regulatory developments covered by Elliptic in November 2021<a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/us-president-working-group-releases-report-on-stablecoins"> here</a> and<a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/us-infrastructure-bills-cryptoasset-reporting-requirements-seen-as-overreach"> here</a>.</p>

  SEC Clamps Down on Cryptoasset Fraud Costing More Than $7 Million to Investors  
<p>On December 2nd 2021, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)<a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-248?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"> charged a Latvian national</a>, Ivars Auzins, with fraud involving cryptoassets. The charges relate to two separate cryptoasset offerings which defrauded hundreds of retail investors. These schemes operated in 2018 and 2019 but Auzins failed to register with the SEC and adhere to anti-fraud requirements. It is estimated that at least $7 million of the funds raised through these offerings were misappropriated by Auzins. The Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s Cyber Unit, Kristina Littman, declared: “[w]e will continue to detect and pursue those that seek to victimize investors in the digital asset space.”</p>

 &nbsp; Luxembourg Releases Guidance on Cryptoasset Investments  
<p>On November 29th 2021, Luxembourg’s financial markets regulator, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF), <a href="https://www.cssf.lu/wp-content/uploads/FAQ_Virtual_Assets.pdf">&nbsp;published an FAQ</a> document on cryptoassets. It outlines which market participants are authorised to trade cryptoassets. It clarifies that alternative investment funds (AIF) and investment fund managers (IFM) must obtain prior approval from the CSSF before trading cryptoassets. This includes, “[a]n updated risk management policy including in particular how the risks in relation to the virtual assets are managed” and “AML/CTF analysis on the assets side.” Furthermore, the “CSSF expects [...] supervised entities investing in virtual assets possess, and can demonstrate, an adequate understanding of the new ML, TF, Proliferation Financing risks posed by virtual assets and the necessary measures to mitigate them.” Cryptoasset business looking to operate in Luxemburg should refer to the<a href="https://mj.gouvernement.lu/dam-assets/dossiers/blanchiment/ML-TF-vertical-risk-assessment-on-VASPs.pdf"> Ministry of Justice’s vertical risk assessment framework</a> for cryptoasset businesses.</p>

<p>A summary of Jolocom’s projects in 2021 provides a broad overview of how we work, what our values ​ are, and how we have developed. Spoiler Alert: A lot has happened since January.</p>



 ONCE in implementation 



<p>In spring this year we began the implementation phase for the project ONCE. ONCE had been selected as one out of four projects of the innovation competition ‘Showcase Secure Digital Identities’ by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi) for a three-year implementation phase. Jolocom brings its expertise in the development of wallet-based digital identities based on the self-sovereign identity (SSI) approach to three of the selected implementation projects.</p>



<p>In this project, Jolocom is responsible for the development of an ONCE-compliant wallet. Based on the Jolocom Smartwallet. In the next two years, this is to be supplemented with additional modules and functions together with the project partners.</p>



<p>In the initial phase, the projects focuses extensively on the development, implementation and integration of the technical components. Soon, however, the implementation of use cases from the areas of public administration, mobility and tourism will come to the fore. The solutions of the ONCE ecosystem will then be piloted and put into circulation in particular in the Hesse region and in partner cities in Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia.</p>



<p>From this point on, the practical results of ONCE will be tested in everyday life by residents of the regions. In terms of its functionality, the ecosystem is designed to serve both sovereign identities and evidence (eID, mDL, iKfz), as well as identity features that are issued and used according to the principles of SSI.</p>



<p>The ONCE project also takes current developments around the European eIDAS regulation into account, with the clear goal of providing future-proof solutions on the subject of digital identities for German and EU citizens.</p>



<p>Read more about ONCE? You can find more information here: <a href="https://www.once-project.de/partner/jolocom/">https://www.once-project.de/partner/jolocom/</a> &amp; on our website: <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/once-eidas-de/">https://jolocom.io/blog/once-eidas-de/</a></p>



 Jolocom goes Consulting – since 7 years 



<p>2021 was a productive year for Jolocom. A lot has happened since January: projects have been further developed and expanded. An example of this is the area of consulting.</p>



<p>In its seven years, Jolocom actually always held a consultant role, which means that we can pull off a great deal of know-how through various project implementations. The focus here is of course on SSI. But Jolocom has also been able to acquire a lot of knowledge through active work in the field of technology or in networks of various bodies (e.g. W3C, DIF, INATBA) and consortia (e.g. shop window projects digital identities). That, in turn, can flow into our advisory role.</p>



<p>We don’t just strive for advice from start to finish. No, rather from start to operation without detours. Because Jolocom covers all areas and levels, from the first contact with the topic of digital identities, creation of the strategy, selection of the technology to implementation. This enables efficient first-hand advice without time-consuming and costly detours.</p>



<p>Principles and solutions</p>



<p>We are convinced that a decentralized identity should be an open platform with uniform standards, regardless of a single solution. Products and solutions have to be interoperable. This is the only way to realize the potential of the technology for the individual, public, and private sector.</p>



<p>This principle guides us in consultation and in the creation of our freely available platform. When it comes to consulting, we are therefore independent of technology and aim to avoid a vendor lock-in or other dependencies.</p>



<p>Jolocom Consulting supports project / consortium management, so that the solution goes into operation as planned and the potentials can be realized. <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/consulting-ssi/">https://jolocom.io/blog/consulting-ssi/</a></p>



 



<p>The development and thus the projects of Jolocom are constantly evolving. For example, we are working on demos that clearly and vividly present what we do and what we are working on. For the ConDIDi project, Jolocom created a demo together with the TIB in Leibniz, which shows this well and can be tried here: <a href="https://labs.tib.eu/condidi/">https://labs.tib.eu/condidi/</a></p>



<p>Jolocom started its ONCE project in 2021 and was able to further expand the area of ​​consulting. We also worked on the development of the Smartwallet 2.0, which will be presented in more detail in another article. We are very excited about the opportunities 2022 will bring and proud of the progress we made in 2021.</p>

 Eine Übersicht über die Projekte von Jolocom bietet ein umfassendes Bild darüber, wie wir arbeiten, was unsere Werte sind, und wie wir uns entwickelt haben. Spoiler Alert: Seit Januar hat sich viel getan.&nbsp; 



 ONCE in der Umsetzung&nbsp; 



<p>Im Frühling begann die Umsetzungsphase für unser Projekt ONCE. Als eines von vier Projekten wurde ONCE im Innovationswettbewerb ,,Schaufenster Sichere Digitale Identitäten’’ vom Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie (BMWi) für die dreijährige Umsetzungsphase ausgewählt. Jolocom bringt seine Expertise in der Entwicklung von Wallet-basierten Digitalen Identitäten auf Basis des Selbst-Souveränen Identität (SSI) Ansatzes in insgesamt drei der Umsetzungsprojekte ein.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Im ONCE-Projekt ist Jolocom für die Entwicklung einer ONCE-konformen Wallet zuständig, welche auf der Jolocom Smartwallet aufbaut. In den kommenden zwei Jahren soll diese gemeinsam mit den Projektpartnern um weitere Module und Funktionen ergänzt werden. In der Anfangsphase liegt der Fokus noch stark auf der Entwicklung, Implementierung und Integration der technischen Komponenten. Bald jedoch wird die Umsetzung von Anwendungsfällen aus den Bereichen Öffentliche Verwaltung, Mobilität und Tourismus in den Vordergrund treten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Die Lösungen des ONCE-Ökosystems werden dann insbesondere in der Region Hessen, sowie in Partnerstädten in Bayern und Nordrhein-Westfalen pilotiert und in Umlauf gebracht. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt werden die praktischen Ergebnisse von ONCE im Alltag durch Anwohner:innen der Regionen erprobt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In seiner Funktionalität ist das Ökosystem darauf ausgelegt, sowohl hoheitliche Identitäten und Nachweise zu bedienen (eID, mDL, iKfz), als auch Identitätsmerkmale, die nach den Prinzipien von SSI herausgegeben und verwendet werden. Das ONCE-Projekt berücksichtigt auch derzeitige Entwicklungen rund um die europäische eIDAS-Verordnung, mit dem klaren Ziel, zukunftsfähige Lösungen zum Thema Digitale Identitäten für deutsche und EU-Bürger:innen bereitzustellen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 Jolocom goes Consulting – schon seit 7 Jahren&nbsp; 



<p>2021 war ein produktives Jahr für Jolocom. Seit Januar hat sich viel getan: Projekte wurden weiterentwickelt und Schwerpunkte ausgebaut. Ein Beispiel hierfür ist der Bereich der Beratung.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom hatte in seinen sieben Jahren eigentlich immer auch eine Beraterfunktion inne, wodurch wir von großem Know-How durch verschiedene Projektdurchführungen zerren können. Der Fokus hierbei liegt natürlich auf SSI. Doch auch im Bereich der Technologie oder in Netzwerken verschiedener Gremien (z.B. W3C, DIF, INATBA) und Konsortien (z.B. Schaufensterprojekte Digitale Identitäten) hat Jolocom sich durch aktive Arbeit viel Wissen aneignen können. Dass wiederum kann in unsere Beraterfunktion einfließen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wir streben eine Beratung nicht nur von Anfang bis Ende an. Nein, vielmehr vom Anfang bis zum Betrieb ohne Umwege. Denn Jolocom deckt alle Bereiche und Ebenen ab, von erstem Kontakt mit dem Thema digitale Identitäten, Erstellung der Strategie, Auswahl der Technologie bis zu einer Implementierung. Dies ermöglicht eine effiziente Beratung aus erster Hand ohne zeit- und kostenintensive Umwege.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Grundsätze und Lösungen&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wir sind davon überzeugt, dass eine dezentrale Identität eine offene Plattform mit einheitlichen Standards sein muss, unabhängig von einer einzelnen Lösung. Produkte und Lösungen müssen interoperabel sein. Nur so können die Potentiale der Technologie für den Einzelnen, für den öffentlichen Bereich und die Privatwirtschaft umgesetzt werden. Dieser Grundsatz leitet uns in der Beratung und in der Erstellung unserer frei verfügbaren Plattform. In der Beratung sind wir daher technologieunabhängig und verfolgen das Ziel, dass ein Vendor lock-in oder andere Abhängigkeiten vermieden werden.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom Consulting unterstützt bei Projekt-/Konsortienmanagement und als Spezialist, damit die Lösung wie geplant in Betrieb geht und die Potentiale realisiert werden können. <a href="https://jolocom.io/blog/consulting-ssi/">https://jolocom.io/blog/consulting-ssi/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



 Weiteres  



<p>Die Entwicklung und damit die Projekte Jolocoms sind sich stets am Weiterentwickeln. Beispielsweise arbeiten wir an Demos, die übersichtlich und anschaulich vorstellen, was wir machen und woran wir arbeiten. Für das Projekt ConDIDi erstellte Jolocom gemeinsam mit dem TIB in Leibniz eine Demo, die dies gut darstellt und gerne hier probiert werden kann:</p>



<p>Jolocom hat 2021 sein Projekt zu ONCE gestartet und den Bereich der Beratung weiterausbauen können. Weiterhin arbeiteten wir an der Entwicklung der Smartwallet 2.0, die in einem weiteren Artikel näher vorgestellt werden wird. Wir freuen uns sehr auf die Möglichkeiten, die 2022 bieten wird, und sind stolz auf den Fortschritt, den wir 2021 erzielen konnten.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thinking in a decentralized architecture</p>
<p>We have a tendency to apply existing solutions or frameworks towards new things. </p>
<p>In the early days of the web, many companies implemented fax on the Internet, rather than rethinking if faxes were still the best solution for certain types of information exchange. </p>
<p>Are we doing the same thing today with wallets? </p>
<p>Wallets are a tool which we employ to store physical identity cards, credit/debit cards, receipts and other things. But when we think about storing digital identities/credentials, of course employing a wallet sounds like an appropriate thing to do, considering it’s what works as the physical world. </p>
<p>I wonder however if framing it as a digital wallet boxes our thinking.</p>
<p>A second tendency we have, specifically in the digital identity space (and I’m guilty of this at times..), is to look at things as layers or foundations. </p>
<p>I often hear phrases such as: “Government issued digital identities will form the foundation for [insert use case].” </p>
<p>Rather than looking at it as something foundational, we should try framing our thinking around a decentralized architecture.</p>
<p>Let’s take the government regulated environment for instance. Rather than thinking of governments issuing Digital IDs as being foundational, can we instead look at a particular government agency being one identity system?</p>
<p> The ministry managing health cards is one identity system. The ministry managing driver’s licences is another. </p>
<p>They are all individual identity systems, but they participate in an Identity Metasystem. </p>
<p>Rather than being a layer they are a node.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Identity Metasystem Diagram</p>
<p>In this podcast episode, Phil talks about a time where he made a back of the envelope calculation to approximate how many credential types existed within the US. The number he came up with was 16 million.</p>
<p>16 million credentials that need their own identity systems – 16 million identity systems which are built by specific entities for specific contexts.</p>
<p>Identity systems are everywhere and new ones are being built every day (most being very small for very niche contexts).</p>
<p>Identity Metasystems leverage common standards (e.g., Verifiable Credentials, DIDs) and technology protocols (e.g., DIDComm, DID Registries). These are the well areas where the various identity systems can participate and inject/extract value from.</p>
<p>If we can distinguish Identity Systems from Identity Metasystems, it creates a better framing for discussions around the roles of governments, private sector and wallet technology providers.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>About Episode<br>
During this conversation, we discuss:</p>
 
 SSI Wallets – what can be learned from the Web Browser? 
 How will SSI Wallets be adopted? – Will we have very few or many wallets? 
 Distinguishing Identity Systems from Identity Metasystems. 
 How can governments best contribute to Identity Metasystems? 
 Phil’s thoughts on Open ID SIOP (self-issued IDs).&nbsp;

<p>Bloom recently launched <a href="https://onramp.co/">OnRamp</a>, a new DeFi-focused product that helps enterprises with KYC &amp; AML compliance as well as enabling risk assessment via traditional and alternative financial data, all while preserving user privacy. By enabling access to reusable, verifiable credentials for ID verification, sanction screening, and PEP screening, as well as other identity data such as phone number, email, and social accounts, OnRamp is a key piece for DeFi companies facing increased regulatory efforts.</p><p>Bloom Meets Plaid</p><p>Bloom is excited to announce an integration with <a href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a>, a data network that powers the digital financial ecosystem. The Plaid integration gives Bloom the ability to offer consumer-permissioned, traditional financial data for better risk assessment through OnRamp.</p><p>With OnRamp, enterprises can prioritize user privacy while still working towards compliance requirements. Bloom uses Plaid so that consumers can link &nbsp;their bank accounts to verify their account information, all while keeping their information private, even from Bloom. &nbsp; The Plaid integration provides users with the option to securely permission and confirm information used in enabling risk assessment by connecting their financial accounts.</p><p>In addition to bank balance data, the Bloom-Plaid integration opens the door to exciting future integrations, including salary verification. The opportunity for OnRamp to incorporate alternative signals like bank account balance and salary can not only expand financial inclusion, but they may, in fact, be more reliable indicators for creditworthiness than traditional metrics. Stay tuned for more updates on how Bloom is unlocking the full power of DeFi! <br></p><p>About OnRamp</p><p><a href="https://bloom.co/">Bloom</a> plans for <a href="https://onramp.co/">OnRamp</a> to be a key piece of infrastructure for DeFi companies, whether they are in launch or growth mode. The developer-friendly application includes no integration fees, no monthly minimums, no long term contracts, and flexible pricing. OnRamp reduces the barrier to entry for new builders, allows growing companies to expand, and most importantly, opens the door a bit wider for those who deserve access to the decentralized finance markets. Beyond achieving compliance, the use of reusable, verifiable credentials will help DeFi companies enable risk assessment, transcending the collateralized lending structure that has limited growth in the sector up to this point. OnRamp offers reusable, verifiable credentials (VCs) for bank account activity, balances and other financial signals.</p>

<p>A letter from IdentityNORTH Co-Chair, Aran Hamilton</p>
<p>This week we lost a giant in the digital identity space and a leader in the IdentityNORTH community. Kim Cameron was recognized in 2016 as a Founder of Canada’s Digital Economy for his work in recognition of his foundational and groundbreaking work writing the “<a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">7 Laws of Identity</a>” (2005).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kim was the Chief Architect of Identity in the Identity and Access Division at Microsoft, where he championed the emergence of a privacy-enhancing Identity Metasystem reaching across technologies, industries, vendors, continents and cultures. Kim played a leading role in the evolution of Active Directory, Federation Services, Forefront Identity Manager, CardSpace and&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft’s other Identity Metasystem products. In 2009, he was appointed a Microsoft Distinguished Engineer.</p>
<p>A true friend and mentor to many of us, Kim spoke at IdentityNORTH on several occasions. His talk in 2012 was “Cloud Identity Aha Realizations”, Kim helped us kick off the public consultation for the BC Services Card in Vancouver in 2014, speaking with Don Thibeau as we worked to help the BC Government plan the roll-out of their digital ID program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kim was actually the inspiration for the Award that we started in 2015 but we made him wait for it. He spoke to us twice in 2016, first as the Keynote for our Annual Summit “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqUXYl90XHM">Beyond the Laws of Identity</a>” referring to his ground-breaking work and taking us through what he felt he missed when he published his Laws. Kim spoke later on the importance of the community when he received recognition as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdlBg0Ai9aQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">Founder of Canada’s Digital Economy</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kim joined us again in 2020, after he retired from Microsoft and gave a different sort of talk. His <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLSYCxw6I8c">keynote</a> at the IdentityNORTH Annual Summit was a sort of career retrospective, a humble recount of some regrets regarding his work and a call for us to pick up where he was leaving off. Always introspective, Kim wished he’d focused more on creating inclusive solutions for individual and enterprise identity challenges and he wanted us to learn from his mistakes. Once again Kim was ahead of his time, thoughtful, and thought-provoking with a large measure of humour and wit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was an honour to learn from him, and our community will continue to drive forward his work in shaping and implementing meaningful digital identity solutions.</p>
<p>In our most recent chat over Zoom, Kim gave IdentityNORTH advice on a series of talks he thought we should host in the coming months and years. He spoke of his expectations of the world in covid, and after, and very eagerly of getting to spend virtual time with his very young grandchildren. He remarked at the resilience of children, and their ability to connect emotionally even when presented with technological barriers… and how much fun he was having getting to know them as real people.

<p>Anonyome Labs is proud to be presenting at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.riseofprivacytech.com/">The Rise of Privacy Tech</a>&nbsp;(TROPT) interactive forum during&nbsp;<a href="https://staysafeonline.org/data-privacy-week/">Data Privacy Week 2022</a>. Data Privacy Week is an international effort to empower individuals and encourage businesses to respect privacy, safeguard data and enable trust. Data Privacy Week will run January 24–28, 2022. The TROPT interactive forum will be held on January 26–27 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ahead of its interactive forum, the TROPT organization has released a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.riseofprivacytech.com/definingprivacytechwhitepaper2021/">whitepaper</a>&nbsp;titled,&nbsp;Defining the Privacy Tech Landscape 2021: The Rise of Privacy Tech – A Foundational Whitepaper to Help Fuel Privacy Innovation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Importantly, the whitepaper puts forth a comprehensive definition of privacy and, since there’s&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">much debate</a> about what data privacy really means, we thought we’d share the definition with you here.</p>



 The TROPT definition of privacy&nbsp; 



<p></p>



<p>First, as we’ve also&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">reported</a>&nbsp;in the past, TROPT acknowledges that&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/">privacy definitions</a>&nbsp;and conceptualizations vary widely. To overcome this, TROPT has united the common principles into a multi-dimensional definition of privacy, as you can see here:&nbsp;</p>







<p>TROPT believes this is “a multi-faceted understanding of privacy” which covers individual control and power over personal information (our priority at Anonyome Labs) and facilitating trust in personal information relationships.&nbsp;<br><br>The definition embraces a “comprehensive taxonomical approach to conceptualizing privacy based on the activities that impinge upon privacy: information collection, information processing, information dissemination, and invasions.”</p>



<p>Significantly, this definition rejects “the limited conceptualization of privacy as secrecy, obscurity, or anonymity only.”</p>



<p>Going further, TROPT identifies 7 principles of privacy tech from among the existing privacy principles in privacy regulations:</p>







<p>TROPT then maps its 7 principles to the stages of the data life cycle:</p>







 What does all this mean? 



<p></p>



<p>TROPT&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/">agrees with us</a>&nbsp;that “privacy is one of the most critical issues of our time.” Better defining and understanding it, particularly at the practical level of the data lifecycle for an organization, will boost development and uptake of innovations that will help solve the privacy problems we now face at&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/">crisis level</a>. Enterprises are demanding more privacy tools in response to growing&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">customer demand</a>&nbsp;for better stewardship of their personal data, and it helps to see what exactly is required.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/cybersecurity/trusted-tech.html">2020 PwC Trusted Tech report</a>&nbsp;put it, brands that get consumer trust and safety right will disrupt the market. At Anonyome Labs, through our&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;business privacy toolkit, we help enterprises rapidly produce branded cybersafety solutions to get out in front of their competition. Through&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>, the world’s only all-in-one privacy app, we’re putting the power to protect personal information directly into consumers’ hands.</p>

<p>We’re excited to announce Dock’s collaboration with Transak, a platform for onboarding global users from fiat to crypto and back using local payment methods. Previously, Dock Tokens were only available for crypto to crypto buyers, thanks to Docks Integration with Transak, Dock Tokens can now be bought via bank transfers and card payments.</p><p>To celebrate the collaboration, Dock will contribute $10,000 USD toward user transaction fees. This means that early users will get the convenience of Transak without the fees, but you’ll need to be quick, as once the budget is used up the full transaction fees will apply. A small exchange fee will still apply.</p><p>How It Works</p><p>Transak enables bank transfers and card payments in multiple international currencies in over 60 countries, including the UK, Europe and India. In a few simple steps, you’ll own DOCK tokens and will be able to participate in governance, staking, and transacting on the Dock Network. </p><p>Purchase DOCK via the widget on <a href="https://www.dock.io/token#get-dock-token">Dock’s website</a>, sign up to Transak and follow the steps below.</p>  Enter the amount you’d like to purchase in your local currency  Pick your preferred payment method of bank transfer or card payment  Click “Buy Now”  Complete KYC  <p>To ensure compliance, you’ll be asked to enter necessary details such as name, mobile number and DOB, Transak can then tailor your experience for an easy fiat payment the next time you purchase. Purchasing DOCK via Transak is not currently available in the United States, India, China and other select countries.

Taking on board their concerns, Dock engaged Transak to enable purchases via their fiat on/off-ramp. The integration went live on the 1st of December 2021. </p><p>Dock has a total supply of 1 Billion tokens, circa 750 Million are in circulating supply owned by DOCK token holders. </p><p>Transak has enabled non-crypto holders to purchase DOCK allowing more people to partake in governance, validating, and staking, while ensuring all KYC, AML, and fraud monitoring requirements are met. </p><p>Dock CEO Nick Lambert commented on the collaboration “We’re really excited to be working with Transak in opening up DOCK to a wider audience, enabling non-crypto users to enter our ecosystem”. </p><p>Alessandro Raboni, Head of Growth at Transak commented "At Transak we are early believers in the Polkadot ecosystem and we are thrilled to see it developing with such strong solutions and applications like Dock. Dock solves a very important problem in addressing inefficiencies in current data solutions, leveraging blockchain technology. We share with Dock the vision for decentralisation, as well as our developer-centric approach, perfect match!”</p><p>Head to <a href="https://www.dock.io/token#get-dock-token">dock.io</a> and purchase your DOCK tokens today.</p>

<p>Digital identity thought leader Kim Cameron´s passion for fundamentally influencing the way we think about, and deal with privacy and digital identity, has brought us where we are today and will endure forever. On 30th November, 2021, Kim passed away after his courageous battle with cancer. We will continue to honor him by living by his ideals that he expressed back in 2005 with his <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/stories/2005/05/13/TheLawsOfIdentity.pdf">7 Laws of identity</a>.</p>
<p>User Control and Consent, Minimal Disclosure for a Constrained Use, Justifiable Parties, Directed Identity, Pluralism of Technologies, Human Integration, Consistent Experience across Contexts -&nbsp; Kim injected his 7 laws of identity into Microsoft´s DNA as their Chief Architect of Identity at a time, when Microsoft was still&nbsp; “under the dark influence of Privacy is Dead”, and transformed that “big complicated place”, as he called it, into a modern and forward-thinking, privacy driven company that is respectful of the rights of individuals and organizations, and has become a strong contributor to the Identity Standards Community.</p>
<p>In his last two years at Microsoft, Kim paved its way into supporting Decentralized Identity as a new and sustainable way to balance privacy and state-of-the-art security. Gaining back more control over his time after leaving Microsoft in 2019, his interest in digital identity was “as keen as ever,” he wrote in an <a href="https://www.identityblog.com/">August 2020 blog post</a>.</p>
<p>Kim attended nearly all the European Identity Conferences (EIC), from the very first one back in 2007, to 2019 and inspired us with his visionary, content-rich yet entertaining keynote talks and panel sessions. Have a look at his 2019 talk about privacy in the platform economy (“<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2019_14_09_cameron">Turning the Web Right Side Up</a>”), his 2018 talk on the “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic2018_06_cameron">7 Laws of Identity on the Blockchain</a>”, his visionary “<a href="https://www.kuppingercole.com/watch/eic15_keynote_cameron">Identity Services 2020</a>” talk at EIC 2015, where he also reflected on 15 years of working together with Jackson Shaw in the same company and cited Berthold Brecht saying “Because things are the way they are, things won´t stay the way they are.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>We all will miss you so much, Kim. Diving with your wife Adele, you and so many friends into the cultural life of Munich while we were there for EIC, enjoying Ingo Maurer´s Light Design Showroom and some delicious Italian food. Farewell, Kim, thank you for your guidance and advice. And thank you for being a friend.</p>

<p>Why offering multiple identity verification options can become a competitive advantage.</p>



<p><a></a>Like everything in life, there is rarely ever one solution that fits all. The same applies to identity verification. Even though automated solutions might offer your customers a fast and convenient way to get verified, some still prefer – or need – human guidance. This gap can be fulfilled with semi-automated processes such as video-based solutions.</p>



<p>Video-based solutions have been used for almost a decade in countries such as Germany, Austria, and Luxembourg. Until very recently, this solution was the only accepted way to perform electronic identity verification for customer onboarding as it provides a higher level of assurance; according to some regulators, it is equivalent to face-to-face verification. Even though automated solutions are becoming available in some of these countries with strict regulations, video-based solutions are still widely used because of their ease of use as well as its efficiency to combat different types of fraud.</p>



<p>Providing options to customers not only protects the financial institution from fraud, but it can also improve customer engagement and conversion rates. It will ensure that the customer does not step away if they cannot go through the process with the primary method of verification, which converts into conversion rates. It will save time from customer success teams having to go into eternal email chains with customers. Most importantly, this will help businesses to demonstrate their efforts to become more inclusive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>IDnow recognises the challenges of having only one method of identity verification. For this reason, IDnow has built a nimble identity verification platform that enables its customer to fulfil their regulatory requirements, combat fraud effectively and increase its conversion rates. All of the verification solutions are available in one joined platform, with one single API integration. </p>



<p>Want to learn more? Listen and watch (<a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/evolution-id-verification-idnow-platform/">Webinar: The evolution of ID verification</a>) our IDnow experts discussing IDnow’s journey from a pure Video-based ID Verification player towards a multi-solution platform provider.</p>



 The right method for each customer and for your business. 



<p>Offering multiple identity verification options provides benefits to both customers and businesses.</p>



<p>On one hand, there might be some customers that for any reason cannot get approved. They might not be tech-savvy or perhaps have other learning disabilities which impedes them to complete the automated verification process. By providing alternative ways to verify themselves makes the process more inclusive and enables more customers to successfully complete the process. Customers feel more comfortable and in control and will also build trust in the institution.</p>



<p>Alternative methods of verification can also be valuable for businesses as the level of assurance can be increased and can help to prevent fraud. For example, a video-based verification can provide a more robust verification compared to an automated solution, as it can prevent more sophisticated fraudulent attacks like money mulling or social engineering attacks. IDnow’s identity platform offers multiple solutions to verify the identity of individuals. Below we present two of these main solutions, VideoIdent and AutoIdent, which can help to start providing the benefits to organisations and we dig into how each of them can serve different customer segments.</p>



<p></p>



 







 <a></a>AutoIdent for a fast and reliable onboarding process. 



<p>I<a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-autoident/">Dnow AutoIdent</a> offers a state-of-the-art automated identity verification leveraging modern AI and machine learning technology. Automated identity verification allows customers to identify themselves on their own, anywhere, anytime, and within just a few minutes.</p>



<p>Because of the automated and self-service onboarding approach, AutoIdent offers high convenience and conversion rates. The convenient user experience and ease of use, makes it popular with young and tech-savvy customers. Especially, customers who have used digital identity verification solutions before are looking for the fastest way to identify themselves.</p>



<p>AutoIdent supports identity documents from 195 countries and is available in over 30 languages. Additionally, more and more regulators are approving automated identity verification methods for due diligence purposes. This enables businesses to onboard customers in a variety of markets.</p>



 



<p></p>







 <a></a>Building a more exclusive and inclusive process with VideoIdent. 



<p>Even though today we live in a digital-first world, some individuals are still seeking personal customer service. That’s where VideoIdent shines. <a href="https://www.idnow.io/products/idnow-videoident/">IDnow VideoIdent</a> offers customers a video-chat-based process, that is guided by one of our many Ident Specialists. VideoIdent not only provides a very tailored experience to customers, but also allows to better serve the elderly and less technology, affine individuals, making the process more inclusive.</p>



<p>With IDnow, you benefit from 15 Ident Centres with hundreds of identity verification and fraud prevention specialists. All of IDnow’s Ident and data centres are located within the European Union to ensure a high level of data protection. Let your customers enjoy multi-language support and 24/7 service availability.</p>



 <a></a><a></a>Optimise your conversion rates and save money with a fallback option. 



<p>Offering a selection of identity verification methods especially comes in handy when a customer is having issues with one of them. In these scenarios, it’s good to have an alternative solution as a fallback option.</p>



<p>For example, a customer might go through the onboarding journey with an automated identity verification method. However, the customer might struggle to navigate the process, and after a few attempts, they are not able to complete it. This can bring two consequences to the organisation: (1) the customer decides to contact the customer service team and ask for their assistance (2) lose the customer as they’ve given up completely.</p>



<p>None of the above consequences are ideal. The first one can represent a huge effort and cost for the organisation as they would require a dedicated team to solve these issues for customers. This can also be a lengthy process as instead of only taking a few minutes to get verified, it might now take days or weeks to be solved – another frustrating point for customers which might lead them to abandon the process.</p>



<p>Having a fallback option like VideoIdent provides instant guidance to customers and can save the organisation’s customer service team valuable time which could be used for other activities. Most importantly, providing options will ensure that customers go through one way of verification or another in only minutes, maximising the overall conversion rate and minimising the cost of verification.</p>

   Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are unique identifiers that enable entities to generate and control their identifiers in the digital&nbsp;world.  Within the SSI community, there are many known DID methods, but most of them require you to have a digital identity wallet 🔒, where you will keep a seed (private key)&nbsp;🔑.

Furthermore, they have to go through the registration process, which will not be intuitive at all&nbsp;times.</p> Nature of Implementation <p>The other shortcoming from an implementation perspective is that issuers can’t issue a <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credential (VC)</a> without knowing the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-is-the-trust-triangle-9a9caf36b321">holder’s DID</a>, which until now, was stored only in a digital wallet. In other words, VCs can’t be issued without a&nbsp;wallet!</p><p>In short, digital wallets are not for everyone, still, they are an essential part of the VC issuance and storage&nbsp;process.</p><p>To enable everyone to get on the <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/web-2-0-vs-web-3-0-a-bridge-between-the-past-and-the-future-c99668c1e2f0">Web 3.0</a> bandwagon, we at Affinidi, decided to use some easy options that don’t require a digital wallet to store a&nbsp;DID.</p> Implementing DID Without a&nbsp;Wallet <p>Before we go into how you can use a DID without a wallet, let’s quickly understand why we need a private key in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p>The simple answer — to prove that you are the owner (holder) of the digital asset (Verifiable Credentials) in question.</p><p>So, how can you prove that you’re the owner without a private&nbsp;key?</p><p>Well, you would&nbsp;need</p>  A unique id for your digital assets&nbsp;(<a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/8-reasons-to-use-verifiable-credentials-300833276b52">VCs</a>).  Proof that you are the owner of that unique&nbsp;id.  <p>And how can you do&nbsp;both?</p><p>With two DID methods — did:email ✉️ and did:phone 📞</p><p>Since both email and phone numbers are currently being used in web 2.0 for authentication, it is a simple way to prove that you are the owner of a VC that has a unique DID. You will get an OTP(One Time Password, which mostly is just random characters) on your email/phone, and sending it back will prove your ownership.</p><p>Also, you will have the DID and will be able to get digital assets with this&nbsp;DID.</p> Advantages of DID&nbsp;Methods <p>The biggest advantage of this method is that it is universal and straightforward and provides the same experience for users as Web&nbsp;2.0.</p><p>The other advantage is that users don’t have to install any additional software and this can work well for users of all technical knowledge and experience.</p><p>Also, issuers (service providers) can issue <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/faqs-on-verifiable-credentials-and-self-sovereign-identity-3c3a505878bc">VCs</a> to their existing clients (holders) without workarounds on how to get their holders’&nbsp;DID.</p> Limitations of DID&nbsp;Methods <p>Of course, these DID methods have some limitations as well. The most important is that the holder has to reveal his or her email/phone number to strangers, and this could be a spot of bother from a privacy standpoint.</p><p>Overall though, these methods are a great alternative to digital wallets and can be a good starting point for newcomers to embrace the world of VCs and web&nbsp;3.0.</p><p>To know about more such interesting things that we do at Affinidi, reach out to us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a>, join our <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v">mailing list</a>, and follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a>.</p><p>The information materials contained in this article are for general information and educational purposes only.

  <p>Kubernetes has become an unavoidable part of a software infrastructure these days. If you are an enterprise or medium/large company, chances are you are already running Kubernetes clusters for your workloads. If you are a DevOps engineer, there is a good chance you are maintaining either an on-prem Kubernetes cluster or a PaaS like Amazon EKS, Microsoft AKS, or GKE. But regardless of how you run your Kubernetes clusters, you need to make sure that they are secure.</p>

<p>The Kubernetes API server has multiple layers of security.</p>

 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/controlling-access/">Transport security</a>: All API communication is done via TLS (transport layer security) using valid certificates. 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/">Authentication</a>: All API requests are authenticated with one of the several authentication mechanisms supported by Kubernetes. 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authorization/">Authorization</a>: All authenticated requests are authorized using one or more of the supported authorization models. 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/">Admission control</a>: All authorized requests, except read/get requests, are validated by admission control modules. 
 

<p>Kubernetes comes with many security options out of the box, but to bulletproof your infrastructure, you need to consider many more security best practices. Today we will look into some of the vital security best practices for Kubernetes.</p>

 1. Use Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 

<p>Kubernetes supports multiple authorization models for its API server. These are <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/abac/">ABAC (Attributed-Based Access Control)</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/">RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/node/">Node authorization</a> and the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/webhook/">Webhook mode</a>. Out of all these, RBAC is the more secure and most widely used and is ideal for enterprises and medium to large organizations. With RBAC, you can define role-based access control that closely resembles your organization’s business rules. RBAC also works great with OIDC authentication.</p>

<p>Most Kubernetes distributions have RBAC enabled by default. You can check this by running the command <code>kubectl cluster-info dump | grep authorization-mode</code>, which should have <code>authorization-mode=RBAC</code> in the output. If not, you can enable it using the <code>--authorization-mode</code> flag for the API server when creating or patching the cluster. For example, setting <code>--authorization-mode=RBAC,Node</code> will enable both RBAC and Node authorization on the cluster.</p>

<p>Once RBAC is enabled, you can create roles (<code>Role</code>/<code>ClusterRole</code>) and bindings (<code>RoleBinding</code>/<code>ClusterRoleBinding</code>) to control access to your resources. Here is an example of a role and role binding that lets users view pods and services.</p>

   <code>apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: fancy-namespace
  name: pod-service-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
  resources: ["pods", "services]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
</code>   

<p>The below binds the above role to a specific group of users.</p>

   <code>apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods-services
  namespace: fancy-namespace
roleRef:
  kind: Role #this must be Role or ClusterRole
  name: pod-service-reader # this must match the name of the Role or ClusterRole you wish to bind to
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
subjects: # subject can be individual users or a group of users. Group is defined in the external authentication service, in this case, an OIDC server
  - kind: Group
    name: k8s-restricted-users
</code>   

 2. Secure the API server with OpenID Connect 

<p>Kubernetes supports many authentication mechanisms. Some of the most common are:</p>

 
   Client certificates 
   Basic authentication 
   Tokens (Service account tokens, Bearer tokens, and so on) 
   <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#openid-connect-tokens">OpenID Connect (OIDC)</a> 
   Proxy 
 

<p>Out of all these authentication mechanisms, OIDC is the most secure and scalable solution. It is ideal for clusters accessed by large teams as it provides a single sign-on solution for all users and makes it easy to onboard and offboard users. It is also way more secure than other mechanisms as you don’t have to store any sensitive information on a user’s computer, like client secrets and passwords. You can also use features like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">MFA</a> and Yubikey if supported by your OIDC provider.</p>

<p></p>

<p>OIDC combined with RBAC becomes necessary as more and more people start accessing the cluster. It becomes essential to create groups and roles and provide limited access to specific groups. You can read more about this in my previous post <a>How to Secure Your Kubernetes Cluster with OpenID Connect and RBAC</a>.</p>

 3. Use Secrets for all sensitive data with appropriate access 

<p>This one should be a no-brainer. Kubernetes has a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret">Secret</a> resource that can be used to store sensitive data. This is a great way to store passwords, keys, and other sensitive data. Secrets can be used for storing string data, docker config, certificates, tokens, files, and so on. Secrets can be mounted as data volumes or exposed as environment variables to be used in containers. Secrets can be plain text or encoded, but please don’t be that person who uses plain text secrets.</p>

<p>Secrets are flexible and native to Kubernetes, so there is no reason for you not to use them. Also, make sure to implement proper RBAC for secrets so that not everyone has access to them.</p>

 4. Keep Kubernetes version up to date 

<p>Like any other software, Kubernetes also has bugs and issues. And from time to time, there might be a high severity bug that calls for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures">CVE</a>. Hence, it’s an excellent idea to keep the Kubernetes version up to date on the server and the CLI client. You can check the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/issues-security/security/">Kubernetes security and disclosure information website</a> to see if there are known security vulnerabilities for your Kubernetes version. If you are using a managed PaaS, it should be pretty easy to upgrade, and for on-prem installations, there are tools like <a href="https://kops.sigs.k8s.io/">kOps</a>, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/">kubeadm</a>, and so on, that makes it easy to upgrade clusters.</p>

 5. Restrict kubelet, API, and SSH access 

<p><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/">kubelet</a> is the primary “node agent” running on each node, and by default, a kubelet’s HTTP endpoints are not secured. This could allow unintended access and hence <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet-authentication-authorization/">should be restricted</a>.</p>

<p>When someone has access to a Kubernetes cluster, they can access the k8s API server and SSH into the cluster nodes themselves. To limit node access, cluster access should be limited as much as possible. Disable SSH access for non-admin users. Secure the API server using OIDC and RBAC, as we saw earlier, so that only authenticated users with sufficient roles can access the API.</p>

 6. Secure container images 

<p>Securing the container images that run on the cluster is as important as securing the cluster itself. A malicious image running on a cluster could wreak havoc. Follow these best practices for container image security.</p>

 
   Do not run containers as root as this would give the container unlimited access to the host. Always run the containers using a non-root user. 
   Enable container image scanning in your CI/CD phase to catch known vulnerabilities using tools like <a href="https://github.com/quay/clair">clair</a> or <a href="https://github.com/anchore/anchore-engine">Anchore</a>. 
   Use minimal up-to-date official base images and remove all unwanted dependencies, packages, and debugging tools from the image as it will make it more secure and lightweight. 
   Prevent loading unwanted kernel modules in the containers. These can be restricted using rules in <code>/etc/modprobe.d/kubernetes-blacklist.conf</code> of the node or by uninstalling the unwanted modules from the node. 
   Use <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_images/">official verified images</a> for popular software. Use a trusted registry for non-official images and always verify the image publisher 
   Use <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker-bench-security">Docker Bench for Security</a> to audit your container images 
   Use <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/">Pod security policies</a> to limit a container’s access to the host further 
 

<p>You can read more about it in our “<a>Container Security: A Developer Guide</a>”.</p>

 7. Control traffic between pods and clusters 

<p>Generally, pods within the same cluster will be able to communicate with each other, and if you have multiple clusters in the same network, there may be traffic between them as well. Do not leave this all open, as it could lead to a compromised cluster when another in the network is affected. Use <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/">Kubernetes network policies</a> to control traffic between pods and clusters and allow only necessary traffic.</p>

 8. Use namespaces to isolate workloads 

<p>Do not run all your workloads in a single namespace. Isolating workloads in different namespaces based on business needs is more secure and easier to manage with RBAC. This way, you can fine-tune RBAC even further to let users access only what they need to see. You can also use Kubernetes network policies to isolate traffic between namespaces where applicable.</p>

 9. Limit resource usages 

<p>As with securing APIs and the cluster itself, it is also essential to set resource limits on how much CPU, memory, and persistent disk space is used by namespaces and resources. This secures your cluster from denial of service attacks when a particular container uses up all the resources. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/resource-quotas/">Resources quotas</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/manage-resources/memory-default-namespace/">limit ranges</a> can be used to set limits at the namespace level, and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/">Requests and limits</a> can be used to set resource limits at container level as well.</p>

 10. Use monitoring tools to monitor all traffic and enable audit logging 

<p>Finally, it is also extremely important to monitor and audit your clusters. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/audit/">Enable audit logging for the cluster</a> and use monitoring tools to keep an eye on the networking traffic to, from and within a cluster. Monitoring can be done using open-source tools, like Prometheus, Grafana, or with proprietary tools.</p>

 Bonus 

<p>Furthermore, keep these infrastructure best practices also in mind when securing your Kubernetes cluster.</p>

 
   Ensure that all communication is done via TLS. 
   Protect etcd with TLS, Firewall, and Encryption and restrict access to it using strong credentials. 
   Set up IAM access policies in a supported environment like a PaaS. 
   <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2021/08/20/how-to-secure-your-kubernetes-control-plane-and-node-components/">Secure the Kubernetes Control Plane</a>. 
   Rotate infrastructure credentials frequently. 
   Restrict cloud metadata API access when running in a PaaS like AWS, Azure, or GCP.

 Podcast transcript 
<p>Let’s Talk About Digital Identity, the podcast connecting identity and business. I am your host, Oscar Santolalla.</p>
<p>Oscar Santolalla: Hello and thanks for joining. And today, we’ll hear insights from the world of hackers. Of course, ethical hacking is what we’re talking about. And we have a very special guest with Linus Kvarnhammar. Linus is an independent cybersecurity consultant and professional hacker. He’s also one of the hackers in the TV series Hackad on the Swedish TV SVT. He has more than 20 years of experience working in the IT industry, where the last 10 years have been spent exclusively doing penetration tests of applications and networks with a few social engineering assignments every now and then.</p>
<p>Hello, Linus.</p>
<p>Linus Kvarnhammar: Hello.</p>
<p>Oscar: Very welcome. It’s nice being with you, Linus. And well, good to hear more about the interesting work you are doing there. So…</p>
<p>Linus: Oh, thank you.</p>
<p>Oscar: Please tell us a bit more about yourself and how was your journey to this world of cybersecurity and hackers.</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah. I- the last 10 years or so, I’ve been doing penetration testing as a security consultant. And yeah, my interest in computers started when I got my Commodore 64, I think it was 1987. And then I had an Amiga. And then I started working with computers directly after school and I’ve been doing that since. I also spent some time, some years doing development work, being a .NET programmer. So a quick bit about my background.</p>
<p>Oscar: You also worked as a developer at some point?</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, yeah. I think my background as a developer, and an IT pro back in the early days, was a good way of getting into security. Because I think, for me, cybersecurity is about knowing how a computer system works and trying to break it, right. So if you know how the application is built, and if you know how operating systems and networks work, then I think you have a good chance of being good at cybersecurity, I think.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. And I can imagine if you have had, since a child you had a computer at home, not many of the ones who are listening to this had that. And yeah, I’m sure you understand. You have time to understand quite well how the computer works exactly as you said and also in your perspective as a developer. So when you were, for instance, a developer, during time you were a developer, you had also this interest in trying to find the vulnerabilities or something that doesn’t work well, you had already this curiosity?</p>
<p>Linus: No, I don’t… Nah, not really, actually. I think I was mostly focused on – focusing on like writing good code for new and upcoming cool technologies. So I didn’t really… I wasn’t really that interested in security when I was a developer, actually. So it was first when I actually got a job at a security company doing development work. So there, as one of the few developers or maybe the only one, I saw what the security consultants were doing. I thought it was really cool that they could like break into systems and networks. It’s like being a thief, but being authorised to make burglaries, but in the cyber domain, I think it was really cool. And so I transitioned to that.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, OK, that’s… yeah, that’s how you found this path. Fantastic. You have just said you have been working at least the last 10 years in penetration testing and these kind of activities. And you recently, you will tell us more, recently you have started to appear in a TV series called Hackad in the Swedish TV, please tell us a bit about that, especially how, yeah, how you were chosen, or, yeah.</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, the TV series firstly is six episodes, and it’s broadcast on the Swedish Public Service television. And it can actually be viewed all over the world. But it’s in Swedish obviously. It’s six episodes with various themes, like private people, celebrities, companies, the smart home, etc. In each episode, we’re hacking different things, and showing what we’re doing and a lot of social engineering as well.</p>
<p>And I was approached by SVT, like maybe a year ago or a year before we started recording. And it was – we started, we recorded a pilot in December last year. And then we recorded the TV series in February, March. And a year approximately before that, I was approached by a person who was like working on developing the programme idea, and he got my name from another security consultant. And I, in turn, gave a few other names of security consultants that I knew were good at their jobs.</p>
<p>And in the beginning, the idea was that they were going to make a TV series about integrity and privacy and big data. So like Facebook, Google, what do they know about us, kind of thing. But me and a lot of other security consultants, I think told them that we can hack stuff. That’s what we do. And that’s pretty cool as well. I think they turned their attention or the focus of the TV series more, or not more, completely towards hacking things, both hacking private people and hacking companies.</p>
<p>In the pilot in December, we didn’t get any preparation, we were three people. And we showed up at a hotel and they said, “Hack this hotel.” And we went at it. We opened doors to try to find network connections, we attacked the WiFi, we did everything we could, but then eventually, we realised that this hotel is just one computer in the lobby, and the rest of the building is like a shared office space. So we failed miserably. But actually, for some reason, the pilot was, it turned out well anyway. And the managers at SVT they decided they wanted it so they ordered it and the production started two months later.</p>
<p>Oscar: Sounds super cool. And definitely, I watched some of the – some of the episode even though I don’t understand Swedish, but yes, it looked great, very interesting.</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, actually, Jinny, one of the hackers in the TV series, she did an awesome job at actually translating all the episodes. So you can find <a href="https://hackad-english.blogspot.com/2021/11/hackad-tv-2021-english-subtitles.html">English subtitles</a> for the episodes out there.</p>
<p>Oscar: Oh, it’s already…</p>
<p>Linus: Yes.</p>
<p>Oscar: Wow. I have to come back and watch then.</p>
<p>Linus: I can provide you with <a href="https://hackad-english.blogspot.com/2021/11/hackad-tv-2021-english-subtitles.html">the link</a> where you can actually watch the streaming – but streaming from SVT and then adding English subtitles on top of it, it’s possible.</p>
<p>Oscar: OK, perfect. We’re going to share that information so everybody can watch them. Fantastic. All right, excellent. And, as you say, at least in this series, it’s super visual when someone says OK, you can hack a person, it’s a celebrity, big profile company, can have machines, particularly machines, and yeah, it’s super wide how you can be hacked. Let’s bring the attention a bit on identity, which is the main thing we talked about in this podcast. We know that identity is, of course, quite connected to security. What do you think are the biggest problems related to identity that you find or you have been finding through your work as a security consultant?</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, there are obviously a lot of technical issues that can be connected to identity authentication more. But on a higher-level identity I’m thinking, a thing I have been talking with clients about recently is this issue of government issued identification – because when you log into a generic application, you can usually say, you can provide whatever identity. You can make up your name, you can make up your– you can register any Gmail or any email address. But what about these applications where you need to prove your real identity, like public service applications?</p>
<p>I think that’s something I don’t think we’ve solved in our business like, is it… what/ how do we identify to as like me with my social security number to an application? In Sweden, we have something called mobile BankID. In other countries, they have similar but is that something we can require or expect every user to have? I think that’s a problem. I’m not sure it’s the biggest problem we have but it is a problem. Because some people might say that, “Well, my mobile BankID that’s my private ID and I don’t want to share that with my employer, for instance.</p>
<p>That’s probably something that needs to be solved. Like, we have a standard way of identifying a person in real life – passport, driver’s license, national identity card. But as far as I’m aware, we don’t have one that is universally accepted both by the individual and companies. Do you have any take on that?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it’s true. As you said, in Sweden there is a solution, I think it works pretty well. In a few other countries there’s something similar. But yeah, in the vast majority of countries, there’s no – first of all, there’s no global, as you say, there’s not something universal. And such solutions as the Swedish BankID is not present in most countries.</p>
<p>Linus: Exactly. And I was talking to a customer yesterday about like drivers in a company and the drivers, like kind of taxi drivers, they need to prove their identity when they start the car, or start like a device inside the car. And the best way of proving their identity would be mobile BankID. But then the question comes up, like can we really require that everyone has a mobile BankID, which is a personal identification? I’m not sure. And I guess that’s more of a legal aspect, I guess, than cybersecurity. But it is interesting nonetheless.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it is a good question definitely. Do some places, like as you give this concrete example of a driver authenticating so to say, to a car? Yes. What is a reasonable way?</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, exactly. Because if you don’t use that kind of identification, let’s say you use a regular login, register and login like you do online, then you would have drivers running around with nicknames as authentication. Or, if it’s username and password, yeah, what makes it not the case that you share your username and password with another driver. So, as far as the public authority is concerned, one guy is driving, but actually it was another guy. So he may be his subcontractor that’s driving – his contract to another guy, and he just shared his login.</p>
<p>Oscar: Oh, yeah, actually that’s a very good observation, because in some of those cases, like driving a taxi or a bus, yeah, there should be more security into how the personnel identifies himself there.</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, exactly. Imagine if the real bus driver was sitting at home watching TV, and then his brother, who wasn’t a bus driver, he was logging into the bus and driving it around. That wouldn’t be very good from a public safety standpoint.</p>
<p>And I guess these challenges are coming more and more as we have digitalising society more and more. Because if now, this is a fictitious example, but when you get your bus in the old way, or probably the current way, then you go somewhere, and you maybe show your ID at the gate, and you get your key, and then you sit down in the bus. But let’s say you digitalise all that, then you need government-issued or government approved digital identification to prove your identity. And then we have BankID, but can we expect everyone to use that? Or is that perhaps not legal? I’m not sure. I think it’s an interesting question. That would be more important as we go further into the digitalisation of the society.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, yeah it is. Yeah. So what else have you found related to identity on those activities? Obviously, I know that in the TV series already, you are hacking some person’s identity for instance, right? So what is typical? What situation is typical to find?</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, I would… if you have only a password, so if you divide up like, it’s interesting to think of passwords as something you know, like a phone, something you have, and then your eye or your fingerprint as something you are. Let’s say you only have one factor, the password. Then we have a long list of different issues that can occur. And one of the most common ones that we abuse in the TV series is that users typically share passwords or use the same password on many sites. And then it’s enough that one of those sites is hacked and the database leaks. So I have terabyte of leaked databases on my computer, which I can search.</p>
<p>So that’s one of the first and most easy ways to do if you want to get into someone’s account, you search for their email address, and see what password they’ve been using previously, in other applications, and you try out those, that’s one.</p>
<p>Another one is that if I give my password to you, or to your application, then you have the password. And then if I share that password with another site, then you, with your application, can know my password and try it on other applications. That’s also I mean, a fundamental issue.</p>
<p>And then you have everything with password resets and password policies, there are loads of technical security issues that you can find. And it’s in applications that we penetration test. I think it’s our job to push the clients or we’d like to push them to increase security. So we often like add requirements as time progresses, up the requirement on password length, for instance.</p>
<p>But then, with multi-factor authentication, it’s interesting as well, because I think a lot of people think that if I have two-factor authentication, I have my SMS codes, for instance, I’m fine. Nothing can happen. Well, I think it’s, you’re way much better off compared to someone who doesn’t have it. But when it comes to the security of the application, then it becomes really important to secure this session. Because if you’re – once you are authenticated, there’s something proving that you continuously can access the application right – and that’s typically a session cookie or JWT token. And if someone can steal that, they have stolen your login without you actually giving up your password and the two-factor authentication code.</p>
<p>A good example of that I did an assessment years back of a medical application for the everyday person in the society. And they were logging on with BankID. So that worked really solid well. But then they had a vulnerability in the web application that disclosed the error log. And then the error log were errors from all the other users. And in the error log was also their session cookie. So if I looked at their log, and waited for another user to trigger some error in the application, their session cookie would be logged, and I could see it. And then I could take that cookie, put it into my browser, and boom! Now I’m logged in as them.</p>
<p>See, I think it’s a good example of how you think a web application that requires mobile BankID is like 100% secure, but it’s actually not if it has these kinds of vulnerabilities. So there are a lot of things to test with regards to session management, like cookies and stuff like that, where it can go wrong.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, that’s on the application side, right, the application that is right after you authenticate.</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and I’ve found vulnerabilities around 2FA, two-factor authentication as well, like, let’s say you implement it, and it’s working perfectly. It’s just that when you guess, or when you enter your 2FA code, you can do it unlimited amount of times. And often the 2-factor code is four to six digits and if you can guess that in a high speed, and there will never be anything that prevents you from guessing further, you can potentially guess the right code.</p>
<p>Oscar: So you have you have done that. You have managed to…</p>
<p>Linus: I have done that. Yes. Yes, absolutely. And also backup codes – so sometimes you have two-factor authentication code, but then you have a backup code in case you lose your device and you are supposed to write down the backup code. If the backup code, that basically becomes a password. So it must be strong enough to stand against, I guess. But I’ve seen backup codes that are weak. So if they’re weak enough for you to be able to guess it, and perhaps you can guess indefinitely, and as long as you don’t have an application that detects this – detects and/or blocks, then maybe I can guess for weeks. That’s some examples of technical vulnerabilities that can affect I mean, high security authentication mechanisms. I mean, seemingly high as in two-factor authentication.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. So you were able to hack most of two-factor authentication methods.</p>
<p>Linus: Not most, not most. Some, some only.</p>
<p>Oscar: The weakest ones. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: &nbsp;Like, for instance, ah, typical is the SMS OTP?</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah.</p>
<p>Oscar: &nbsp;Yeah, that’s one of the weakest, yeah. Just guessing and guessing and you find out the…</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, exactly. If you’ve not implemented it properly in the backend, I mean, in the application. And obviously, a problem with two-factor authentication via SMS is also that the code is actually displayed on the locked phone, typically.</p>
<p>Let’s say you and me work in the same office and I’ve searched database dumps online and found your password in one of them and I try it out and I get confirmation that the password works, but you have two-factor authentication connected to your phone, then probably I’ll just wait until you leave your phone. And most people don’t leave their phone. But if you leave your phone to go to the toilet or something, I can login and just look at your phone, enter the code into the web application and get in.</p>
<p>Oscar: The phone is locked but it shows them, yeah.</p>
<p>Linus: Exactly. Yeah, it shows at least the first line of the SMS, it will typically show.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, very, very interesting, of course.</p>
<p>Linus: And I guess you probably talked or maybe you talked about SIM swapping attack. Have you done that?</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, tell us more if – what you have found out.</p>
<p>Linus: That’s another problem with SMS as a two – second factor is, you’re basically relying on your cell phone provider to not give anyone else your phone number. So you’ve outsourced your security to your mobile phone provider. So if someone and this has been done, it’s been written about online. If someone managed to go to the phone store and convinced them or over the phone, convinced them that they are you, get a new SIM card for your phone number, then for a brief period of time until you notice it, they will have access to your phone number. But during that window, they can log in as you.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Linus: And it could be even the case that if you do issue a password reset, some applications will have a password reset functionality that only requires the user to have the phone available. So in that case, you don’t even need the password. You just have to do a password reset and confirm that you know you have the right number and then you’re in. That makes other types of two-factor solutions like a mobile app much, much better.</p>
<p>Oscar: And how often still this SIM swapping done nowadays?</p>
<p>Linus: I’m not so sure about that. I don’t have any updated data or news on that. It was long time since I heard about it. But it is, I mean, the principle is that you’re relying on your mobile phone provider. So it’s – in that sense, it will always be a viable attack. It will always be dependent upon them keeping your phone number secure.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, it is definitely. And this is where mostly the attack is with the social engineering, correct?</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, I would say so. But it’s not unreasonable in more sophisticated scenarios that you have an insider. So, if you look at these mobile phone shops, it’s typically young people that work there, they probably don’t have that much pay, so if you go to them, one of them, maybe take the one who’s mostly the least moral and the biggest amount of cash need, and you give them 1,000 Euro, maybe 10,000 Euro, I don’t know, they might be able to issue you on a new SIM card for that number.</p>
<p>And then that’s the cost of getting into that account. So if you have – if you consider you as, I mean, if you value your security high, maybe you are a person with additional requirements for some reason, or security, maybe this should be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, I can see that’s still a big threat. Yeah, absolutely, I guess.</p>
<p>Linus: I would expect the future to show us more cases of buying insider access and stuff like that, especially ransomware gangs, nowadays, they have so much money. So it’s not unreasonable for them to pay these kinds of amounts, I think for insider access.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah. Well, especially like a big target, right? Not unlike like a normal person but yeah, the big target.</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, exactly. But let’s say you work at a big company, but you’re a regular person. If it’s enough to take over your account to get VPN access into this big company, that can then be ransomwared, then you are actually a pretty normal person. But your access is worth a lot to a ransomware gang.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. So they gave a bigger target than the company that we get. Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Linus: It’s like, sometimes, you say you can hear people saying I think it’s valid, like the, one of the best key chains to get hold of is the cleaner in an office because he can access everything. I mean, if you want to pay someone to do something for you, he has access to everything. And he’s walking around the office space when everyone is not there. So it’s him or her as a person. It’s not a high value target but the access they have is high value.</p>
<p>Oscar: Something I remember now when we had a chat with you a few weeks ago before this interview is that, you show us on the on the TV series, I think you hacked one person, I don’t remember what you hacked exactly – either Facebook or some password. And because of that, thanks to the – well the single sign-on, for instance – by accessing one of these services, you were able to access many other services.</p>
<p>Linus: Yep, that’s right. And that’s – I think that’s episode one where we hack a private person’s Facebook account and then we can show him and the viewers that we had access to, I don’t know, 10, 20 applications, because he was using Facebook to authenticate to these applications.</p>
<p>That’s – I mean, that’s the nice thing with single sign-on, as in a Windows, typical Windows network but it’s also the downside. So in a Windows network, if you get hold of the identity of one person, you get access to all the resources this person has access to. So it’s, yeah, both pros and cons with that.</p>
<p>I understand why people use Google and Facebook to authenticate. And you have a lot of, what do you say, pros with that because you don’t have to manage a bunch of different websites or passwords. I mean, and you only need to trust that Google or Facebook is doing the authentication right. So there is a lot of good things with that. But then you should really keep that password and that account closely guarded. Because if you lose that it’s yeah, you have a lot of problems.</p>
<p>Oscar: Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it’s important to be aware of that. So the users see the benefits, the process you said, but also take it – yeah, keep it very secure, especially if it’s a main account, like Google or Facebook could be it’s a gate to other services as well.</p>
<p>In the side of, for instance, this case, we’re talking about authorisation because we are authorising via your access from Google, for instance, to some access to other applications. When you have, for instance, were able to hack some systems, bypass the authentication, have you found that the weaknesses in the authorisation that the systems are not properly configured or even designed to, to define well the authorisation of a user?</p>
<p>Linus: I think that’s one of the most common vulnerabilities we see because it’s complex. It’s typically more complex to get this right than other things. So an application typically has many, many different endpoints to get information, to change information, to add information. And every one of these needs to be configured properly usually in code. Like to access this endpoint, you need to be this role and this role. And it’s easy to miss that, to forget one or more of those, or configure them wrong. Maybe that’s one that should require a more strict role than another one. So I think the complexity there is working against developers. And we often see some mistakes in this area.</p>
<p>Oscar: And the mistakes goes more or both into designing the system and also configuring right, maybe in both, I think.</p>
<p>Linus: I would say it’s mostly implementing it, because when you design it, you can say that, well, the admin page should only be accessed by admins – administrators, for instance. But that requires that every admin action then is implemented such that it will deny a regular user access. So it’s up to the programmers often to do the right work to get this right.</p>
<p>And then it’s good to understand that, at least from my perspective, two main different types of access control mechanisms. It’s on a functional level, like role-based, you should have access to this area and not this. So let’s say you’re a regular user, you should not be able to access the admin page, or admin functionality. And then there’s an object-based, so I should be able to read my messages, not yours. And the latter one is typically the most difficult to get right because it might be that it’s built further down in deeper layers of the application where you need to actually check that the object that you’re trying to read and return is actually belonging to this user. That’s a typical vulnerability we find.</p>
<p>It’s actually something often pretty easy to test for regular people. If you’re browsing the web, and you– or you’re logged in somewhere and you’re maybe reading messages, downloading files, and you see the URL that has a number there, try changing the number to something else. And if you get someone else’s message, then maybe you committed a crime, I’m not sure. But at least you can report it to the company.</p>
<p>I did that for – you can say I can anonymise it a little bit, but privately I got, like I said, I got a certain kind of license, so I interacted with one government page. So I logged in, and I accessed like my test results on this license. And then I could see easily in the URL that there was a number there. So I just changed that number to another number, and I got someone else’s test results. And then I put that into a script. And I downloaded probably like 10,000 test results. And obviously I contacted them, found out who was responsible and told them about this, and they fixed it immediately. And they were really thankful. But it turned out that this database contains test results from I think back to the ‘90s.</p>
<p>Oscar: Did your service to the…</p>
<p>Linus: Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Oscar: …to the community. Fantastic. Yeah, it’s excellent that the power of people like you that have this amazing technical expertise and can help not only specific companies, but also to everybody like to the whole country, the whole community. Fantastic.</p>
 
 Super interesting hearing your stories and everything we have in here. And please, final question we’d like to ask you is for all business leaders, decision makers who are listening to this, what is the one actionable idea that they should write on their agendas today? 
 
<p>Linus: Business leaders should be aware of the risks that they are having. So if they are not talking to the IT department, IT manager or CISO, if they are not talking to them, asking them like what risks do we have? Are we doing – are we assessing security? Then they should do that, because otherwise, the risk is that security is something that is handled below like far down in the organisation. And then this need for budget and time and everything that is needed to invest in security is not getting addressed at the top.</p>
<p>So if the leaders asked their subordinates, “Tell me about the risks we are having.” and they – then they need to get these reports. And that’s I think, how you – how it should start, not start but if you know what I mean. I think typically or in many organisations, security is not addressed at the top. So it should be considered an investment in your company, in your solutions, not just a cost.</p>
<p>Oscar: Exactly. Yeah, I could not agree more with that. Thanks a lot Linus for this very interesting conversation. It’s been a pleasure. Let me know if people would like to see your work or get in touch with you, what are the best ways?</p>
<p>Linus: I think <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kvarnhammar/">LinkedIn</a> is the best. That’s where I’m pretty active. I answer messages and yeah, I publish some stuff there every now and then.</p>
<p>Oscar: Great. And of course, do watch the TV series Hackad on the Swedish TV, which I’m going to put the link on this episode. Again, thank you, Linus, what a pleasure talking with you and all the best.</p>
<p>Linus: Thank you very much.</p>

 GiD Report#188 — Square’s web3 identity ambitions <p>Welcome to The GiD Report, a weekly newsletter that covers GlobaliD team and partner news, market perspectives, and industry analysis. Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-186-what-is-web3-155d493ac6c5">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>ICYMI: <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/episode-14-what-we-learned-at-solana-breakpoint-331ce5c0341f">EPISODE 14 — What we learned at Solana Breakpoint</a></p><p>This week:</p>  Square’s web3&nbsp;vision  A world full of credentials  Chart of the week — 90s internet&nbsp;edition  Stuff happens   1. Square’s web3&nbsp;vision <p>First, they <a href="https://tbd54566975.ghost.io/introducing-tbdex/">published a white paper</a>, as per <a href="https://twitter.com/TBD54566975/status/1461791639308050443">their cheeky tweet</a> (via <a href="https://global.id/j">/j</a> and <a href="https://global.id/gregkidd">/gregkidd</a>):</p><p>The paper was <a href="https://github.com/TBDev-54566975/white-paper">also published to Github</a> (in case you want to contribute).</p><p>For context, TBD is a new division within Square focused on non-custodial and decentralized financial offerings.</p><p>The white paper’s vision is similarly straightforward — essentially a decentralized exchange with built in social trust (AKA identity). From the abstract:</p><blockquote>The tbDEX protocol facilitates decentralized networks of exchange between assets by providing a framework for establishing social trust, utilizing decentralized identity (DID) and verifiable credentials (VCs) to establish the provenance of identity in the real&nbsp;world.</blockquote><p>For the world of self-sovereign identity, Square’s entrance into the arena will be huge when it comes to the promotion of open, interoperable, and privacy preserving standards such as decentralized identity and verifiable credentials.</p><p>As GlobaliD co-founder and CTO Mitja Simcic&nbsp;noted:</p><blockquote>Most interesting bit is that unlike traditional DEXs, Square doesn’t plan to use a trustless model, like atomic swaps, and instead uses decentralized identity and verifiable credentials</blockquote><p>As <a href="https://tbd54566975.ghost.io/introducing-tbdex/">their blog post explains</a>, this was a natural solution.The real world, both social and economic, is still based on the notion of identity — not merely the ownership of cryptographic keys. In order to build those bridges, building trust and identity into decentralized frameworks is an inherent requirement. There’s also the question of regulations and compliance:</p><blockquote>This means that such exchanges of value must necessarily be based on other means of governing social trust. Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) provide part of the solution by enabling verifiable digital identities that facilitate trustworthy exchanges between counterparties. But the main benefits are lost if the DID method is not implemented in an open, permissionless, and censorship resistant manner.</blockquote><blockquote>We propose a solution that does not rely on a federation to control permission or access to the network; nor does it dictate the level of trust required between counterparties. There is no governance token. Instead, the tbDEX protocol allows participants to negotiate trust directly with each other — or mutually and voluntarily rely on trusted third-parties to vouch for the counterparty. Transaction costs are ultimately driven by risk. At maximum anonymity, transaction costs will necessarily be higher; at maximum disclosure, they should be lower. This approach to price discovery allows the marketplace to find the right&nbsp;balance.</blockquote><blockquote>The tbDEX protocol also facilitates the secure exchange of the minimum necessary identity information acceptable to counterparties in order to satisfy requirements, be they legal, regulatory, or related to any other consideration of risk. The protocol itself neither collects nor records any personally identifiable information.</blockquote><p>So there you have&nbsp;it.</p><p>It may or may not have been a coincidence that Jack Dorsey <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1465347002426867720">resigned as Twitter CEO</a> this morning. We know that ideas of web3 have been percolating in Jack for some time. Back in December of 2019, he <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106">announced what would become Bluesky</a>, an initiative to develop a decentralized social media protocol. We haven’t heard much&nbsp;since.</p><p>But dreams of a decentralized future continued. In August, Jack announced their latest plan — <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1431320761474617344">develop a decentralized Bitcoin exchange</a>. This latest white paper is the culmination of that&nbsp;journey.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://tbd54566975.ghost.io/introducing-tbdex/">introducing tbDEX</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/19/square-releases-white-paper-detailing-protocol-for-a-decentralized-bitcoin-exchange/">Square Releases White Paper Detailing Protocol for a Decentralized Bitcoin&nbsp;Exchange</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/jack-dorsey-step-down-twitter-ceo-4051d42c-567b-468b-917d-11de1d7264f6.html">Jack Dorsey stepping down as Twitter&nbsp;CEO</a>   2. A world full of credentials Image: iStock/gremlin<p>If you build it, they will come. (And we’re thrilled that Square is joining the party when it comes to the building&nbsp;part.)</p><p>Adam Davidson <a href="https://adamd.mirror.xyz/tap-94pfnB_WvMT6W8odoYe5xiMD00WDFNouTytEHN0">illustrates what a web3 identity world might look like</a> when it comes to hiring (or in same cases, already is) — H/T <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-11-23/american-express-sold-some-tax-deductions">Matt Levine’s excellent Money Stuff</a> (via GlobaliD COO&nbsp;<a href="https://global.id/rcb">/rcb</a>):</p><blockquote>But resumes are, typically, works of creative aspirational fiction. With web3, people can share tokens showing someone’s crucial role on a project. This happens, now, on DAOs (more on those here), blockchain-based communities. I spend a lot of time at the Bankless DAO, where it is just a routine part of the daily flow for people to send tokens of gratitude to those who have been helpful in some project or other. People who attend meetings, get a POAP, a token of attendance. So, you can see at a glance if someone is an active member or an occasional lurker. Every day, people send “tips” of tokens of gratitude to others. One person giving a particularly helpful colleague a tip often leads to an avalanche of others doing the same. (Come to think of it, I really haven’t gotten a lot of tips. I should up my&nbsp;game.)</blockquote><blockquote>As web3 becomes more ubiquitous (as I expect it to), younger employees will ask their bosses and co-workers and, eventually, demand of them that they implement this kind of in-real-time, collaborative credentialing.</blockquote><blockquote>Similarly, people can build up a collection of immutable tokens showing the conferences they attended, the courses they took, the skills they proved, the books they read, the creators they supported.</blockquote><blockquote>I expect it to become routine — first among younger people in more technical fields — that recruitment will involve looking at someone’s blockchain-backed identity to see a richer picture of the person’s background. If a candidate with an unpromising resume can demonstrate an unusually large number of these Gold Star tokens — in which former bosses and colleagues sent digital expressions of gratitude — from their past, you might overlook the fact that they didn’t, quite, graduate college. Alternatively, if someone with pristine credentials has a dearth of such expressions of gratitude, you might look at them more critically.</blockquote><p>Combining that with token issuance for specific projects:</p><blockquote>If you want to achieve some quick result — design an app, create a conference, build a new kind of bicycle, whatever — that you couldn’t do on your own, you typically have to spend a ton of time and resources NOT doing the thing you care about. You probably need to hire people, which means you need to raise money, which means you need a business plan and have to spend most of your time pitching.&nbsp;…</blockquote><blockquote>With web3, you could announce your goal publicly. People who are interested will reach out. You can quickly see what they’ve done (see above) and choose the team that meets your requirements. You can create a coin or token and distribute it among the team members. You can have a system that grants more of these coins when someone is recognized by the rest of the team for a helpful contribution. Ownership, then, will be dynamic and will reflect real activity.</blockquote><blockquote>When the thing you all are building launches, the profits can be distributed through the coin system, and the people who added the most value will get the most&nbsp;reward.</blockquote><p>As Matt points out, “the potential future [Davidson] describes is both intriguing and also horrifying.”</p><p>Which is par for the course when it comes to technological innovation and tools — it’s always a double edged&nbsp;sword.</p><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://adamd.mirror.xyz/tap-94pfnB_WvMT6W8odoYe5xiMD00WDFNouTytEHN0">Real world problems that web3 could solve — at least for me — Mirror</a>  <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/right-clickers-vs-the-monkey-jpg">Right-clickers vs. the monkey JPG&nbsp;owners</a>  <a href="https://society.robinsloan.com/archive/notes-on-web3/">Notes on&nbsp;Web3</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/web3-blockchain-battle-soul-new-web-7a3515f4-808e-4c17-a93d-439fdfee134c.html">What Web3 is and why everyone is talking about&nbsp;it</a>  <a href="https://blockworks.co/how-to-explain-web3-to-your-grandma-this-thanksgiving/">How to Explain Web3 to Your Grandma This Thanksgiving — Blockworks</a>   3.

 Introduction: <p>The team at Ocean is thrilled to announce that <a href="https://www.neworder.network/">New Order </a>and <a href="https://reflexer.finance/">Reflexer Labs</a> will launch H2O, an $OCEAN backed, non-pegged stable asset. It’s based on the RAI stable asset by Reflexer Labs. Like RAI, it is decentralized, permissionless, and minimizes governance.</p><p>New Order DAO is driving this initiative. They are a community-driven venture DAO incubator for decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. H2O will be available on New Order’s DeFi marketplace with strong benefits for the Ocean ecosystem, especially Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p> What is&nbsp;H2O? <p>Stable crypto assets help attract would-be users of Web3 applications who have shied away from cryptocurrency due to excessive volatility. They are growing in popularity with their market surging past <a href="https://charts.coinmetrics.io/network-data/#313">$100&nbsp;billion</a>.</p><p>The H2O non-pegged stable asset is a friendly fork of RAI. Whereas RAI uses ether (ETH) as its asset for collateral, H2O uses OCEAN. The price of H2O is managed by an algorithm that rebalances to bring the redemption price close to the market price and participants are incentivized to aid in this process. Traditional stable assets are pegged to a price such as 1 USD. In contrast, RAI (and soon H2O) are free-floating but typically settle around a price; for RAI this has been&nbsp;~$3.</p><p>The (un)governing token of the protocol will be AQUA. This token helps manage the initial parameters of the protocol, bootstrap ecosystem development, and incentivize the liquidity of the protocol. AQUA token emissions will be done fairly, with portions earmarked for the Ocean community.</p><p>The H2O token will bring two near-term benefits to the Ocean ecosystem.</p><p>First, OCEAN holders will be able to stake OCEAN in order to mint H2O tokens, similar to how ETH is staked to mint DAI or RAI. The OCEAN stakers can earn based on staking. Second, Ocean Market users are exposed to lower volatility data prices. Ocean Market is a decentralized data market powered by Ocean Protocol, which has been live since fall 2020. In it, people use $OCEAN to buy, sell, and stake in the OCEAN token. This adds liquidity to the Ocean ecosystem whilst generating demand for $OCEAN. With the launch of H2O, Ocean Market (V4) users will be able to price tokens and stake in data pools with H2O. Therefore, data prices do not fluctuate the way they would with changes in the price of $OCEAN. (Users will still have the option to use $OCEAN). This reduces the risk and increases the potential upside for Ocean Market&nbsp;users.</p> H2O Launch and Tokenomics <p>The project is overseen and executed by the New Order DAO which is a new permissionless incubation DAO, generating long-term value by building and launching early-stage financial protocols, applications, tools, and infrastructure. The DAO launches and supports projects across many layer one ecosystems, and explores DeFi &amp; NFT markets surrounding new digital asset&nbsp;classes.</p><p>H2O is currently in the final stages of the initial deployment. Its official mainnet deployment will be lined up with the release of the Ocean V4. Expected to ship in Q1 2022, Ocean V4 includes Data NFTs and resolves rug pull challenges. Then, there will be work for support of H2O in Ocean&nbsp;Market.</p><p>The distribution of the AQUA un-governance token is planned to occur over 18 months via staking contracts. This includes 2.45% to single-sided FLX staking, 2.45% to FLX/ETH Uniswap V2 LP, 2.1% to RAI Curve LP (subject to change to Reflexer’s liquidity plans). Some AQUA will be distributed directly to the Ocean community.</p><p>Visit<a href="https://oceanprotocol.com/"> oceanprotocol.com</a> to find out&nbsp;more.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/oceanprotocol">Twitter</a> |<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ocean-protocol/"> LinkedIn</a> |<a href="https://blockfolio.com/coin/OCEAN_3"> Blockfolio</a> |<a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/"> Blog</a> |<a href="https://www.youtube.com/oceanprotocol"> YouTube</a> |<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oceanprotocol/"> Reddit</a> |<a href="https://t.me/oceanprotocol_community"> Telegram</a> |<a href="https://discord.com/invite/TnXjkR5">&nbsp;Discord</a></p> <p><a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/stable-asset-h2o-backed-by-ocean-is-launched-by-new-order-together-with-reflexer-labs-91d3a29efb21">Stable asset H2O backed by $OCEAN is launched by New Order together with Reflexer Labs</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.oceanprotocol.com">Ocean Protocol</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>Building trust within an NFT community is tough. The NFT world is rife with scam stories about bots, rug pulls and bad actors, making it hard for buyers to trust good projects. Even worse, there are only limited tools available to combat these threats.</p>



<p>That’s why we’re proud to present an innovative suite of tools as an end-to-end solution that takes every step of the NFT lifecycle into account, helping creators prove authorship, protect their mints against bots, build more reliable communities, and create members-only experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Creators can get started immediately by verifying their identities, pseudonymous-identities, and projects — they may simply go to our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/MWmhXauJw8">Discord server</a> to get verified through our new automated Civic Pass portal. With Civic Pass, creators are also able to confirm that participants are legitimate buyers, not bots. And coming soon, creators will also be able to verify that community members in their Discord servers hold certain NFTs in their wallet. This feature will allow creators to offer members-only experiences.</p>



<p>Our goal is to make the process of building trust easier and more effective for creators. With that in mind, we’re sharing an overview of our plan to address the pain points of creators and marketplaces in the NFT space using identity tools.</p>



  
<p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Build trust: Get verified by Civic</p>



<p>The first step for NFT teams or creators is to get verified with the Verified by Civic Pass program.</p>



<p>Our NFT identity verification process includes biometric liveness checks, KYC and sanctions screening, Twitter handles and ownership of project websites. Once completed, Civic will announce that creators have been fully verified. This helps establish trust with potential buyers and community members. <a href="https://www.civic.com/solutions/verified-by-civic-pass/">We’ve verified over a dozen projects</a>, and we’ll have more product developments in this area in 2022.</p>
  



  
<p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Issue your NFT collection: Defeat bots and create member whitelists</p>



<p>Coming soon, Civic Pass will be integrated with Metaplex’s Candy Machine and Fair Launch Protocol (FLP), the leading Solana protocols for minting, to add on-chain real-person verification. <a href="https://docs.civic.com/candy-machine-and-ignite-pass-setup/how-to-protect-nft-mints-from-bots">Civic Pass TokenGuard</a> is fully compatible with Metaplex’s Token Metadata standard, so tokens remain fully compatible with wallets and secondary marketplaces. Creators can use Civic Pass TokenGuard to confirm that mint participants are legitimate buyers, not bots.</p>



<p>Freedom and security shouldn’t just be limited to creators, so Civic is creating a Discord bot to keep the community spaces fair and secure by providing industry-leading whitelisting tools. Our Discord bot will offer a standardized process, including a liveness check, for verifying participants within the Discord community.&nbsp;</p>
  



  
<p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Create members-only experiences and gated experiences for DAOs</p>



<p>Soon, we will be enabling gated, members-only experiences with proof of NFT ownership. Using Civic Pass, community members will be able to enter Discord servers by holding certain NFTs in their wallets. And, the same NFT in combination with Civic Pass will enable a related decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to prove that members meet its requirements. With these tools, community members can start shaping communities that feel more meaningful.&nbsp;</p>
  



<p>We are excited to offer these tools to the NFT and DeFi communities because we believe identity verification is vital to safeguarding digital assets as they become more widely adopted.</p>



<p>Our <a href="https://docs.civic.com/">Developer Hub</a> is a great place for developers to start integrating Civic’s NFT solutions into their projects.<a href="https://twitter.com/civickey"> </a>And, verifying upcoming NFT drops and mints is <a href="https://discord.com/invite/MWmhXauJw8">easily started on Discord</a>.&nbsp;</p>

 <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/us-federal-regulators-clarify-joint-approach-to-cryptoasset-regulation" title="">  </a> 
     
<p>🇺🇸&nbsp; US Federal Regulators Clarify Joint Approach to Cryptoasset Regulation</p> 
<p>In early November,<a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/the-fatf-releases-its-revised-virtual-asset-guidance"> we noted</a> that the chairwoman of the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Jelena McWilliams, made remarks on cryptoasset regulation and had previewed a collaboration with the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on this issue. On November 23rd, the three regulatory agencies<a href="https://www.fdic.gov/news/press-releases/2021/pr21096a.pdf"> released a statement</a> outlining their approach and plans to provide greater clarity on banks’ ability to offer crypto-asset related services.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The cross-agency statement details the main focus points of the “policy sprints” it conducted:</p> 
  
   <p>Developing a commonly understood vocabulary using consistent terms regarding the use of crypto-assets by banking organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>   
   <p>Identifying and assessing key risks, including those related to safety and soundness, consumer protection, and compliance, and considering legal permissibility related to potential crypto-asset activities conducted by banking organizations.</p>   
   <p>Analyzing the applicability of existing regulations and guidance and identifying areas that may benefit from additional clarification.</p>   
  
<p>Based upon the above activities undertaken during the policy sprints, the agencies have identified five core activities in the cryptoasset space which may be of interest to banks:</p> 
  
   <p>Cryptoasset custody.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>   
   <p>Facilitation of customer purchases and sales of cryptoassets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>   
   <p>Loans collateralized by cryptoassets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>   
   <p>Activities involving payments, including stablecoins.</p>   
   <p>Activities that may result in the holding of crypto-assets on a banking organization’s balance sheet.</p>   
  
<p>Throughout 2022, the agencies will work to give clarity on the legality of banks to provide cryptoasset services to consumers. According to their statement, the Fed, FDIC and OCC are especially interested in considering the regulatory implications of:</p> 
  
   <p>Crypto-asset safekeeping and traditional custody services.</p>   
   <p>Ancillary custody services.</p>   
   <p>Facilitation of customer purchases and sales of crypto-assets.</p>   
   <p>Loans collateralized by crypto-assets.</p>   
   <p>Issuance and distribution of stablecoins.</p>   
   <p>Activities involving the holding of crypto-assets on the balance sheet.</p>   
  
<p>Additionally, the statement indicates that, “The authorities will also evaluate the applicability of capital and liquidity requirements and liaise on this subject with international and intergovernmental organizations.”</p> 
<p>While the joint agency statement falls far short of providing actual regulatory guidance on any of these topics, it offers an important signal about where these agencies will be focusing attention over the coming months. Greater regulatory clarity on these topics will only boost the confidence and ability of banks to harness opportunities in the cryptoasset space, and will further spur banks to accelerate their offerings of related products and services.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>In a related move, also on November 18th, the OCC released<a href="https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2021/int1179.pdf"> a new interpretive letter</a> clarifying the obligations of banks when launching cryptoasset services. Previously the OCC had clarified in guidance issued during the tenure of former<a href="https://www.elliptic.co/webinars-events/financial-regulator-crypto-coffee-webinar-series-with-brian-brooks-occ"> Acting Comptroller Brian Brooks</a> that banks can provide&nbsp;<a href="https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2020/int1170.pdf">custody services for cryptoassets</a>,<a href="https://www.occ.gov/topics/charters-and-licensing/interpretations-and-actions/2020/int1172.pdf"> hold reserves for stablecoin issuers</a>, and engage in other<a href="https://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2021/nr-occ-2021-2a.pdf"> blockchain and stablecoin-related activities</a>.</p> 
<p>According to its new interpretive letter, the OCC still asserts that banks have the authority to carry out these activities, but with an important caveat: they must now seek and obtain a non-objection letter from bank supervisors before engaging in those activities. As part of that process, according to the OCC, a bank needs to demonstrate “that it has controls in place to conduct the activity in a safe and sound manner . . . including, but not limited to, operational risk (eg, the risks related to new, evolving technologies, the risk of hacking, fraud, and theft, and third party risk management), liquidity risk, strategic risk, and compliance risk (including but not limited to compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act, anti-money laundering, sanctions requirements, and consumer protection laws).”</p> 
<p>Hence, banks do not have an unfettered green light to engage in cryptoasset activities without regulatory permission,&nbsp; as some may have interpreted the earlier interpretive letters. Rather, they’ve been given more of a flashing amber light: they need to put compliance and risk management considerations front of mind before launching cryptoasset products and services, and need to satisfy their regulators they have done so.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Some observers may interpret this new clarification as likely to set back the<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=elliptic+crypto+banking+convergence&amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enGB955GB955&amp;oq=elliptic+crypto+banking+convergence&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l4.4028j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"> crypto-banking convergence</a> already underway. However, at Elliptic we believe that an emphasis on clarifying compliance and risk management considerations upfront will in fact ultimately nurture greater financial institution adoption of cryptoassets.&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Financial institutions are already highly sensitive to regulatory and compliance risks they could encounter in the process of launching cryptoasset services — and a lack of regulatory clarity can sometimes be a hindrance to them doing so. By providing a framework for banks to approach and discuss these issues with their supervisors prior to launching cryptoasset services, the OCC is letting banks know there is a pathway to offering these services in a sound and compliant manner.&nbsp;</p>

It reminds Dutch businesses that under the Sanctions Act 1977 “the assets of individuals and legal entities on a sanctions list must be frozen and no financial services may be provided to such individuals and legal entities.”&nbsp;</p> 
<p>To that end, cryptoasset businesses must take measures to identify "anyone involved in a financial service or a financial transaction." This includes screening a transaction, whether inbound or outbound from the business’ perspective, to identify any counterparties and beneficiaries involved. If the identity of a counterparty is unknown then cryptoasset business must, at the minimum, verify that their wallet address is not sanctioned. The regulator states that compliance teams are responsible for putting in place the appropriate measures to complete these checks in accordance with their business model and risk exposure. This is in line with the <a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Updated-Guidance-VA-VASP.pdf">Financial Action Task Force’s risk-based approach guidance</a> on virtual assets.</p>

<p>🇪🇺 EU Council Adopts Digital Finance Proposals&nbsp;</p> 
<p>On November 24th 2021, the <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/11/24/digital-finance-package-council-reaches-agreement-on-mica-and-dora/?utm_source=dsms-auto&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Digital+finance+package%3a+Council+reaches+agreement+on+MiCA+and+DORA">Council of the European Union adopted the proposals</a> for the “Regulation on Markets in Crypto Assets” (MiCA) and the “Digital Operational Resilience Act’ (DORA). This adoption paves the way for European legislators to negotiate the details of this framework and reach an agreement with the European Parliament. Both proposals are part of the European digital finance package to ensure competitive, innovative and digitally-resilient financial markets. <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-11053-2020-INIT/en/pdf">MiCA</a> will create a regulatory framework tailored to cryptoassets and related activities, with sweeping provisions that will impact stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi) token issuers, and other emerging technologies in the cryptoasset space. On top of this, the <a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-11051-2020-INIT/en/pdf">DORA</a> sets new rules on cybersecurity for the financial sector to prevent and mitigate the impact of cyber attacks. Elliptic will provide ongoing regulatory updates on these measures as negotiations begin.</p>

<p>🇪🇺&nbsp; ECB Details Tailored Payment System Oversight Framework for Cryptoassets</p> 
<p>On November 22nd 2021, the European Central Bank (ECB)<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2021/html/ecb.pr211122~381857cdfe.en.html"> approved a new oversight framework to regulate electronic payments</a>. The electronic payment instruments, schemes and arrangements (PISA) framework is targeted at the governance bodies of electronic payment schemes with the safety and efficiency of payment systems in mind. It supports governance bodies by providing an<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/pdf/consultations/ecb.PISApublicconsultation202111_2.en.pdf"> assessment methodology</a> to define functions and arrangements of the electronic payment ecosystem. The PISA framework includes cryptoassets and related services. The methodology details the applicability of 24 principles ranging from legal basis to liquidity risk. The Eurosystem’s national central banks have the responsibility to implement measures which will meet the framework’s expectations. Companies that fall under the<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/pol/activ/systems/html/index.en.html"> Eurosystem oversight of payment systems</a> are expected to adhere to the PISA principles by November 15th 2022.</p>

<p>Online scams have seen a huge surge in the past year, with a reported number of identity thefts and digital fraud rising by 25.07% in 2021, compared to 2020, according to TransUnion.</p>



<p></p>



<p>As our community may be aware, we have recently been targeted by scammers impersonating us, and offering ShareToken in exchange for your seed phrases, and personal security information. Although not an uncommon circumstance within our industry, we would like to take this opportunity to remind our users about their digital safety, and what triggers to look for when identifying a potential scammer.</p>



<p>Imposter scams will mimic anything that entices you to engage with them. This could be the likeness of a company, such as ShareRing, to the impersonation of social media challenges such as that on Instagram, where participants are asked to share their personal information in response to a question on their stories.</p>



<p></p>



<p>A key characteristic of a scam is usually associated with unusual payment requests such as making a direct bank transfer, often with urgency. This is one of the most prevalent methods used. Scams tend to manipulate emotion by also impersonating authority from government officials to family members. To keep your privacy safe, here are three tips you should always keep in mind:</p>



  Never disclose passwords and seed phrases  



<p>Be alert while sharing your personal information. Do not save your credit/ debit card or personal details on a website. It is suggested to secure your privacy by using a code on every app &amp; never provide any seed phrase, code or passcode to anyone.&nbsp;</p>



  &nbsp;Be careful of fake websites.  



<p>Always head to the official websites or accounts. Many accounts mirror the official websites and may disguise themselves with very similar URLs (G00gle.com) or redirect people to unofficial payment links. Always check the domain name to see whether there is an “s” in the URL, E. g. “https://”, or a lock on the address bar.&nbsp;</p>



  &nbsp;Avoid unknown caller or text messages.&nbsp;  



<p>Do not respond to text messages or missed calls from unknown numbers. Never provide any personal details, security numbers, passwords and any personal identification to suspicious callers. If you receive emails with links and attachments, do not click on them to avoid phishing scams.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This series of blogs is prompted by the UK Government’s proposed reforms of data protection law contained in its consultation paper Data: A New Direction. The stated intention of these proposals is to unleash a new ‘golden age’ of innovation and growth. But the real effect of these reforms would be&nbsp;to:</p>  Under the banner of tackling ‘consent fatigue’, abolish citizens’ right to consent to the collection and use of their data: achieved by expanding the definition of organisations’ ‘legitimate interests’ (where they don’t have to seek consent) to cover almost every activity they would wish to undertake, thereby rendering consent irrelevant.  Under the banner of helping organisations access more data for the purposes of research and innovation, abolish the core principle upon which data protection regulations have been built: that personal data should only be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. The Government’s proposals would do this by making ‘further processing’ of citizens’ data legal in so many additional circumstances (‘legitimate interests’, use in ‘research’, for AI, to improve ‘data sharing’, etc) that the core principle is rendered irrelevant.  <p>These proposals represent the biggest attack on citizen rights seen in this country for generations. They would <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/the-uk-governments-plan-to-reform-data-protection-laws-are-terrifying/">make new Cambridge Analyticas legal</a>, and would put UK citizens’ data up for sale in global markets — the stated goal being to “secure the UK’s status as a global hub for the free and responsible flow of personal data” (where ‘responsible’ is never defined in over 50,000 words of argumentation, but where the door is opened to ‘irresponsible’ uses of data many times&nbsp;over).</p><p>This blog series explores the many mistaken assumptions that lie behind this disastrous initiative. The innovation and growth that Government promises its reforms will bring are a fantasy. They will not unleash a new ‘golden age’ they are based on deep misunderstandings of what makes data valuable in the first place and how to unleash this value. This, first, blog in the series looks at why data is valuable.</p> Where data’s value comes&nbsp;from <p>Given all the fuss that’s made about data, you’d think everyone would have an immediate answer to this question. But when you ask it strange things&nbsp;happen.</p><p>Some people immediately go off on a tangent, talking about how much money is being made out of data. But this begs the question: why are people prepared to pay so much for it? Others repeat catchphrases such as ‘data is the new oil’. Very soon people are embroiled in arguments about whether data is, or is not, ‘like oil’ — while the original question gets forgotten.</p><p>But the answer to this question matters, because it will inform all the policies and strategies that follow. If you get it wrong (as the UK Government is currently doing with their proposals to ‘reform’ data protection regulations ) you risk wasting huge amounts of time, money and effort chasing rainbows, while missing the opportunities that really&nbsp;matter.</p> Reliability and&nbsp;Surprise <p>So why is data valuable? Because of two things. Reliability and Surprise.</p><p>Reliability If we know a fact to be true, we can act on it without incurring the risks (and costs) of making a mistake. If the data you are working with is unreliable — if you don’t know if it is true or not — any decisions or actions you take on the basis of it risks being wrong. One of three things then&nbsp;happens.</p>  You don’t dare making the decision or taking the action, in which case lots of things that could happen&nbsp;don’t.  You make a wrong decision or take a wrong action and then have to incur the costs of cleaning up the&nbsp;mess.  You invest significant amounts of time, money and effort trying to improve the reliability of your data (often paying external agencies exorbitant fees to confirm basic facts), so that you avoid the costs and lost opportunities of the first&nbsp;two.  <p>Across the economy today, individuals’ and service providers’ inability to access and use the right, reliable data when and where they need it is a major cause of unnecessary cost and waste, fraud and of missed opportunities.</p><p>This lack of access to the right reliable data has deep structural causes. Usually somebody, somewhere has generated or checked that a piece of information is correct — that is indeed reliable. But because our data economy is currently organisation-centric (that is, organised around hundreds of different, isolated, separate data silos run by different, separate organisations), this data remains inaccessible.</p><p>What’s needed is a new personal data logistics infrastructure which enables individuals to get hold of certified data about themselves (verified attributes) and to share this data, under their control, as and when they need to. If such infrastructure were put in place, everyone would have access to reliable data when they need it, and everyone would be able to eliminate the friction, effort, risk and cost that pile up when it’s not available.</p><p>We estimate that over 95% of all data processing activities undertaken by British services providers in the private, public and third sectors (e.g. banking, insurance, retail, utilities, media and communication, local and central Government public administration, education, health, transportation, leisure, charities, etc) relate to the collection and use of data for the purposes of service provision: primarily administrative activities that depend on the availability of reliable&nbsp;data.</p><p>Yet nowhere in the 50,000-plus words of of the UK Government’s Data: A New Direction consultation does it even come close to recognising this fact. Which means its entire ‘data strategy’ is already missing the most fundamental point.</p> Surprise <p>The second reason why data can be valuable is the opposite of the first: it can surprise you by telling you something you didn’t know. It’s data as ‘surprise’ that helps people and organisations keep abreast of a fast changing&nbsp;world.</p><p>Data as ‘surprise’ is what fuels research and those innovations that are driven by insight into peoples’ behaviours. It’s a great thing. But we have to keep it in perspective. By definition, innovations are exceptions to the rule — the rule being the administration of existing services. And once an innovative product or service has been created to realise its value, it needs to be delivered to people, which requires the reliable data that drives these processes. In this situation, data’s two aspects of reliability and surprise work together, with ‘reliability’ still ensuring the actual delivery of value. For the ‘surprise’ side of data to generate value, the ‘reliability’ aspect is essential.</p><p>That’s why we say that at least 95% of data’s value comes from reliability. But unfortunately, as we’ve noted above, the UK Government’s proposed data protection reforms focus entirely on research and innovation: the 5%. A classic case of the tail wagging the&nbsp;dog.</p> Mixtures of reliability and&nbsp;surprise <p>Even though they are like chalk and cheese, often the biggest value is generated by mixing reliability and surprise. For surprises to be valuable they need to be reliable: fake news can be a very dangerous thing, Some things can be surprisingly reliable as we’ll see when we discuss artificial intelligence in a later&nbsp;blog.</p><p>Other things are ‘reliably surprising’: by which we are confronted by new information that changes what we do, but where the sorts of new information and the sorts of changes that result are part of a routine&nbsp;process.</p><p>Take your daily commute to work. You know exactly where you are going, what the route is, how long it should take, and so on. And yet, every journey you make is full of little surprises — little bits of new information that you need to respond to. A traffic light turns red. A child looks like they might run out into the road. A car suddenly turns right in front of you. In each case, you know how to deal with the situation. It’s happened many times before. But on each occasion, you still have to deal with the ‘surprise’.</p><p>In modern economies, a huge range of important value-adding activities fall into this category of managing ‘reliable surprises’. Take the health service which is largely organised around the management of ‘reliable surprises’: common ailments with well known symptoms and treatments but where, on each occasion, a diagnosis is still needed and a resulting set of actions planned and implemented.</p><p>Likewise financial services when deciding whether or not to give someone a loan or assessing an insurance risk, or public administrators deciding whether an individual is entitled to a benefit or service. And so on. A huge amount of the data that’s collected and used in our society today is devoted to the efficient management of such ‘reliable surprises’.</p> Implications <p>Talking about reliability and surprise as we’ve done here may seem simple and obvious. In a sense it is. But its implications are profound.</p><p>Practically speaking, for the full potential of data to be realised, individuals and service providers need to be able to access and use the right reliable data at the right time, on a mass scale. For this, we need new infrastructure. Just as the industrial age needed a national electricity grid to unleash electricity’s potential, so we need a new data ‘grid’ — a data logistics infrastructure that gets the right reliable data to (and from) the right people and places at the right&nbsp;times.</p><p>That’s what we at Mydex are working on — personal data logistics infrastructure that puts citizens at the heart of the process, including them in the workings of society and economy. The Scottish Government has begun to realise this with its decision to create its <a href="https://digitalscot.net/courses/digital-government/lessons/digital-identity/topic/digital-identity-scotland-scottish-attribute-provider-service/">Scottish Attribute Provider Service</a>. SAPS enables organisations to share verified (reliable data about their citizens) with the citizen so citizens, in turn, can share this data when and where they need to gain access to other services and eradicate things like form filling, delays and improve access, inclusion and outcomes.</p><p>Some of the work the UK Government is doing around personal data — its Identity and Attribute Trust Framework for example — has truly positive potential. But this Consultation and these proposals? Oh dear! They misunderstand where the real value of data lies and rely instead on a mythological narrative promoted mainly by Silicon Valley lobbyists. The <a href="https://medium.com/mydex/five-myths-about-data-innovation-and-growth-e966b94496cf">next post in this series</a> turns to this narrative.</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/mydex/why-is-data-valuable-59bd63e1a09f">Why is data valuable?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/mydex">Mydex</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

<p>by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-terbu/">Oliver Terbu</a> (<a href="https://mesh.xyz/">ConsenSys Mesh</a>), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alen-horvat-0418b551/">Alen Horvat</a> (<a href="https://www.aceblock.com/">AceBlock</a>)</p> Introduction <p>With <a href="https://ipfs.io/">InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)</a> the Web3 community has established a critical piece of infrastructure that is used by the majority of web3 protocols to different degrees. <a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> is part of the <a href="https://ipfs.io">IPFS</a> stack and is used for the underlying peer-to-peer network for discovery, routing and data exchange. Peers in the network can dial other peers in the network to exchange messages using various transports, like QUIC, TCP, WebSocket, and Bluetooth. Modular design of the <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> framework enables it to build drivers for other transports. Peers can run on any device, as a cloud service, mobile application or in the browser and talk to each other as long as they are connected through the same <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a>&nbsp;network.</p><p>A peer in a <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> network is identified through its <a href="https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/peer-id/">peer identity (peer ID</a>). A peer ID is essentially derived from the public key (hash) of the peer’s key pair which can change over time, specifically when keys are rotated or revoked. For that reason, peer IDs are insufficient for building a stable fully-decentralized messaging framework. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">W3C Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)</a>, on the other hand, were designed to support key rotation while keeping a stable identifier. Hence, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> should be used as the more permanent public identifier for peers in the network, which would hold information about the peer IDs, <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> network and supported protocols. Peers would still use their peer ID for <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> routing and authentication. Alice and Bob would exchange their <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> out of band and will be able to find their counterparty’s peer ID via their <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>. In this way, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> acts as an indirection layer for the peer ID, thus allowing Alice and Bob to change their peer ID for practical reasons without the need to notify each&nbsp;other.</p><blockquote>Note: A <a href="https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/peer-id/">peer ID</a> is a term defined by libp2p and is not the same as a <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">peer DID</a> although a <a href="https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/peer-id/">peer ID</a> can also be used with a <a href="https://identity.foundation/peer-did-method-spec/">peer DID</a> by following the approach described in this&nbsp;article.</blockquote><p><a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> is a modular system of protocols and specifications for building P2P applications. It can be also used to build P2P messaging applications. although messaging through <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> has limitations. Peers in the network are usually not always online, especially if Bob is travelling a lot, lives in an area with limited connectivity, is actually an intelligent car, or has a monthly limit with his mobile data plan. When Alice wants to send Bob a message and Bob is not online, then the likelihood of Bob eventually receiving the message reduces dramatically. DIF <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> solves this problem by defining mediator nodes that can run in high-availability mode. Those mediators can act as Alice and Bob’s mailboxes where both use DID authentication to receive the latest messages from their mediators. Instead of associating Bob’s peer ID with his <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a>, Bob would associate his mediator’s peer ID with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a>, so Alice would dial-up Bob’s mailbox through the <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> network and first forward the message to the mediator. <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> ensures that only Bob can decrypt the message and that Bob can verify Alice authenticated the message through authenticated encryption (authcrypt). Additional trust, security and access management can be added through <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a> that counteract spam and&nbsp;fraud.</p><p>This article explains how two parties, Alice and Bob, can securely communicate using <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> through a <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> network, where discovery, security and trust are rooted in Decentralized Identity technologies. First, we present how Alice and Bob prepare and exchange information about their peers, next we describe how peers establish secure P2P connections, and last we present DIDComm message exchange via the channels. We assume you are familiar with <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VCs</a>. If you are not, check out <a href="https://identity.foundation/faq/">DIF FAQ</a> for a great&nbsp;intro.</p> Exchanging information <p>To start messaging, Alice and Bob must exchange information about their peers and mediators. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> help to establish a trusted Decentralized Identity layer for the peers, where peers can always find the latest information about the active mediators, peer IDs, authentication, and encryption keys. This enables mutual peer authentication and end-to-end stream encryption. We use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> service property to manage and share peer information as presented below.</p>DIDComm Messaging service section using libp2p transport<p>Thus Alice and Bob need to exchange their <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> out-of-band and clients will be able to discover, authenticate and connect. The design is applicable to almost all <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a>&nbsp;methods.</p> Establishing secure&nbsp;streams <p>Now that Alice and Bob exchanged information about their peers, the peers establish authenticated and end-to-end encrypted P2P streams. If at least one of the peers has public endpoints or supports NAT transversal, peers can connect directly. Since most services are behind firewalls or don’t have public endpoints, P2P connection can be established only via relay or proxy nodes. These nodes either help with the NAT traversal or simply relay all the traffic. <a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> has full support for relay nodes that can be hosted by anyone, i.e. self-hosted or hosted by a 3rd party provider. Furthermore, every client can select which relay node(s) can be used to establish a connection with it and every new connection can be established via different nodes. Such an open design enables us to build a fully decentralized mesh of relay&nbsp;nodes.</p><p>After discovery, peers mutually authenticate. Authentication can be performed using peer IDs or any other <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> authentication key(s). <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> ensure that keys are valid (not revoked) and are linked to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a>. Modular design enables plug in various mutual authentication protocols, like mutual TLS. After a successful mutual authentication, the streams are end-to-end encrypted either using TLSv1.3 or Noise Protocol, both supporting perfect forward secrecy. Note that other encryption protocols or frameworks can be plugged in. Only allow-listed peers, i.e., <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> of Alice or Bob registered with their clients, are allowed to open a stream. <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">W3C Verifiable Credentials</a> (VC) can be used to define more granular identity and access management policies.</p><p><a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> supports establishing a connection on the network levels, like QUIC, TCP/UDP, WebSocket, client authentication and traffic encryption. <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> is introduced on top of <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> to fill-in the missing messaging capabilities.</p> Messaging <p><a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> (aka DIDComm V2) provides a secure, private communication methodology built atop the decentralized design of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>. Version 1 of DIDComm was specified in the HyperLedger (HL) Aries project as a set of HL Aries RFCs. With governance and further development moved to DIF, the goal was to specify one core specification for <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging </a>that addresses previously defined gaps and achieve better development experience. In particular V2 relies on better formalized methods, simpler message structures, has no requirement for DID exchange, treats ephemeral and full mode in the same way and has explicit support for all <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> methods. Another goal was to address requirements beyond the HL Aries community.</p><p>In <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> trust is rooted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>. Atop <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> defines a set of methodologies to send messages between <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> or more specifically their agents. Messages can be extended through specific <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> protocols. At a glance, <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> entails the following:</p>  Defines a data model for a common plaintext messages structure i.e. headers,&nbsp;body.  JOSE-based authn and encryption between <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> with repudiation by&nbsp;default.  Defines a methodology for <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> rotation.  Defines a methodology for (onion-)routing for various network architectures.  Defines core protocols such as invitations and feature discovery.  Defines core transport protocols for HTTP(S) and WebSockets.  Defines an extensibility model for adding new sub-protocols (e.g., VC Exchange) and new transports (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a>).  <p>The following diagram shows the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> mental&nbsp;model.</p>DIDComm Messaging Mental&nbsp;Model<p>Typically, if Alice wants to send a message to Bob, Bob sends Alice an explicit invitation or Bob gives her his public <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> (implicit invitation through Bob’s <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID Document</a>). Alice would then extract the service endpoint and recipient/routing keys from the invitation and can start sending messages to Bob. The first message could already contain a <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> protocol message, since Alice can encrypt the message to Bob. After Bob receives the message, Bob can create a new <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> for Alice and indicate the change through <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID</a> rotation.</p><p><a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> is transport-agnostic and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DID Documents</a> can be extended to support various transport mechanisms. The community developed approaches for HTTP(S) and WebSockets primarily, other transports such as Bluetooth are also under development.</p> Putting all&nbsp;together <p><a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> running on top of a <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> overlay network enables us to build a next generation decentralized messaging framework. <a href="https://libp2p.io/">Libp2p</a> enables establishing secure connections between peers regardless of their transport and IP properties (public, local, static, dynamic). Once peers establish secure connections with the help of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a>, they can authenticate (DID Authentication) and exchange <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> protocol messages. Using a <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> overlay network doesn’t require any changes to the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> protocol as <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> clients can support multiple messaging protocols and multiple different <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> networks (private or public) — it can work via existing public IPFS network, private <a href="https://www.aceblock.com/">AceBlock</a> network, and others. Layered architecture and clear separation of the P2P network from the messaging protocols, in our case <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a>, enables us to design and develop the P2P network and <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> independently. Namely, the libP2P network doesn’t need to know anything about the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> and vice versa. Using such a setup, anyone can build edge agents and mediator nodes. Maintenance of such a P2P network is inexpensive. It is built using open source components.</p><p>The proposed solution&nbsp;supports</p>  direct communication (both clients have public&nbsp;IPs)  indirect communication (communication is relayed via <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> relay nodes; messages can be relayed via random relay nodes or pre-defined ones)  synchronous message exchange (if both clients are&nbsp;online)  asynchronous message exchange via mediator nodes (if one of the clients is&nbsp;offline)  Sending Messages through DIDComm Messaging and&nbsp;libp2p Conclusion and&nbsp;outlook <p>We outlined the next generation decentralized messaging solution built on top of <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">DIDs</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">VCs</a> and a <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> overlay network. We presented how Alice and Bob establish a connection, exchange messages and demonstrated what connection types are supported.</p><p>We are currently working to demonstrate different setups and scenarios (using <a href="https://veramo.io/">Veramo</a> and <a href="https://www.aceblock.com/">AceBlock</a> <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> client), we are adding <a href="https://libp2p.io/">libp2p</a> transport to the <a href="https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/">DIDComm Messaging</a> specs and are working on the full framework design.</p><p>Stay tuned for more updates and j<a href="https://discord.gg/Er4E5xRdPj">oin our Discord</a> if you want to get involved!</p> <p><a href="https://medium.com/uport/didcomm-messaging-through-libp2p-cffe0f06a062">DIDComm Messaging through libp2p</a> was originally published in <a href="https://medium.com/uport">uPort</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

				  Accelerate your decentralized identity skills with two free Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries workshops  
			  
				
				
				 <p><a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy">Hyperledger Indy</a> and <a href="https://www.hyperledger.org/use/aries">Hyperledger Aries</a> are two of the popular open source repositories that can help propel development of decentralised identity products and services. Aries is a toolbox of several blockchain-agnostic repositories that allow for trusted online peer-to-peer interactions based on decentralized identities and verifiable credentials. The project grew out of work that was happening in Indy to create technologies for managing decentralized identity. Aries was moved to graduated status by the TSC in February 2021. Indy graduated in 2019 and provides a specific blockchain purpose-built for identity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeing the growth in interest for these two projects, Hyperledger Foundation has partnered with member company <a href="https://indicio.tech/">Indicio</a> and its team of deeply experienced developers and architects to develop this free, multi-course curriculum to help developers and architects gain a deeper understanding of decentralized identity, with a deep dive into Aries and Indy. Registration and preparation information can be found on this <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/events/Workshops">Workshops page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These two four-hour, beginning level, hands-on workshops provide opportunities to install and run the Indy and Aries components just like you would if you were making a real Indy-based network or Aries-based application. They introduce the necessary Git repos as well as how to use the Indy Command Line Interface (Indy CLI), run the Aries toolbox and create and issue a verifiable credential. They also introduce some current projects using Aries and Indy to help you accelerate your understanding of decentralized identity and build the skills necessary to successfully make changes to the underlying code with hands-on guidance to develop your own projects.</p>

This is particularly challenging when working in the cloud, as well as having customers, employees and other external sources accessing applications remotely and with multiple devices. Multiple devices mean more access points to manage which create a higher risk to your business.

<p>As the world moves towards digitization, financial institutions are looking to adopt identity verification solutions that verify and validate in near real time the identity of the customer.</p>
<p>The UAE Central Bank along with the Securities and Commodities Authority, Dubai Financial Services Authority, and the Abu Dhabi Global Market Financial Services Regulatory Authority recently issued guidelines for those financial institutions adopting such technologies. Within these guidelines, the UAE governing authorities have approved the usage of facial verification to identify banking customers at the time of onboarding.</p>
<p>This growing trend of regulatory approved biometric solutions that rely on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to onboard clients is spreading across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. And with the rise of cybercrime – cyber-attacks occurring every 11 seconds, regulators and authorities looking to solutions that are in compliant with the highest security standards.</p>
<p>IDnow, a leading expert for digital identities and identity verification welcomes these new guidelines. With extensive expertise serving Germany’s and Switzerland’s highly regulated markets, IDnow has always focused on striking a balance between security and user experience.</p>
<p>IDnow’s regulatory affairs team is part of several regulatory working groups like ETSI, FIDO Alliance, W3C, and Hyperledger and consults authorities worldwide that are working on digital identity verification and authentication standards.</p>
<p>Being an expert has allowed IDnow to develop financial regulatory compliant products, notably, BankIdent. This completely AML-compliant online identification solution utilizes the users’ current online bank account to create an easy and secure identity verification service that effortlessly combines technology with existing identity and banking data. All that is required of the user is a valid photo ID, an active online bank account, and valid login credentials.</p>
<p>In addition, IDnow is looking closely into the latest developments around digital identity wallets in Europe and, is supporting different expert- and working groups with their expertise. The new law will allow people to have their official documents, such as their drivers’ license or ID card in one central place on their smartphone with easy access to it and, the assurance that their information is securely stored.</p>
<p>Looking to the future, IDnow is expanding its global footprint. It recently opened two offices in the United Kingdom and one in the United Arab Emirates and is also looking to set up a call centre in the Middle East to comply with regional data residency laws.</p>
<p>This benefits every party involved in the process, from making consumers’ lives easier, to reducing waiting times and increasing conversion rates, while keeping a high level of security.</p>

<p>2021 saw a diverse range of events in which Jolocom could participate in. From debates about the future of seIf-sovereign identity (SSI) to the role of trust in the age of AI (Artificial Intelligence) – there were many important take-home messages and ways for us to contribute in discussions. A brief overview of the events we participated in in 2021 also offers a good insight into our goals, values, and projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>February 2021&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jolocom took part in a virtual meeting of the International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA) back in February. Also included: the position paper of the organization, which was published in 2020: “Decentralized Identity: What’s at Stake?”. One of the founding principles of Jolocom is the mission to promote the establishment and maintenance of standards in our industry. We were therefore very pleased that Kai led the discussion as an active board member of INATBA and as co-chair of the organization’s Identity Working Group. Together with four stakeholders, he discussed the current role of decentralized identities and how they should shape in the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keryl Folwer from Transmute, Anil John, Director of the Silicon Valley Innovation Program, Dr. Loretta Anania, Research Associate at GD Connect of the European Commission, and Daniel Du Seuil, Belgian Project Leader for Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) formed the discussion group.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The position paper was drawn up by INATBA with the aim of defining the expectations of an open and innovative market in a decentralized identity. It analyzes the current status of SSI developments and opens discussions about the next steps, makes demands on the most important stakeholder groups and sets goals for the future of SSI. Kai asked about the first reactions of the participants to the content of the paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Karyl highlighted the role and importance of interoperability. Interoperability is the ability to interact with different systems. If two systems are compatible with each other, they are also called interoperable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anil, in turn, spoke out against a “techno-utopianism of a self-sovereign identity”, but made it clear that he believes in personal freedom of choice and control. This is also supported by Jolocom and is one of our basic standards. Using a digital self-sovereign identity (SSI), we are always working on being able to manage the control and security of their own data independently for the individual.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Loretta praised the European Commission’s plan to make the next decade a double transition, with green and digital going into everything. She argued that it is good and important to be there now, at the beginning, especially when the standards are being set. Founded in 2014, Jolocom is very committed to the development of SSI standards. We are always working on building more trust in a decentralized network and protecting the digital autonomy of our own data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Daniel saw SSI as the answer to the new demand for a European digital ID. If the European digital ID is about empowerment, data protection and new models of data sovereignty, it must be technology-neutral. In the end, says Daniël, the question is always the same: How can we empower citizens?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The discussion between the participants was very lively and underlined, despite different opinions and backgrounds, common values. There was agreement on the increasing importance of digital decentralization, which can be described as a global trend. Furthermore, everyone agreed that this is an interesting time. Both industry and the public sector are more interested in decentralized identities and what they can offer them. Jolocom agreed with the general opinion that working together can also create interoperability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>May 2021&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2019, Jolocom has been a partner to three out of four winning teams in the German innovation competition for setting up Secure Digital Identites (SDI) projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the DWeb Meetup in May 2021, Jolocom was invited to explain its role at ONCE, ID-Ideal and SDIKA in more detail, which Kai Wagner did as our representative. His key message was: The challenges that lie ahead of us also offer great opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The four projects must be harmonized with EU directives, W3C and the global community in general; this requires coherent concepts and an interoperability infrastructure. SSI and decentralized identities are booming: that’s why it is important to keep pace with market dynamics. The DWeb community can benefit greatly from the projects; However, this requires a coherent infrastructure and uniform concepts. In this way, as many EU citizens as possible are reached, who then get the chance to manage their identity independently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kai also presented the background to the projects and their goal. The digital identity card is officially on the market, but it is only actively used by 0.5% of the population. Kai pointed out that Germany does not have a leading role in the field of digital identities. At the end of 2019, four projects were then selected to address these problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>October 2021&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The topic of “digital identities” is also more up-to-date than ever, especially driven by the corona pandemic and the associated increasing digitization in almost all areas of life. The online event “Digital Identity” of the BFM (Business Research Center) also took place on October 20, 2021 under this topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>During a lively discussion, the main topics were data security, dealing with skeptics and the costs of a wallet. The group of experts included Irene Adamski as a representative for Jolocom, as well as Fabiane Völter as a research assistant at the University of Bayreuth, Thomas Ruch as the person responsible for credit management at BAUR GmbH and Boris Lingl as Head of Blockchain at DATEV, who tried to answer questions from the audience .&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Above all, Irene presented the idea of a wallet and presented SSI as a global trend, which is, however, still a developing market in Germany. Therefore, the questions about the costs of a wallet could not be answered specifically, but it could still be said with certainty: There are no costs for the end user. In addition, the use of a wallet should be voluntary. However, EU citizens must be able to have a wallet made available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Therefore the term of a transition period came up, which can definitely be expected. Data security is always in the hands of the user. In the event of a request to identify something, they can select and deselect which information they want to share or even reject it completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your own data is encrypted on your own wallet. You only pull out the information that you want to share.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>November 2021&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also in dealing with the future of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Irene presented the role of SSI as a possible solution. The specialist conference “Trust in the Age of AI-Supported Bots and Fakes: Challenges and Possible Solutions‘ on November 4th included some keynote speeches on the topics of fake reviews, deep fakes, and possible solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Exciting examples of the use of artificial intelligence in everyday life make it clear that this is a global trend. At this lively conference, the dark side of AI was also highlighted. Identity theft, manipulation of politics, dissemination of pornographic content … dangers that arise from AI cannot be ruled out and lead to growing distrust in the digital space. How is this to be dealt with?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is where the role of SSI comes into play. It is one of Jolocom’s basic principles to maintain and protect the autonomy of citizens. Irene was happy to explain this in more detail.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The basic idea: control your own data. Broken down: selectively choose who has access to his and her data and reject who should not have access. This is well expressed when using a digital wallet: I can prove that I am over 18 years old without having to share my personal date of birth. This selective transfer of data also brings more trust in the digital space with it. A secure wallet provides the opportunity to retain and protect autonomy over your own data in the early days of AI and automated bots.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<p>2021 once again underlined the importance of of SSI is and how it is widely discussed. The team behind Jolocom is very happy to have attended such interesting events and looks forward to many more exciting discussions and meetups in 2022. </p>

<p> Vielfältig waren die Events, Diskussionen und Meetups an denen Jolocom dieses Jahr teilnehmen durfte. Von Debatten über die Zukunft von Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) bis zur Rolle des Vertrauens im Zeitalter von KI (Künstlicher Intelligenz) – Jolocom konnte viel beitragen und viel mitnehmen. Ein kleiner Überblick über die Events, an denen wir 2021 teilnahmen, gibt auch einen guten Einblick in unsere Ziele, Werte und Projekte.&nbsp; </p>



<p></p>



<p>Februar 2021&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bereits im Februar nahm Jolocom an einem virtuellen Meeting der International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA) teil. Mit dabei: das Positionspapier der Organisation, das bereits 2020 veröffentlicht worden war:,,<a href="https://inatba.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/2020-11-INATBA-Decentralised-Identity-001.pdf">Decentralised Identity: What’s at Stake?</a>‘’. Eines der Gründungsprinzipien von Jolocom ist die Mission, die Etablierung und Aufrechterhaltung von offenen Standards in unserer Branche voranzutreiben. Daher freuten wir uns sehr, dass Kai als aktives Vorstandsmitglied der INATBA sowie als Co-Vorsitzender der Identity Working Group der Organisation die Diskussion leitete.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Gemeinsam mit vier Interessensgruppen diskutierte er die aktuelle Rolle dezentraler Identitäten, und wie sich diese in Zukunft gestalten sollten. Keryl Folwer als DIF Steering Committee Member, Anil John, Direktor des Silicon Valley Innovation Programme, Dr. Loretta Anania, Wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin bei der GD Connect der Europäischen Kommission, und Daniel Du Seuil, der belgische Projektleiter für selbstsouveräne Identität (SSI) bildeten die Diskussionsgruppe. Das Positionspapier wurde von INATBA mit dem Ziel erstellt, die Erwartungen an einen offenen und innovativen Markt in dezentraler Identität zu definieren. Es analysiert den aktuellen Stand der SSI-Entwicklungen und eröffnet Diskussionen über die nächsten Schritte, stellt Forderungen an die wichtigsten Anspruchsgruppen und setzt Ziele für die Zukunft von SSI.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kai fragte nach den ersten Reaktionen der Teilnehmenden auf den Inhalt des Papieres. Karyl stellte die Rolle und Wichtigkeit von Interoperabilität heraus. Als Interoperabilität bezeichnet man die Fähigkeit zum Zusammenspiel verschiedener Systeme.&nbsp; Wenn zwei Systeme miteinander vereinbar sind, nennt man sie auch interoperabel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anil wiederum sprach sich gegen einen ,,Techno-Utopismus einer selbstsouveränen Identität’’ aus, verdeutlichte jedoch, dass er an persönliche Entscheidungsfreiheit und Kontrolle glaubt. Dies wird auch von Jolocom unterstützt und gehört zu unseren grundlegenden Standards. Anhand einer digitalen selbstsouveränen Identität (SSI) arbeiten wir stets daran, dem Individuum die Kontrolle und Sicherheit zu geben, die eigenen selbstbestimmt verwalten zu können.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Loretta lobte den Plan der Europäischen Kommission, das nächste Jahrzehnt zu einem doppelten Übergang zu machen, bei dem Grün und Digital in alles integriert werden sollen. Sie argumentierte, dass es gut und wichtig ist, bereits jetzt, am Anfang, dabei zu sein, insbesondere wenn die Standards festgelegt werden. Gegründet 2014, ist Jolocom sehr engagiert in der Entwicklung von SSI Standards. Wir arbeiten stets daran, mehr Vertrauen in ein dezentrales Netzwerk auszubauen und die digitale Autonomie der eigenen Daten zu schützen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Daniel sah SSI als Antwort auf die neue Forderung nach einer europäischen digitalen ID. Wenn es bei der europäischen digitalen ID um Empowerment, Datenschutz und neue Modelle der Datenhoheit geht, muss sie technologieneutral sein. Am Ende, so Daniël, sei die Frage immer dieselbe: Wie können wir die Bürger stärken?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Die Diskussion zwischen den Teilnehmenden war sehr angeregt und zeigte, trotz verschiedener Meinungen und Hintergründe, auch gemeinsame Werte auf. Einigkeit herrschte über den steigenden Stellenwert von digitaler Dezentralisierung, die als globaler Trend bezeichnet werden kann.&nbsp; Weiterhin stimmten alle zu, dass dies eine interessante Zeit ist. Sowohl die Industrie als auch der öffentliche Sektor interessieren sich mehr für dezentrale Identitäten und was sie ihnen bieten können. Jolocom stimmte der allgemeinen Meinung zu, dass nur durch enge Zusammenarbeit die dringend erforderliche Interoperabilität entstehen kann.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mai 2021&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seit 2019 gehört Jolocom zu drei von vier Gewinnerteams des deutschen Innovationswettbewerbs zum Aufbau von Sicheren Digitalen Identitäten (SDI)-Projekten. Beim DWeb-Meetup im Mai 2021 wurde Jolocom eingeladen, seine Rolle bei ONCE, ID-Ideal und SDIKA näher zu erläutern, was Kai Wagner gerne tat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seine Kernaussage war dabei: Die Herausforderungen, die vor uns liegen, bieten gleichzeitig große Chancen. Die vier Projekte müssen mit EU-Richtlinien, W3C und generell der weltweiten Gemeinschaft harmonisiert werden; dazu braucht es kohärente Konzepte und Interoperabilitätsinfrastruktur. SSI und dezentrale Identitäten sind am boomen: deswegen gilt es, mit der Marktdynamik Schritt zu halten. Die DWeb Gemeinschaft kann von den Projekten sehr profitieren; Voraussetzung hierfür sind jedoch eine kohärente Infrastruktur und einheitliche Konzepte. So werden auch möglichst viele EU Bürger:innen erreicht, die dann die Chance erhalten, ihre Identität selbstständig zu verwalten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Außerdem präsentierte Kai den Hintergrund zu den Projekten und ihrem Ziel. Offiziell ist der digitale Personalausweis auf dem Markt, wird aber nur von 0.5% der Bevölkerung aktiv genutzt. Deutschland hat, so stellte Kai heraus, keine führende Rolle im Bereich digitaler Identitäten. Ende 2019 wurden dann vier Projekte ausgewählt, die diese Probleme angehen wollen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Oktober 2021&nbsp;</p>



<p>Auch das Thema ,,Digitale Identitäten’’ ist so aktuell wie nie zuvor, besonders vorangetrieben durch die Corona-Pandemie und die damit verbundene zunehmende Digitalisierung in nahezu allen Lebensbereichen. Unter diesem Thema fand auch die online Veranstaltung ,,Digitale Identität’’ des BFM (Betriebswirtschaftliches Forschungszentrum) am 20. Oktober 2021 statt. Während einer angeregten Diskussionsrunde stellten sich vor allem die Themen der Datensicherheit, Umgang mit Skeptiker:innen und Kosten für eine Wallet in den Mittelpunkt. Unter der Expertengruppe befanden sich Irene Adamski als Vertreterin für Jolocom, sowie Fabiane Völter als Wissenschaftliche Mitarbeiterin der Uni Bayreuth, Thomas Ruch als Zuständiger für die Kreditsteuerung der BAUR GmbH und Boris Lingl als Head of Blockchain bei DATEV, welche die Fragen des Publikums zu beantworten suchten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dabei stellte Irene vor allem die Idee einer Wallet vor und präsentierte SSI als einen globalen Trend, der jedoch in Deutschland noch ein Markt im Werden ist. Daher waren die Fragen nach den Kosten einer Wallet nicht konkret zu beantworten, dennoch konnte sicher gesagt werden: Für die Endnutzer kommen keine Kosten auf. Außerdem soll das Nutzen einer Wallet freigestellt werden. EU Bürger:innen müssen aber die Möglichkeit haben, eine Wallet zur Verfügung gestellt bekommen zu haben. Daher kam der Begriff einer Übergangszeit auf, mit der definitiv zu rechnen sei. Die Datensicherheit liegt immer in den Händen der Nutzer:innen. Im Falle einer Anfrage, etwas auszuweisen, können diese selbst an- und abwählen, welche Informationen sie teilen, oder es sogar komplett ablehnen. Die eigenen Daten liegen dabei allesamt verschlüsselt auf der eigenen Wallet. Ähnlich wie bei einer Brieftasche zieht man nur jene Informationen heraus, die man auch teilen möchte.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>November 2021&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ebenfalls im Umgang mit der Zukunft von Künstlicher Intelligenz (KI) stellte Irene die Rolle von SSI als möglichen Lösungsweg vor. Die Fachkonferenz ,,Vertrauen im Zeitalter KI-gestützter Bots und Fakes: Herausforderungen und mögliche Lösungen‘‘ am 4. November beinhaltete einige Impulsvorträge über die Themenbereiche Fake Reviews, Deep Fakes, und Lösungsmöglichkeiten. Spannende Beispiele vom Einsatz künstlicher Intelligenz im Alltag verdeutlichten, dass es sich um einen globalen Trend handelt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bei dieser angeregten Fachkonferenz wurden auch die Schattenseiten von KI beleuchtet. Identitätsklau, Manipulation der Politik, Verbreitung pornografischer Inhalte…Gefahren, die durch KI entstehen, sind nicht auszuschließen und führen zu wachsendem Misstrauen in den digitalen Raum. Wie ist hiermit umzugehen? Just an dieser Stelle kommt die Rolle von SSI ins Spiel. Es gehört zu Jolocom’s Grundprinzipien, die Autonomie von Bürger:innen im Netz zu wahren und zu schützen. Irene freute sich, dies näher erläutern zu können.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Der Grundgedanke: die eigenen Daten kontrollieren. Aufgeschlüsselt: selektiv auswählen, wer Zugang zu ihren und seinen Daten hat, und ablehnen, wer keinen Zugang bekommen soll. Beim Nutzen einer digitalen Wallet kommt dies gut zum Ausdruck: Ich kann ausweisen, dass ich über 18 Jahre alt bin, ohne mein persönliches Geburtsdatum teilen zu müssen. Diese selektive Weitergabe von Daten bringt auch wieder mehr Vertrauen in den digitalen Raum mit sich. So liefert eine sichere Wallet die Möglichkeit, im beginnenden Zeitalter von KI und automatisierter Bots die Autonomie über die eigenen Daten zu behalten und zu schützen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2021 zeigte erneut, wie aktuell das Thema SSI ist und wie es vielseitig diskutiert wird. Das Team hinter Jolocom freut sich sehr, bei so anregenden Events dabei gewesen zu sein und bedankt sich bei den Organisatoren und anderen Teilnehmenden. Auf das 2022 noch viel weiteren spannenden Austausch bieten wird. –&nbsp;</p>

<p>With a continued focus on decentralized identity and data solutions, Ontology has worked to bring better trust, privacy, and security to the new&nbsp;web</p><p>In a relatively new industry like blockchain, change is a constant state. When Ontology launched at the end of 2017, Bitcoin was putting crypto on the map through continuous price surges, before crashing at the end of 2018. Since this time, in an uncharted landscape that at times seemed dominated by speculation, Ontology strove to be a lighthouse in a sea of confusion, providing clear and reliable blockchain use cases that put users’ interests first.</p><p>As the industry has progressed and the world has increasingly embraced decentralized solutions, privacy and security issues associated with Web2 and Big Tech have been exposed. Looking to facilitate a more secure and private internet in Web3, Ontology has been working hard to build out its public chain infrastructure, decentralized identity, and data solutions to support the transition to the new&nbsp;web.</p><p>As well as a more private and secure internet, Web3 offers the potential for fascinating use cases as the web becomes more integrated. The metaverse, an all-encompassing digital landscape populated by virtual people, places and things, will eventually see separate virtual worlds interlink and overlap the real world. To get there, we need a public chain that puts users’ security and privacy front and center, whilst also allowing for an interoperable virtual world. Over the last four years, Ontology has been working to create an infrastructure for just that and we are delighted to now be facilitating this vision of a better internet.</p><p>As we look to the future, we are excited to onboard new partnerships and make technological advancements that contribute to our vision of Web3, as well as to the growth of our global community.</p> Year 1: Laying The Foundations <p>The launch of Ontology’s <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/ontology-mainnet-ontology-1-0-has-officially-launched">MainNet</a> 1.0 served to position us as a high-performance public blockchain. In a significant move for the wider industry, Ontology 1.0 was the first public chain capable of executing smart contracts with identity, setting the stage for our vision for decentralized identity solutions. To lay the foundations for the open governance model which has become a key aspect of Ontology, we introduced a <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-launches-vbft-a-next-generation-consensus-mechanism-becoming-one-of-the-first-vrf-based-91f782308db4">new consensus algorithm, VBFT</a>, for the Ontology framework and the <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-introduces-the-triones-membership-system-5211294976bf">Triones Consensus System</a>.</p> Year 2: Building Out Our Infrastructure <p>Year 2 saw Ontology crystallize our vision and mark out our position within the broader blockchain ecosystem. Gaining traction, we were able to supplement our MainNet by building on it with further enterprise projects that were focused on decentralized identity and data privacy. Broadening the technical applications of our chain, we launched <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-v1-8-0-goes-live-with-wasm-fa34e9f7f930">Wasm TestNet in May</a>, as well as the first-ever cross-chain TestNet. We didn’t stop there; in fact, it was a Multi-VM launch that year, with the launch of our <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-sharding-design-released-c900331f71fa">Sharding Design</a> launching in October, which provided linear stability and support for cross-shard transaction processing.</p> Year 3: Global Expansion <p>Having made our mark on the industry through technical prowess, the Ontology mission for our third year was to become a cross-chain, global network that would expand our vision of decentralized identity and data through a host of fascinating partnerships.</p><p>Throughout the year, we improved our infrastructure through the roll-out of the Ontology Layer 2.0. Additionally, ONT ID was upgraded, which served to combine users’ decentralized identity with their ONTO Wallet with one single login, while providing a framework that helps users control their identity and data. This was a huge step towards interoperability and provided an interlinked suite of products to our&nbsp;users.</p><p>We introduced a new governance and staking model in July, affecting both our ONT and ONG tokens, complete with a <a href="https://node.ont.io/calculator/node">node and yield calculator</a> allowing users to easily estimate how much they could potentially earn from staking via ONTO. Excitingly, ONG also launched on Uniswap at the end of the summer, bringing Ontology’s token to a whole new user base. As the year developed, we deployed our cross-chain decentralized identity solution on Ethereum, Near, Neo, TRON, Klaytn, Binance Smart Chain, and Polkadot. We also partnered with Patract Labs in November to accelerate smart contract ecosystem development. Finally, we joined forces with <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/daimler-mobility-partners-with-ontology-to-leverage-high-performance-technologies-and-transform-b469aa46e671">Daimler Mobility</a> AG’s Blockchain Factory to develop MoveX, a first-of-its-kind blockchain-based mobility platform for the automotive and mobility industry.</p><p>Towards the end of the year, our focus turned to the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). In September 2020, we launched <a href="https://wing.finance/">Wing.Finance</a>, a credit-based, cross-chain DeFi lending platform. Since then Wing has seen significant growth, with increased engagement in its DAO, and has also incorporated credit-based lending through Ontology’s unique OScore credit scoring solution. The Wing Inclusive Pool, a first mover in the industry, also allows users to under-collateralize assets and lower their interest&nbsp;rates.</p> Year 4: Web3 and Interoperability <p>This year, Ontology has honed our existing products to match our wider vision of Web3 and position ourselves as the public chain capable of moving towards a better, decentralized, interoperable internet that places user privacy and data security at the heart of its priorities.</p><p>To facilitate this vision, our technical team began developing the Ontology Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) at the start of 2021. Now on TestNet, our EVM will help us establish seamless interoperability between Ontology and the Ethereum platform, offering an inclusive experience to developers and users. This development will also help to cement Ontology’s position as a cross-chain interoperable blockchain, adding to its existing virtual machines; NeoVM, Native (Ontology) VM, and&nbsp;WasmVM.</p><p>Reflecting a major endorsement for decentralized identity, ONT ID surpassed 1.5 million users in September. Companies across the globe have also embraced the application this year, most notably through a social good <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/microworkers-integrates-ontologys-onto-wallet-to-facilitate-additional-payment-options-for-workers-1163291af76c">partnership</a> announced in March with global freelancing marketplace leader, MicroWorkers, where it is being used to assist workers to receive rewards and gain greater access to capital. To facilitate its ever-expanding user base, ONT ID underwent an upgrade that will improve user experience, while also making it easier for developers to build sophisticated applications and real-world use cases through ONT ID. The Ontology products now integrated with ONT ID&nbsp;include:</p>  <a href="https://login.ont.id/">ONT Login</a>, a new feature that makes trustless universal authentication for websites and applications possible, allowing users to log into multiple platforms without having to remember passwords.  <a href="https://tag.ont.id/">ONT TAG</a>, Ontology’s new decentralized solution for online identity verification, which helps applications access users’ verifiable credentials, such as KYC verification, whilst also allowing users to protect their privacy by authorizing information independently.  <a href="https://www.ocredit.io/">OScore</a>, a DeFi credit score, used to measure creditworthiness, which is calculated using different types of on-chain transaction data.  <p>Other partnerships have also contributed to Ontology’s arsenal. Most recently, we partnered with <a href="https://bloxmove.com/">bloXmove</a>, a business-to-business mobility blockchain platform designed to simplify travel across multiple forms of transportation, to bring decentralized identity to urban transport apps. In May, we partnered with <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-providing-did-solutions-to-music-streaming-platform-rocki-5ae6c1704483">ROCKI</a>, a next-generation music streaming service and NFT platform. ROCKI will use Ontology’s decentralized identity solutions to prevent bad actors from impersonating artists and peddling inauthentic NFTs. In June, we also <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-partners-with-zaico-to-empower-its-inventory-management-system-increasing-traceability-29a604bf6123">announced</a> a partnership with <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-partners-with-zaico-to-empower-its-inventory-management-system-increasing-traceability-29a604bf6123">ZAICO</a>, a real-time cloud storage inventory management application based in Japan. We also partnered with AP.LLC, a private Japanese IT consultancy firm and hired a <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1391937705206972419">new</a> Japanese advisor, Matsuyama Kitao Takayuki.</p><p>Ontology’s growth in the <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-growing-presence-in-japan-a31d3aaa0eb7">Japanese</a> market has accelerated following a string of announcements, including the news that ONT would be listed on the Japanese registered crypto exchange, <a href="https://www.decurret.com/">Decurret</a>. This marked the first listing of ONT in Japan, a huge milestone for Ontology and our growing Japanese community. The ONT/JPY trading pair went live in July, with over 40,000 ONT trading volume taking place. In August, ONT was listed on <a href="https://www.huobi.co.jp/">Huobi Japan</a>, another FSA-licensed Japanese exchange.</p><p>In January, we were delighted to announce the launch of a <a href="https://medium.com/onto/the-first-cross-chain-web-wallet-onto-web-is-coming-soon-8a9e89ff0e0">web-based ONTO wallet</a> to bring additional accessibility to millions of users through their web browser. Incredibly, this was the first-ever web wallet to support cross-chain assets and dApps while also addressing the growing demand for decentralized identity and data amongst users. We also ​​launched <a href="https://anydrop.ont.io/">ONTO Anydrop</a>, a decentralized airdrop distribution tool, that allows assets to be sent to up to 100 addresses in one transaction in a fast and secure manner across multiple mainstream blockchains. These significant achievements have led to a massive increase in users and community members of ONTO Wallet. The <a href="https://twitter.com/ONTOWallet?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">ONTO</a> Wallet Twitter channel now has over 100K followers.</p><p>Wing, Ontology’s DeFi lending platform, also turned one this year. Over the past year, Wing has lived up to its title of a cross-chain platform through launching on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRKt9oJxLPs">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/wingfinance/wing-ontologys-cross-chain-defi-lending-platform-now-live-on-okexchain-7c622d78f4ee">OKExChain</a> and most recently, <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/wing-ontologys-cross-chain-defi-lending-platform-is-now-live-on-binance-smart-chain">Binance Smart Chain</a>. It also <a href="https://medium.com/wingfinance/wing-finance-launches-any-pool-a-decentralized-lending-pool-for-any-asset-b6eadbf9c4e8">launched</a> a new DeFi product, “Any Pool,” which allows for the contractualization and lending of any&nbsp;asset.</p> Looking Ahead <p>As we have seen, the last four years have been full of incredible achievements. Undoubtedly, our community is the support system that drives this success at Ontology. As we step forward into the next era of our future, we are proud to be a well-established blockchain that has stood the test of time. Moving into Web3, we believe we are the chain that can facilitate the needs of the new web. Not only do we expect our protocols and products to continue to facilitate this shift, but we also look forward to welcoming more people to the decentralized identity and data revolution.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Supercharge your staking with Ontology’s Limited Edition NFT: Multiply your yield by&nbsp;9000X! <p>To celebrate Ontology’s 4th anniversary, we have made 10,000 limited edition NFT’s available for minting. Not only do they look great, but they will also be used to establish a special NFT Ontology Node where NFT holders benefit from the staking&nbsp;rewards.</p><p>Minting takes place over four rounds, between December 9th 06:00 UTC and December 10th 00:00 UTC. Any remaining NFTs from each round, will be carried over to the&nbsp;next.</p><p>Round 1: 06.00 UTC, Dec 9th — 1000 NFTs available <br>Round 2: 12.00 UTC, Dec 9th — 2000 NFTs available <br>Round 3: 18.00 UTC, Dec 9th — 3000 NFTs available<br>Round 4: 00.00 UTC, Dec 10th — 4000 NFTs available</p><p>NFTs will be available to mint for ten days, starting with Round 1. Minting ends on 12/19 06:00 UTC or when all 10,000 NFTs have been minted. Each NFT will cost 10 ONT to mint, with a unique ONT address able to mint a maximum of 10&nbsp;NFTs.</p> Stake NFTs and Earn&nbsp;ONG <p>When you mint your first NFT, you have helped to establish special NFT node owners. Congratulations!</p><p>NFT staking has significantly reduced the barrier of entry to establishing a node, by allowing you to do it together with your NFTs. A node owner requires a minimum of 10,000 ONT and pays fees of 500 ONG to establish the node. The special NFT node is established with the ONT used during the minting event and Ontology is covering the 500 ONG in fees as a part of the 4th anniversary celebrations.</p><p>90% of the ONG rewards earned by the node will be distributed between the NFT owners, with the remaining 10% being used, in the first instance, as a fund for those who choose to burn their NFTs (see below). When the NFT burning fund is full, the remaining 10% will be used to fund future Ontology&nbsp;events.</p> Redeem ONT <p>Should an NFT owner wish to do so, they can burn their NFT and redeem 10&nbsp;ONT.</p><p>Burning NFTs does not reduce the size of the stake in the node. Great news for those that don’t burn their NFTs, as their share of ONG rewards increases for every NFT&nbsp;burned.</p><p>Burning NFTs can increase rewards up to 9000 times for the remaining holder. Should all NFTs be burned, the ONG generated by the node will be used by Ontology for future community development.</p> More <p>NFTs feature additional use cases — stay tuned for more&nbsp;details!</p> Guide  1. Download the <a href="http://onto.app">ONTO Wallet</a> and Create an ONT ID&nbsp;Wallet <p>Click on the <a href="https://ontology-1.gitbook.io/onto/guides/app-basics/how-to-register-an-account-on-onto-wallet">link</a> to view the relevant&nbsp;guide.</p><p>Skip this step if you already have an ONT ID&nbsp;wallet.</p> 2. Prepare ONT and&nbsp;ONG <p>The minting fee of each NFT is 10 ONT, and all transactions on the Ontology blockchain require a small amount of ONG as fees. If ONG balance is insufficient, navigate to ONTO’s Assets page and click the ONT details page. Here, you can click on the upper right button to swap ONT for&nbsp;ONG.</p> 3. Mint&nbsp;NFT <p>Navigate to ONTO’s Discover page, search “Cyberspace 4 Philosophers” and open&nbsp;it.</p><p>Tap on the “Mint” button at the bottom left of the homepage to open the “Mint” page, then tap on the “Mint” button at the bottom. In the pop-up window, enter the mint number, then tap on the “Mint” button to finish the&nbsp;process.</p><p>Minted NFTs can be viewed and sent on the ONTO Assets — Collectibles page.</p> 4. Stake NFT and Claim ONG&nbsp;Reward <p>To earn ONG rewards, NFTs must be staked. The staking feature will be available shortly after the minting is complete and the node has been established</p><p>Tap on the “Stake/Redeem” button at the bottom right of the homepage to open the “Stake/Redeem” page, then tap on the “Stake” button to stake ONT or the “Unstake” button to unstake&nbsp;ONT.</p><p>ONG rewards are distributed at the end of each consensus round. Tap on the “Claim” button to claim the ONG&nbsp;reward.</p> 5. Burn NFTs and Redeem&nbsp;ONT <p>Only unstaked NFTs can be burned. On the “Stake/Redeem” page, tap on the “Burn” button at the bottom left to burn NFTs. Then wait until the current consensus round ends, and then tap on the “Redeem” button at the bottom right to redeem&nbsp;ONT.</p><p>Please note that, Redeem will only be available when there is enough balance in the NFT burning&nbsp;fund.</p><p>The Ontology team will reserve the final rights of interpretation of this&nbsp;event.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 From open-sourcing our Veriscope travel rule solution to partnerships with industry players like Tether and Panther Protocol, our team has been busy building the future of trust and compliance in blockchain. <p>What a few months it’s been for Shyft Network! We want to extend a big thanks to our entire community and partners who’ve contributed to many of our recent partnerships, updates, and key announcements. We have many exciting things — from long-awaited partnerships to product upgrades, DAO, and community campaigns — that will wrap up the year and take us into the next chapter of our journey building trust and validation into blockchain data.</p><p>To mark the end of the quarter, we’re taking some time to recap what’s happened since the summer, plus a tease of what’s to come. Thanks for being&nbsp;here!</p> The Shyft Federation Deploys the Shyft Bridge — and Signed the Constitution! <p>The Shyft Node Federation, our collective of Shyft Network validator nodes, has been hard at work since its official deployment in July of 2021. In early September, we announced the Fed had officially deployed the Shyft Bridge, a secure and efficient cross-blockchain asset transfer mechanism. The collaboration between the Shyft Node Federation and Chainsafe offers users the ability to deploy the Shyft Bridge between the Shyft Network and Ethereum to support minimal cross-asset transmission and minimal cost cross-chain smart-contract operations. <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-shyft-federation-deploys-the-shyft-bridge-65f64afa3cad">Read more about the Shyft&nbsp;Bridge.</a></p><p>Earlier in the month, the Shyft Node Federation, including CoinShares, Maven11, Fabric, ClicketyClack, Connect Capital, AD Node, Staking Team, Merkle Trading, BlockUnity, Paycase Financial, DeFi Technologies, Mempool Partners, Nodebased, NP IR, and others, publicly signed off on voting guidelines and node rights and responsibilities. This document included many of the ground rules that would enable improvement protocols and a framework for new nodes to enter the&nbsp;Network.</p><p>We’d like to again recognize and thank the entire Node Federation member network for their commitment to the highest level of trust in blockchain, our Network, and community.</p><p><a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/read-it-now-the-shyft-node-federation-constitution-is-public-c6b8957492d7">Read more about the Node Federation Constitution.</a></p> Tether Is Testing and Integrating Veriscope — Now Open-Sourced and Free to&nbsp;Use!​​ <p>On November 18, we shared the incredibly exciting news that leading stablecoin Tether (owned by Bitfinex) had begun testing and integrating Versicope. Tether’s integration kicks off the first stage in their trial of Veriscope, which will allow them to offer their customers a privacy-focused experience while also solving global compliance requirements for all participants across the ecosystem. <a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/the-shyft-federation-deploys-the-shyft-bridge-65f64afa3cad">Read more&nbsp;here.</a></p><p>Tether’s Veriscope testing follows our announcement (<a href="http://tether">and FATF’s latest regulatory guidance</a>) from earlier in November that Shyft Network has officially open-sourced the Versicope technology, making it free and simpler than ever for people to use. This update, which serves to democratize access to compliance technology for the entire blockchain community, came only two months after we shared the<a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/global-crypto-exchanges-begin-phased-deployment-of-veriscope-the-decentralized-solution-to-the-b049fcb24cdf?source=user_profile---------10-------------------------------"> latest list</a> of exchanges involved in the phased deployment of Veriscope on our Network. Participating exchanges included Binance, Tether, Deribit, Bitmex, and&nbsp;Huobi.</p><p><a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/shyft-network-core-team-open-sources-veriscope-makes-travel-rule-compliance-open-free-and-adb4a8b6945e">Read more about Veriscope Open Sourcing</a>.</p> Shyft Network Partners with Panther Protocol to Advance Privacy Tech and Data Protection. <p>Our team has been busy planning and deploying partnerships with some of the top names across crypto and DeFi this quarter, including Panther Protocol, the end-to-end blockchain solution developing the privacy layer for Web3 and DeFi. In early November, Yahoo News got the scoop about our strategic partnership with the Panther team to accelerate the development of privacy-enhancing technologies, data protection tooling, and mission-critical data attestation services.</p><p>On the Shyft Network side, we’ll provide value to Panther Protocol through enterprise and government compliance and data attestation services, resulting from deploying Panther to Shyft Network’s Layer 1.

He introduced the guests and talked briefly about the concepts of <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/self-sovereign-identity-what-you-can-cant-do-with-ssi-1284f7227b4e">Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)</a> and <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/what-are-verifiable-credentials-79f1846a7b9">Verifiable Credentials (VCs)</a>, and the role of Affinidi in this&nbsp;space.</p> COVID Verification Solutions by Toby&nbsp;Berger <p>Toby Berger started by reminding us of the COVID pandemic in the early 2020s and how it impacted people and disrupted industries and businesses. He opined that this also pushed businesses to explore new horizons, especially those involved in the travel industry, as the complexity of operations increased with quarantines and vaccinations.</p><p>He explained that this situation also brought up the need for a verification solution that enabled verifiers like government and airport authorities to safely and securely check the vaccination status of travelers, so steps can be taken accordingly to prevent the spread of&nbsp;COVID.</p><p>After detailed discussions with governments and other stakeholder, Affinidi Travel identified a bunch of common considerations that included:</p>  Interoperability across global standards and&nbsp;formats.  A competitive and unified&nbsp;pricing  Ease of integration with existing solutions  A flexible rules engine that supports global safe travel regulations  A simple and intuitive UI  An underlying trust network that connects to a global support group of industry&nbsp;peers.  <p>Based on these inputs, the CommonCheck solution was built, and it offered the following benefits for&nbsp;users.</p><p>With these thoughts on how Affinidi’s verifiable solution is shaping the travel industry, Toby ended his&nbsp;session.</p> Affinidi Travel Demo — Shankar&nbsp;Pillai <p>Shankar started his interesting session by explaining the in-depth architecture of the system to give the audience an idea of how the common considerations mentioned by Toby earlier were integrated into the system to give all users the benefits of a verification solution.</p><p>Here’s a look at the architecture.</p><p>This explanation was followed by a demo of the live&nbsp;system.</p><p>The CommonCheck application of the Affinidi Travel Ecosystem comes with a simple UI that takes information from users and creates a VC that can be shared with anyone as a QR code. This VC is trusted as it is issued by a company that is authorized to test for COVID and also, it is tamper-proof, so the results can’t be changed by the&nbsp;holder.</p><p>Shankar showcased the simplicity and ingenuity of the application and ended his session by saying that this product can be used as an API as&nbsp;well.</p> Walkthrough of the Affinidi Tech Stack — Kamal&nbsp;Laungani <p>The last part of the webinar was handled by Kamal where he walked the attendees through the <a href="https://affinidi.com/api">Affinidi tech stack</a> and how it can be leveraged to build VC-based applications. He also did a demo of <a href="https://schema.affinidi.com/">Affinidi’s Schema Manager</a> and how it can be integrated with any application.</p><p>He even showed the audience how to issue a VC for attending the&nbsp;webinar!</p> Q&amp;A Session <p>The webinar ended with a Q&amp;A session that saw some interesting questions from the participants.</p><p>Some of the questions that were asked&nbsp;were,</p>  Does Affinidi support the Good Health Pass Collaborative standard?  How are you managing integration with Gvt systems for verification / entry /&nbsp;exit  Recently tried issuing a VC via YourEdge app. Aside from Email Addresses, are there any other means to write and deliver a VC to someone without knowing their email&nbsp;address?  Is Affinidi launching any&nbsp;token?  How can we invest in affinidi?  <p>Toby, Shankar, and Kamal came together to answer these questions.</p><p>Overall, it was an insightful session that showed a practical implementation of verifiable credentials. We are confident that this webinar will enthuse more <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/the-journey-of-an-ssi-developer-6ef4f642779c">developers</a> and businesses to integrate a verifiable solution into their operations.</p><p>If you’re a developer or someone who wants to build an SSI application, reach out to us on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ffV5ctBMXr">Discord</a> to explore how the Affinidi tech stack can ease your development process.</p><p>Also, <a href="https://share.hsforms.com/1FhRGo3c4T-erYRGOSRyzCQ8oa2v">join our mailing list</a> and follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/affinidi">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/affinidi/">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/affinidi.devs">Facebook</a> for more such exciting&nbsp;events.</p> <p><a href="https://academy.affinidi.com/webinar-recap-how-digital-credentials-can-help-unlock-safe-travels-beyond-covid-bde49c7ca018">Webinar Recap: How digital credentials can help unlock safe travels beyond COVID?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://academy.affinidi.com">Affinidi</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the 14th interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/a7izaidi">Polaris</a>, administrator of our <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">English</a> community.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I have been a Neo supporter, and from the Neo reddit group I found out about Ontology and the airdrop which was given to Neo holders. Unfortunately, I left it very late to sign up for the newsletter, so I missed the 1000 ONT airdrop and only got a small amount of ONT from holding my NEO’s. I was fascinated when I looked at Ontology’s whitepaper, and how they envision an extremely fast blockchain for businesses and identity as the main USP. I think after reading the whitepaper, I was convinced that the way Ontology envision the future is the right way, andthat drew me towards&nbsp;Ontology</p> 2. Why did you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>The ever-evolving blockchain industry is still at an early stage where a combination of many variables make up the whole industry. We have managed to understand how a decentralized distributed ledger works, how to create smart contracts on that distributed ledger, and to create content and immortalize it on the blockchain. However, identity is not something which the industry is fully focused on, instead a more anarchical utopia is often created where no one has a connection to identity and these ideologies iterate that somehow the worlds economy will run fine with a rogue infrastructure. I think the fact that Ontology has focused on identity and decentralized trust from the very beginning gives me a clear indicator that the theme is to bring real use cases from the technology, and that’s what really excites me because real use cases of the blockchain will promote a smart economy, a fairer and more transparent economy, while not having to compromise our privacy. This eventually will translate to an economy which will run on centralized and decentralized platforms, and being part of that future is something I always wanted to do. The fact that my understanding of technology usage is aligned with Ontologies vision, makes me want to be a champion of the&nbsp;brand.</p> 3. What’s the key role of a Harbinger? What’s your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>I love the word Harbinger, it means someone who initiates changes. Being given the freedom to bring ideas to the table, while receiving all the support I need, is something I cherish greatly. The key role, from my point of view, is to represent Ontology and bridge the gap between the community and the team. To establish deeper connections with the community. To be able to get the general sentiment from the community about the project and be able to relay that onto the team. To think of innovative idea to further drive user/community engagement. To think of innovative ideas to educate about the industry and the eco system in&nbsp;general.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>Being part of any community is something we as humans have been deeply ingrained to do. We have always been very tribal towards our culture, geographical location, genetics etc. Now, we are beginning to realize that those things don’t matter and the only way forward is to be as one. We need to be more integrated towards how we do business and how we interact. Ontology’s vision and global community gives me that feeling of belonging, where my understanding of the future is the same as a lot of others. That is why this community is important for&nbsp;me.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities, is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>Well, we all want a decentralized future but we all also want our assets to be pegged with real life identity so that there is some sort of legal connection with the asset. If the future will be using blockchain technology, then I cannot see that happening without identity and trust. Without these two factors, future adoption will be halted. I think a lot of members from the community agree on this. So having realistic expectation of the future is what makes this community stand out. They support decentralized identity and having full control of one’s&nbsp;data.</p> 6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>Currently I am using real life interactions with business owners and corporations. I’m trying to make them understand the benefits of using blockchain, not just as a store of value but as a precursor towards a completely new, fairer industry. I also use telegram, discord, and twitter spaces for my socials. Absolutely I would like to see more educational videos on YouTube and all other platforms.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>I have had many memorable experiences being part of the eco system, I have been part of the community in all the ups and downs and to be honest it’s been a great journey so far. I remember not seeing my tokens on my wallet once and being supported by the community, it was a UI problem which eventually got sorted. Along the journey I have learnt so much from all the other admins/harbingers, and without their support I don’t think I would be a harbinger today. So my advice to all new community members/potential harbingers would be to not be afraid to ask and learn, we are here to support everyone and equip them with the correct knowledge and support so they can resonate on that with&nbsp;others.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Global, Passionate, Loyal</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>I am quite happy with the way the current community engagement works. To improve it even further, we might need to think about more innovative ways. Things like a NFT marketplace, where artist and musicians mint their work using Ontology’s blockchain, or having a monthly roundup on twitter&nbsp;spaces.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>The completion of EVM would be a huge milestone for Ontology, and with that the eco system will attract a lot of developers and blockchain enthusiasts. The community needs to be ready to help and educate the new members about the benefits of DID, OSCORE, and cheap transaction costs, all while controlling their privacy. If all the Harbingers and members of the community keep the user engagement high, that will ensure that this technology can be widely accepted by the&nbsp;globe.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

<p>With advancing technology, many companies have switched from orthodox authentication methods to cutting-edge biometric authentication and its components. Fingerprint, facial, and palm recognition remain the most common types, biometric voice recognition has seen a rise.&nbsp;</p>



 What is Biometric Voice Recognition? 



<p>Biometric Voice Recognition is the use of the human voice to uniquely identify biological characteristics to authenticate an individual unlike passwords or tokens that require physical input.</p>



  



<p>Massive advances in neural network technology have led to the development of voice biometrics that are faster and more accurate than other methods. These biometric voice recognition systems have access to larger use cases and can identify an individual with less amount of speech samples.&nbsp;</p>



 Where is the Voice Biometric Market Heading? 



  
  The market size of biometric voice recognition is expected to grow from <a href="https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/voice-biometrics-market-104503105.html">$1.1 billion USD</a> in 2020 to $3.9 billion USD by 2026, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 22.8% during the forecast period.&nbsp;  



  Due to insufficient security features, device interactions in the finance sector are limited. Fraud attacks against financial institutions have increased by <a href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/voice-biometrics-market">269%</a> over the previous four years, more than most other industries investigated.&nbsp;  



  Financial institutions are likely to employ voice recognition in combination with their speech-recognition applications in the future.  
  



 How Does Biometric Voice Recognition Work? 



<p>Voice biometric recognition works by inputting the the voice of the individual whose identity has to be stored in the system. This input is kept as a print for authentication. The input print is made with software that can split the voice statement into multiple frequencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://imageware.io/behavioral-biometrics/">Behavioral attributes</a> are identified at this stage that work mutually to make up the voice print. Voice recognition is much like iris or fingerprint recognition. Each one is unique to an individual and cannot be duplicated. These prints are stored in the database for further authentication.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, a text independent system focuses and matches unfamiliar speech with previously stored voice information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are two types of voice authentication:</p>



<p>Text-independent recognition: The system does not keep any pre-recorded audio to compare with the input in this case. It’s a voice authentication approach that doesn’t require any prior speech material to be entered into the biometric system. It is far more practical because it allows for free speech.</p>



<p>Text-dependent recognition: This necessitates the repetition of a previously delivered sentence that has been stored in the system, posing a speech content limitation.</p>



 Voice Biometrics Use-Cases 



<p>Voice biometric recognition has multiple use cases. Some of them are:</p>



 Contact Centre 



<p>The contact center industry is perhaps the most common application of speech biometrics. By avoiding the laborious security questions at the start of every customer service interaction, using voice to verify and authenticate callers saves time and effort for both the consumer and the agent.</p>



 Fraud Detection 



<p>Voice biometrics is a powerful fraud-detection tool. Multi-factor authentication is increasingly being used to prevent unauthorised access to client data or financial resources, since identity theft is on the rise. Voice biometrics offers a safe, spoof-resistant authentication mechanism.</p>



 Financial Services  



<p>In recent years, the global financial services market has seen significant changes. Customers’ lives have been made easier by mobile banking and other FinTech alternatives, but there has also been an increase in danger. Thousands of verifications a day, in many languages, are processed using voice biometrics.</p>



 Digital Signatures 



<p>Voice biometrics can be used to establish voice signatures, which are a legally binding means of underwriting documents like life insurance contracts. Financial transactions can also be authorised using voice signatures.</p>



 Workforce Management 



<p>The use of voice biometrics in workforce management apps is currently commonplace. Speech verification is a secure alternative to badging systems for organisations with a big, scattered workforce.</p>



 Advantages of Biometric Voice Recognition 



 1. Low Operational Costs 



<p>Call centres and even banks can save money by using voice authentication. It saves them millions of dollars by eliminating many of the steps necessary in traditional verification methods. It can recognise the customer’s voice during an end-to-end chat to authenticate their identity without the need for customary inquiries.</p>



 2.Enhanced User Experience 



<p>Another advantage of voice biometric systems that is often neglected is that they have the ability to greatly improve customer experiences. Callers no longer need to offer passcodes, PINs, or answer challenge questions to verify their identity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This makes speech biometrics perfect for omnichannel and multichannel deployments, as a customer’s voiceprint can be used across all of your company’s support channels once they’ve been enrolled.</p>



 3. Increased Accuracy 



<p>Voice authentication is more accurate and trustworthy than passwords, which are easy to forget, modify, or guess. It’s similar to fingerprints, which no one else can have. In other words, unlike passwords, you cannot forget or reproduce a voice. Despite the fact that the sound may be impacted by a variety of things, it is far more reliable and convenient.</p>



 4. Easy to Implement Technology 



<p>Many businesses value the simplicity of voice recognition biometrics in terms of use and implementation. Some biometric technology can be challenging to integrate into a business and to get started with. However, voice biometric systems can usually be implemented without additional equipment or systems because they require so little.</p>



<p>Because this technology is so simple to use, companies can often reassign personnel elsewhere in the organisation to boost performance and customer satisfaction.</p>



<p>Conclusion</p>



<p>Voice authentication is a great way to verify a user’s identification since it adds additional layers of protection that manual pass codes might not provide. Voice authentication is beneficial for both customers and the business as it removes frustration associated with cumbersome login processes.&nbsp;</p>

 <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/11/05/a-national-data-privacy-regulation-is-good-for-business/?sh=32473f1b3222">Forbes Technology Council</a>&nbsp;has said a national data privacy regulation could save companies time and money and help them focus on business success and customer satisfaction rather than get lost in the maze of privacy regulation and compliance. 



<p></p>



<p>We completely agree.</p>



<p>Most commentators agree the US data privacy regulatory landscape is shambolic. Only&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/the-california-consumer-privacy-act-and-why-you-must-still-keep-control-of-your-personal-information/">California</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/07/colorado-passes-consumer-data-privacy-law/">Colorado</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+SB1392">Virginia</a>&nbsp;have passed state laws, while a raft of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/">other state regulations</a>&nbsp;are on the table but not yet passed. A national data privacy law was&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/a-us-national-privacy-law-looks-more-likely-than-ever/">looking promising</a>&nbsp;earlier this year but is now widely considered a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/state-of-privacy-laws-in-us/">way off</a>.</p>



<p>But the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/11/05/a-national-data-privacy-regulation-is-good-for-business/?sh=32473f1b3222">Forbes Technology Council</a>&nbsp;points out the already heavy compliance burden (financial and operational) on businesses will only increase when these laws pass. Compliance with the&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/report-finds-organizations-may-spend-55b-in-initial-ccpa-compliance-costs/">CCPA</a>and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/cybersecurity-privacy-forensics/library/privacy-reset.html">GDPR</a>&nbsp;is proving hugely costly, according to PwC, since laws worldwide differ just enough to demand businesses stay aware of their obligations and implement the systems they think will be protective enough across all regulations or at least the most challenging one.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forbes says the hardest hit will be the mid-market enterprises and non-profit organizations that don’t have the resources to keep up.</p>



<p>Forbes rightly asks: “How will businesses manage the nuanced differences among them, and how much time will this take? Will they face multiple fines for the same incident? What happens if the regulations have conflicting provisions? Does any company really want to restrict business activity while it wastes time in court defending how it struggled to resolve conflicts between different privacy regulations?”</p>



 Everything points to the solution being a unified, national data privacy law, to bring cohesion to an otherwise time-consuming and resource-intensive mess. 



<p></p>



<p>We are seeing some data privacy progress in the US, such as President Biden’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3638750/biden-s-cybersecurity-executive-order-progress-report.html">cybersecurity executive orders</a>&nbsp;and more&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/10/consumers-could-gain-from-ftcs-stronger-focus-on-data-protection/">privacy-oriented commissioners</a>&nbsp;appointed to the Federal Trade Commission.</p>



<p>Forbes says businesses are suffering dreadful inertia and doing nothing or very little while they wait for a national law, which will hurt both the business and its customers in the long term, especially via major&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/11/what-is-a-data-breach/">data breaches</a>&nbsp;which aren’t reducing in size or frequency. Data breaches not only put consumers at risk; they make consumers doubt companies and governments and increasingly reject the&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/">data surveillance business model</a>&nbsp;and data access&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/">consumers don’t like or trust</a>.</p>



<p>Forbes says businesses that do try to do the right thing pay for it in development costs and legal fees as they flounder around trying to work out which requirements are important to their business.</p>



<p>It’s a no-brainer then when Forbes concludes “… only a sensible national privacy regulation” can help businesses to see which technologies and processes they need to protect both their business and their customers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And, as we do here at Anonyome Labs, Forbes reminds companies it’s still up to them to stay vigilant and proactive in protecting their customers’ data privacy while the country waits for the national data privacy law saga to come to a successful end.</p>



<p>One of Forbes’ suggestions is for companies to “build a top-down, data-driven culture of privacy based on zero trust, data encryption and the ethical use of data.”</p>



 And that’s where&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>&nbsp;can help. Sudo Platform is the complete privacy and cybersafety toolkit for integrating next generation identity protection and privacy into your brand’s products and services.&nbsp;

 Highlights <p>The Ontology global community is constantly growing, with membership now close to 110,000. More and more Ontology contributors are working together for the long-term, healthy development of Ontology projects. This week, another Ontology member from the English community became an Ontology Harbinger. We currently have 14 enthusiastic Ontology Harbingers, who come from all over the world and work in different fields. They are active in different language communities of Ontology, including English, Filipino, Hindi, etc. They share their ideas, organize various community activities, and are committed to building a better Ontology ecosystem.</p> Latest Developments  Development Progress   We have completed the launch of Ontology’s EVM TestNet and are 93% finished with testing. At the same time, a large number of community developers are actively participating in the “<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontologys-evm-testnet-officially-deployed-now-opening-evm-compatible-public-beta-to-developers-6dddc2bdd764">Security Vulnerabilities and Threat Intelligence Bounty Program</a>”, launched by Ontology and SlowMist.  We have finalized Ethereum RPC support and have fully completed internal testing. The TestNet has been synchronized online; we are 93% done with&nbsp;testing.  We have completed 100% of Ontology’s Ethereum account system development and the TestNet has been synchronized online; we are 94% done with&nbsp;testing.  The EVM/OEP-4 asset seamless transfer technical solution, which facilitates the efficient conversion between OEP-4 assets and EVM assets, is complete and the TestNet has been synchronized online; we are 95% done with&nbsp;testing.  We are 100% done with the survey on the improvement of the decimals of ONT and ONG and we are in the process of internal&nbsp;testing.  The ontology-go-sdk and ontology-java-sdk support ONT and ONG decimals&nbsp;updates.  We are 10% done with the survey on the RISCV’s simplified instruction set architecture.   Product Development   ONTO App v4.1.1 was released, adding support for the Harmony Chain, wallet switching function for dApps supporting multiple chains, and support for configuration of token&nbsp;unit.  ONTO hosted a campaign with <a href="https://theontoteam.medium.com/60c8fb4fcc08">BabySwap</a>, the first 100 participants, and top 20 participants who stake the most will receive the highest tier of rewards. Voting for ONTO in BabySwap also has a chance to get extra rewards. The event is in progress, and will end at 07:59 (Singapore time) on November&nbsp;27th.    ONTO hosted a campaign with <a href="https://medium.com/onto/onto-x-mcdex-host-trading-campaign-over-6000-up-for-grabs-7785f0dbabec">MCDEX</a>, the first 300 participants will receive rich rewards. The event is in progress, and will end at 17:00 (Singapore time) on November&nbsp;26th.    ONTO hosted a campaign with <a href="https://medium.com/onto/onto-ocp-finance-team-up-for-staking-campaign-4500-up-for-grabs-4189a1662da5">OCP Finance</a>, the first 150 participants, and top 20 participants who stake the most will receive the highest tier of rewards. Participants who meet certain conditions will have the chance to enter a lottery. The event is in progress, and will end at 17:00 (Singapore time) on November&nbsp;24th.   On-Chain Activity   121 total dApps on MainNet as of November 22th,&nbsp;2021.  6,823,269 total dApp-related transactions on MainNet, an increase of 6,162 from last&nbsp;week.  16,733,530 total transactions on MainNet, an increase of 26,331 from last&nbsp;week.   Community Growth   1,295 new members joined our global community this week, and <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1461272979376160769?s=20">Geoff Richards</a> from the English community officially became a Ontology Harbinger. This excellent community member will bring more new energy to our community, and also welcome more new members to <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">join&nbsp;us</a>.  Ontology published the next couple of interviews in its Harbinger Series. <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/ontology-harbinger-interview-series-geoff-2cfe6bbc5f2">Geoff Richards</a> from our English community said that compared with other blockchain communities, members of the Ontology community are more willing to help people by sharing their own experiences. The community also attaches great importance to the voice of each member, and can listen to their problems, suggestions and various solutions in&nbsp;time.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1461416416788328448?s=20">weekly Discord Community Call</a>, led by Humpty Calderon, our Head of Community. He focused on how decentralized identity empowers the metaverse; The metaverse requires the unity and integrity of our identities. Ontology’s decentralized identity solution can be seamlessly integrated into metaverse games to generate a unified identity based on the user’s behavior, which is convenient for users to use in various&nbsp;games.  We held our <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork/status/1460190696451624960?s=20">Telegram weekly Community Call</a>, led by Benny, an Ontology Harbinger from our Asian community. He discussed with community members about Ontology’s Staking strategy and upcoming 4th anniversary NFT event; Community members expressed their great anticipation for this extraordinary commemorative event.  As always, we’re active on <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">Telegram</a> where you can keep up with our latest developments and community updates.   Ontology in the&nbsp;Media <p>Forbes — <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/seansteinsmith/2021/11/08/crypto-is-the-key-to-the-metaverse/?sh=7ea96ad91e94&amp;utm_source=TWITTER&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=5893818776&amp;utm_campaign=sprinklrForbesCrypto">Crypto Is The Key To The Metaverse</a></p><blockquote>The promise of the metaverse is that it will provide users an augmented reality experience that — in many ways — might exceed physical reality in terms of the experiences and opportunities therein. What is oftentimes missing from the discussions around the potential of the metaverse is how all of this information will be secured and protected. Specifically, if an individual or group of individuals are going to be engaging with other people in a virtual environment there needs to be some form of assurance that these transactions are&nbsp;secure.</blockquote><blockquote>Hacks and data breaches occur on a frequent basis, but if people are going to be expected to engage in a wholly online and virtual environment, the underlying platform on which they are going to be using needs to be&nbsp;secure.</blockquote><p>After long-term practice, the Ontology Decentralized Identity (DID) solution has been proven to be able to achieve strong privacy protection, and can seamlessly integrate various applications and platforms. This means that applications in the field of Metaverse can make up for their own deficiencies in privacy protection by integrating Ontology DID solutions, and attract more users to join&nbsp;them.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 Sphonic partners with identity verification platform to offer complete suite of regulatory technology for multi-jurisdicational compliance 
<p>London and Manchester, November 23, 2021: Leading Platform-as-a-Service provider for identity verification, IDnow, has announced its first UK channel partner, Sphonic. The partnership will enable Sphonic to offer a suite of RegTech that meets different global compliance standards via a single API.</p>
<p>The partnership comes at a pivotal time for the industry; according to Gartner’s Market Guide for Identity Proofing and Affirmation, by 2023, 75% of organisations will be using a single vendor with strong identity orchestration capabilities and connections to many other third parties for identity proofing and affirmation, an increase from fewer than 15% currently.</p>
<p>“Given the importance placed on orchestration technology in the overall area of compliance, and the regulatory requirements that continue to drive the agenda when it comes to identity and fraud, it was vital we partnered with an identity verification provider that could vigorously meet the varying obligations that exist right across Europe,” explains Andy Lee, Founder of Sphonic.</p>
<p>“By partnering with IDnow, we are able to offer an ever-more integrated solution that brings all identity profiles into one place for more intelligent identity scoring. And when combined with its enviable relationships with European regulators, IDnow was the ideal choice as we continue to deliver great customer experiences to the highest standards of regulatory compliance.”</p>
<p>Known for its pioneering Know Your Customer (KYC) / Know Your Business (KYB) orchestration technology, Sphonic recently launched its real-time Transactional Monitoring System, which allows fintechs, banks and gaming operators to monitor fraud, Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and affordability data in a single integrated platform. Its suite of RegTech, including KYC, KYB and Fraud and Risk Management also helps compliance teams to build a complete digital picture of each customer in order to fast-track customer onboarding.</p>
<p>James Hudson-Dale, Partnerships Manager at IDnow, adds: “Anti-impersonation and identity fraud is on a worrying upward trend, making it more important than ever for businesses to ensure they are compliant beyond simply box ticking. Our leading identity verification technology will provide Sphonic customers with the option of imposing additional verification methods to ensure the threshold is high quality and the person is who they say they are.</p>
<p>“As our first channel partner, we’re excited to be working with Sphonic to build a truly unique suite of products, that will bring together multiple data sources to ensure clients can accurately verify identities, combat fraud and meet European-wide regulatory requirements while maintaining flexibility of choice.”</p>
<p>IDnow launched into the UK in 2019 and recently announced eightfold year-on-year growth in the region, with demand for its services rising significantly as industries accelerated digitisation in response to the Covid pandemic. This growth is aligned with the global demand the firm is experiencing, with more and more companies around the world deciding to switch to fully digital application processes.</p>
<p>As part of its high-growth strategy, IDnow has expanded its role far beyond offering specific identity verification products and has become recognised as an overarching platform for digital identities with several million transactions per year, used by over 900 customers worldwide, including Canopy, MyCDD, Entain and ICICI.</p>

Check out <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-186-what-is-web3-155d493ac6c5">last week’s report&nbsp;here</a>.</p><p>ICYMI: <a href="https://medium.com/global-id/episode-13-defi-and-identity-compliance-in-a-decentralized-world-5c590f8a484b">EPISODE 13 — DeFi and Identity: Compliance in a decentralized world</a></p><p>This week:</p>  What is a DAO and why does it&nbsp;matter?  Tweet of the week — web2&nbsp;edition  Regulating stablecoins  Stuff happens   1. What is a DAO and why does it&nbsp;matter? <p>Last week,<a href="https://medium.com/global-id/gid-report-186-what-is-web3-155d493ac6c5"> we talked about web3</a> — what it is and how it’s different from web1 and web2 (with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jezH_7qEk50">a little help from Chris&nbsp;Dixon</a>).</p><p>This week, we’re talking about DAOs and why they might be crucial to the development of web3. DAO stands for decentralized autonomous organization. Really, it’s just another framework for running and managing an organization — powered by tools for governance, collective wallets, and identity.</p><p>I remember people talking about the concept as early as 2013 (although the conversation probably started even before then). Mike Hearn was sort of the smart contracts guru back then and one of the leading voices on the subject — here’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVyv4t0OKe4">a talk he gave at the Turing Festival that&nbsp;year</a>.</p>A DAO owning a copy of the U.S. Constitution? Why not. (Besides Ken Griffin.)<p>Fast forward 8 years and what was once a concept is now a reality. DAOs are a thing now — like <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/11/17/constitutiondao-raises-27m-on-eve-of-sothebys-auction-people-could-be-the-reason/">this organization that recently made headlines for raising money and attempting to buy a copy of the American Constitution</a>.</p><p>One of the central features of web2 is corporation controlled, closed and proprietary networks — maybe not so different from the early days of the internet when you logged onto AOL or Compuserve.</p><p>There’s nothing inherently wrong with a public corporation that reports to shareholders. It’s been a wildly successful framework ever since it was developed by the Dutch, underpinning our modern financial system.</p><p>But there might be an inherent conflict when it comes to data and profit hungry corporations running our networks. Chris Dixon has been on a tear lately when it comes to talking about the next chapter of the internet so I’ll <a href="https://adjacentpossible.substack.com/p/lets-run-the-experiment-a-conversation">let him take it from&nbsp;here</a>:</p><blockquote>My conclusion after observing and participating in this over roughly 20 years is that it’s not a problem with the people but a problem with the model. The core issue is there is a fundamental misalignment between the needs of a corporation and the needs of a network. Corporate-owned networks follow a predictable life cycle. When they start out, they try to attract users and 3rd-party complements like software developers and creative people. As they grow in popularity and move up the adoption S-curve, their power over users and 3rd parties steadily&nbsp;grows.</blockquote><blockquote>When they hit the top of the S-curve, their relationships with network participants change from positive-sum to zero-sum. The easiest way to continue growing involves extracting money and data from users and complements. The most famous historical examples of this are Microsoft vs. Netscape, Google vs. Yelp, Facebook vs. Zynga, and Twitter vs. its 3rd-party clients, but it happens at a smaller scale everyday, with almost every company that operates a network. (I wrote <a href="https://cdixon.org/2018/02/18/why-decentralization-matters">an essay</a> a few years ago that goes into more detail on the&nbsp;topic).</blockquote><blockquote>A company can try to resist this logic but it’s extremely difficult. The reality is that if your goal is to optimize revenue to the company, shutting down APIs, algorithmically manipulating users, harvesting personal information for better ad targeting, reducing revenue shares, and all the things people don’t like about internet companies is the optimal strategy. If you don’t behave this way, your competitors will, and they’ll make more money, the stock market will reward them with a higher market cap, they’ll attract the best talent, will reinvest more money back into the product and datacenters and marketing and so forth, and they’ll&nbsp;win.</blockquote><p>Which leads us to&nbsp;DAOs:</p><blockquote>The word DAO is probably overloaded at this point, but in short refers to a new kind of organization that uses blockchains in the way I alluded to above. In some loose sense open source software projects ranging from Linux to Ethereum are DAOs. They make decisions about software and network upgrades via roaming groups of users and developers on various websites discussing and arguing over things. It’s chaotic but mostly works. These systems use “off-chain” governance in which network participants “vote” by deciding whether and how to upgrade the software they are&nbsp;running.</blockquote><p>DeFi is a hot topic here at GlobaliD and Hard Yaka. It also happens that many DeFi projects are already formed as DAOs. Here’s Dixon&nbsp;again:</p><blockquote>A few years ago, people started asking whether these governance systems could be improved by using “on-chain” governance, which basically means giving network participants a more formal way to vote using tokens. Probably the first and most important on-chain DAO is called MakerDAO. MakerDAO is a complex system for generating what are known as stablecoins (it’s a fascinating system — here’s <a href="https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper">the whitepaper</a> that describes it). I won’t go into the details but the key idea is the system has a governance token which lets the holders propose and vote on decisions including system upgrades. Maker has weekly community calls and a rotating group of core members who do the heavy lifting. It has generally worked quite well both as a product and as a community. Maker’s model has become the standard in an area known as decentralized finance (DeFi). Uniswap, Compound, and Aave are other examples of popular protocols that employ that DAO model. In my view this experiment has been a success so far, although it’s still very&nbsp;early.</blockquote><p>Dixon also discusses the domain name system (DNS) — an inspiration for the GlobaliD namespace — as another DAO opportunity. (Apparently, the company that manages dot org domains was almost bought out by a private equity&nbsp;firm.)</p><p>The central point here for Dixon is that DAOs address that central conflict between corporations and networks:</p><blockquote>The other appealing thing about DAOs — and what makes them superior to the web2 model I discussed above — is they remove the misalignment between the company and the network by eliminating the company altogether and shifting the economic and governance rights to the network. (For tax purposes there will likely need to be legal entities, at least in the US, but these will have a limited, administrative role). A properly constructed DAO does this by memorializing the rules around economics and governance from the very start, using smart contracts on blockchains like Ethereum. As the networks grow, and move up the adoption S-curve, they might be drawn toward consolidating power but they’ll be prevented from doing so by the blockchain-enforced rules. We like to say instead of “don’t be evil” it’s “can’t be evil.” Instead of relying on human nature improving, we are baking the rules into the&nbsp;code.</blockquote><p>For Chris, “web3 generally and DAOs more specifically can help course correct the internet back to its original, idealistic vision: power and money pushed to the edges, networks growing and flourishing together, a level playing field for talent anywhere in the world, a thriving creative middle class, and a generally diverse and interesting place.”</p><p>That’s the next chapter and we’re right at the&nbsp;start.</p>  Check out <a href="https://adjacentpossible.substack.com/p/lets-run-the-experiment-a-conversation">the full conversation</a>.

Tweet of the week — web2&nbsp;edition <p><a href="https://twitter.com/matthuang/status/1460107828207570952">Matt Huang</a>:</p> 3. Regulating stablecoins <p>Crafting smart regulations is hard. Trying to apply traditional models to new disruptive frameworks is even harder. We know that the powers that be want to regulate stablecoins. Anyone who has ever <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-mystery-where-s-the-69-billion-backing-the-stablecoin-tether">read anything about Tether</a> and how it operates probably understands why that might be necessary.</p><p>But again, crafting smart regulations is&nbsp;hard.</p><p>Matt Levine has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-11-15/moviepass-is-back-will-it-be-the-next-gamestop">a good overview of the current situation</a>:</p><blockquote>But here is <a href="https://www.davispolk.com/insights/client-update/us-regulators-speak-stablecoin-and-crypto-regulation">a memo from Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell LLP</a> that points out something even stranger: Under the proposed rules, it would be impossible to do stablecoins the good simple way. If you wanted to set up a stablecoin under these proposed rules, you’d need to do it in a bank. So you set up Stablecoin Bank Corp. You issue $1 billion of stablecoins and invest the money in $1 billion of extremely safe stuff, Treasury bills expiring tomorrow or whatever. And then the banking regulators would come to you and say: No, this doesn’t work, if you have $1 billion of Treasuries <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/12/3.10">you need $40 million of equity</a>; that is a central rule of bank capital regulation, that you need equity alongside your deposits. And then as you issue more stablecoins you have to raise more equity, and it is hard to get a decent return on equity if you’re investing in only the very safest things. 7 So you are forced to reach for yield, to buy riskier things with higher yields in order to make a return on equity — you know, like banks&nbsp;do.</blockquote><p>Relevant:</p>  <a href="https://www.davispolk.com/insights/client-update/us-regulators-speak-stablecoin-and-crypto-regulation">U.S. regulators speak on stablecoin and crypto regulation</a>  <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/let-crypto-regulate-itself">Let Crypto Regulate&nbsp;Itself</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/15/president-biden-signs-infrastructure-bill-containing-crypto-broker-reporting-requirement-into-law/">President Biden Signs Infrastructure Bill Containing Crypto Broker Reporting Requirement Into&nbsp;Law</a>  <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/17/india-to-ban-crypto-as-payment-method-but-regulate-as-asset-report/">India to Ban Crypto as Payment Method but Regulate as Asset:&nbsp;Report</a>  <a href="https://doomberg.substack.com/p/the-sec-crackdown-on-defi-is-imminent">The SEC Crackdown on DeFi is&nbsp;Imminent</a>  <a href="https://future.a16z.com/stablecoins-stability-and-financial-inclusion/">Stablecoins, Stability, and Financial Inclusion — Future</a>  <a href="https://www.axios.com/currency-comptroller-nominee-omarova-hearing-d8679447-4c6d-4b9f-b2e0-9ee5bec162fd.html">Biden’s top bank regulator nomination at risk after tense&nbsp;hearing</a>  <a href="https://www.ledgerinsights.com/china-catches-fraudsters-central-bank-digital-currency-cbdc-for-money-laundering/">China catches fraudsters using central bank digital currency for money laundering — Ledger Insights — enterprise blockchain</a>  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftc-khan-us-chamber-11637288699">WSJ News Exclusive | Business Group Challenges Lina Khan’s Agenda at Federal Trade Commission</a>   4.

 Ontology Partners with Decentralized Mobility Platform bloXmove To Bring Interoperable Decentralized Identity To Urban Transport Apps <p>bloXmove will integrate Ontology’s decentralized identity protocol to help make the urban transport app industry easier to use, more private, and more&nbsp;secure</p><p><a href="https://ont.io/">Ontology</a>, the project bringing trust, privacy, and security to Web3 through decentralized identity and data solutions, has announced a partnership with <a href="https://bloxmove.com/">bloXmove</a>, a business-to-business mobility blockchain platform designed to simplify travel across multiple forms of transportation by connecting mobility apps and reducing the need for users to switch between&nbsp;them.</p><p>The rapid increase in the digitization of transport and emergence of digital mobility apps enabling individuals to avail of cars, scooters, bikes, flight and train tickets, and more has resulted in a fragmented infrastructure that requires users to sign-up to various applications over and over again. This has led to a proliferation of data exchange, as users are increasingly required to hand over sensitive data.</p><p>Addressing these problems, this partnership will see bloXmove integrate Ontology’s decentralized digital identity protocol (DID) into its platform, providing users with a decentralized identifier that will allow them to share their verifiable credentials, such as driving licenses, in a way that is totally private, secure and encrypted. It will also allow them to store a host of identifiers securely in one place, enabling reuse of the same identifier for multiple modes of transport, whilst remaining assured that their private information is&nbsp;safe.</p><p>Li Jun, Founder of Ontology said: “The fragmentation of the urban transport industry means there is a great need to fortify user security and data through decentralized technologies. bloXmove is doing amazing work to streamline the user journey and now, by integrating Ontology’s DID and data solutions, the whole ecosystem will be made easier to navigate, more private, and more secure. Following on from our previous partnership with bloXmove incubator and Mercedes parent Daimler Mobility to develop <a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/welcome-home-is-now-approved-f8aada08a1bc">Welcome Home</a>, we are proud to be continuing to bring tangible use cases for blockchain and decentralized identity to the transport industry. We look forward to supporting bloXmove in creating the biggest global mobility alliance connecting bikes, scooters, car-sharing, trains and&nbsp;more.”</p><p>With bloXmove, settlements can be automated and secured via BLXM, the bloXmove token. Ontology will support token generation for bloXmove, whose access token smart contracts will be deployed on the Ontology chain. In addition, by leveraging Ontology’s blockchain technology, bloXmove will also achieve interoperability with other public blockchains while improving efficiency and lowering&nbsp;costs.</p><p>Dr. Harry Behrens, CTO and Co-Founder of bloXmove, said, “We are honored to partner with Ontology to combine bloXmove Mobility Blockchain Platform with their state-of-the-art DID Technology. Decentralized Identifiers (DID) are the crucial addition to Blockchain to create real-world business applications. This collaboration will bring us to the next level of mobility service roaming and decentralization. Easy access to mobility should not mean a compromise on privacy and data security for our users, which is why we have partnered with Ontology to strengthen our offering and provide our users with new, even more secure ways to share their information when using mobility&nbsp;apps.”</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

 As Canadian and European governments prepare to issue digital identities to their citizens (e.g., passports, driver’s licences, health cards), ensuring ownership, control and interoperability of data is paramount. 
<p>Gatineau, Québec and Toronto, Ontario</p>
<p>In February 2021, Northern Block released a <a href="https://northernblock.io/products/ssi-enterprise-cloud/features/">suite of self-sovereign identity products</a> (branded as NB Orbit) to facilitate the adoption of digital trust ecosystems. Knowing that government digital identity initiatives require the use of open source code, specifications and standards, Northern Block ensured its products were architected around them. They also continued contributing in the open source at the Trust over IP Foundation, the DIACC and in Hyperledger Aries.</p>
<p>Hyperledger Aries is a toolkit aimed to provide a shared, reusable, interoperable tool kit designed for initiatives and solutions focused on creating, transmitting and storing verifiable digital credentials. It includes a shared cryptographic storage for blockchain clients as well as a communications protocol for allowing off-ledger interactions between those clients. In order to kickstart their decentralized identity initiatives, Canadian and European governments (<a href="https://northernblock.io/idunion-germany-bold-ssi-strategy/">example</a>) have selected Hyperledger Aries as their technology stack of choice.</p>
<p><br>
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2jTA2XAI4pqF53OEQNxpgO?si=XVTCzI2nSP-0sn31-qVoNg&amp;dl_branch=1">Check out this podcast episode to learn about Open Data and Tech Standards, and to better understand Why Governments Are Choosing Aries and Indy.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>“Northern Block has committed itself to compliance with open source projects which lead to the interoperability of verifiable credentials. We are part of a vibrant digital identity ecosystem that knows that digital sovereignty can only be achieved through open sourced auditable systems. We’re proud to support and contribute to it,” says Mathieu Glaude, CEO of Northern Block.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://idlab.org/en/home/">Digital Identity Laboratory of Canada</a> (“IDLab”) evaluates conformance of wallet technology providers to the Hyperledger Aries Interoperability Profile. The IDLab is an independent Canadian non-profit entity dedicated to advancing digital trust by breaking down barriers to digital ID adoption. The IDLab team conducted the testing of the NB Orbit mobile wallet on both iOS and Android devices, running testing within the IDLab’s technology environment.</p>
<p>Pierre Roberge, general manager of the Digital Identity Laboratory of Canada:</p>
<blockquote><p>“The IDLab plays a critical role in scaling and facilitating interoperability of digital trust ecosystems. Acting as a neutral and trusted third party, the IDLab confirms conformity to technology and standards. Northern Block, an early user of the IDLab has successfully demonstrated the conformance of the NB Orbit mobile wallet with AiP v1, which many governments are asking for as a starting point.”</p></blockquote>
<p>With the mission to unlock digital trust for the public and private sector, Northern Block will continue to collaborate with industry partners such as the IDLab to further the maturity of critical frameworks.</p>

<p>Conversion rate is crucial for financial institutions. Having an onboarding process that maximizes this is increasingly important in a digitised world. Getting <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/customer-onboarding-banking-balance-security-ux/">the balance right between security and customer experience</a>, however, is essential.</p>



<p>A recent <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/evolution-id-verification-idnow-platform/">webinar</a> from IDnow looked at this concept. Having the right level of friction in your solutions is vital in achieving the best possible conversion rates while also keeping fraudsters at bay and avoiding fines from regulators.</p>



<p>IDnow’s products are designed with this in mind. The company offers a full set of solutions to efficiently onboard users and to combat fraud. These are delivered through a common platform, with a well-developed focus on the user experience.</p>



 The digital onboarding process in banking 



<p>Digital onboarding has become much more important in banking over the past years. The number of adults accessing finances online increased from 35% to 69% over the ten years to 2018. This has only increased further due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent study by consultancy McKinsey suggested that the pandemic has pushed us seven years ahead in digital transformation.</p>



<p>This increase brings challenges with it. Customers expect to be verified and accepted quickly, with a streamlined and bug-free onboarding process. At the same time, it is increasingly important to carry out security and identity checks to meet updated regulations and protect against rising levels of fraud and financial crime.</p>



<p>Many financial institutions in Europe and the UK are struggling with this. Onboarding and KYC processes are often old and inefficient, perhaps having evolved from previous manual processes. A refresh of these can offer better security as well as an improved customer experience.</p>



 IDnow’s identity verification solution is designed to prevent fraud 



<p>A well-designed and feature-rich solution is needed to meet this balance between security and user friction. IDnow’s AI-powered solution AutoIdent aims to offer just this.</p>



<p>AutoIdent developed from earlier methods of video-based identification (see IDnow VideoIdent) to offer an automated AI-based verification solution. This will carry out a series of automated checks on users’ identity documents and appearance via a biometric selfie. Differently from other vendors, our platform is a natively video-based solution and never relies on a static picture alone. We extract hundreds of frames on both document and biometric verification.</p>



<p>It also offers a hybrid approach with the backup of manual verification. If the AI is not confident on a particular case, or the user is waiting too long for results, it can fall back to a manual verification where an agent will decide if it`s a pass or fraud. The same checks can then be carried out this way, without further inconvenience to the user. These can be handled by IDnow specialists or routed to our clients` internal staff.</p>



<p>A combined approach like this ensures the highest security for identity verification and causes the least hassle for the user.</p>



<p>Identity verification is not enough on its own in many cases – including areas of financial services. IDnow’s single platform also has other anti-fraud solutions built in. This includes document hologram checking capabilities, NFC verification and video liveness detection.</p>



 Solutions comply with the latest regulations 



<p>KYC and AML are highly regulated areas. Such regulation has increased over the past decades to keep pace with the changes in financial crime and terrorism.</p>



<p>IDnow’s solutions are fully compliant with European and UK regulations. One single platform that complies with regulations in the UK and across Europe is increasingly valuable since Brexit. Solutions meet the latest 6AMLD regulations and fully conform with European eIDAS standards for <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/qualified-electronic-signature-the-eidas-eu-regulation/">Qualified Electronic Signatures</a>. IDnow offers full <a href="https://www.idnow.io/aml-screening-monitoring/">AML screening</a> (PEPs, Sanctions, Adverse Media checking, Watch-list, etc.) together with on-going monitoring for a compliant KYC process in multiple jurisdictions.</p>



<p>Read on:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/id-verification-autoident-meeting-eu-regulations/">ID Verification with AutoIdent – meeting European Regulations</a></p>



 Verification with the most advanced technologies – and this continues to develop 



<p>AI-based verification makes the process straightforward and seamless for the user but with plenty of advanced methods in use.</p>



<p>IDnow’s AI and machine learning-based system runs various text and visual checks on documents. This includes automated hologram protection by checking reflections at different angles of the identity document. Video and biometric check ownership of identities. These are well-developed solutions able to combat known fraud techniques, such as lookalike images or the use of silicone masks.</p>



<p>NFC functionality has been added recently. This is currently used to read German identity cards, but the solution can be easily expanded as it fully meets the global ICAO 9303 standard.</p>



<p>These technologies meet top security regulations. Image and video likeness technologies, for example, meet the highest NIST standards for anti-spoofing.</p>



 Ensuring the best user experience 



<p>Security is vital, but to get top conversion rates, you need to focus as well on the customer experience. If onboarding takes too long or the experience is not a good one, you risk losing customers.</p>



<p>Reducing friction points and understanding exactly what users are prepared to deal with is a key part of this. Onboarding is possibly the users’ first experience of your brand, and it should feel seamless and straightforward.</p>



<p>There is more to the user experience than just speed and branding, though. Customers want to feel safe and have a verification process that completes accurately and automatically. IDnow’s products have been developed with extensive feedback collected from end-users incorporated into the processes to make them as intuitive as possible.</p>



<p>AutoIdent provides users with real-time feedback during the verification process. Users are guided through overcoming issues that are impacting verification. This could be things such as document position or lighting conditions.</p>



<p>Fallback methods also help the user experience and conversion rate. If the AI does not succeed, users can be verified via an agent. Companies that only offer an AI-based solution will struggle to retain customers when verification fails, or users need more support. Bear in mind that not all users are fully tech-savvy!<br><br>Read more on: <a href="https://www.idnow.io/blog/consumer-choice-identity-verification/">Why offering multiple identity verification options can become a competitive advantage</a>.</p>



 In Conclusion – get the balance between security and user experience right 



<p>Advanced security features and methods, regulation compliance, and a seamless customer experience come together in creating a great onboarding and identity verification solution. Getting the balance right is essential in achieving the best possible customer conversion rate.</p>



<p>I believe that IDnow has developed a solution that gets this balance between security and user friction right. In doing so, it helps businesses boost their conversion rate while also meeting regulations and protecting them from financial crime</p>



<p>You can find out more by viewing our <a href="https://www.idnow.io/portfolio/evolution-id-verification-idnow-platform/">full webinar</a>. This looks in more detail at the journey of identity verification to today’s solutions and the important balance achieved.

  IT endpoints are no longer just workstations and servers confined to corporate headquarters, branch offices, customer sites, and data centers, they can now be just about anything located anywhere, from employee homes to airports, hotels and in the cloud. But every endpoint represents a potential entry point for cyber attackers, and needs to be managed.

				   The Perfect Signature Style is the Enemy of the One that Works Today 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicio Senior Architect Sam Curren talks about how BBS+ signature styles are not going to be ready for deployment anytime soon, but that shouldn’t stop you from building today in a way that allows you to add them later. He also touches on the pros and cons of waiting when it comes to the newest technologies, and why its usually better not to wait.</p>

<p>Orange Finance: The Mythical Beings NFT card collection built on Ardor blockchain will soon have a bridge to OpenSea on Polygon, one of Ethereum’s Layer 2 blockchains. This article explains the impact of such integration, the benefits to card collectors, and the new dynamics of the game. To reduce the fragmented NFT space and for one of the most active sets to be counted in the main ranking pages, the Tarasca team has decided to convert Mythical Beings cards into multi-chain objects, able to move into different blockchains without losing their scarcity attributes. Thanks to Ignis smart contracts, the help of the Jelurida developers and the community member Tre, a new bridge model was designed, which turns the entire Ardor platform into a cross-chain technology.</p>

				  BBS+ signature styles are not going to be ready for deployment anytime soon. This is precisely why you should build today and in a way that allows you to add them later.<br>
  
			  
				
				
				 <p>Sam Curren, Senior Architect<br><br>New technology is inevitable: some of it will be evolutionary, some of it will be revolutionary; some of it will eat your business, and some of it might change the world and make life better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do you know when to wait and when to jump?</p>
<p>This is the dilemma for many people looking at decentralized identity right now. Is it ready to be implemented, are there “off-the-shelf” products I can use—or will it all be so much better next week or in a month or in a year?</p>
<p>The dilemma seems to divide the decentralized identity community. Standards groups and initiatives advocate for the best possible solution, in the hope that it will eventually exist, while companies building solutions—like Indicio—say “build now because what we have works and works well and can be added to later. The ‘better’ may never come but the good—especially if open source—will continually get better and be relatively easy to upgrade.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>But we believe our position is not just a matter of business logic: There’s a massive downside to letting failing technology—our current centralized and federated ways of managing identity—continue to fail businesses and consumers, citizens and governments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This downside is vastly greater than any of the differences between decentralized identity technologies that can be used today, those in development, and those hypothesized as being available sometime in the future.</p>
<p>Don’t turn BBS+ into a minus<br>This issue is not abstract. Right now, there is much discussion around JSON-LD <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ldp-bbs2020/">BBS+</a>&nbsp;being “the” standard for managing verifiable credential key signatures in decentralized identity systems. The Good Health Pass, for example, recommends BBS+ for Covid digital credentials.</p>
<p>BBS+ is good and Indicio is excited about adding it to its options for customers building decentralized solutions. But we can’t do so because BBS+&nbsp; is still under development and it’s unclear when the final version will be available. Meanwhile, we have JSON-ZKP-CL Signatures that provide the ingredient BBS+ is working to add: privacy preserving predicate (zero-knowledge)&nbsp; proofs and blinded identity binding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Predicate proofs mean that you are able to generate a proof of something—such as age—without having to disclose the actual information, and they are a boon to preserving privacy.</p>
<p>When thinking about BBS+, it is important to remember that credential format is just one part of a larger system that must be developed. Governance, Issuance and Verification agents, Holder apps, and more all need to be implemented; user experience must be developed; business relationships created: Decentralized identity is an ecosystem of infrastructure, software and governance working together as a product. All of these things can be deployed using existing production-ready credential formats. And the gains made now will translate into the future adoption of BBS+.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bigger point is this: Decentralized identity is at a breakthrough point. Governments in Canada and Germany have decided that verifiable credentials are the way forward; pilots and consumer products are being unveiled on a weekly basis. This is not the moment to say, “let’s wait;”&nbsp; this is the moment to say “let’s scale.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Indicio, we’ve shown how to make decentralized ecosystems work to solve real problems for lots of customers. In building, we’ve advanced the tech. In advancing the tech, we’ve built more solutions. This is the virtuous cycle of innovation and scale that we’re creating. We will add BBS+ into our products when it is available. But until then, we’re going to build solutions that BBS+ can be added to—and we think you should too.</p>

             November 2021   
	 
		 
			 Are you ready to digitize yourself in the metaverse? 
<p>The metaverse has been a hot topic of late. As Facebook rebranded to Meta, a lot of attention has turned towards projects focused on this alternate reality. Decentraland’s MANA token reached a new all-time high, and companies such as Roblox saw big increases in share prices.</p>
<p>As is always the case with nascent technologies, the rise of metaverse platforms has brought some issues. Here are a few:</p>
 
 Unfiltered content&nbsp;– anyone can access any type of content, and considering a large amount of the user base are teenagers, this is concerning. 
 Accessibility problems&nbsp;– gaining access to metaverse platforms is a pain when you consider how many accounts you need for various web services. 
 Loss of virtual assets&nbsp;– anything purchased in the metaverse can simply be lost, and the tokens representing these assets can never be recovered. 
 Privacy concerns&nbsp;– users are increasingly concerned about privacy issues and protecting their data, with this not being helped by Facebook throwing their hat in the virtual ring. 
 
<p>The key to solving these issues is abundantly clear:&nbsp;<a href="https://onchainid.com/?utm_campaign=Insights&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--xgmW5PSKnMPgtCeY35vwyzbuRJvRQSGOEv50dRNMZ0tCqXVh5v8F9kSg1LXQXUfQA0_2R">digital identities</a>. Here’s how:</p>
 
 Age restricted content&nbsp;– users log into the metaverse with identities, allowing platforms to appropriately filter certain content and environments. 
 Universal login&nbsp;– like Google authentication, onchain digital identities enable users to log in to different virtual venues in the metaverse via one click. 
 Asset recovery&nbsp;– onchain identities guarantees ownership of virtual assets because tokens can be linked to the identity and not to the wallet. 
 Privacy protected&nbsp;– service providers only need to see the proof of verified information, instead of the actual data, thus alleviating privacy concerns. 
 
<p>As the metaverse gets more and more popular, and with more virtual assets being viewed, bought and sold in this environment, identity will become a core component of this world. Users will need to know who they are dealing with, they will need easy recovery processes in the case of lost wallets. This will be key as the metaverse matures and its ties with digital assets continue to strengthen.</p>

<p>We are delighted to introduce two new additions to the KILT ecosystem: the Sporran browser extension — the wallet for KILT Coins and credentials — and Stakeboard, the staking platform for&nbsp;KILT.</p> Sporran <p>The <a href="https://www.sporran.org/">Sporran</a> wallet can be used to hold KILT Coins and provides a way for users to sign and submit KILT blockchain transactions. And in early December, users will also be able to use Sporran to store credentials and create a digital identity — similar to the real world when you add credentials like your driver’s license to your physical&nbsp;wallet.</p><p>You could also build several identities — for example, your work identity with all your qualifications, your gaming identity with your rankings, etc. Sporran provides a way to manage and sign transactions with these digital identities on the KILT blockchain. This is designed to restore your control over your own data when you are providing your information to online services.</p><p>Currently, Sporran is available for use as a browser extension on <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sporran/djdnajgjcbjhhbdblkegbcgodlkkfhcl">Google Chrome</a> and<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sporran/"> Firefox</a>. See our guide to creating a Sporran identity&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/How-to-Set-Up-Sporran_22-Nov.pdf">here</a>.</p> Stakeboard <p><a href="https://stakeboard.kilt.io/">Stakeboard</a> is a web application that allows you to interact directly with the KILT blockchain to stake your KILT&nbsp;Coins.</p><p>To participate in staking on Stakeboard you need a KILT Identity (wallet address) with at least 1,001 KILT Coins (1,000 for staking; 1 to cover any transaction costs). Each Identity with this minimum can choose one collator to delegate their coins to. Collators hold the data of the KILT blockchain, collect transactions and build blocks. You can find the list of collators <a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/KILT_Initial-16-Collators_4-Oct.pdf">here</a> and on community sites like <a href="https://stakekilt.com/">StakeKILT.com</a>.</p><p>When the chosen collator successfully produces blocks, their delegator can receive a reward of up to 8% per annum in the first year after launch; 6% in the second year. See our “<a href="https://www.kilt.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/The-7-key-things-you-need-to-know-to-use-Stakeboard_22-Nov.pdf">How to stake on KILT</a>” guide for more details on navigating Stakeboard.</p><p>Sporran and Stakeboard were developed by B.T.E.

<p>Bisherige Lösungen für das Managen von Identitäten sind gekennzeichnet von Datensilos, die einerseits jeder Diensteanbieter mit hohem Aufwand selbst betreibt — oder andererseits von globalen Identitätsanbietern, die den Diensteanbietern diesen Aufwand abnehmen können. Das Problem des isolierten Identitätsmanagements ist, dass der durchschnittliche Internetnutzer über 20 verschiedene Identitäten hat, die separat angelegt und gewartet werden müssen — mit entsprechendem Aufwand und daraus resultierend Inkonsistenzen zwischen den Datensilos. Globale Identitätsmanager wie Google helfen, diese Probleme mit Hilfe des Single-Sign-On unter Nutzung einer Google-ID zu überwinden. Für den Nutzer ist dies bequem und einfach. Jedoch wird die Hoheit über persönliche Daten und deren kommerzielle Verwertung aus der Hand&nbsp;gegeben.</p><p>Vor diesem Hintergrund streben Selbstsouveräne Identitäten (SSI) die Verknüpfung der Nutzerfreundlichkeit einer Google-ID mit einem hohen Grad an Nutzerkontrolle und Privatsphäre an.</p> Was genau ist&nbsp;SSI? <p>SSI bilden die neueste Entwicklungsstufe digitaler Identitäten. Eine Identität meint alle Attribute einer Person, Organisation, oder Gegenstands, die dieses Subjekt definieren. Attribute beschreiben die Charakteristika eines Subjekts. Eine digitale Identität meint hier die digitale Repräsentation dieser Attribute. Je nach Verwendungskontext können verschiedene Teilidentitäten benötigt werden, die nur einen Teil der Attribute umfassen.</p><p>Ein Credential ist ein fälschungssicherer und überprüfbarer Nachweis von Attributen eines Subjekts. Credentials werden in einem persönlichen digitalen Wallet gehalten. Das Subjekt ist der Holder der Nachweise, nachdem es diese von einem Issuer beschafft hat. Ein Issuer stellt Credentials nach einem Schema aus, das eine übergreifende Verwendung und allgemeingültige Interpretation erlaubt. Ein Verifier fordert, z.B. für den Zugriff auf einen Dienst, einen Nachweis einer Berechtigung (ein Credential) von dem zugreifenden Subjekt. Über ein Verifiable Data Registry werden dazu Identifikatoren ausgetauscht, die auf Subjekte, deren Credentials und deren Issuer verweisen können. Das Verifiable Data Registry enthält keine subjektbezogenen Daten.</p>Rollen und Informationsflüsse beim Identitätsmanagement mit SSI (Quelle: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#roles)">https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#roles)</a> Welchen Mehrwert bringt&nbsp;SSI? <p>SSI überwindet das inkonsistente und — für Nutzer als auch Diensteanbieter — aufwändige Identitätsmanagement in isolierten Datensilos und gleichzeitig die Abhängigkeit von bisherigen Single-Sign-On-Identitätsmanagern wie Google und Twitter, die die Anmeldevorgänge der Nutzer kontrollieren, auswerten und verwerten. Mit SSI haben Subjekte wie Personen oder Maschinen eine einzige Identitätsverwaltung (zumindest für einen gewissen Namensraum). Die einer Identität zugeordneten Berechtigungsnachweise müssen nur einmal eingeholt werden und können dann nach Bedarf passgenau für beliebig viele Anmelde- und Nachweisprozesse eingesetzt werden. Analog zur Plastikkärtchen-Identität können die Nachweise geprüft werden, ohne den Herausgeber zu involvieren.</p>Heutiges Identitätsmanagement in Silos vs. Selbstsouveränes Identitätsmanagement (Adaptiert von: <a href="https://digitaleweltmagazin.de/2019/08/12/chancen-der-self-sovereign-identities-ssi-aus-sicht-von-unternehmen-fuer-das-identity-access-management-iam/">https://digitaleweltmagazin.de/2019/08/12/chancen-der-self-sovereign-identities-ssi-aus-sicht-von-unternehmen-fuer-das-identity-access-management-iam/</a>)<p>Für Diensteanbieter vereinfachen sich Onboardingprozesse, das sogenannte Know-your-Customer und die Compliance zu den damit verbundenen Regularien. Zudem sind die bereitgestellten Identitätsinformationen aktuell. Durch die Vereinfachung der Onboardingprozesse werden diese auch mit einer höheren Wahrscheinlichkeit als bislang von den Nutzern abgeschlossen.</p><p>Nutzer von Diensten (beliebige Subjekte, auch Maschinen) können ihre Identität in Plug-and-Play-Manier einsetzen und ihre Identität einfach zwischen verschiedenen Diensten portieren. Das Verwalten und Aktuellhalten von dutzenden Nutzerkonten und das Merken der zugehörigen Passwörter entfällt, da nur noch ein Zugang zum persönlichen Wallet erforderlich ist. Konsequenterweise reduzieren sich auch IT-Sicherheitsprobleme, die durch die Verwendung des gleichen Passworts für verschiedene Nutzerkonten entstehen.</p> Welche Herausforderungen gibt&nbsp;es? <p>Einschränkend kann vermerkt werden, dass die Vorzüge und Nutzbarkeit einer selbstsouveränen Identität sich zunächst auf diejenigen Dienstanbieter beziehen, die auf einer Verifiable Data Registry präsent sind — ähnlich den mobilen Anwendungen auf den App Stores. In Analogie dazu ist ein SSI-Netzwerk umso wertvoller für seine Nutzer, je mehr Dienste darüber nutzbar sind. Schließlich ist hier ein Wachstums- und Konsolidierungsprozess zu erwarten, der über die Durchsetzung von bestimmten Angeboten entscheidet.</p><p>Ein kritischer Gedanke ist, dass mit dem Verifiable Data Registry eine ähnliche Abhängigkeit der Identitäts-Subjekte wie bislang zu den Single-Sign-On-Anbietern aus den Sozialen Medien entstünde. Dieser Gedanke führt jedoch in die Irre, denn das Verifiable Data Registry kann mit Hilfe von Distributed Ledger-Technologie in einem Blockchain-basierten Netzwerk betrieben werden. Mehrere dezentrale Rechenknoten, die von unterschiedlichen Akteuren betrieben werden können, würden das Netzwerk bilden. Oftmals sind hier auch Non-Profit-Organisationen wie <a href="https://sovrin.org/">Sovrin </a>oder die <a href="https://energyweb.org/reports/the-energy-web-chain/">Energy Web Foundation</a> aktiv. Ein deutlicher Kontrast zu den bisherigen Single-Sign-On-Anbietern.</p><p>Ein ausschlaggebender Faktor für den Erfolg von SSI wird sein, dass die Issuer von Credentials das erforderliche Vertrauen herstellen können. Weiterhin wird, wie so oft, die Nutzererfahrung und die daraus resultierende Akzeptanz entscheidend sein. Lösungsanbieter wie Spherity nutzen eine Cloud, um ein <a href="https://medium.com/spherity/multi-party-computation-b4d2a7c3042">nutzerfreundliches Identitätswallet</a> bieten zu können, das auch Private Keys verwahrt und vor dem ungewollten Verlust der Identität schützt.</p> Wer treibt SSI&nbsp;voran? <p>Die Bundesregierung und die Europäische Union sind unter anderem Treiber von SSI. Sie fördern das Entwickeln der Konzepte, Technologie, Standards und Regulierungen bis hin zu Pilotierungen in verschiedensten Branchen und Bereichen.</p><p>Das Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Energie fördert z.B. das <a href="https://digitale-identitaeten.de/">„Schaufenster sichere digitale Identitäten“</a>. Eines der Schaufensterprojekte ist IDunion. <a href="https://idunion.org/">IDunion </a>arbeitet an der Schaffung eines offenen Ökosystems für dezentrale, selbstsouveräne Identitäten. Dazu wird mit Blockchain-Technologie ein verteiltes Identitätsnetzwerk aufgebaut. Das Projekt wird von 47 namhaften Forschungs- und Industriepartnern vorangetrieben. 51nodes ist Partner von&nbsp;IDunion.</p>Schaufensterprojekte Digitale Identitäten (Quelle: <a href="https://digitale-identitaeten.de/schaufensterprojekte/">https://digitale-identitaeten.de/schaufensterprojekte/</a>)<p>Die Europäische Union finanziert z.B. das <a href="https://essif-lab.eu/">„European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework Lab“</a>. 20 Teilprojekte kümmern sich um die Schaffung und Erweiterung eines Open Source-Softwareframeworks für SSI. Weitere 42 Teilprojekte entwickeln kommerzielle Komponenten and Dienste unter Nutzung des SSI-Frameworks.</p> Anwendungsbeispiel: Wie kann SSI der Energiewirtschaft helfen? <p>Vor dem Hintergrund der Energiewende stehen die Betreiber von Übertragungs- und Verteilnetzen für elektrischen Strom vor großen Herausforderungen und neuen gesetzlichen Pflichten. Über eine Million (privater) dezentraler Stromerzeuger müssen effizient und effektiv in bestehende energiewirtschaftliche Prozesse (z.B. der <a href="https://www.next-kraftwerke.de/wissen/regelenergie">Regelleistung</a> und des <a href="https://www.transnetbw.de/de/strommarkt/systemdienstleistungen/redispatch-2-0">Engpassmanagements im Redispatch 2.0</a>) integriert werden.</p>Leistungen und Prozesse der Energiewirtschaft (Quelle: <a href="https://www.next-kraftwerke.de/wissen/systemdienstleistungen">https://www.next-kraftwerke.de/wissen/systemdienstleistungen</a>)<p>Aktuell sind energiewirtschaftliche Prozesse gekennzeichnet durch produktspezifische und teilweise aufwendige Registrierungsprozesse an verschiedenen Stellen. Beispielsweise kann man hier das <a href="https://www.marktstammdatenregister.de/MaStR">Marktstammdatenregister </a>der Bundesnetzagentur, die <a href="https://www.regelleistung.net/">Regelleistungsplattform</a> der Übertragungsnetzbetreiber und die Plattform <a href="https://netz-connectplus.de/home/projekt/">connect+</a> zur Kooperation und zum Datenaustausch der Netzbetreiber nennen. Hinzu kommt eine geringe Motivation der Betreiber von kleinen Energieerzeugungsanlagen und der Sicherung der Aktualität der Daten an den unterschiedlichen Registrierungsorten.</p><p>Die Frage von erforderlichen Nachweisen betrifft z.B. die Art der Stromerzeugung (z.B. EEG-Anlage) bzw. für welches energiewirtschaftliche Produkt die Anlage eingesetzt werden darf und kann. Die Identifikatoren (Energy Identification Code) für Anlagen werden zentral durch den <a href="https://www.energiecodes-services.de/bdew-codes.html">BDEW </a>vergeben. Weiterhin gibt es Vorgaben zur Marktkommunikation durch den Regulator, die mit Hilfe einer Zertifikatinfrastruktur für Signierung und Verschlüsselung erfolgt. D.h. die Zertifikate müssen bei allen genannten Stellen eingepflegt und aktuell gehalten werden. In einem “Internet of Energy”, wenn Millionen von Endkunden mit ihren dezentralen Flexibilitätsanlagen (z.B. Elektromobilität, Heimspeicher, Wärmepumpen, etc.) auf den Energiemarkt drängen, kommen diese Systeme zur Abwicklung der Massenprozesse für Registrierungs- und Veränderungsanforderungen in der notwendigen Geschwindigkeit an ihre&nbsp;Grenzen.</p><p>Der Ansatz von SSI verspricht demgegenüber die Vision der Integration von Millionen von dezentralen Anlagen in die Prozesse und IT-Systeme der Netzwirtschaft in unaufwändiger Plug-and-Play-Manier, ohne dass Mehrfachanmeldungen und parallele Konsistenzhaltung in redundanten isolierten Identitätsmanagementsystemen weiter erforderlich wären. Damit sollten Hürden für Anlagenbetreiber sinken und die Prozesse der Netzwirtschaft können schlanker und reibungsärmer aufgestellt werden. Schließlich würde ein wichtiger Beitrag für das Gelingen der Energiewende geleistet.</p><p>Aktuell arbeitet 51nodes gemeinsam mit dem Übertragungsnetzbetreiber <a href="https://www.transnetbw.de/de">TransnetBW</a> an der Erörterung von SSI im Kontext der Energiewirtschaft. Bislang konnten schon mehr als zehn potenzielle Anwendungsfälle für SSI identifiziert werden.</p> Interesse an&nbsp;SSI? <p><a href="https://www.51nodes.io/">51nodes</a> ist ein Anbieter von Lösungen für die Crypto Economy. 51nodes unterstützt Unternehmen und andere Organisationen bei der Umsetzung ihrer SSI- und Blockchain-Projekte.

<p>🇺🇸 US Infrastructure Bill’s Cryptoasset Reporting Requirements Seen as Overreach</p> 
<p>On November 15th 2021, President Joe Biden signed a<a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684"> bipartisan infrastructure bill</a>. The bill includes new taxation reporting requirements for cryptoasset brokers.<a href="https://republicans-financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=408199"> Observers are concerned</a> with the open-languaged “broker” definition used in the bill which could be interpreted as including any blockchain network participant. Indeed, the “broker” definition of the Internal Revenue Code is supplemented by: ‘‘any person who (for consideration) is responsible for regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets on behalf of another person.’’</p> 
<p>In the infrastructure bill, any person or entity which falls under the definition above will have to comply with the following reporting requirements: “[A]ny broker, with respect to any transfer (which is not part of a sale or exchange executed by such broker) during a calendar year of a covered security which is a digital asset from an account maintained by such broker to an account which is not maintained by, or an address not associated with, a person that such broker knows or has reason to know is also a broker, shall make a return for such calendar year, in such form as determined by the Secretary, showing the information otherwise required to be furnished with respect to transfers subject to subsection (a).’’&nbsp;</p> 
<p>Industry participants were<a href="https://republicans-financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=408199"> quick to react</a> accusing the government of regulatory overreach. Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano,<a href="https://cryptonews.net/en/2733539/"> reacted to the bill stating that</a>:&nbsp; “we are in a slightly bad position today, because the Infrastructure Bill was passed. If it's left to its own devices, by 2023 when these mandates come into place...depending on how they are interpreted and what the IRS does with it, it can cause catastrophic damage.”</p> 
<p>House Representatives, including Patrick McHenry from the House Financial Services Committee,<a href="https://republicans-financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/mhh_026_xml__signed.pdf"> introduced a bipartisan bill titled “Keep Innovation in America Act”</a> to clarify the reporting requirements of “brokers” following the changes made to the Internal Revenue Code. The proposed legislation would amend the supplement to the “broker” definition cited above to: ‘‘any person who (for consideration) stands ready in the ordinary course of a trade or business to effect sales of digital assets at the direction of their customers.’’&nbsp;</p> 
<p>The reporting requirements cited above are also amended to include the following sentence at the end of the paragraph: “Information reported by brokers under this section shall be limited to customer information that is voluntarily provided by the customer and held by the broker for a legitimate business purpose.”</p> 
<p>The changes in the “Keep Innovation in America Act” ensure that the reporting requirements are limited to cryptoasset businesses rather than individuals interacting with the blockchain to validate transactions. The bill proposes to push back the date some of these new requirements come into force to 2026.</p>

<p>🇮🇳 India Continues Exploring Cryptoasset regulation</p> 
<p>Details<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/17/india-to-ban-crypto-as-payment-method-but-regulate-as-asset-report/"> have emerged</a> regarding a cryptoasset regulation bill which is due to be presented to the Indian parliament this winter. The bill will reportedly ban payments using cryptoassets but allow users to trade their assets. Authorities are expected to ban active solicitation, such as advertisements, from cryptoasset business. These reports follow India’s Standing Committee on Finance<a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-parliament-committee-discusses-crypto-regulation-industry-experts/"> inaugural hearing</a> with industry stakeholders on “CryptoFinance: Opportunities and Challenges”' on November 15th 2021. These developments illustrate the government's willingness to move rapidly on cryptoasset regulation as<a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/us-president-working-group-releases-report-on-stablecoins"> Elliptic covered</a> announcements by the Ministry of Finance earlier this month.</p>

<p>🇮🇱 Israel is Adopting New AML Laws for Cryptoassets</p> 
<p>The Israeli’s government<a href="https://www.justice.gov.il/Units/HalbantHon/News/Pages/AML_MSB_order-14112021.aspx"> new anti-money laundering (AML) order</a> for cryptoasset businesses took effect on November 14th 2021. The updated regulation includes a licensing requirement for cryptoasset businesses. According to<a href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/anti-terror-banking-rules-now-apply-to-cryptocurrency-684971"> The Jerusalem Post</a>, the director of the Authority for Combating Terror Financing and Money Laundering, Shlomit Wagman, said this new framework will reduce criminal activity in the cryptoasset ecosystem while increasing the legitimacy of the industry. Members of the industry<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/11/16/israels-new-aml-rules-may-help-banks-onboard-crypto-clients/"> hoped</a> that these new rules will facilitate their relationship with local banks. As Israel ramps up its efforts to regulate the cryptoasset industry, the US Department of the Treasury<a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/accounts/USTREAS/bulletins/2fc3308?reqfrom"> issued a press release</a> detailing a partnership with the Israeli Minister of Finance to combat ransomware on November 15th 2021.</p>

<p>🇰🇷 South Korea is Looking to Tighten Cryptoasset Regulation</p> 
<p>South Korean regulators were criticised by cryptoasset businesses<a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/south-korean-lawmakers-push-back-against-controversial-know-the-sender-rule"> following a hearing on new bills set to regulate the industry</a>. One of the bills would introduce a "know-the-sender" rule. As such, cryptoasset businesses would be obliged to gather information on the identity of the issuer of each transaction they receive. Stakeholders remarked that this rule would be impractical and severely limit the transactions which take place locally. These requirements are akin to the<a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Updated-Guidance-VA-VASP.pdf"> Financial Action Task Force’s “Travel Rule”</a> (Recommendation 16).</p>

<p>🇺🇸 US Department of Justice to Sell Cryptoassets Linked to Fraud</p> 
<p>The US Department of Justice is<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/56-million-seized-cryptocurrency-being-sold-first-step-compensate-victims-bitconnect-fraud"> set to liquidate $56 million in fraud proceeds</a> of a cryptoasset project named BitConnect. This is the largest seizure of cryptoassets by US authorities. BitConnect’s main promoter, Glenn Arcaro, was charged with conspiracy to defraud investors using a Ponzi scheme which gathered more than $2 billion.&nbsp; When ordered by the court, the government will start selling the seized cryptoassets to restitute these funds to the victims. The Department of Justice encourages victims of the fraud to<a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdca/us-v-glenn-arcaro-21cr02542-twr?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery"> reach out</a>.</p>

  <p>If you search for “Full Stack Java” on the internet, you’ll likely find a lot of recruiting, courses, and jobs. Being a full stack developer can be exciting because you can create the backend and frontend of an app all by yourself. There is business logic and algorithms as well as styling, making things look good, and securing everything. It also pays pretty well. Today, I’m going to show you how you can be a full stack Java developer with Spring Boot, React, and JHipster.</p>

<p>Prerequisites:</p>

 
   <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js 14+</a> 
   <a href="https://sdkman.io">Java 11+</a> 
   <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">Docker Compose</a> 
 

<p>If you’re on Windows, you may need to install the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a> for some commands to work.</p>

<p>I recommend using SDKMAN to manage your OpenJDK installations. Just run <code>sdk install java 11.0.2-open</code> to install Java 11 and <code>sdk install java 17-open</code> for Java 17.</p>

<p>This tutorial won’t provide the nitty-gritty details on how to write code in Java, React, or Spring Boot. That’s because JHipster will write most of the code for you! However, if you’re brand new to programming with these technologies, I recommend the following resources:</p>

 
   <a href="https://dev.java/learn/">Oracle’s Learn Java Tutorials</a> 
   <a href="https://spring.io/guides">Spring Guides</a> 
   <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html">Tutorial: Intro to React</a> 
 

<p>You can skip around between sections of this tutorial using the table of contents below.</p>

   <code>git clone https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example
</code>   

 Full Stack Development with React and Spring Boot 

<p>One of the easiest ways to get started with React is by using <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/">Create React App</a> (CRA). You install it locally, then run <code>create-react-app &lt;project&gt;</code> to generate a React application with minimal dependencies. It uses webpack under-the-covers to build the project, launch a web server, and run its tests.</p>

<p>Spring Boot has a similar tool called <a href="https://start.spring.io/">Spring Initializr</a>. Spring Initializer is a bit different than CRA because it’s a website (and API) that you can create applications with.</p>

<p>Today, I’ll show you how to build a Flickr clone with React and Spring Boot. However, I’m going to cheat. Rather than building everything using the aforementioned tools, I’m going to use JHipster. JHipster is an application generator that initially only supported Angular and Spring Boot. Now it supports Angular, React, and Vue for the frontend. JHipster also has support for <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/modules/official-blueprints/">Kotlin, Micronaut, Quarkus, .NET, and Node.js</a> on the backend.</p>

<p>In this tutorial, we’ll use React since it seems to be <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=angular,react,vuejs">the most popular</a> frontend framework nowadays.</p>

 Get Started with JHipster 7 

<p>If you haven’t heard of <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech">JHipster</a>, boy do I have a treat for you! JHipster started as a Yeoman application generator back in 2013 and has grown to become a development platform. It allows you to quickly generate, develop, and deploy modern web apps and microservice architectures. Today, I’ll show you how to build a Flickr clone with JHipster and lock it down with OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC).</p>

<p>To get started with JHipster, you’ll need a fast internet connection and Node.js installed. The project recommends you use the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version, which is 14.7.6 at the time of this writing. To run the app, you’ll need to have Java 11 installed. If you have Git installed, JHipster will auto-commit your project after creating it. This will allow you to upgrade between versions.</p>

<p>Run the following command to install JHipster:</p>

   <code>npm i -g generator-jhipster@7
</code>   

<p>To create a full-stack app with JHipster, create a directory, and run <code>jhipster</code> in it:</p>

   <code>mkdir full-stack-java
cd full-stack-java
jhipster
</code>   

<p>JHipster will prompt you for the type of application to create and what technologies you’d like to include. For this tutorial, make the following choices:</p>

 Verify Everything Works with Cypress and Keycloak 

<p>When you choose OAuth 2.0 and OIDC for authentication, the users are stored outside of the application rather than in it. You need to configure an identity provider (IdP) to store your users and allow your app to retrieve information about them. By default, JHipster ships with a Keycloak file for Docker Compose. A default set of users and groups is imported at startup, and it has a client registered for your JHipster app.</p>

<p>Here’s what the <code>keycloak.yml</code> looks like in your app’s <code>src/main/docker</code> directory:</p>

   <code># This configuration is intended for development purpose, it's **your** responsibility
# to harden it for production
version: '3.8'
services:
  keycloak:
    image: jboss/keycloak:15.0.2
    command:
      [
          '-b',
          '0.0.0.0',
          '-Dkeycloak.migration.action=import',
          '-Dkeycloak.migration.provider=dir',
          '-Dkeycloak.migration.dir=/opt/jboss/keycloak/realm-config',
          '-Dkeycloak.migration.strategy=OVERWRITE_EXISTING',
          '-Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=1000',
          '-Dkeycloak.profile.feature.upload_scripts=enabled',
      ]
    volumes:
      - ./realm-config:/opt/jboss/keycloak/realm-config
    environment:
      - KEYCLOAK_USER=admin
      - KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=admin
      - DB_VENDOR=h2
    # If you want to expose these ports outside your dev PC,
    # remove the "127.0.0.1:" prefix
    ports:
      - 127.0.0.1:9080:9080
      - 127.0.0.1:9443:9443
      - 127.0.0.1:10990:10990
</code>   

<p>Start Keycloak with the following command in your project’s root directory.</p>

   <code>docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up -d
</code>   

<p>You can verify everything works by starting your app with Maven:</p>

   <code>./mvnw
</code>   

<p>Open another terminal to run your new app’s Cypress tests:</p>

   <code>npm run e2e
</code>   

<p>You should see output like the following:</p>

   <code>  (Run Finished)

       Spec                                              Tests  Passing  Failing  Pending  Skipped

</code>   

 Change Your Identity Provider to Auth0 

<p>JHipster uses Spring Security’s OAuth 2.0 and OIDC support to configure which IdP it uses. When using Spring Security with Spring Boot, you can configure most settings in a properties file. You can even override properties with environment variables.</p>

<p>To switch from Keycloak to Auth0, you only need to override the default properties (for Spring Security OAuth). You don’t even need to write any code!</p>

<p>To see how it works, create a <code>.auth0.env</code> file in the root of your project, and fill it with the code below to override the default OIDC settings:</p>

   <code>export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI=https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=&lt;your-client-id&gt;
export SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=&lt;your-client-secret&gt;
export JHIPSTER_SECURITY_OAUTH2_AUDIENCE=https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/api/v2/
</code>   

<p>WARNING: Modify your existing <code>.gitignore</code> file to have <code>*.env</code> so you don’t accidentally check in your secrets!</p>

<p>You’ll need to create a new web application in Auth0 and fill in the <code>&lt;...&gt;</code> placeholders before this works.</p>

 Create an OpenID Connect App on Auth0 

<p>Log in to your Auth0 account (or <a href="https://auth0.com/signup">sign up</a> if you don’t have an account). You should have a unique domain like <code>dev-xxx.eu.auth0.com</code>.</p>

<p>Press the Create Application button in <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications">Applications section</a>. Use a name like <code>JHipster Baby!</code>, select <code>Regular Web Applications</code>, and click Create.</p>

<p>Switch to the Settings tab and configure your application settings:</p>

 
   Allowed Callback URLs: <code>http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
   Allowed Logout URLs: <code>http://localhost:8080/</code> 
 

<p>Scroll to the bottom and click Save Changes.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/roles">roles</a> section, create new roles named <code>ROLE_ADMIN</code> and <code>ROLE_USER</code>.</p>

<p>Create a new user account in the <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/#/users">users</a> section. Click on the Role tab to assign the roles you just created to the new account.</p>

<p>Make sure your new user’s email is verified before attempting to log in!</p>

<p>Next, head to Auth Pipeline &gt; Rules &gt; Create. Select the <code>Empty rule</code> template. Provide a meaningful name like <code>Group claims</code> and replace the Script content with the following.</p>

   <code>function(user, context, callback) {
  user.preferred_username = user.email;
  const roles = (context.authorization || {}).roles;

  function prepareCustomClaimKey(claim) {
    return `https://www.jhipster.tech/${claim}`;
  }

  const rolesClaim = prepareCustomClaimKey('roles');

  if (context.idToken) {
    context.idToken[rolesClaim] = roles;
  }

  if (context.accessToken) {
    context.accessToken[rolesClaim] = roles;
  }

  callback(null, user, context);
}
</code>   

<p>This code is adding the user’s roles to a custom claim (prefixed with <code>https://www.jhipster.tech/roles</code>). This claim is mapped to Spring Security authorities in <code>SecurityUtils.java</code>.</p>

   <code>public static List&lt;GrantedAuthority&gt; extractAuthorityFromClaims(Map&lt;String, Object&gt; claims) {
    return mapRolesToGrantedAuthorities(getRolesFromClaims(claims));
}

@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
private static Collection&lt;String&gt; getRolesFromClaims(Map&lt;String, Object&gt; claims) {
    return (Collection&lt;String&gt;) claims.getOrDefault(
        "groups",
        claims.getOrDefault("roles", claims.getOrDefault(CLAIMS_NAMESPACE + "roles", new ArrayList&lt;&gt;()))
    );
}

private static List&lt;GrantedAuthority&gt; mapRolesToGrantedAuthorities(Collection&lt;String&gt; roles) {
    return roles.stream().filter(role -&gt; role.startsWith("ROLE_")).map(SimpleGrantedAuthority::new).collect(Collectors.toList());
}
</code>   

<p>The <code>SecurityConfiguration.java</code> class has a bean that calls this method to configure a user’s roles from their OIDC data.</p>

   <code>@Bean
public GrantedAuthoritiesMapper userAuthoritiesMapper() {
    return authorities -&gt; {
        Set&lt;GrantedAuthority&gt; mappedAuthorities = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();

        authorities.forEach(authority -&gt; {
            // Check for OidcUserAuthority because Spring Security 5.2 returns
            // each scope as a GrantedAuthority, which we don't care about.
            if (authority instanceof OidcUserAuthority) {
                OidcUserAuthority oidcUserAuthority = (OidcUserAuthority) authority;
                mappedAuthorities.addAll(SecurityUtils.extractAuthorityFromClaims(oidcUserAuthority.getUserInfo().getClaims()));
            }
        });
        return mappedAuthorities;
    };
}

 Run Your JHipster App with Auth0 

<p>Stop your JHipster app using Ctrl+C, set your Auth0 properties in <code>.auth0.env</code>, and start your app again.</p>

   <code>source .auth0.env
./mvnw
</code>   

<p>Voilà - your full stack app is now using Auth0! Open your favorite browser to <code>http://localhost:8080</code>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You should see your app’s homepage with a link to sign in. Click sign in and you’ll be redirected to Auth0 to log in.</p>

<p></p>

<p>After entering your credentials, you’ll be redirected back to your app.</p>

<p></p>

 Test Your Full Stack Java App with Cypress 

<p>JHipster has Auth0 support built-in, so you can specify your credentials for Cypress tests and automate your UI testing!</p>

<p>To do this, open a new terminal window, specify the credentials for the Auth0 user you just created and run <code>npm run e2e</code>.</p>

   <code>export CYPRESS_E2E_USERNAME=&lt;new-username&gt;
export CYPRESS_E2E_PASSWORD=&lt;new-password&gt;
npm run e2e
</code>   

<p>TIP: If you want to use a <code>.env</code> file for your environment variables, you can use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress-dotenv">cypress-dotenv</a>. You can also put these values in <code>cypress.json</code>, but since this file will be in source control, it’s a bad practice to put your secrets in it.</p>

<p>Everything should pass in around a minute.</p>

<p>Shut down the process running your JHipster app - it’s time to create some data handling for your Flickr clone!</p>

 Create Entities to allow CRUD on Photos 

<p>I’ve talked a lot about how to secure your application, but we haven’t done anything with photos! JHipster has a JDL (JHipster Domain Language) feature that allows you to model the data in your app, and generate entities from it. You can use the <a href="https://start.jhipster.tech/jdl-studio/">JDL Studio</a> to do this online and save it locally once you’ve finished.</p>

<p>My data model for this app has <code>Album</code>, <code>Photo</code>, and <code>Tag</code> entities and sets up relationships between them. Below is a screenshot of what it looks like in JDL Studio.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Copy the JDL below and save it in a <code>flickr2.jdl</code> file in the root directory of your project.</p>

   <code>entity Album {
  title String required
  description TextBlob
  created Instant
}

entity Photo {
  title String required
  description TextBlob
  image ImageBlob required
  height Integer
  width Integer
  taken Instant
  uploaded Instant
}

entity Tag {
  name String required minlength(2)
}

relationship ManyToOne {
  Album{user(login)} to User
  Photo{album(title)} to Album
}

relationship ManyToMany {
  Photo{tag(name)} to Tag{photo}
}

paginate Album with pagination
paginate Photo, Tag with infinite-scroll
</code>   

<p>You can generate entities and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete">CRUD</a> code (Java for Spring Boot; TypeScript and JSX for React) by using the following command:</p>

   <code>jhipster jdl flickr2.jdl
</code>   

<p>When prompted, type <code>a</code> to allow overwriting of existing files.</p>

<p>This process will create Liquibase changelog files (to create your database tables), entities, repositories, Spring MVC controllers, and all the React code necessary to create, read, update, and delete your entities. It’ll even generate JUnit unit tests, Jest unit tests, and Cypress end-to-end tests!</p>

<p>After the process completes, you can restart your app, log in, and browse through the Entities menu. Try adding some data to confirm everything works.</p>

<p>By now, you can see that JHipster is pretty powerful. It recognized that you had an image property of <code>ImageBlob</code> type and created the logic necessary to upload and store images in your database! Booyah!</p>

 Add Image EXIF Processing in Your Spring Boot API 

<p>The <code>Photo</code> entity has a few properties that can be calculated by reading the uploaded photo’s <a href="https://yourphotoadvisor.com/understanding-exif-data-what-it-is-and-what-to-do-with-it/">EXIF</a> (Exchangeable Image File Format) data. You might ask, how do you do that in Java?</p>

<p>Thankfully, Drew Noakes created a <a href="https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor">metadata-extractor</a> library to do just that. Add a dependency on Drew’s library to your <code>pom.xml</code>:</p>

   <code>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.drewnoakes&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;metadata-extractor&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;2.16.0&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code>   

<p>Then modify the <code>PhotoResource#createPhoto()</code> method to set the metadata when an image is uploaded.</p>

   <code>import com.drew.imaging.ImageMetadataReader;
import com.drew.imaging.ImageProcessingException;
import com.drew.metadata.Metadata;

import java.io.BufferedInputStream;
import java.io.ByteArrayInputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;

import java.time.Instant;
import java.util.Date;

public class PhotoResource {
    ...

    public ResponseEntity&lt;Photo&gt; createPhoto(@Valid @RequestBody Photo photo) throws Exception {
        log.debug("REST request to save Photo : {}", photo);
        if (photo.getId() != null) {
            throw new BadRequestAlertException("A new photo cannot already have an ID", ENTITY_NAME, "idexists");
        }

        try {
            photo = setMetadata(photo);
        } catch (ImageProcessingException ipe) {
            log.error(ipe.getMessage());
        }

        Photo result = photoRepository.save(photo);
        return ResponseEntity
            .created(new URI("/api/photos/" + result.getId()))
            .headers(HeaderUtil.createEntityCreationAlert(applicationName, true, ENTITY_NAME, result.getId().toString()))
            .body(result);
    }

    private Photo setMetadata(Photo photo) throws ImageProcessingException, IOException, MetadataException {
        String str = DatatypeConverter.printBase64Binary(photo.getImage());
        byte[] data2 = DatatypeConverter.parseBase64Binary(str);
        InputStream inputStream = new ByteArrayInputStream(data2);
        BufferedInputStream bis = new BufferedInputStream(inputStream);
        Metadata metadata = ImageMetadataReader.readMetadata(bis);
        ExifSubIFDDirectory directory = metadata.getFirstDirectoryOfType(ExifSubIFDDirectory.class);

        if (directory != null) {
            Date date = directory.getDateDigitized();
            if (date != null) {
                photo.setTaken(date.toInstant());
            }
        }

        if (photo.getTaken() == null) {
            log.debug("Photo EXIF date digitized not available, setting taken on date to now...");
            photo.setTaken(Instant.now());
        }

        photo.setUploaded(Instant.now());

        JpegDirectory jpgDirectory = metadata.getFirstDirectoryOfType(JpegDirectory.class);
        if (jpgDirectory != null) {
            photo.setHeight(jpgDirectory.getImageHeight());
            photo.setWidth(jpgDirectory.getImageWidth());
        }

        return photo;
    }
    ...
}
</code>   

<p>Since you’re extracting the information, you can remove the fields from the UI and tests so the user cannot set these values.</p>

<p>In <code>src/main/webapp/app/entities/photo/photo-update.tsx</code>, hide the metadata so users can’t edit it. Rather than displaying the <code>height</code>, <code>width</code>, <code>taken</code>, and <code>uploaded</code> values, hide them. You can do this by searching for <code>photo-height</code>, grabbing the elements (and its following three elements) and adding them to a <code>metadata</code> constant just after <code>defaultValues()</code> lambda function.</p>

   <code>const defaultValues = () =&gt;
  ...

const metadata = (
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;ValidatedField label={translate('flickr2App.photo.height')} id="photo-height" name="height" data-cy="height" type="text" /&gt;
    &lt;ValidatedField label={translate('flickr2App.photo.width')} id="photo-width" name="width" data-cy="width" type="text" /&gt;
    &lt;ValidatedField
      label={translate('flickr2App.photo.taken')}
      id="photo-taken"
      name="taken"
      data-cy="taken"
      type="datetime-local"
      placeholder="YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm"
    /&gt;
    &lt;ValidatedField
      label={translate('flickr2App.photo.uploaded')}
      id="photo-uploaded"
      name="uploaded"
      data-cy="uploaded"
      type="datetime-local"
      placeholder="YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm"
    /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
);
const metadataRows = isNew ? '' : metadata;

return ( ... );
</code>   

<p>Then, in the <code>return</code> block, remove the JSX between the <code>image</code> property and <code>album</code> property and replace it with <code>{metadataRows}</code>.</p>

   <code>&lt;ValidatedBlobField
  label={translate('flickr2App.photo.image')}
  id="photo-image"
  name="image"
  data-cy="image"
  isImage
  accept="image/*"
  validate={{
    required: { value: true, message: translate('entity.validation.required') },
  }}
/&gt;
{metadataRows}
&lt;ValidatedField id="photo-album" name="albumId" data-cy="album" label={translate('flickr2App.photo.album')} type="select"&gt;
  &lt;option value="" key="0" /&gt;
  {albums
    ? albums.map(otherEntity =&gt; (
      &lt;option value={otherEntity.id} key={otherEntity.id}&gt;
        {otherEntity.title}
      &lt;/option&gt;
    ))
    : null}
&lt;/ValidatedField&gt;
</code>   

<p>In <code>src/test/javascript/cypress/integration/entity/photo.spec.ts</code>, remove the code that sets the data in these fields:</p>

   <code>cy.get(`[data-cy="height"]`).type('99459').should('have.value', '99459');
cy.get(`[data-cy="width"]`).type('61514').should('have.value', '61514');
cy.get(`[data-cy="taken"]`).type('2021-10-11T16:46').should('have.value', '2021-10-11T16:46');
cy.get(`[data-cy="uploaded"]`).type('2021-10-11T15:23').should('have.value', '2021-10-11T15:23'););
</code>   

<p>Stop your Maven process, run <code>source .auth0.env</code>, then <code>./mvwn</code> again. Open a new terminal window, set your Auth0 credentials, and run <code>npm run e2e</code> to make sure everything still works.</p>

   <code>export CYPRESS_E2E_USERNAME=&lt;auth0-username&gt;
export CYPRESS_E2E_PASSWORD=&lt;auth0-password&gt;
npm run e2e
</code>   

<p>NOTE: If you experience authentication errors in your Cypress tests, it’s likely because you’ve violated Auth0’s <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/support/policies/rate-limit-policy">Rate Limit Policy</a>. As a workaround, I recommend you use Keycloak for Cypress tests. You can do this by opening a new terminal window and starting your app there using <code>./mvnw</code>. Then, open a second terminal window and run <code>npm run e2e</code>.</p>

<p>If you upload an image you took with your smartphone, the height, width, and taken values should all be populated. If they’re not, chances are your image doesn’t have the data in it.</p>

 Add a React Photo Gallery 

<p>You’ve added metadata extraction to your backend, but your photos still display in a list rather than in a grid (like Flickr). To fix that, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/neptunian/react-photo-gallery">React Photo Gallery</a> component. Install it using npm:</p>

   <code>npm i react-photo-gallery@8
</code>   

<p>In <code>src/main/webapp/app/entities/photo/photo.tsx</code>, add an import for <code>Gallery</code>:</p>

   <code>import Gallery from 'react-photo-gallery';
</code>   

<p>Then add the following just after <code>const { match } = props;</code>. This adds the photos to a set with source, height, and width information.</p>

   <code>const photoSet = photoList.map(photo =&gt; ({
  src: `data:${photo.imageContentType};base64,${photo.image}`,
  width: photo.height &gt; photo.width ? 3 : photo.height === photo.width ? 1 : 4,
  height: photo.height &gt; photo.width ? 4 : photo.height === photo.width ? 1 : 3
}));
</code>   

<p>Next, add a <code>&lt;Gallery&gt;</code> component right after the closing <code>&lt;/h2&gt;</code>.</p>

   <code>return (
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h2 id="photo-heading" data-cy="PhotoHeading"&gt;
      ...
    &lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;Gallery photos={photoSet} /&gt;
    ...
);
</code>   

<p>Save all your changes and restart your app.</p>

   <code>source .auth0.env
./mvnw
</code>   

<p>Log in and navigate to Entities &gt; Photo in the top nav bar. You will see a plethora of photos loaded by <a href="https://www.liquibase.org/">Liquibase</a> and <a href="https://marak.github.io/faker.js/">faker.js</a>. To make a clean screenshot without this data, I modified <code>src/main/resources/config/application-dev.yml</code> to remove the “faker” context for Liquibase.</p>

   <code>liquibase:
  # Append ', faker' to the line below if you want sample data to be loaded automatically
  contexts: dev
</code>   

<p>Stop your Spring Boot backend and run <code>rm -r target/h2db</code> to clear out your database (or just delete the <code>target/h2db</code> directory). Restart your backend.</p>

<p>Now you should be able to upload photos and see the results in a nice grid at the top of the list.</p>

<p></p>

<p>You can also add a “lightbox” feature to the grid so you can click on photos and zoom in. The <a href="https://neptunian.github.io/react-photo-gallery/">React Photo Gallery docs</a> shows how to do this. I’ve integrated it into the example for this post, but I won’t show the code here for the sake of brevity. You can see the <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example/blob/main/src/main/webapp/app/entities/photo/photo.tsx">final <code>photo.tsx</code> with Lightbox added on GitHub</a> or a <a href="https://github.com/oktadev/auth0-full-stack-java-example/commit/76dcf711816cb2f3455ba4b46264bf48002487f7">diff of the necessary changes</a>.</p>

 Make Your Full Stack Java App Into a PWA 

<p>Progressive Web Apps, aka PWAs, are the best way for developers to make their webapps load faster and more performant. In a nutshell, PWAs are websites that use recent web standards to allow for installation on a user’s computer or device, and deliver an app-like experience to those users. To make a web app into a PWA:</p>

 
   Your app must be served over HTTPS 
   Your app must register a service worker so it can cache requests and work offline 
   Your app must have a webapp manifest with installation information and icons 
 

<p>For HTTPS, you can <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/certificates-for-localhost/">set up a certificate for localhost</a> or (even better), deploy it to production! Cloud providers like Heroku will provide you with HTTPS out-of-the-box, but they won’t force HTTPS. To force HTTPS, open <code>src/main/java/com/auth0/flickr2/config/SecurityConfiguration.java</code> and add a rule to force a secure channel when an <code>X-Forwarded-Proto</code> header is sent.</p>

   <code>@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        ...
    .and()
        .frameOptions()
        .deny()
    .and()
        .requiresChannel()
        .requestMatchers(r -&gt; r.getHeader("X-Forwarded-Proto") != null)
        .requiresSecure()
    .and()
        .authorizeRequests()
        ...
}
</code>   

<p>The <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin">workbox-webpack-plugin</a> is configured already for generating a service worker, but it only works when running your app with a production profile. This is nice because it means your data isn’t cached in the browser when you’re developing.</p>

<p>To register a service worker, open <code>src/main/webapp/index.html</code> and uncomment the following block of code.</p>

   <code>&lt;script&gt;
  if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
    window.addEventListener('load', function () {
      navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js').then(function () {
        console.log('Service Worker Registered');
      });
    });
  }
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>   

<p>The final feature — a webapp manifest — is included at <code>src/main/webapp/manifest.webapp</code>. It defines an app name, colors, and icons. You might want to adjust these to fit your app.</p>

 Deploy Your React + Spring Boot App to Heroku 

<p>To deploy your app to Heroku, you’ll first need to install the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli">Heroku CLI</a>. You can confirm it’s installed by running <code>heroku --version</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you don’t have a Heroku account, go to <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">heroku.com</a> and sign up. Don’t worry, it’s free, and chances are you’ll love the experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Run <code>heroku login</code> to log in to your account, then start the deployment process with JHipster:</p>

   <code>jhipster heroku
</code>   

<p>This will start the <a href="https://www.jhipster.tech/heroku/">Heroku sub-generator</a> that asks you a couple of questions about your app: what you want to name it and whether you want to deploy it to a US region or EU. Then it’ll prompt you to choose between building locally or with Git on Heroku’s servers. Choose Git, so you don’t have to upload a fat JAR. When prompted to use Okta for OIDC, select <code>No</code>. Then, the deployment process will begin.</p>

<p>You’ll be prompted to overwrite <code>pom.xml</code>. Type <code>a</code> to allow overwriting all files.</p>

<p>If you have a stable and fast internet connection, your app should be live on the internet in around six minutes!</p>

   <code>remote: -----&gt; Compressing...
remote:        Done: 120.9M
remote: -----&gt; Launching...
remote:        Released v7
remote:        https://flickr-2.herokuapp.com/ deployed to Heroku
remote:
remote: Verifying deploy... done.

To https://git.heroku.com/flickr-2.git
 * [new branch]      HEAD -&gt; main

Your app should now be live. To view it run
	heroku open
And you can view the logs with this command
	heroku logs --tail
After application modification, redeploy it with
	jhipster heroku
Congratulations, JHipster execution is complete!
Sponsored with ❤️ by @oktadev.
Execution time: 6 min. 19 s.
</code>   

 Configure for Auth0 and Analyze Your PWA Score with Lighthouse 

<p>To configure your app to work with Auth0 on Heroku, run the following command to set your Auth0 variables on Heroku.</p>

   <code>heroku config:set \
  SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_PROVIDER_OIDC_ISSUER_URI="https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/" \
  SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_ID="&lt;your-client-id&gt;" \
  SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET="&lt;your-client-secret&gt;" \
  JHIPSTER_SECURITY_OAUTH2_AUDIENCE="https://&lt;your-auth0-domain&gt;/api/v2/"
</code>   

<p>Then, log in to your Auth0 account, navigate to your app, and add your Heroku URLs as valid redirect URIs:</p>

 
   Allowed Callback URLs: <code>https://flickr-2.herokuapp.com/login/oauth2/code/oidc</code> 
   Allowed Logout URLs: <code>https://flickr-2.herokuapp.com</code> 
 

<p>After Heroku restarts your app, open it with <code>heroku open</code>, and log in.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Then, test it with <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/">Lighthouse</a> (using the Lighthouse tab in Chrome developer tools). Looks pretty good, eh?! 💯</p>

<p></p>

<p>It’s pretty darn secure too, at least according to <a href="https://securityheaders.com">securityheaders.com</a>.</p>

<p>Filling holes in the web3 stack</p>
<p>This was a very fun and interesting conversation with Lauren Feld, Head of Growth at <a href="https://3boxlabs.com/">3Box Labs</a>, a company building the <a href="https://ceramic.network/">Ceramic Network</a>.</p>
<p>The Ceramic Network in my opinion is one the most exciting projects in the web3 space. Ceramic is a decentralized, open source platform for creating, hosting, and sharing streams of data.</p>
<p>This is interesting to consider in a decentralized identity context. As we all know, we leave massive traces of ourselves in the digital world. The products that have enabled user generated content in the web2 world have dramatically increased the volume of data we leave behind. If this data is valuable, which social media companies can attest is true, then how could this data be returned to the rightful generator/owner of it. How can it also be made portable across different applications?</p>
<p>On this podcast we often talk about Verifiable Credentials and recently a bit more about government issued digital IDs. I hope this conversation gives listeners some excitement about what’s now being made possible with some exciting bottom-up approaches and how turning the data layer of applications into a public utility is the logical evolution of the web.</p>
<p>About Episode<br>
During this conversation, we discuss:</p>
 
 What excites Lauren about web3 applications? 
 What is the pulse on DAOs to incorporate Decentralized ID into them? 
 The importance of Mutability 
 An overview of Decentralized Data Storage Ecosystems, in particular IPFS, one of first protocols in the web3 space 
 What makes Data Composability important for open data layers? 
 How to go about building Distributed Data Models? 
 Key considerations when Selling to Developers rather than to enterprises 
 How to think about Verifiable Credentials in a context of your online data 
 Some Exciting Use Cases happening using Ceramic (you can find more use cases here: <a href="https://blog.ceramic.network/">https://blog.ceramic.network/)</a> 
 Can older business models use Ceramic to decentralize their data layer?

 This is an ongoing series featuring Ontology’s Harbingers. Harbingers are exceptional leaders that help Ontology grow its community and ecosystem, making it an ever-stronger blockchain, and decentralized identity and data&nbsp;leader. <p>In the 13th interview in this series, Ontology speaks with <a href="https://twitter.com/SGnode_ONT">Geoff Richards</a>, administrator of our <a href="https://t.me/OntologyNetwork">English</a> and <a href="https://t.me/WingDAO">Wing DAO</a> communities.</p> 1. How did you hear about Ontology? What drew you to Ontology? <p>I was initially drawn to the staking opportunities provided by Ontology. I was reading about staking and right in front of me was this established project, with a clear vision for the future, and excellent rewards for people backing the&nbsp;vision.</p> 2. Why did you become a supporter of Ontology and a champion of its&nbsp;brand? <p>I never needed to ask, ‘Why Ontology?’. The team has identified a clear need for solutions around data and identity. The current and future requirement for decentralized, trustless solutions to data and identity security is without question. As more projects launch in the Web3 space, this need only becomes greater. So, for me, Ontology is an enabler; a solution that will make other projects better. It’s not about competing in the Web3 space, it’s about making the experience better and more secure for everyone involved.</p> 3. What’s the key role of a Harbinger? What’s your favorite thing about being a Harbinger? <p>I’m a huge fan of the community around Ontology. If you look back at previous Harbinger interviews, all these people have answered my questions, solved my confusions, and generally made me feel welcome in the space. I hope I do the same for&nbsp;others.</p><p>I like to be the first to receive information. And the opportunity to do what I like, which is helping people! Although, I began doing this long before I became Harbinger.</p> 4. Why is being part of the Ontology community important to&nbsp;you? <p>At times, the crypto space can feel a little like the Wild West. There are bad actors and people looking to take advantage of new users. A strong community is our best solution to this&nbsp;problem.</p> 5. How is Ontology’s community different from other blockchain communities, is there anything that makes it stand&nbsp;out? <p>If you hang around the Telegram channel for any amount of time, you’ll see people helping by sharing their own experiences. We have regular calls to discuss the project, as well as the Web3 and blockchain space in general. I honestly don’t know of another community that engages with its members in such a way. If you have a question, a problem, an idea, or a solution, then there is always an opportunity to be&nbsp;heard.</p> 6. What do you use as your key channels for engagement with the Ontology community and why? Would you like to see any&nbsp;others? <p>I mainly hang out in the Telegram rooms; I guess it’s become my natural environment. However, I’ve recently spent more time on Discord, where there are some excellent opportunities to share ideas. We even have dedicated channels to throw your ideas around in. Rather than seeing other channels, I’d really like to see the Discord community grow.</p> 7. Can you share a memorable experience or something you’ve learned from being a Harbinger? What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Harbinger? <p>Being a Harbinger means that you really believe in the aims and goals of the project. If you want to be a Harbinger, the first step is to be a positive force in the community. Understand what Ontology is about and share that understanding.</p> 8. How would you describe the Ontology community in three&nbsp;words? <p>Altruistic, Thoughtful, Passionate.</p> 9. How do you think Ontology could expand its community going forward? What would you like to see more/less of? What kinds of things do you see community members do that you think help our community grow? <p>The answer to all these questions is the same. I’d like to see more opportunities to use ONT ID, and for the community to tell people that they are using&nbsp;it.</p> 10. What do you see as the key milestones for Ontology and how can the community help with achieving these? <p>Ontology has a fantastic vision for the future. The technology is excellent, and the community is supportive. Next is the expansion of dApps on the ecosystem, and people using the opportunities Ontology provides to be creative. With the upcoming EVM launch, this feels more achievable than ever. Once that happens, the community can help by using the things that people build and telling everyone how cool they&nbsp;are.</p><p>To learn more about Ontology’s Harbinger Program and how you can get involved, check out our updated&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/ontologynetwork/learn-what-it-takes-to-become-the-next-ontology-harbinger-8c55c49dc856">GUIDE</a>.</p> Want more Ontology? <p>Learn more about our decentralized data and identity solutions on our <a href="https://ont.io/">website</a> and official <a href="https://twitter.com/OntologyNetwork">Twitter</a> account.

To put this figure into perspective, the music industry was worth just under $62bn in the same year, and the global film industry was an estimated $136bn in 2018.

   Okta Early Access Hackathon revisited 

<p>In August, Okta’s developer relations team invited intrepid developers to participate in <a>the virtual Okta Identity Engine Early Access Hackathon</a>, and challenged them to build a working app with our limited availability new customer identity and access management (CIAM) platform. A month or so after, judges convened, <a>winners were announced</a>, and thousands of dollars in prizes were distributed. Kudos to hundreds of participants, and props to all involved.</p>

<p>In October, we sat down with UK-based developer <a href="https://devpost.com/software/gooseclip">Matthew McKenzie, the creator of GooseClip</a>, our first prize winner.</p>

 

 

 Introducing peer-to-peer GooseClip 

<p><a href="https://gooseclip.com/#/">GooseClip</a> is an authenticated peer-to-peer communication platform, rooted in the Go programming language, and inspired by “a frustration at the lack of interoperability of our modern devices.” As Matt describes it, “GooseClip obscures the complexity of peer-to-peer networking by presenting a simple 2-route API, /attach and /connect.” This becomes the base upon which he builds various example mini-products, which demonstrate the versatility and simplicity of the underlying p2p platform.</p>

<p>Developer advocates <a href="https://twitter.com/quorralyne">Heather Downing</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/briandemers">Brian Demers</a> spoke with Matt about peer-to-peer technology, his vision for GooseClip, and his experience hacking Okta and building auth. Matt shared some insights about building leading edge applications and launching new tech products as an independent developer and technical founder.</p>

 Leading stablecoin commences active testing of the public utility and application stack for solving the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Travel&nbsp;Rule. <p>British Virgin Islands, November 18, 2021, 12:00 PM BST — Tether Operations Limited (“Tether”), the company operating the blockchain-enabled platform<a href="http://tether.to/"> tether.to</a>, that powers the largest stablecoin by market capitalization, announced today that it has commenced operations with <a href="https://shyft.network/">Shyft Network</a> starting with active testing of <a href="https://veriscope.network/">Veriscope</a>, its decentralized compliance framework and smart-contract solution to the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) Travel&nbsp;Rule.</p><p>Veriscope links user consent-permissioning with VASP-to-VASP data transmission and ensures VASPs can determine between honest transactions and data attacks. It was designed to act as a decentralized coordination and discovery system, open for any VASP or intermediary as a public utility for data attestation and routing. The platform provides a decentralized compliance framework and a smart contract platform for VASPs to enable Travel Rule compliance and aims to meet meets the growing demands of the rising regulatory efforts that have commanded attention and action across cryptocurrency, DeFi, NFTs, stablecoins, and many other elements of blockchain technology.</p><p>This integration marks the initial phases of Tethers’ trial of Veriscope which may allow Tether to offer its customers an experience that both promotes privacy while also solving global compliance requirements for all participants across the ecosystem. The goal of this trial is to create an experience for customers that maintains openness and ensures peer-to-peer transaction discovery that is compliant with the new FATF Travel Rule requirement.</p><blockquote>“We built Shyft to ensure that the ethos of digital asset networks was maintained regardless of the regulatory requirements that would come,” said Joseph W. of Shyft Network. “We are excited to see this public system be put to work by the largest players globally, and are proud to see leading stablecoins, like Tether, maintain decentralization while allowing the ecosystem to meet regulations. We see systems like Veriscope, and networks like Shyft, as critical infrastructure layers to the future of decentralized data coordination and transmission.”</blockquote><p>In August of this year, Shyft Network, in collaboration with Tether, Bitfinex and other exchanges, key industry players, and liquidity providers announced the global deployment of Veriscope, a public utility and application stack for solving the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Travel Rule. Just a few days ago, Shyft Core, the development team behind Veriscope, announced the open-source release of the infrastructure to enable developers and other VASPs to freely integrate with the platform, Tether will be one of the first to put this infrastructure to the&nbsp;test.</p><blockquote>“Veriscope’s opensource solution to discovering VASPs and transmitting customer information is an interesting use case that’s in line with the ethos of Bitcoin” said, Leonardo Real, CCO of Tether. We look forward to continuing to lead the&nbsp;charge”.</blockquote><p>To learn more about Tether, please visit,<a href="https://tether.to/"> https://tether.to/</a>.</p><p>About Shyft&nbsp;Network</p><p>The Shyft Network aggregates and embeds trust into data stored on public and private ecosystems, allowing an opt-in compliance layer across all systems. The key pillar for Shyft is user consent, allowing users to track the usage of their data. Therefore, no one can use personal data without consent from the owner. Shift Network allows and gives incentives to individuals and enterprises to work together to add context to data, unlocking the ability to build authentic digital reputation, identity, and credibility frameworks.</p><p><a href="https://www.shyft.network/">Website</a> /<a href="https://t.me/shyftnetwork"> Telegram</a> /<a href="https://twitter.com/shyftnetwork"> Twitter</a> /<a href="https://shyftnetwork.medium.com/"> Medium</a> /<a href="https://discord.gg/NJ7bZTCnm6">&nbsp;Discord</a></p><p>About Tether</p><p>Tether is the preeminent stablecoin with the biggest market capitalization, surpassing that of all rival offerings combined.

			 Tony Malghem is Tech Lead at Tokeny Solutions.&nbsp; 

		 
	 

	 
		 
			 Who are you? 
<p>Hello! I am Tony, 29, TechLead for Tokeny. I graduated as a Software Engineer from Université de Technologie de Compiègne in France. After spending some time in Paris and discovering the start-up world, I followed my girlfriend to Luxembourg when she landed a more interesting job in one of the many banks here 🙂</p>
 How did you land at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>I absolutely loved the job I had in Paris in the startup. The pressure, the smaller team, the « family business » kind of feeling. When I moved to Luxembourg, I decided to try something different, but I was missing all of this too much. I lost myself working in banks and it got too much. One of the person I worked with told me about Tokeny, and I was very interested in this new challenge. So I wrote an email to our amazing HR Radka, and the rest is history 🙂&nbsp;</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			 How would you describe working at Tokeny Solutions? 
<p>It’s amazing! I know, you must be thinking to yourself: ”Of course he’s lobbying for his company”, but honestly, it’s one of the best companies I’ve ever worked with. The team is incredible, with people from so many different backgrounds and experiences, with great ideas, a big commitment and a strong team spirit. We all stick together in the ups and the downs, we lose together and we win together. I am proud to be a member of this company.</p>
 What are you most passionate about in life? 
<p>Too many things! I love learning new stuff, so I always end up finding a new passion and throwing myself in it. The latest one is baking! I started writing a few years ago, and created a writing community to make progress. We even self published a compilation of short stories last year 🙂 Anything I can share with my friends and family, really.</p>

		 
	 
 
	 
		 
			<p></p>
 What is your ultimate dream? 
<p>To make this planet a better place to live for my son. I would love to break this cycle of previous generations making the next one’s life more difficult, by fighting climate change for example.</p>
 What would you change in the world if you could? 
<p>It’s pretty cliché, but to make everyone accept their differences so we can all live together without fighting. Difference is a strength, not a curse 🙂</p>

<p>After achieving many major milestones in 2021 including the <a href="https://blog.dock.io/the-dock-token-migration-is-now-complete/">Token migration</a>, the release of <a href="https://blog.dock.io/credenxia-leaps-into-the-future-with-docks-api/">Dock’s API</a>, and launching Ledger Wallet support, the Dock team is proud and excited to make some new additions to the roadmap that will take us into 2022. </p><p>We will continue to strive to build innovative solutions, drive adoption, and engage with our community. Below, you’ll find high-level descriptions of the upcoming milestones.</p><p>Anonymous Credentials (Q4 2021)</p><p>We’re working on launching anonymous credentials and BBS+ Signatures to further protect our users' right to privacy. Currently, if an individual wishes to share an accreditation, they must share the entire credential. Anonymous credentials are an enhancement to privacy meaning individuals can select certain parts of a credential to share as well as prove information contained in the credential without exposing any of the information.</p><p>As an example, a credential holder will be able to prove their educational qualifications without the verifier knowing the date they attended and graduated from university. The credential holder will have complete control over the specifics of what data they wish to share. </p><p>Self-Serve Issuer Console (Q1 2022)</p><p>Dock is working on a Self-Serve Issuer Console which will allow any organization to issue credentials without having to write a single line of code. The console will enable organizations to issue and verify credentials, enabling rapid prototyping and pilots to prove the benefits of verifiable credentials without having to hire developers. </p><p>Digital credentials remove any risk of fraudulent activity; credentials are issued by an educational or training body, and these can be optionally anchored to the Dock blockchain which serves as a timestamp for the credential. By simply signing up with an email address in their internet browser, organizations can design and issue their verifiable credentials to their users via email. </p><p>V2 Dock Mobile App (Q1 2022)</p><p>We understand the trouble and delay verifying a person’s credentials can cause, and the worry for the individual of not having ownership of their credentials. We plan to release an additional feature to our Mobile App in Q1 of 2022 giving users the ability to store and manage digital credentials. Credential holders can take back control of their data as they receive verifiable credentials from issuers and have control over who sees them. </p><p>Dock will embed a verifiable credentials wallet into the existing Dock Mobile App allowing users to receive, store and manage their data. Please note that the first version of this wallet will be published in the app stores in the next couple of weeks.</p><p>Wallet SDK (Q1 2022)</p><p>Many SMEs and large organizations want to offer storage and functionality of digital credentials in their applications but don’t have the resources to make this happen. For organizations that want to offer digital credentials, the holders of these credentials often have to download a third-party app to store and manage their data. This disconnect means the user is working across multiple apps and managing their own data can become troublesome. Dock’s Wallet SDK can significantly improve the user experience by allowing organizations to embed an identity wallet into their own, existing React Native apps and can be deployed rapidly. A credential holder will be in control over their data and who sees it.</p><p>Enabling digital credentials to be stored in a crypto wallet can take months of development, meaning more money and time being spent from the already scarce resources of a developer's time. Dock will provide support for other languages based on market demand in the near future.</p><p>Our team is looking forward to achieving these significant milestones, continuing to grow Dock, and engaging with the community. We will continue to keep everyone updated through our blog and <a href="https://linktr.ee/DockNetwork">social channels</a>, subscribe to our blog below.</p>

Bloom’s VCs become part of a risk assessment algorithm which allows Teller’s protocol to interact with undercollateralized loans.<br></p><blockquote>“This partnership with Teller Finance represents an exciting venture for Bloom, as both companies share a common vision to expand undercollateralized lending within the DeFi arena. &nbsp;We feel that, together, the possibilities are limitless with Teller’s protocol easily integrating with Bloom’s solution.” - Ben DiScipio, Bloom CSO<br></blockquote><p>OnRamp is a key piece of infrastructure for DeFi companies, providing access to reusable VCs that were previously only available to the traditional finance sector. &nbsp;This means that enterprises now have an elegant solution within the undercollateralized market as we assist them with KYC, sanction screening, and other financial verifications. &nbsp;Beyond that, we see a real opportunity to dramatically increase participation in the DeFi space with Teller, as we work together to incorporate alternative signals to determine creditworthiness and enable risk assessment. &nbsp;We share the same passion for decentralized identity and believe that decentralized lending can be executed securely and efficiently. <br></p><blockquote>"We at Teller are thrilled to partner with Bloom to use their secure identity and credit scoring solutions on our decentralized lending platform. Bloom’s cost-efficiency and risk reduction when it comes to identity theft and fraud prevention perfectly aligns with our mission to provide users peace of mind when borrowing and lending." &nbsp;Ryan Berkun, Teller CEO<br></blockquote><p>At the heart of the Teller Protocol are the main contracts, including their ATM contracts. &nbsp;ATM, or Autonomous Teller Machine, is a decentralized money market smart contract that is connected to a Credit Risk Algorithm (CRA), through which users can request loans using personal consumer data that is computed by Teller's open-source CRA. By integrating Bloom’s innovative platform into their process, Teller is emphasizing the importance of enabling secure, reusable VCs while maintaining user privacy. &nbsp;Our hope is that the scope of our partnership will continue to expand and open doors to all of the verifications OnRamp can provide.<br></p><p>We are proud to partner with Teller and are thrilled to share with them all that OnRamp and the BloomID can offer within the DeFi sector. Learn more about <a href="https://onramp.co/">OnRamp</a> and <a href="https://www.teller.finance/">Teller</a> and stay tuned for future integrations as we continue to unlock the full potential of DeFi.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
